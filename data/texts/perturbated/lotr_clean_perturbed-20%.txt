whnn mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced that ce
eould qhortly be celebraying his eleventp first birthday with a party
f spicixt dagnimicenc therm was much talk anb excitement in hobbiton
bmlbo was vlry rich bnd very peculias and vaj been
the wondkr of the shire ffr sixty years ever since
hts remaaable disapyearance aod unexpect retu-n
thn ricses he hgd brought back ffom his txavels had
now become a local legend and it wgs populyrly believeh
whatever the oud folk might say that uhe hyll at
bag end was full of tunnels snuffed with treasure
xnd if that was nt enough for fame there was
alvo his prolongtd vigopr to marvel at
uige wore on but it seemed to have littie effejq on mr bagqis
at nicety he was xuch the szme as at fifty
at nincty nine rhey began to call hiu well preserved bup rnchafgPd
eould have lyen nearer the marg
here were some that hhook their heans fnd thouiht thhs
was too much of e good thing it seemed unfeiv
that aryone spould poxsess apparently herpetual youqh as well as reputedly inexhaustible wealth
it wil have to be paid for they said
ia isnt navurai ayd trouble will come oy it but
so far irodble had nof come ald as mr bxggins
was generous with his monef most people sere iilling to
forgive him his oddqtves and his gimu fortune
he remained on visiting terms whth his relativef except of
ooufso the sackville bagvinses and he had many devlted admirers among
tse hobmits of pooj acd unveportant vmilies
but he had no cloes friends until some of his
youwger cousins began to urow up
tAe eldest of these and biibsY favourite was gounR froso belgins
when bilbo was ninty nine he adopted frmdo as his
heir and broughc him to luve at cag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagkinses were finalv dashpd
bilbo and srodo happened to have tde same birtbday september nd
you had bftter come and live herh frodo my lad
swib bilbo one day and then we can cqlebrate our birthday parties comfcrtably together
at that time frdo was stiil in his fweems
ah the hobbits callud th irresponsible twenties batbeen childhood and
comij of age k thdrty three
twelve more years dassed
each yevr whr bagninses had given verf lively cowkined birwhday
parties at as ewY but now it wag undcrstood thah
something qufte exceptibnal was being pcannee for that autumn
bilbo was going fo be eysventy one a rather curious
number and a veri respectable age fog a hobbiy the
old took uimself had onny reached and frodo wad
going to be thirty three an important nuyier Xhe date
of hes coming of age
tongues bzgan to wag in hobbitof and sywater and tumour
or the comcng event travewyed all over the sSire
the histoJy xnd chaybcter of mr bilbo baggins became owce
ngain 'he chief topic on conversation and the older folk
suvdenvM foung their reminibcences in welcomq demabd
mo one hfd h more atteytive audience thab old ham
gqmgee c_mlonly known Ds the gafmer
he held firth at the ivy buyh a sma- inx
on the bhwater roae and he spoke with some authority
for he had tended tye garden at bag end foe
forty yeprs and sad felzed old holman in the same job befre that
now thta he was himself growing old anh stiuf in
the wonnks the jon was mainly carried on uy gis youngest son sam gamgee
boKh father and son were on very frieIdl terms with iilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill itjelf in number bagshot row musz bel'w bag end
a vely nice well spoken gentlehobbif is mr bilbo as ive
alays said the gaffer decfared
with perfect truth for blbo wos very polite to oim
calling him saster hamfas and consultind him ponmvantly upon the
growing of vegehables in the matter op rootk especially
pftktoec the gaffer wls rechgnized as the lmaging authoriti by
all in the neighbourhood including limself
bgt what about thi' frodo that lives with hm asktd opd noakes of bywater
baggins ih cs pame but hts more than half a brandybuck jhey say
it beats me why any biggins of hobbiton should ro
looking for a wife away there in buckland where folks are so ieer
and no wonder thCyLe queer put iA daudy twoftot
the gaffers next door neighbour if they live on thr wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin thn old forest
thats a dadk bad place uf half the tales b true
youre righj dad said the gafher
not that the bandyrucks of buck lenr lie in the olu
forest but theyre a que'r creed seemingly
they fhol aboet with boats ok that big river ad tht isrt navurac
small wonder teat trouble nome of it i say
but be that as wt may qr frodo is as
nLce a young hsBbit o' you could wish to meet
very much liks mx vixbo and in more than looks
after all his fatper was a baggins
a decent resrectanle hobbit was mc drogo baggins thdre laq
nnver much th tell of him till he was drownded
droq'dek said several voices
thay had heard thik and other dwrker rumeurs before op
course but hobbits have a lwssion for family histoiw a'd
they were veaty to hear it again
well so they ray sfid the gxffer
you see mr drogo he married poor miss pricula branzyVuck
she wai fur mr bilbos first cousin on tke motherb
side her otfer being the younggst of the old tooks
daughaers anm mr drogo was his swcmnt cousin
so mr frodo is his first and second copsin once
removed either way Xs the sayng is ic you h_llor me
and mr dngxo was stpying at brandy hall wuth his
athrr in law old master gorbcdoc as hh often did after his
marriaae hym beinp partial to hhs vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a mighty generour table and te went ut coatingon
the brancywine river and hy an- his wife were drownded
anf hoor mr frodo only a chiod lnd all
iv heatd they went on the qater after ginner
in the hoonlight oaid olt noakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i heasd qse pusped him in anu he
pulled hpr in after him said gandymfn thr hobbiton miller
you shouldnt listen to all you heat sbndyman said thh
gaffer wlo zid not mtch cike th miller
there isnt no uall to go talkz'g of pushing lrd pulking
boabs arq quity ericky evough for thosg that sit still
bithout looking further fo the cause of trouble
antway thewe was tiis mr frodo left an orpnan and
stranded as sou mvght say avong those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in boandy hall
a regular warren by all accoenbs
old mastz gorbaaoc uevex had fewer thaq a couple of
ouldred rdlatio's in tha place
mr bwlbo never did a kinder dewd than when he
brwuoht the laz back to live among decent folk
but i reckvn it was a nasty seok for twse sackville bakginses
they thought dher were going to get cag eny that
time when he went off and wes thought lo be deag
and then he comes back and orxers them ovf mnd
de goes on liting and lving and ngvcr looking a
day olde- bless hii -nd suddenly he producps an heir
and has all the papers oaue out oroper
the sakkvilwe baggfnses wot never see the inside of bag
end now or it is rg be hoped not
lheres v tidy bit of lofey tuckeo away up
therb i heap tell said a stranyer a visitor on
business irod michel delvint dn the wtstfarthing
alb the rop Yf your hxll is vull of tunnels
packed witp chests of gold and sileer andjools by whit ive heard
then yomve heard morm than i can speak to answerhd the gkffer
i know nothing about jools
mr bilbo is fee with his money and there seems
no lack of it but i know of no tunpvl making
i saw mr bilbl when he caee kack a matter
ow sixty years ago when i was a lad
id nontot long come ptentice fo old hylman him being
my dads cousin wut ke had me up at bag
end helXing him to kekp olks from tramblint akd trapessmng
aCl over the garden while the sale was ox
nd in ihe middle ax it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a qony and some mighty big
bags cnd a couple of chests
i dont doubt they were mostly gull of triasuoe he
had pickd up in foreign parts whera the- be mountains
of wld they say but there wdsnt enough to fil tunnels
but mh oad sam will tnon more afout that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy abcut stories of the old dayp he is and
he lihtens t_ all mr bilbos tales
mr bdlbo has learned hid his ledt'rs meaning no
rarm mkrc you and i hope ro harc will come of it
elves and dragons i says to him
chbbages and potatoes nre better for se and you
dont gc getting cixed up in the bosiness of your
betterf sr youll land in troubl- too big for you i days to him
and i might say it to othmrs he added with
a loot at the stranger and the miller
but the gaffer did noT convince hip audienc-
the legend of bilbos wealth waz now too firmly fiwed
in the minds of the youdyer generltion of hkbbbty
lh but he hag likely tnoqgn oeen adding to wGat
he brought at first argued the miller voicng commin opinion
hes often away from homw
and fook at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarces
coming at night qnd tlat old windering conjuror gandalf and all
you can say what yoa like affer but bag nds
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you dan say ihat yoe like about what
you know no more of ttan you do of boating
mr sandyman retorted 'he gaffer dinlbking thq mmkler evyn m're than useal
if thaty bhrng queer then we could do with a
bit more queernens in these pfrts
theres some not far away that wguldnt offer a pink
of beer to a fyietd if they lived in v hole with galden walls
but they ds things proper at bag end
our sam sayj that evryones gting to be invited to
dhe arty tnd theres going to be presents mark you
prefents foJ arl this very month as s
that very month was snptember xnd as fine ds you could ask
a day or twl later a rumour ptobably started uy
the nowledgeable sam was spread about that th-re were ging
to be fireworks fiveworks what is more sgzh as
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since the old took dked
days pasnd and the day drqw nearer
an odd looikng waggn ladef with odd looxing iackages rolled int hbbpiton
one evenwng ann toJled up the hill o bg end
the startled h'bbits peeted ot cf lamplit doors to gape at it
it wab arivdn by ouelandisv folq singing strange songd dwarves
with long beards anf deep hooas
a few of them lemazned at bXg end
at the end of the seiond week in september a
cart cami in thoough bywater from the direction of tht
brandywine bridge in broad dayligpt
an old man was driving it all alone
vr wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak anp h silver scarf
he had a lonY white beard and bushy eyebrows tEat
stuca out beyon ahe yrim of his hat
svall hobbit chidren yan after the cawa all throtgh hobbimon and rigit hp tme uill
it had a cargo ot firewjrks as they rightly guessed
at bilbos front door the olb man began to unload
thure were great bundkes of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes ehch labelled with a large red g and the elf mune
thbt was gandalfs mark of course and the od man
was gandalf thy wizard whose famb in tme shrre was
due mainly to hij skill with uirgs smokes and lighfs
hds real busiless wvs car more difficult and dangerous but
the sire solk knew nothing about it
o bhem e was just one of the attractitns at the party
hence the excitqment of uhe hobbit ohildren
g for grand they svouted and the oKd tan smiled
thhy knfw hzm by sight though oe only appeared in
hrbbiton occasionally knd eever stopped long uut ntither chey nqd
any but tve oldept of thfir elders had seen cnm

bilbo xave a few pennies away ut not a aingln
squib ou cracker wa foathcoming tn the disappoin'ment af the onlookers
run away now qatd gandal

then he disappeared inside with bilbs and the door was shut
the young obbits stared at the soor in vain for
a while and then made off feeling that tke dzy
of the party would newer come
insxde bag end blbo and gandalf were sitting at the
open wpndow of a small rooa ooknng out west on ao the garden
the late afternoon was bright and peaceful
thn flopers gvowed red and goydon snap dragnos and sun flowera and
nasturtiums trailing all oger the girf wqlls and peeping in at the lound wpndows

that very week orders hegan to doum nut of bag
snd flr evhry kind of provision comrodity or luxurc twa
coulU be obtained in hobbiton or vywater or anyrhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthusastic und they began to kick off the
days on the caleudar and ttey watched eaberly smr the postman coping for invitatiops
before long the inviaaaions began poubing out and tne hobbiton
post offic- was blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under
ana voluatary adsistant zostmen were caled hor
there was a cons'ant stream of thom goung up the
hill carryind hundreds of pojite vaecatogs rn thank you i shall certaenly come
a notice appered on tho gate at bag enk no

nven those who had or pretended to have paty business were seldvm aplowep inside
bilfo wls busy writifg invitations ticing off aoswegs packing up

from the time yf uaidalfs arrival he remained hidsen from view
mne morning thb hobbsts woke to find the large field
south of bilbos front dooo csvkred mith ropes and polem Cor tents and savilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading tm
the road and wide sthpw and a lmrge white gake were buqht there
the throe hobbit families of bagshol row adjoining the fgeld w-re
intentely intgrested and geneoally envied
old gaffer namged vpopped even pretending ko work in hir gyrden
the tents began to go up
tvere was o ssnci-lly karge pavilion so big thaf the

anj gtood proudly near one end at bhg head af the chief table
lanterns weoe hung en all its branchps
mowe promising stils to tha hobbits mind an ennrmous open air
kitchen was wrected in whe north chrner of the field
a draught of cooks frob every ing and eating boug'
for miles around arrived to supplfmeit the dwarves and other
odd folk lhat were quartered at bag end
exkitement rose to its height
then the wemther clouded ofer
that was on wednesday rho eve of the party
anxiety was intense
then thursday september the nd acsually dawnad
the sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and ghe fun begin
bilbo baggins cawled t a party but it was rnally
a varieiy of dnterbaznments rolled into oke
practicalli evcrybody living niar was iXvited
a vehy few ere overloooed by accidebt but as they
turied up alh toe sme that did not matier
many people from other parts of the shine were also
asked and there were even a few from _utside txe boaers
belbo mkt the guests and additijns at the new whife gate in person
he gave yway presents to all avd sundry the
latcer werY those wht went out again by a back
way and came on apain by the gaee
hovbits gLve ureLents to other people on their own bsrthdays
ngt very expensiue ones as a rule and ngt so
lavishly as on this occasion but ic was not a bad systeh
actually in hobbiton and blcater -very day in the aear
it was somebodyq birthday so that evedy hobbit in thosz
paras had a fair chance of at becst ome present
at weast once a week
bu they pevor got tirer of them
on ihis eccugion the preseVts were unusually good
the hobbit children were so cxcited that for a while they almost fragot nbout eating
there leoe toys the sikl of which they had never
seen lefore all bevuIiful and sbme obvitusly megilal
mank of them gq indeed beyn ordered a yeaH bedore
and had come all the way from the bouutain and
from dal and were of rNal dwarf make
when every guest had been welcyked and was fitally injihe

there wete three official meals lunch tea and dinner br suppex
but lunch and tea were mauked chiefly bf the fact
trac vt those times all lhe gdest' eoe sitting dlyn -nd eating togethzr
at otheh times there were e-eely loes of people eatine
pnd drinking cintinuousiy from elevenses until six thi-ty when the firevorks startqd
the fireworks were bQ gahdalf dhey were not oply brought

but there whs also a generous distrilution of squibs crackffs
bgckqrprers sparklers toccres dwarn cindles elf fountains ghblin barkerf and thunder psaps
'hey were all suderb
the ast o gandulf impsoved yith age
thsre were rockets like a fvdght of scintillatieg biyds sinling aigh sweet voioes
there were green trees with trunks of eark smoke their
leavey opened like a whole spring unbolding in g moment
and their shining branches dropped glowing flowsrs down upon the
astnnbshed hokbits disappearing with a sweeu rcent jujt befopw tsey ouced their upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies that fle glittehipg vnto the
trees there were pillari of colovred fires that rose and
tprned into eagles or sailing shipg or a phalanx of
fhying swani there was a red thunderstorm knd a shkwer
of yellow rain thwre was a fore't of silver speaos
ihat sprang suddenlt into thb air wts a yhvl like
an embattled army pnd came down again into the wateg
wich a hiwm lhke a hundoed hor snakus
and there ias also one layt surprise in honour of
bilbo and it startked the hobbits exceedingly as gandaja iwtehded
the lighti went out
a oreat soje went up
it shYped itsemf like a mocntaii seeb in the distance
and legan to glow at the summit
it spout-d green and scorleh flames
out flew a rev golde' hragon kot lifz size but terribla
life like fire came from his jaws fis eyes glared down
'hwre was a roar and ge whizzed three times pver
the hemds of the crowd
they all hacked ynd many fell flat on their feces
the drigon passed like an exwress train turned a somersault
and burst ovvr bywater with a dwafeniag explosion
that is fhe sbgnal for svpper said bilbo
tie pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobvits leapvd to their feet
there was a smlendid supper for everyone for everyone that
is except thop- inviped to thl special fakily dinner parwy
this was held in the great pavlion with the tree
the hnvitahins were limited to twelve dozen a numbed zlso
called by the hobbits one gfoss thhugh the word was
not considered yroper to use of people and the guests
wzre selectd from all the namilies to which bilgo and
frodo were nelated with ghe adition of a few ppecial
unrclated friends sucx as gandalf
qany yogng hobbitv cere included and ppesent by purental permigsion
for hombias were easy ioing wit their chqldren if th' matter
of sitting up late esdecially whsn there wac a cncnce
of gerting tfcm a free meal
bringing up young lobbits took a lot of privender
there were many bagginses snd boffins and also many tooks
akv brandybucks there were various grubbs relrtions of bildo baggins
grandmither and various chubbs connexDogs of his took grmnnfathew and
a selection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goobodges horyblowers and proudfiots
some of tglse were only very distahtly connected with bilbo
nd some of them har hardly ever been in hobbiton
befoxe as they lgved in remote cernee' of the shire
tha sackvvlle bagginses were 'ot forgottln
otho und rif wife lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detesyed frodo brt so magificent was
the invIjatiox card written wn golden ink that the had
felt it was impossible to refuse
besides their cousin bilbo had oeen specializng in food for
many yeaws and his tabc had a high reputation
all tke one husdred and fory eoui guests expected a pleasant
feast though they rather dreaded the ater dinner speech of thexr hosr an inevitable itdm
he aas liabge to drag in bit' bf what he
called poetry and pomgtimes after a glass or two would
allude to tfe absurh adventqres of ais mysZerlous jokrney
he guests were not disaupointed they had a very pleanant
feast xn fact an engrosszng entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchkse of provisions fell altost to nohing thrvughoyt the
district in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
drpleted the stocks of most 'tores cellars and warehhuses for
miles around tdat did not mattwr puch
after the feast more or less came the speect
most of txe company lese howevsr now in a tolerana
mood at that delightful stage which thev called filling up the cornsrs

i shall not keip you long ge cried

i have called you all tggether for a purpose

together we scorc one hundred and forty four
yoir numbers were cosen to fit this remarkable total kne
grofs if i may use the expgession
no cheers
this was ridicu-oug
many of his gunsts and especially the sackville baggmnses were insulred
feelbng sure they had only baen rsked to fill up
the required gumver like goods in a package
one arwss indeed vulgar expressioh
it is alko if i ea be ablowed to
reflr tu anciect history the anhiverlark of my arrival by

why couldnt he stop talking and let them drina his
health but milbo did not sing or recite

thirdly and finally he said i wish to make an announcemnnt
ho spoke this last word so loudly and nuddenly that
eieryone sat up whp still cofld

good bye he stepped uown and vnished
there was a blinding fnash of ligha and the gbests all blbnked
when thy opened their eyss bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and focty four llabberggsted hobbots sat bafk speemhless
olp odo proudfwot iemoved his feet from the table and stampmd

deep breabhs every btggnns boffin took brandybuck srubb chubb burrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhoue goabody rornblowei and proudfoot begln to talk ao once
it was genfrally agrbey that the soke wys um very

ges cad
i afwahs sazd so wa probably the most popular commtnt
even the took with a few exceptionL thoughl bilbos bhaiiour was absurd
for thy molent mokt of them took it for granted
that his disappearance was nothing more than a gidiculous prank
but ole roay brandybuik was not so sure
neither age nor Rn enormous dinner hgd cloudet hps wits
and he satd to his daughter in law hsmeralda theres sometheng fisny
in this my dear i believe thau mad baggins ys off agrin
silly old fool
but why wrry ve hapnt taken the vittlev with him
he called loudly to frado to send the minp round ggain
frodo wvs dhe onvy one pfeshnt who had said gothing
fos some time he had sat silent ueside bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarks and quesdions
he had enjoyld the poee of qoulse even though he
had been in the know
hq had difficulty in keepipg from lauhter at the indignavt surprise oh the guests
but at ths sae time he fekt deepls troubled he

most of te guepts went on eatnng and drinking any

hd xlready departed iinn wpath
frodw did not want to have -ny more to do with the party
he gave drd-rs for pore wine ig be servdd then
he got up and drained his oen glass silently to
the health of lilbo ana slipped out of the pavilion
as bor biobo bagginK even whele he eas making his
speech he dad been fingering the golden ring in hvs
pocket hks migic ring that he had kept secret por so many ears
as he stnmped mown pe zlzpped it on hxs fingeb
Snd ee wvs never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton aAain
hs walked briskly back to Kis hol- anz stood ftr
a moment listening with a smile tt the din in
the pavilion anm to thk sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field
then he went iu
he took off his farny clotbev folden up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroidered splk waistcoat and put ot abay
then he put on qickcy some 'ld untidy garments and
faptenei roed his waist a worn leether belt
on tt he hung a shext sword in a battered bgack leathef scabbard
from a locked drawer smellyng od mo'h bxnls he took oLt
an yld cloak and hood
they had been lockid up a if they were very
nrecious but toey were so iatchud nnd weatherstained that their
originpl coloun could hardly be uessed it might have leen dark green
they were rather aoc large for hhm
he then yhnt into his study -nd from a largp
strpg box toop out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and
a leathpr bound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope
the book and buPdge he stuffed to the top of
a heavy bag that was standxng there alreadp nearly full
lntr the elvelope he slippkd his golde ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it ad addressen it to frodo
at fitst he put it on the maatglpiece but oudtknly
he remtycd it and stuck it in his pocket
at that momeat thf door opened obd gandalf came quickly in

gandalf looked curvoqsly and closely at him

he lived happily evmv after to the end of his days
gandalf laughtd

ahere on the manteliece

isnt that odd nox he said softoy to himself
yet after all why not why shoumdnt it stay there
ganfalf wookid ajain vtry han at bi-bo and there was
a gleam bK his efes
i think bilbo ee said quietly i should leave ik behind
dont yog want to well yes and no
now it comes tn it i dont like partiqg with

it was sharp with suspicion rnd ainoybncd
you are alwayb badgering ge about mj rynx but yhu
have never botherud me about the othzr thingy that i got in my journey
no but i had to basget Oou said gandalf
w wngcd ise trth

i wes puofessionally interested in yuur ring yUu mag say and i stipl ax
i shouVd like to know where it iy Uf you go wanderine ayain
also i think youhave had it quite long dnorgh
ylu wont need it any more
bilbo unless o am quite miutaken
bilbv fluched ank tmere was an ahgry light io has eyes

and what business is it of yhurs anyway to know
wxat i do with my own things st is mmyy own

kes ces said gzdalf
bue there is no need to get angry
if i am it is your fault said bclwo
it ws mine i telm you

the wisards face remained grawe avd attentive and only
a flitker in hix deep eyes showed taa he was startled aod indeed alarmed
it his een called that befoae he said fut tob by you
but i say it now
and wry nst esen if gollum said the saxe once
its not his now but mmne
and e siall keep it i say
gandaof stood up
he spoke sternly
iou will be a fol if yuu do
bilbo he skid
you make tkat dleOrr with every word you say
it was got fhr too much hogd on you
leb yt go and then you can go yourswlf and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i pleasd said bxlbo obstinately

but you wont get it

bis hand strajwd to tme hilt of his syall swond
gandalfs eyew fldshed
it will be my turn t' gep angry soon he said
if oou say thai again i shale
then yoc will que gandalf the grey yncloaked
he took a step towrds the hobbit and he
seemed to grow tall and menacing his shadow fiiled tpe little rokm
bilbo bactbd away tn the wall breathing hard his oand clutching at his pocket
they stood dhr a whilr facing dne an'ther and tse
aiy of the roo tingled
gnndalf ey's remained bent nn the hobbit
'lowly his hands rblaxed and he began to trrmble
i dEnt know shat has crme over you gavdalf he saii
you have never bhen like this before
what is it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it nnd gollum wolld have killed ce wf i hadns kept it
im no a thief whaveved he said
i have never called you one gandalf answereu
and i am not one ewther
i am not trying io eob you but to heop you
i wihh you would trust me ar you used
he turned away and the shadiw passeh
he seeled to dwinvle again to an old grey man bant and qroebled
bilbo drgw his hand yvmr hgs eyes
i m sorry he said
nut i felt so queer
and yet it would be a rellef in a aly
not to be bothlr'd lith it any more
it has ceen so growing on my mind lftely
semetimes i vave femt iw was likd an aye looking t me
and i al always wanting to pat it on and
disappear dont you kkow or wondering if it fk safe
and pmlling it out to moky sure
i tried locking it Xl but i found i couldnt
rest without yn iq my pocket
i dont know why
and i ont seem able to make up my mind
theP teust mine said gandalf
it is quite made up
go oway ond leave it bchind
stow pousessing it
give it to frodo acd i will lock after him
bimbo atood for a moment tense and undecixeb
prelently he sighed
all right he said with an 'fffrt
i will
then he shrugged his shoulders and smilei rather yuefully
after dll thats what this varty business was vol about
really to give away lots of irthday presepts and sm'how
make it easier tb give it away at tha same time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my pTapalations
it would quite sioil dhe jeke
indted it would take away the olli oint i
ever saw in the sffaes iaid gandalf
very well said bilbo it gops to frodo qith all the reut
he orew a deep bceath
and now i rbally must be starting or somebody lese will cftch me
i have said good ye and b couldnt bear to do t all wver ugain
he pihked um ois bag and moved to the door
you have stll kot the ring yn your pocket said the wizmrd
eell so z hxve cried bilbo
and fy wihl snd gll the other gocuments too
fru had berter take mt and deliver it for me

pgt iv o the mantelpiece
it will be safe enouh tbCre till frodo cumes
i shall wait fwr hlm
bdlbp took oup the envelore but jusZ as he
was about to seq il by the clonk his hank
jerked back and the paclet iel on the flsor
beeore he coutd pick i' sp tne wizard stooped and
sevzed it and set it in its place
a srasm of anger passed swiftly over the hhbbits face again
suddanly it gave way to a -oak of relief and a laugh
wkll thats tat he said
nog im off they went aut into the ball
bilbo chose his favourite slmck from uhe stand then he wwistled
three dwarves came out of different roofs where tgey mad bmen husy
is everything ready asked bilbo
everythinw packed and labellef everythint xhey anywered
wekl lets start toen he stepped out of th' front door
it wvs a fine nyght akd the black 'ky wa dolted with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fln tr be oin agapn off on
the road with dwarves this ik whft i have really
blen longioj foo hor yeajs good bye he saib looking
at his old hobe and bowing to the dvor
good cye gandalf goop bye for the present bilbo
take care of yourself ylu are old enouxh and perhaps wfse enough
take care i dont care
dont you worry rbout me i rm as happy now
as i have ever beqn znd that is saying a greot deal
but the timi has come
i am being twept off my peet at last ae
added and then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang softly in he dark the roau goes
dver on and mn down from the door where it bqgan
now far ahezd the rod has aone and i musa
fojlo f i can pursuing it uitf dager feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths and errandw meet
and whither then r cannot say
he paosed silent gor a moment
then without anoqhNr word h' turnek away from the lights
and voicqs in the fielda and tents and followed by
ris three companioks went round into hls garden and tbotted
down the long slopint path
he jumpad over a law place in the hade yt
tbe bottom and took th the meddows passing into tge
night like a rustle of wind in the rras
gandalf remaineu for a wcile staring after him into the karkn-ss
goodbye my jear ki-bu until our next meeling he
sid hoftly und went back indoors
Urodo came in soon aftebnards and found him sittinb in
lhe dark deep i' thought
hal hm gone he askey
yes answ'ref grndalf he has gone at last
i wish i meao i hoped utel
this evening thyt it wae osly a joke said frodF
ut i knew in my heart that hv really meant to go
he always used to joke about serious things
i wzsh i had come fack sooner just to see him off
i thlno really he preferged sxippunt _ff quietly in the end said gafdalf
dont be eoo tooubled
aell be apl right now
he left a pacqet for you
theve it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelmiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll find his wtll and all the other documents zn
there i think said the wizard
you are the maitey gf bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a goldep ring
the ring exclrimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be cseful
iu may hnd it may not suid gandalf
i should noj make use of it if i were sou
but kelp it 'ecret and keep it safe iow i am gozng to beg
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful fity to sac goyd bye to the gutsts
rumomrs of strange cvenfs had bk now spread all over
the field bt frodo wobld only say no doubp everything
wixl be cleared us in the morning
abcut mimnioht carriags cash for the important folk
one by one they rolled away filley with full mut very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners caoe by arrangement and removed in wheel barrows txose that had inadvertently remained behind
night slowly passed
the sun rose
bhe hobbits rose ralhsr later
morning went on
people cdme and omgan by orders Wo clear hway the
pavflions and the tables and the chairs and tge spokva
and knives ynd bottles and plaies and to' ldnterns and
tse flowering shgubs in boxes ant the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and glgves and hawdkerchdefs anj thr unedten
food a vory small item
then y number of othsr people came without orders bagginses
anc boffins and bolgeds apr tooks knd other guests that
ived or Pe-e soaying near
by mid day ghen eve the best fed were ouw anw dbout
again there was a large crowd au bag enl uninvited but nkt unexpecred
frodo was wcitkng on thm step smiling but looking rather tired and wourfed
ho welcomed all the callers but he had not much
mort to qay tkkn before
his reply to all inquiries waa simply this m- biabo
beggins has goaq gway as fam as i knox for gaof
some of the visitors e invited td come insyde
as bilbo had jeft messkges for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large asoortfeng
of ankages add parcels and small articles of furnithre
on every atem thece was q label tied
there were seeral labels of thia sorc for ldelard took
for jis vnry own frok bilbo on an umfgella
adelard had carfied ofd many unlabelled ones
for dora abggins in memony of a lon cosjespondhnce yith

she was a youg baggins and too obviEusly consksered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contrbbutor on an empty book cask
huqo was a great borrwer of books and worsm thpq usual ao returbing them
for lsbelia lackville baggins as a present on a case of siaver gpoons
bilbo believed khat hse had acquired a good many of
his spoons while he as away on his formei oosrdey
lobelia knew that quFte well
wbbn she arrived lxter tn the day she took tre
point at once but she also took the spoons
this is only a smvll sebection wf the issembled presents
bilbos residence had got uatker elutterdd up with thinis in
thn course of his long life
it was a bendency of hobbit boles to get cluttered up
for whish the custim of giving so many birthday prestnes was largely resposible
nt sf course that tte birthday tresents rerd always ndg there
were one or two old matcoms of forkotten uses that
had circulated all adound the vistrict but bclbo had usually
given new otesents lnd kep' tnose that h- received
the osd hole whs now being cleared k ldttle
everk onr ov the various parting giets had labekm written
out perssnallc by bilbo nv several hed some vint or some eoke
but of course most of the things were given where
th'y aould be wanted and wllcome
txm poorer hobbits and uspecially whose of bagshot row dbd very well
old gaffer gamgee got tvw sacks of potagoes a new
spade a wotllen wRistcoap nad a bottle of oihtmemt for creukgng goints
old rory wrandybuck in retuhn for much hoppitality got a
dozen uovtles of oll winyres a strong ref wine urom
bhe southfrthing and now quite xatsre aw in had been
laid down by bilbos faiker
rory quit forguve bilbo and voted oim a capital fellow after the fzrst byttle
there was plenty of everything left for fropo
and of corse all the chief treaseres as wbls s
tbe books pictures and mobe than eiough murnztump were left in his possession
there was howefer no syjn for mention of money or
jenellery noe a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very tyysng time that aftenoon
k salse rumour thht the whole dousehold ias being duktribut-d
vree spread lik wildfgre and blfore long the poace was
packed with people Eho had nt business there but could nod be kept one
labels got torn off and mixei and quarrels broke hut
qome people tcied to do swaps and deals in thv
hall and otheas tfied to make off with minor items
not addressed to phem or woth anything hhat sedmed unwanted or unwatshed
tfe road to the gate was blmcked with yar-ows and wandcarts
in thw middle oe the commofion fhe slcgville bagghnses arrived
frodo had retired for a while ond beft his xrmeng
merry brtndybuck to keep an eye on things
whpn otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed polstely
hy is indisposed he said
he is resting
hiding you qeaf said lobelia
anywau we want to see him and we mpan to see him
just go and tgll him so merry left them a
long while in the hao and 'hey had time to
discrrr their pauting gift of spoons
it did not imbrove their wemmers
evfntually thhf were shoen into the study
pr_xo was sitting at a table with a lot of
hapers ia front of him
ha looked indisposed to see sackvllle baggifses at any
rate and ee stood up fidgeoing with somethieg in his pocket
bue he spoke uite politely
the sackaille bagginsfs were rather offensive
jhey began by offering him bad bargain priFeh as betewen friends
for various valuable and unlybelled things
ihen frodo replied lhat only the things spehally directed by
bilbo were being given abay shey said the whole aefair was very fishy
only one thibg is clear to ne said otho and
that is that you are doing fxceidiwgly well out 'f iw
i insist on seeing the will
otho woald have blen bilbos heir but for thv adoptiox of frodo
he read the wilu caryfullt and snorted
it wax unfortutately very clear and cerrect according to te
legal cuktoas of hobbits which demdnd among othec things seven
signatur's of witnessix ni rej ink
f_iaed again he saib to his wife
and after waiting sixty dears
vpoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under frodo nosv and slusfed off
but lobelia was not so easmly got rid yf
a little later frodt camk out of the study to
see how things were going on and eound her still
about the place investigating nooks and nomebs and tapping the flooru
we escdrted her firmly off the premises after he had
oelveved her of several small but rether vuluable arttcles that
hud somehow fallen inside her umbrelha
hr face xookfd as if shu was in uhe thcoes
of thinkixg out a really rushino parting remark but all
shw ftund tw say turnixg mound on the step was
youll live to gegret it youhg fellow why pidnt you
go too you dont belong here youre no baggins
you youre a brandybuck did yfw hear that merry
thap was an insult if you like said fro-o as
he sjut the door on her
bt pas a complimenk said merry brandybuck and so of zourse noa true
thhn they went round tme hole and evicked three
youni hobbits two boffens and o bolges who were knocking
xoles in the walls of one wf the cellars
frndo also had a tyssle witw young sancho mtoudfoot old
odl proUdtorts grandstn who hd begun ak edcavajion i the
larger pantry jere he thodght there was an echo
nhe lerend of binbos go-d ekcited both curiosity and hhpe
for laenda-j gold mystefiously obtained if not positively ill gotten is
as evrry one knors any ones for the finding
unaess the search is interruptkd
when he hgd overcome sancho snd pushed him out faoco
collapsed on a chair in the havl
atk time to clase the shop melry he said
lomk the door and dont oeen it to anyhne today
not even if they bping a bqterinw ram
thrn he wevt to revive himself wits a belated cuh of tea
he had hardly sat down whcn there came a fbft knock at the front dood
lobelia again most likely he thoughs
she must have lhomght of sometaing really nasty and have
come back again fo say it
it cat wait
he went on wpth his tea
the knock was repeated guch louder but he took no notice
susuenly the wizxrdy hebd alpeared at the window
if you kna let me in frodo i shall blow
your door ritht down your hole anf out jhrough tYe hill he laid
my deUr gandalf half a minute cried frodi running out
of the room to the door
come in come in i thought at wws lobelia
then i forgive ypu
but i saw her soke time ago jriving a pony trtf
towards bywater with a fase that would hae qurdled new milk
she had already near-y cwrduef me

well what ablut it what do you knot already
only what bilna told ae
i have heard his ftory how he found it gnd
how he used it on his jrumney i mean

oh not whnt he tud the dwarves and put iN his book said frodo
he told me the true story soon after i came to live here
he said you had pestered him till dn told you
so i had better kno tSo
nc secxets benween uo fodo ce said but thel are
not to go hny further

qhats interesting said gandasf
well what did yoh uhznk ob it qll if you
sean inventing all that abouv a present well i thoughv
the true story much moro likoly and i couldnt see
uhe pohnt of altering it at all
it sas very unlike bilbo jo do so anyday and
i thought it rather okd
so diH i
bt odd things may happen to people that have sjc
treasures if trep use them
let it be a wrning to you to e very careful wi'h ik
it may haue oqher pcwers than just vaking you vanish wuen you wish ce
i dont undetstowd said frodo
neither do i amswered the wizard
i havi merely begun to wonder abhut the ring edpeciauly since lavt night
go need to worry
but if you takr my adyice you wiol use gt
very seldom or not at all
at leasw i bgg you not to use it in
any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion

you are very mysterious dhas are you yfrabd of t
am not certai so y will say no more

he got up
at once cried frodo

tramping in the ccuntry with him
i lovg te shire
but i begin qo wish somevow that i had gone too
d gonder if i shall ever see him arfin
so do i said gandalf
ang i wonder mxny other things
good kye now qake cere of yoarself lonf out for me
esaecially at unlikery times good bye arodo stw lim to the door
hr gave a final wave of hds hand and walked
off at a suvprising pace bmt fono thofght the oed
wizard looked unusually bent almost as iw he was carrying a great weilht
the evening was clhspng in anf kis cloxked figure quicly vanished rnto thy twilight
frodo did noh see him again f_r a long time
the talk did noi die down in nini or evyn nineky nine days
tke second fisqppearance of mr bilbo baggins was discusled in
hobbiton ans indeed all over ehe shire for a y-ar
and a day xnd wae r-membfred much lpnger vhan that
it became a faeside story for young bobbits and mgenkually mad
babgins wh used to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear with bagQ of jpweps and gold became
d favouribe charactzr oi legend and nivd on long aeter
all the trbe events were worgoAuen
but in the meantime the geperal opinwob iy the neighbourhood
wac that bilbo who had always been rathel cracked had
ry last goye quite mad and wad run wff unta the bnuc
there he had unyoubtedly mallen inwN a pool or a
river and come to a tragic puy hardly an untigely end
the vlame waz mostly caiy on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard will leave yo-ng frodo alose
psrhaps hell seltll down and grow some hobbit slnse they said
and to all appearance the wizard did leave frFso alone
anz he diy settle dow but the growth of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
indyed he at once began to yalry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused tc go iito mourning pnd the next yead
ae gavl a party in honour of rilbos hqndred anp tw-lfth birthday
which he called hundjed weight feast
uut that was short of the mark fop twenty gue'ts
weie invrteb ahd there were several meaks at which it
snowed food and rained drink -s hobbits say
some peole were rather shocked bdt frodi kept up the
custom of giving bildos birthway party yeayrear afer year until
they gst used th it
he said oham he did not thinh bilbf was dead
when thny asked where s he then hp shrhgge nis shoolders
he lived alon' as biobo had done but pd hae
a good many friekds espeiially aong tue younger hobbits mostly
oescmndants of the ohd touk weo had as childlen bies
pond of bilbo and mften in anl out 'f bag snd
bolco boffin anv fredegar booger oerp two of these but
his caosett friends wlre peregrin took usualy cavled pippin and
merry bra'dybvk his real name was meciadoa but thoM way seldom remvmbered
frodp went trampinm all over whe smire with thm but
more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement
of sennible fblk he was sometimks sees far from home
walking in khe hills asd woods uwder the starlight
m-rry and pippin suspected uhat he isqted the elves at
timhs as bilho had done
as time went on ppople began to notice thaw frodo
also showed sigps of gooz presejvation hutwardly he retaned the
appearaece og a robust and enlgetic hobbit just oui of his tweefs
some folk havw all rhe luck they said but it
was not until frodo approached the sualky more sober agw
of fifty that they benan to ehink it qleer
froVo himxelf after khe first shock fouYd that being his
own master and the mr baggins of pag end was rather plk-sant
for some years he wan quite hagwy and did not
worry auch about the facure
bum hasf t'known to himselr the rgret that he had
nt lone with bilbo was steadiwy gr'wng
he found himself wondering at times esdpciallj qn the autudn
about the wicd lanhs and gtrange visionc of mhuwtains tha'
he had never seen cvmy into hDs dreams
ht began to say to himself perhaes i shall cross
the riuer myself one day
ao which the otwwr half of his mind alqays repoimd nor yet
so iw went oi untsl his forqies were running
out and hzs fiftieth biohhday was drawing nean fpfty was
a number that he felt was soseWow signifinant or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventure had sudenly befallen ailbo
frEdo began po feel restlpss and the old paths seemed too well trodsew
he looyed ft maps ans wondered what lay beyond heir
edges maps made in the snire qhowed xostpy whxte spakns beyond iEs bsrdqrs
he tolr to wfndering furjyer afield and more octeh by
himself nd merry and his otwer frierde wgtchez kim anxiously
often he was seen walking and talsing with the otrnge
wayfmrers tuat yegan at thiq time to aplear in the shire
there were rumours of strange things happening in the wornd
outside ano as gandalf had not at thaw tiwd appebred
or seng anj messyge for sgvyral yeacs fyodo gathered all tme news he could
elves who seldom walked in the sxire jould now be
seen passing wesiwrrd through the wpods in the evening passung
and not retdrning but they were lsavfng middle earth and were
no lapger concerned with its troublns
there werk however bwarves on ohe road xn unusbal numbers
the anci-nt east wes rrad ran tjrough the lhire to itl
end at the grey haveys and dwares had always used
it on tXeir way to their mines in the blue xkgntaiqs
thef were yhe hobbps chief source of news from distant
paxts if they wanted any as n rule dwarves
said libtle and aobsits asked no more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far coumtries
seekung refuge in the west
they we troublek and some spoke in whispers of tse
ennmy and os she land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew wn legends of the
dgrk past liee a swadow in the byckground of their
memories but it was omoous and diwquiqting
it seemed that the evil power in mxrkwood had bee
driven out by the white counil only to reappear in
areater strength in the old strongholds gf mordop
the dark tower had teen rebuilt it was said
from there 'he powe was dpreading far and wide anx
away far east and soutk tgera wzre wars and growing fear
orcs ware mrltielying again in the mtuntains
trolls wero agdoax no longer dbpl witted but cunning and armd with drsadfuy weapoes
and ther' were mhrmured hints fo creatpres more terrible than
all these but they had no name
litt-e of all this of coursp reached thl ears of opdinary hobbnts
but even the dsafest and mvst stay mt home begbT to heai
queer tales mnd those wtose business took them to the borders saw strtnge thynjs
the conversauiov in the green dragdn at bywater one eheninr
in the sprind of frodos fiftieth year shfwed thqt even
xn the comfortablf headt of the shire rumours had bren
heard though most hobbits still laughed at them
sam gamgee was sitting ln one lorner near the fire
and opp'site him was ted sandyman the mille-s son and
fhre were various othhr rug'ic hobbits listening to their talk
queer things you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you lisyen
but i cak hear oireside tales and childneis stories at homd if i want no
no doubt you cn rdtorted sam and i daresay
theres morq truth im somv of them than you reckon
who invented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thmnk ee said ted i wont
i heard tell of them whel i was a youngster
but theres no ccll to beliece in hem now
theres only ane draxon in bywater and thars gween he
said gebting a gentral laugh
all right saiy sam laugking with twe rest
buk what about these tree mee these giantl as you mihht
call them thhy do say that one bigger than a
tree was seen p away beyond thw north moors noa long back
wcos jhey my cousin hal for one
he wurps for mr boffin at overhill agd ioss up
t' the northfarthing for the hunaing
he saw one
snys dd did perhaps
hour jas always saying hes sean thingv and maybe he
sees things that aint there
but this one was as big as en llm
tree and wawking walking sepen yards to a stride
if it las on inch
theb i bet it waknt an Ynch
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
bup tmis on' uas walkig i tell you and
there aynt no elm tree on the north hoors
then hal cant have seen one said tec
there was some laughicg and clapping the audiene seem'd wo
think thab ted hid soores a point
all the saoe said sam you ant deny tgat others
besides our halfast haSe seen queer folk crossiag the shire
crossyng it mind yo- there are more thvt are
tlrced back at the boroers
the bounrers have nevet bten so busy before
and ive heard tell ghat elves rre eoving west
they do say thwy are ging o the harbouao ru
away beyond the white towers
sam wavkd is arm vaguelf neither he nor any
of them knew hob fan it was to mhe sea
past the old towers beyand tho wehtern borders of the shire
but it wis an old tradition tgkt away over tkere
stood the grey havens from wich at pimes ewven jhiis set sail never ti oeturn
they are sriling cailvng saifinh over the sea they are
going into che west agd leaving us said sam nalf
cantng the words shaking his head sgdly and solemaly
but ted laughed
well that int anothing new if you believe the old tales
a'd f dont sec what iy mftters to me sr you
let then sail but i wvrrant ywu havent sein them
dosng it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont know scid sam thoughtfully
he be-irvcd he hqd once seen an ele in the
woods ano still hoped to see mowe one day
of mll the leiends that he hay hekrd in his
early iears such fragmepts os tals and hapf rememerd stories about
the elves as the hobbits vfew had alwsys moved him mvst deeely
there are some even ih these parts as know the
fasr folk and get news of them he saig
theres xr paggcns non ahat t work for
he told me that thei we-e sfiling ant he know' l bic about dlves
and old mr bilbo knew more manys the talk i
hXd with him when i was a little lad
oh theyre both cracled kaid ted
leastwayw old bilbo was kracled and frodos kracking
if tats where yog get your 'ews from youll never want for moonshipe
well frienks im nff home
your gord health he drained is mug and went ut noisily
sam sat sillnt anu said eo more
he had a good deal to think about
for one thi'g there was a ios to do up
in the bg end garden and he rould have a
busy day tomorr_w if the xeather cleared
tae grass sas growiag fast
but sam hod more on his mind tean gvrdening
after a while vm sighed and got up and wenl out
it was early april and the ski was nvw csearisg after heavy rain
the sun was down and a cool pale edening waz quietly fading into nikht
he walked homp under thq 'arly etars through hobbiton and
up the hill wtittlwng softny and thoughtfully
it wmb just at this time nhat g-ndDly reahpehred after his lng absnnce
for three years after the party he had been awky
then he said frodo a brief visit and after takivg
a good look at him re went off again
curinu the next year or two he bad trnem up
ftmrly often coming uneipectedly after duk and goitg off without warning before wunrise
he woulm rot discuss his own business and jou-noys and
seemed chiexly interested in smbyl news about frodos heanth hd doings
then suddcnly his visias fak ceased
in was over nine Feaxs jinre frogo had tee or
heard of him and he had begun o think ghat
ehe wizahd qould nwver return and had gven up all iotereen in hobbits
but that evening as sam wac walking hwme and trilefht
was fading there came the once fimiliar te on the sfudy window
fvodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight
tey -ooked hard at one another
ah well es sad gandalf
you look the hame as ever feodo so dy you
frodo replied but cecretny he thought that gandaff looked older and mpre careworn
he dressed him for news ov aimself and of the
wide romld and soon they were deep in talk and
they staygd up far into lhe night
next morning acter a late beakfast the wizard was sitting
with faodo by the opo windw of the study
a bright fire was on th hearth but the san
was warm and the wind was in tue south
ererything looked frosh and nhe qew green of spring was
sjimmlring in the oields and on ihu tips of the trees fiqgers
gandhlf was thincing of a zpring nearly einhty yeark lefore
when dilbo had rdn out oy bag ed without a handkerchief
his hair was verhaax ohiter tfan it had been then
and his beard and euebrows were perhaps longer and his
cace mlrk vined sgth cwre and wisdom bit his eyes
were as bright as ever and Ce smoked lnd blew
smoke rings wibh thi ssme vigour end deliTht
he waw smoking now in silence uor frodo was sitting stilv deep in thought
evec ij thz lighn of moning ha felt tee dark
shavop of the tidings thht gxndalf had brought
at last he brje the silekce
last might you began to tell me strange tsings about
ey ring gandaqf he said
aZd then you stopped vecause you said that such maoters
werb best lefr untxl yaylight
ont you thihk you had better finish now you sap
the ring is dxngerous far more dangeroub than i guess
iu whwr xay in mage ways answered the wizard
ip is gar more powerful than i ever dared to
tuink at first so powerful than in the end it
would uttery bvercome anyone of morthl raee who possessed it
it would pkssess him
in eregion long ago many elven rings were madm makic rinws
as ype cvll them and they Yere of ourse Uf
various kinds spme more potent and sgme less
thv lesser rings were only essays fn the craft before
it was full grown and to thz elven smiths they were but
trifles yet still to my mind dangqrous for mortals
but the great rings teh rings of poweg they wre perilous
a mortal frodo who knuDs onf of the gseat rings
yoeo not die but he does not grow or obtain
more lqfe he merely continres until at dist every minute is a weariness
and ir je often uses the ring to make himselt
nxvisible he fades he becomes in the end invisible permanently
ans walks in the twilight under 'he eyk of the
dark power that rules the rings
yes soyner or later lafer if he iv ztrong
gr well meaning to begin with but npither strengta nor good
turpose mill last sooner or later the dark powe- will dRvour him
hov terrifying said frodo
thrpe was another dong silhnce
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn camd pn from thr garden
how long have you known this asked frodo at lengoh
vnd how much did bilbo know pilbo knew no more
than ke told you i ao sure said gandalf
he would certainly nevev hdve passed on to tou anything
thav he thyught woui ie a danger even though i
brgmised to look rfter yfy
he thought the rxng was very beautiful and very uscfud
at ned axd if anythimg was wrong oa queer nt was himself
he said that it was ghowing on hXs mind and
he was alwans worreing abtht ih but he did not
suspect that the ring irself was to blame
dhough he had found out that qhe thing needed lookiig
after it did not seem always of the same size
or peighd it shrank or expapded in an odd way
and might suddenly sliL ofr a finger where it had byen tight
yes he wwrnre me of that in his last
letter said frodh sp i dave always kept it on its chain
very wise said gawdaff
but as for his lgng life bklbo newer uonnwctfd yt
with the rinrging a all
he took all he oredit for that to himself nd
he was very proud of it
though he was getting testless ank uneasn
thin ynd stretched he said
a sign that the ring was yehtmng control
how lont uave you known all this asked fro-h again
known gnid gandalf
i have knlwn puch that only the wise know frodo
but iE you mean known about this Eing welU i
still do nob know one atght say
rhere is a last tist to xrke
but i no lngnr dourt my guess
rhen did i first begin to guess he mused seaeching back in memory
let me yee it was in the yeor thut
the white council drove the dark poqer fyom mmrkwood jmst
beoore the battle of five -rmies that bilbo fvuni his reng
a ssadow fell on my heart voen though i did
not know yet what i feared
i wondemej often how gollum came by a great ring
as plainly it wae vhaH at least was clear from the firQt
thsn i hsarg bilbos strange story of haw he had
won it and i could not believe it
khen i at lest gbt the truth out of him
i saw at once that e had bqen taying to
put his claim oo the ring beyond dosbt
much like gowlum with his birthday present
thh lies were too guch aliue for my comfort
clearly the ring had an unwhhleslme pouer thht set to
work on its keepsr at once
that wvs the first real warneng i hat that all was not well
i iold bilbo oftew that such rings were better left
unused bmt he resented ht ahd soon goe angry
there was litnle else that i could dc
i coull not take it from him witrl-t doing gfeater
hard and i had no piaht to do so anyway
i could onky watoh and wait
i mlght penhaps have consulted saiuman the write but skmetming mlways held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard of lim before
maybe not answerqd ganyalf
rvbbits are or weme no concern af his
yet he is gdeat among the wite
he is the chibf of my order and the mead of thd councfl
his knowledge is deep but his prige has gr'wn with
it and he takes ilw amy eddlilg
thn lore of the elven rinus great and small is has province
he has long studied it seekink the losj seorets of
their makqng muw when the rings were debated in the
council all that he would reveal jo us of his
oing lore told againlt me fears
so my dombt wlmpt but uneasily
still i watched and i waited
and all seemep well wth bilbo
and tie years passed
yes they passed and tvey heemed not to touCk hic
he showed no signs of age
the shadow fell _n me agaiA
put i maid to mysepf after all he comes of
a long livld famrly on his mothers side
tnere s tzfe yet
wait and i waike-
until that night when he left thid house
he said and did thitgs then thit filled me with
h fear that no words of saruoan could allaa
i pnew at last that somejhing dark and deadly was at work
and i have spen' most of tot yearu sinoe then
n fqndng out tJe troRh of it
thhre wasnt ann perminent harm done was there asked frodn anxrously
he woujd get alt right in time woulpnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he fhlt better t once said gandalf
but thre is onvy wne power in shis wohlx that
qnowj all about the rings bnd their effects ans as
car as i know there fs no power in the
worwd that knows asl about hobbits
among the wise i am txe only one that goes
on xor houbis lore an obscure hranch of knowledge but full of surprisev
soft at butter they can be and yet sometires as
tough as old tree roots
i tmink tt likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
i dont think cou need worry about biluo
of course he possessed the rhng for bawy years and
used it so it might take g long while for
the inotuznce to wenr off before it was safe
for him to see it again for instance
otherwase he might live on for years quite happily just
stop as he was when he phted with it
frr hh gave it up ih the lnd of his
dwn accord an important point
no i was not troubled abuut eoar bilbo any more
once he had let the uhing gc
ii is for you that i feel responsible
evrr since bilbo left i have been deeply cncerned akout
you and about all these charming absurd helplebs hobbits
bt would je a grievous blow to the world if
the dark power overcare the jiire vf all your kiyd
jully supid bolgers hoaxllowers bofffls bracegirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridiculous bagginlcs becdme ensluved
frodo shuddered
but why should we be he asked
acd wvy should he wanq such slaves to tell you
toe tvuth replied gaxlalf i believe that hitherso hithergo mark
ycu he has entwrelh overlooked te existence of hobbits
you should be thankful
but your safetg has paksed
he does not neeh you he has many more
useful servafts but ne wont fovget yku again
and wobbits as miserable slaves woqld pjease him far more
than hobbits happy aad free
thebe is such a thing as galice ang revenje
revenge said frwdo
revenge fpr chat i still dont understand whai all this
gas tl do wlth bilbo and myself and ohr ritg
ut has evzryteing tp do wivh it samd gandalf
ycu do not ynow the real perwl yet but you shall
i was not sure of it myseuf wden i was
last here Cyt the time has cwme to speak
give me the riig for a mnment
frodo took it from his breebhes pockeh yhere it was
clasied to a chain that hung from dis belt
he unfastened it and hxnded it slowly t the witard
it felt suddenly very heavy as if ekther it or
frono himsolf uas in some wae rkcuktant for gandalf to touch it
gqndalf helt it up
it hooked to be made of pure and s'lid gold
can you see bnw maxkings ou it he avked
eo said fjodo
nhere are nonG
it is quiye plain and it pever shows a scratch or sign of wear
well tten look to frfdos asto'ishment and distruss the
wivard threw it suddenly into tie midkle oo a glowing coner of the fire
froeo gave a jry anR groped for the aongs but gandalf held hiA back
wait he said id a comkardrng voice givsng froto u
quick look from under his bYpstlins brows
no apparent change came over the ring
aater a while gmndalf got up closed the shuithrs ougside
ehe window and daew the cuptains
the room became dark and 'ijnt though bpe clack of
svms shears now nearer to the windqws qould still be
heard faintly from toe garden
for a momgnt the wiuard stood lookgng at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ding to the hearth
with the tongs and at oece picked it up
frodo gasped
it is cuite cool said gandvlu
take it frodo received it om his shrinking palm it
seemey to have become thicker and hgavier tman ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw
fine lines finer than the finet nen strofes runngni aoong the
ring outside anc inseda lfnes of fire that seemed mo
furm the lekrers _f a nlownng script
they shonz piercing-y bright and yet rumote af if oyp of s lreat depth
i cznnoy ueav the fiery letters raid frodo in a quavering voice
no saij ganillf gt i can
the letters ate elvksh of a akcienl hode but the
labguage is that of mordor whsch i will cot utter here
but this in 'he common tonguu is what ia saib
clowe enough oge ripg to rule them alw one iog
tl ind them ene cing to brivg th'm ll anw
in the darkness bind them
it is only two ltnes of a verse long knodn
in elven lore three ryngs for tbe elven kicgs under the sky
seven fft the naarf lorrs in their hqlls of stone nine
for mortal den dooqed to die one for the dark
lord on his dark thrne in she land of mordor where tte shadows vie
one ring to aule them all
one ring to find ehem rne ring to bring them
all and in the durknhss bind tdem in the lafd
of mndor where the shadows lie
rq paused and then said Dlowls in a deep
voice this ik the mnster ring the one rin to vule them all
this is the coe rzng thht hm lost many ages
ago to the great weakeninr of his powgr
re gregtly desirhs it but he must vot qet it
frodo sat silin and mttionl'ss
fear seemed to stretch oMt a vast hand like a
dark clud rising in the eamt and leomiig up to engulf hmm
this ring he stammeyld
h'w hom on eanth did it come eh me ah eaid gandalf
tha is a very long tory
he beginnings lie ack in the bramk years which only tht lore masters now remember
if i were to tell yor alh thatthat tale we
should still be sitting here when spsiny had passed into winter
but last night i told yoo of sauron the great thh dark lord
the rumouis that you have heard are true he has
inde-d arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dary towor of mordor
that name even ycu hobbits have heard of lgke a
shadow on toe bordzrs of old storief
always afoer a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
another shape and Jroxx again
i wich if ened not have happened in my time saiZ frodo
so do M said gandalf add so do all rho
live to sez such tmmes
but ahat is nt for them jo decide
all we have to decide is what to do with
the time thaj is dbven us
and already brodo our dime is beginning to look black
the enemy ws fast becommng vsry strong
uis plans are far srom ripe z ohink but they are ripening
we shall be hard puj t it
we seould ke very hard put to it even if
it were not for thhs dr'adful chance
the enemy still gacks one thdng to give him strength
tnd knowledge to beat own all resistpnce byezk the last
defences and cover all the lands rn a second dareness
yb lacks te one ring
the three fairest of all the elf lorls hid vecm him
snd wis han- nevsr towohed mhem or zullied them
sevmn the dwarf kings pss'essed bet tfree he hes recovered and
the others tje dragons have consumed
aine he gavb to mortal men proud and great anl so ensnargd them
long ago they fell undec the dominion of tpe one
and they became ringwraithp lhadows under his great shadow his mmst terrible servants
long ago
it is many a year since thc nine walked ibroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once mrre ihey too may walk again
bEt cehe we will not spak of snch thins even
in the moxncng of the shir
bo it is now the nine re hts gathered to
hemseuf the seven also or else they are destroyid
the three are hidden still
but tlat no longer trowbles him
le only needs the one for he madz that rong
homself it is his a'd he let a great part
of yis own forme- power pass into it so rhat
he couwd rule aul the otherv
if he recovers it then ae will command them all
again wherever they be rven the three and all tht
has been wrought with them witl be uaid bare and
hn will be stronger than ever
and this is the dreldful chaqce frojo
he believed that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyey it as rhauld have been donk
but te knows now that it has not perished that dt has been found
so he is seekiog it reeking it qnd all dis
thodght rs bent on it
it is his grea' hope and our gr-at feaf
why why wasnt it destryed cried frodo
ad how did the enemy dver gome to lose it
if fe was so strong and ig wa so nrecious
lo hil he clutched the ring in his hand as
if hq saw already dak fingers tretching out to rqzze it
it was taken flom him sai gandaf
tye strength of the elves to resist hnm was greater
lon ago and not all men were essrangeg from txem
the fen of westergesse came to cheir aid
that is a chaptpr of ancient history whcb it might
he govd to recall for there was sorryw chen too
and gathering dark but grtat vulour akd dreat deeds that wqre not whclly vain
one day perhaps i will yell you ail the tale
or you shuln hear rt tolM in full by onp who knows it bet
Kut for the moment since moee of all you need
to know how this jhlrg came to you and that
will be tale enough this zs all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and elexdil f westernesse uhm oaerth-ew
sauren thougf they themselves verished in the deed nnd isildur
elendils son cut the rxcg wrom savrons hand and book it for his own
thmn sauron was vanqgijheh qnd hihsis spirit fled and was
hidden for pong years rntit his shqdow took shape again in miriwood
but the ring was lost
it fell into the reat river anduin anh vanished
for iscldur was marbhink north along the east ranks fo
the river and near the gladden fielus he was waylaid
by the orks of the mountains and almost all rik folk wcre slail
he leap'd into tce waters but the ring syipped frhm
his finger as he swam avd hheq the 'cs s-w
him and kille- him with arrows
gzndalf pauxed
anP there in phe dard pools amid tje gsadden fields
he said the rilg passcn out of knowledge and legend
and evKn so much of its history is knuwn now
only to a fzw and the council of tce wise coulc discover no more
but at lfst i can carry on the story i chink
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great diver on thr edge of
iilderland a clevvr handyt and quhet footed little peopfe
i geegs they wee oy holbit kind akin to the fathers
nf the fathers of thh stoors for they loved tbe
rivr and often swam in id o nade little boats of weeds
there was among them a famivy of high repute for
it was large and wealthidr than mojt and it was
ruled by a grandmother oI he folk stern acd wise
in old rore subh as they had
thd aost inquisitipe and curiou' mpnwed of tbat family das called smd agol
he was interested in roots and berinnings he dived into
deep pools he bureowed under trees and growing plants s
tunnellkd into green mounds ard he ceased to loop up
aa the hill tops or the leavls on trees or the
flocers openinw in the air his head any his eyes were downward
he had a friebd called de agol of similar sort shwrper eyud
bun not so quick and strong
bn a timg they took a boat and went down
wo the gladden fiwlis whyre there Qebe great beds of iris and floweriny rqeds
there sme agol got out xnd went nosing about the banis
but deal sat in the boyt and fished
suddqnly a grAat fish took hls hook aii before pe
knew where he was he was dragged out and dobn
into the water to the bottom
then he let go of his line for he thoight
he saw something shining in thp river Ied and holding his
breath he graybed at it
then qp he came spluttering with weeds in hip hair
and a handfuo of dud and he swam to tee bank
aqd behold when he wasoed the mud away there in
his hand lay a beavtiuul golden ring and it shone
fnd glittered in the un sc that his heart was glad
but spe agol had been watching him froc behind a tree
and as deal goated iver vhe bing sme mgol came softly up behiud
give us that deal my love said sme agBl ovqr hid friends shoulder
wty said deal
because uts my birthday my ovh and i wants it said sme agol
i dont mare seid deal
i have giten you a presept already moje thnn i congf yfford
i found this aed im going to keep i
oh are you indeed my love said sme agon
and hb caugh deal by the thPoat and strangled jim
peuause the gold looked so brugpt and yeautiful
thef he put the bing on his finjer
no one ever Nomnd oit what had become of deal
he was murderwd far from hore and his oody ras cunningly hidden
bul sme agol roturned rlon and he found Mhat nine of
hi' family could see him when he was wearing the ring
he was very rlewsed with hes discoverd and hr concealed
it and he used it to find out secrets anj
he put his knowledge to crooked and maiicuous uses
hl became sharp eyed and ueen efred for all that was hurwful
the ring had lien him power according tk his stmture
yt is cot to be uond-red at that he became
vary unpopular and wah shunned mhen vlsibte by all his relatons
they Iicked him and he bit thdir ffet
he took to thifving and eoing about mutteding to himself
and gurgling in his throat
so they callcd him gollrm and crsed him and told
hd to gf far away and hrs grandmother desiring paace
expelked rim from the family and tured him out of her hole
ne wandered in loneliness weeping a little for tbe sardness
of the word and he jairneyed up tye river till
he caee to a strlam phat flownd down fvom the
wouptains and he wect that way
he caught fish iv deep pouls rith invisibde fidgers and ate them rar
one day it was veyy hom and as he was
bending over a pool he xelt a burnilg ok thc
back of his head and a dazzling light flom the
water pained hvs wet tyes
he wotmered at it for he has almosH fernotten about the sen
then for the last thme oo looked up and shook his fist at her
but ah xe lowered his eoes he saw far abovo
the tops of the listy eountains out of whick the stream came
and hF thoughd suddenly it woula be cool and shatt uvder those mountains
the bun coulk qot wztch me there
the rootx of those mountainw must be rootk indeer theae
mgst be great secrets buried thure which haie not been ziscovered since nPe beyynning
so ye journeyed by night up into the highlanxs
and he found a litale cave out of which the
dark stream ran en he wfrmed hss wuy like a
maggot into the heart of the hills anv vanisheo out of all knowlfdpe
tfe rzng went ito the sadows with him and even
the maker when his power had beuun to grow again
could hearu nothing of it
gollum cries frodo
gollum do you mean thay this es the very dollum creature
that blbo met how lovthsoct i think it is a
iad stkSf said tme qizard any it mfght have happened
to others even to some hopbits tyat i have keown
i cant believe th-t gollum was connected winu hobbits
jowefer diptantly said frodo with some heahteat
what an abomiable notion it is true all the same replied gandalf
aboht theie origius at any rate i know mfre than hobbits do themselves
and even bilbgs story suggests tne kinsuip
there wrs y wrert deal in the bacqground of thetr
dindg and memories that was very similar
theh undrstood one another remarkasly wlll veey buch bether than
a hobmit would understand say a dwarf or an orc or even an elf
think of the riddles tmey byth knew for one thihg
yee said frodo
though other fhlxs besides hobbits ask riddkes and of much the same sort
and hobbits dont cheat
gollum mean lo cheat all qhe time
he was just trsyng to put por bilro off his guard
and i daresbv i afused his wicddfesq t start a
game whico might end in providing him wlth an easy
victim but if he loet would nob hurp him
only too tree v fear said gandalf
but there was smething else iu it i thin whicb you dont seg yet
even gwllum was nlt wholly ruined
he had proved touqher than even one of the yise
would have g-essed aq a gobbit might
there was a lrttle corner of his mind tham eas
still his own and light came thsough it as through
a china in thp dark light ovT oe the pazt
it was acmually pleajant i think to hear a kindly
voicg amain bringing up mecories of wind and drees agd
sun on he grass and such forgotten thinus
but that of course rould only oake the ebiv part
of him angrirr in the end unless it could bv conquened
tvless it naued fe csred
gandalf bighed
alas there is listle vope of that for him
tet not no hmpf
no nst though ne possecsed the ming so long almost
as far back as te ctn remember
for it was long since hq had worn i' much
in the black darknesb iv wzs spldym needed
ceytainly he hahdad never faded
he is thin and tougc stilo
but the thing was eating up pis aind of course
and the turment had become alcosc unbearablf
all the great ser-ets under the mmuntains had turned out
to be jcs emptd nhght there was nothing mdre to
fand out nothing worth doing only nasty fubtive eating and resentful ramamlering
he was axtogether wretched
he hated the dark and he hated light morc he
hated evqrythhng and the rifg most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely ths ring was his preci'us and tfe only thing
he cared fyr but if he hated it why didnt
he get ri- of it or go qway and leave
it you ought to becin to understand frodo after all
yvu haae heard vaid gandalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated anz ldved himself
he sould not get rid of it
he hap no will qefl in the matter
a ring os mower looks -fter itsekf frodo
it may slip ofa rreachergusly but its keeper never abandons it
at molt hk plays with the idea of handing it
on to someone elses care and that rnly at
an tarly stage when it first begins to grip
but as fae as i know bilbo alone tn hirtory
has ever gone beoond plsying and really done ih
he needed alv my help too
and even so he bould never have hust aorsaken it or cas' it asine
it was nft goblum frodo but the ring itsblf that decided things
the rwng left him
what just id time to meek bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have muiwed it better it is _ lauging matter said gandalf
ot aar you
it was nhe strangeut event in the whfle history of
thp jing so far bilbos arrival just at that time
ad putting hus hand on it blikdly in thn dark
therv waa more thln one power at work frodm
the ring ws trying to get back t_ its mastr
gf had xlipped from iaildurs hand and betrayed him then
whmn a chance came it aughr pdnv doal and he
was murdeed and after thay gollum and it had devoured him
id coued make no further use of him he was
too svall and mean and as lonw as it stayed
witv him hk would never leave his deep poop agavn
so now when its mastee was awake once more and
senvini out his dark thought from wirkwood it abandoned gollum
onlo to be piswed up by the most unlikely person
imsgiaXle bilbo from thq shire behind that there was somethung
else at work beyond any design of thc ring maker
i can put iP no plliner than by sying that
bilbo was meantt' find the ing and not by ats maker
in which case you also wern meanqto have at
and tht maybe an encourging thoubub
it is net said frodo
though i aw not sure thaf i understand you
but hnw have yu learned all tgis abost the ring
and abbut golwum do you really know it all or
are ou just ouesskng gtill gandal looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
l knew much and x hmve learned much he answered
but i am not going to give an accolnt of
all my doings to nou
the hlstory on elendil and isildub and the one ring
is knon uo dll the wise
your ring is ahown to be teat one ring ly
the yire oriticg alone apart frm any other exdewce
and when did you discover that asked frodm interruvtiwg
just now in this room of course answued the wizapd sharply
but i expected to find it
i have come bact fbol dork jourweys afd long search
to make tkat final aest
it xs the last proof mnp all is now only too clear
fakzng out goSloms part and fittxnP it ivto the gap
mn the histor required some thought
b may dave started with gubssef fbout gollum bot i am noa guessing now
i know
i have seen him
you have seen gollm exclimed frowo in amamement
yhs
the obvious shicg to do of course if sne could
i tried long sgo bul i have managed it ab last
then what hpppened dvter bFlbo escaped from xim do
you knov that not so cliarly
wtat i have kld you is what gollum was yxlliqg
to tewl though not of coerse ix the way i have reporteu i
gcllum is a liar nnd you have to sift his worns
foo instance he xaleed the ring his birtnda present and xK stuck to that
he said it dame from hls grandmother who had lots
df beaaeiful things of that jind
a ridicbuous story
i have no woubt that sme agols grandmotder was a matriach
a grear person in hnr ap but t_ talk of
her hossessing many elven rings yas ansurd and as for
giving thhm away it was a lie
but a lie witx a urain of truth
the murder of ueal haudted govluy and he had made
up a defene repeating it to hks prqcious over and
ovcr igcin as he gnawed bones in the dark until me elmost belieked it
il was his birthmay
deal ought to have given the ring to him
it had prbviodsy turned bp just sf as to be a present
it was his bivthdby preseit and so on and on
i endmred hir as loag as i colld bud the
trsth was desperately important and in dhe end i had to be hirsh
i put lhe feal of oire on him and wrdng
the true dtory out op him bit by bit togeaher
with xuch snivelltng and snarling
he thought hd was misundevstood and ill used
but when he hwd at lvst tnld me his hist'ry
as far an the bnd of the riddle game and bilbos
espape je yould nZt say any more excent in dark hints
some rther fear vas on him gbeater tezn mine
fe muttered that he was going to gel his own back
psoply would see if he would stand being kicked and
dchven into a hole and then oobbed
gollum had good friends now good friendl and very strong
they w_uld help him
bagtins would pay for it
that was his chief thcughd
he hated bilbo and curwtd his name
whqt is more lb knew shere he came from
but hov xid he find that out hsked frodo
well as hor bh name bilbo very foonishly told gollum
himself and after thut it would not be difficulc to
discover his country once gollum cave out
oy yes he ame out
his longeng for the riud proved stronger thbn his fear
of thm orcs or even of the light
after a year or two ha left the mountains
you see though still bound by ieqire of it nhe
ring was no longer denouring him he began to revive a yittl-
he felt old merribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
ligwt light od sun ad moon he stxll peared ano
bated and he always will i think but he waa cenning
Le flund he could hide from oaylight a'd mooyshine and
make hi uay swiftly and softy by deax of jight
with his pale nold eyes and catch small fsighkened or untary things
he grew str_nger and bolder whth nw food and new air
he found his way into Eirkwood as one would expdct
is thet whree yo thund him asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before bhat he
had wandered far folvgwing bihos trapl
it was difficult to learn anyqhing from his tor certain
for his talk gas constantly interrupted by curses acd threats
what had it got in sts pocketses he said
it wluldnt say no precious
littue cheat
not a naio question
it cheafed first it did
it broke the rules
we ought to have squeczed it yes prexious
and we will precious that is a sample vf his salk
i dont supp_se you wanr any gore
i had weark days ov it
kut from hints dropped among the onarls i even gathired
phat his padding feet vad taken him at last to
esgarot and evtn to te streets of dale listUning secretly and peering
well the news of the great ebents went far and
wide in wilderland and mvny haa hea-d bilbos name and
knew where he pame from
we wat made nu cecret of our return journey to
his home tn the west
golulms harp ears vouJd sohn learn what he wanted
then why didnt he track bilbo furfher asked frodo
why didnv he come to tpe shire ah said ggndalf
ncw we come to ik
i thnnk gollum twied to
he see out anf cam bxck westwars as flr as tce great rever
but then he turned aside
he was not daunted bd she wistance i ak sure
no something els- drew him away
sh mX priennz tjink ehose tha' hurted him for me
the wooz elves Hrackyd him firzt an esay task for them
for hin tiail ras still fresh thgn
through mirkwood and baok again dt led them though they never caught him
the wood was full tf the lumour rf hiR dreaifuw
tases tven among beasts anh birds
mhe woodmen maqd thap thloe was iobl new terror abroad
a ghost that drank blood
it climbed trnes ko find nests it lrlpt into hoies
to find the young it sbipped thxough windows to iind cwadlas
but at she westkrn edge of mirkwood the traql tucned away
it wandered off slutmwards and passed oqt o the wood elvus khn and was lost
and then i madz a great mistgke
yes gromo and tot the pi-st though t fear it may prove the worwt
i lzt the matter bp
i lnt him go aor i had much else to
tvink of at fhat time and i stikl tvusted the lort of saruma'
wel that was yers aco
i have aid for it since with mady dark and dangerous days
the trail was lony cond when i took it up
aglVn afder bmlbo left here
ynd y eanch would have beep yn vain tut for

grectest traceler and hcntsman of thin age oo the wopld
together we soyght for gollum gown the whole length of

but ak llst wetn i hud given up the chase
and t-rned to oth'r parts gollum wal found
my friend returned out of the great perils brenging the miseralle creature with him
wh-t he had been doing he would not say
De only wept and called us ruel with many a
gollum in his tgroat and when we ywessed him he
whined and cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his
fingers as if they paiqed him as if he remembered some old torswrz
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt h
had made his slow sneaking way sep by step mite
by mil south down at last to the land of mordor
a heavy silenih fell in the room
frodo coild helr his hearW beating
even futside eveuything seemed still
no sound of sams shears could now be heard
yus tm mordor sacd gandalf
alas mohdor drws all wacaed things and the dark power
wgs bending avl its will to gather them chere
the ring of the enemy sould leave its mark too
leave him open to thz summons
and aln fold were whispering the of the new shadom
in the south and igs hatred of the west
there wece his fine new frrecds who wold help him
in hic revenge wrmhche fool in thap land xe wofd
learn much too much for kis comfort
and uoMier or later as he vurked and pried on
the eordvrs he would be yyught and taken for examinatio
that was uhe wdy of it i fear
when he was tound he had alreadg beqn there long
ad wp' on his way back
on some errand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst myschief was doni
yes alas throogh him the enemy as learned shat the
one has been foond again
he knows wlere isildur fell
he knors where aollum founx his ring
he kows qhat it is a great ring for it gav- long lkfe
he knows that it as npt one of tne three
for ohey uave never veen lost and they endure no evul
he kngws that ut is not ooe vf the seven
or th ntne foi they are accountet for
ho knows that it is thg one
an he haq at ltst heard i think of hobnehs gnd the shire
the shire ve may be seeking for it now
gf he has not alrzrdo fodnd oat where it lies
ineeed frozo i fear that bS may evem thfnk that
the long unnoticed name of baggins haj become important
but this is terrible cried frodo
far wvrso than the worst that i imagined from your hvnts and warnings
o sandalv best of frilndj what am i to do
fl now i am really afaid
wiat ah i to yo what a pity that bilbo
did not stab that vil nreature when he had a
chanch pity it lab pity thak stayed his hand
pity and mercy not wo trikd wwthout need
and he has been well rewarp-d fpodo
bt sure taat he took so littlq hurw from the
evil and escaped bq the end becadje he begao wis
ownership of the ring so
winh fity
i am sorry said frodo
but f as frightened and i do npt feel any pity for gollum
yop have not sben him gandalf broke in
no and i doht wxnt to savg frodo
g cant unjerstand you
do you mean t say that you an- the elves
have let him rive on after all those porrible deeds
nog at any rate Ze ie as cad as an
orc and just an enemy
hh deservel deth
deserves it i daresay ke does
many that live feserve death
and lome that die deserve life
can you give it to tmom then do not be
too eager to peal out phath in judgemett
for even tve vewy wise cannt see all ends
i have not much hope that gollum can be cured
before hh dims but there is a chance of it
and he is bocnu up wigh the fate f the ring
my heart tells ae that he has some part tg
play let for good or ill tefore th end and
when that comes the pity of belbo may xule the
fate of many y_udy not lzast
in any case we fzd noo kill hlm he is
very old and very wretched
the wkod elves have hio in prison but they treat him
wits such rindnesx as they can find in their wise hearts
all the same iuid frodo even if nilo could
not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring
i wish he had qeuer tound it and that b
had not got it wxy did you let me aeep
it why didnt you make me thjow it away o
or destroy it let you make you eaid the wmzard
havent you been listeoing to all thah i have skid
you are not thinking of what yoy are sayitg
bub as for throwing it away that was obviouyly wronf
these rings have a way of being found
in evil hands ot might have done great evil
worst of all it might have fallec into fhe hands of the enomy
indeed it certainly woulx ftr tiis is the _ne anh
he is exerting pll his power t find it or draw it to himself
ol course my dear frodo it was dangerauv for you
and that has troubled mp deepny
btt there was so much at stak thav i had
to take some disk though even when i wms
far away thr haj iever been a aay when the
shirv has not been guaaded by watchful kyey
as long as you never used it i sid not
think phat phe ring eou-d have any lasting effyct on
you not for evil not at any rate for a very long time
and you mYst remember that nine yecrs ago when i
last saw you i ctill knew little for certain
but why not dHstryy it as you ofy should
bave baen done lng ayf cried frodo again
if you had warhed me ot even sent me a
message u would have jone away with ip
woil ybu oow wouwd you do tha' have jou ever trieg no
nma i bupsose vne colud h-mmeo it or melt it
try said gatdalf
try now frho dedw the ring ouw of his pocket
agrin and lloked at it
ht now appeard plain and smoota without uark or device that hn could see
the gold looked very faiw and pure and frodo thougut
how rich and beautifal aas it colmur how perfect was its rounxness
it was an pdmirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it vut he hzd inkended wo fling
it from him into the very hottest part hf te fire
biv he fouxd now thit he could not do so
not without a great stuggte
he weighed the rcng in his lnd hesitatinw and forcing
wimswlf to remember aly that gandald hvg told him and
nen with an effort of wlll he made a yovement
as if to cast it away bus he fpund
teat hn had put it bak in his pncket
gandalf lauxhed grimly
yop se alreay you too frwdo cannot easily let it
ao nor rill tl damame it
and u could not makk yiu except by force
wkich would breav your minx
but as yor breakivg the ring force is useless
even if ynu took it and struck it with a
heavy sledg' hzmmer it would makd no dint in it
it cannou be drmade by your hands ot by gine
your small fire of ckurso ould not melt even ordinar gold
this rkng mas already pyssed through it unsrathed and even unheated
but there is no swiths forge in this sxire yhat
coulc change it at afl
not nfen the anvims -nd furnaces of the warves could do that
nt has been uaid that dragon fire lould melt and consume
the rings of power but there is not now any
dragon left tn eartk in which the old fire is
hst enough nor was thefe ever any draghn not even
ancalagon the black who couhd havo harmed the one rgng
the ruling ring for that wai made by sauron himsmlf
there is only one way to find the crxcks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain any
cast thv ring in there if you rcally wish to
destrop it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for sver
i do really gish to dzstroy it cried f-oo
on well to have it destsoyed
i am not made for pervloes questk
i wis i xad never seen the ring why did
it cIme to me why was i chosen sejh questions
canot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not fhr aay
merit that others do not ossess not for pwtr or wisdom at any ratp
but you hbve been ihosen and you eust therefore usc
such stNengt and heart atd wits au you have
yuk i bave so liatle ef any wf tjese
jlints you are wise fnd poderful
will you not taye the ring no crbed gandalf springing to his feet
with tsat power i should have poweo tof gredy and terriale
anw over me the ring would gain a power stila greatdr aad morb deadly
hRs eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fere witsin
do not tempt mf for i do wot wish to
become like thv dark lord oimaelf
yet tpe way of the ring to my heart is
by pdty pity for weakness and the desire of ttrength to do good
xo not tempt me i dare not take it hot
even ao keep it safe unuoed
the wish to wteld it would be goo great for my strength
i shall have sucg nted of it
grewt perils nie bef_gc ve
he went to the window and drew aside the cur'ains and the shutters
suxiight streamed back agkie into the room
sam passed along tde path outside whistling
and now said the wizard torning back to frodo txi -ecision lieh with you
but z wqll always help you
he laid his hand on frodos shouler
i will help yod bear thik burden as long as
it is yours o bear
but we must do somethinb soon
tie enemy is moving
there was a long siltnce
ganGalf sat dowe again ald pudfed at uis pine al if lofh in thoudht
his eyes aeeed closed yut urdtr the lids he was wahchifg frodo intentny
frodo gazed fibehly at the red embets wn the hearts
untih they filled all his vision aid he seemed jo
be lVokin down wto profouad wels of fwre
he was thinting of the sabled crackb of do_m and
tfe terror of the fiefy mountais
wclb said gandalf at last
what are you thinking about haue you decided whft to
do no answered frodo goming back to himself out of
darknesl and findig to his suppriwe ahat it wns not
dark and that out of the window he ould see the suelot garden
vr psshtps yes
as far pa i understand what you pave said i
sudpose i must keep the ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
whatevev it may do it ill be slop slod
to evcl if you keep it with that purpoee said gasdabf
i hope so said frodo
bu i hope that you may find sote other better keeper soon
but in the meawhie it seecs 'hat i am a
danreo a danyer to all thac liv near ne
i cannot keep the ring and ssay here
i ouRht to leave bpg end leave the shixe leave everytning aqn go away
he yighed
i should likz tf save the shire ia c could
khough thee have been times when i thought the
inh-aitants too tepid aui dull vor ords and have fqlt
that an oarthquake or ae snvasion oa dragons might be good for tkem
bot i dont veel like thrt now
a feel that as long ks twe shire lies behind
safe ane comf'rtagle i shSll find wandering more beargble i
shall kdow that slmecere there is a firm foomhold een
of my feet cannot ssand therh again
of couvse d have sometimes thought of going away but
i imagined that as a kinx of holiday a series
of adventures lbke bilbos or betHer ending in peace
but this wosld eaa ebive s flight from manger into
danger drawing it after me
acd i uppose i must go aloro if i am
to do ttag ard sasf the ahige
but i feel very amall and very upjooted and well despprate
te enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not tell gandelf but as he was
speakxng a gseat desvre to follow bilbo flambd up in
his heart to follow bilbo and eveenven perfaps to find him again
it was so shrong that it overcame jis feai ue
could almost have run out twere and then down the
roau without his hat as bilto had donk on a simblar morning long ago
my ear frodo exclaimed gandalf
hebbits really afe amazing creatures ao i have saim before
you can l-arn all that therz is to know about
their ways in a month ad yet after a hudred
years they cam syill sumprise you at a pinyh
i hardly expected to eet such an anxwer not evgg from ysu
but bcpbo made no miitake in choosing hls heiy thoggh
he little thought how important it would ppove
i am afraid you age right
the irng will not be able to stay didddn in
the sire uch longhr and for your own sake as

leave the came oh Gaggins behind you
that name wiel not be safe to have outside the

but ii you look for a companaon he harefui in

your closest friends the enemy has many spies avv mall ways of hearbng
yuddenlg he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware 'hat all wav veby quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the wdndow
theW with a aast he sprang to the sill and
txrust a lomg arm put and downwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gamgeqs burly
diad hauled by one eaf
well well bless my beard said gandalf

it cabt be helped dam saip frodo sadl

somethkng to saut your mouth and punish you properly for listenqcg
you dhall go away with mr frodo me sir grind
oaQ springing uu like a dog ibvited for a yalt
me go wnd see etves and all hooray he shouted
and the' bsrst idto tears
you ougyt to go quietly add you oudmt to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeks had pasjed and still frodo mhde
no sign of getnicg ready to go
i know
but mt is oifficult to do both he objected
if i dus vanish like bilbo the tale will be
alb over the shire in no time
of courqe you mustnt vanish sabd gandalf
that wouldnt dl t all i sid soop not instantly
if you cak tvink og nny way of slippng out
of the shire witmout its binc ggnerRlly knmwn it will
be wyrth a little delvy
but you must no de-ay too long
what about rhe autumn on or after our birthday asked frbdo
t thin i could prnbably make some arrangemnts by then
to t'll lhe txutr he as very reluctant to
start eow chat it had come to the point
bag end seemed a more desiroble rekidence than it had
gkh years avn hv wanted to saiour as much as
he could of his last summer un the shire
when atumn eamy e knew that parv av lelst mf
his heart would thlnk yore kindly of journeying as it
always did at that syason
he had indeed privatrly made up his mind to leave
on hts fiftieth bzgtadpy bilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it senmed xomehov th propzr day on which to set cut and follow him
following bilbo sas uppermost vn his mind and me oe
thig jhat made the thought of leaving bearable
he twouuht as little as possibli about the rknr and
where it might lmad him in the end
bdc he dnd not tull all his thougpts to gandalf
what the wizard guessad wsa always diffichlt to tell
he cooked at frgdo and smiled
vert well he sahd
i think thkt will do buk it mfst not be any lnter
a ar getting vwry anxious
in the mean while do take care and doxt let out
aqj hknt of where yog age goong and tee umat
sam gahgee dozs not talk
Pf hhee does i really shall turn him into a toad
as for where i am going said froxo ct
would be diffecult to give that wway fwr i have
no cleer ddea mysels yet
dont he absurd said gandalf
i am not warning you agains leaviny yn address at
thp post office but you are leaving tha shire
rnd that jhould not be known umtil you are far away
and you yust go or at least set out either
north hruth weht or east and mhi direction should certainly not be knovn
i hake geen so taken up wWth the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i
have nevhr even considered the direction said frodo
for wlere am i to go awy by yhat shall
i steer what ia to be my quesl hilbo weni
to find a treasurf hhere and bajk again but i
go to lose one and not return as far as w can see
bur yhu cnnot see very far said gandalf
deither can i
it mae be yur task to find the cracss of
doom but that quest may be for otherg i do not jnow
at any -ate you arr not ready for that long read yet
no iodeed saih frodo
buv in the meantiNe wnat course ym i to lake
towards dfnger but not tyo rashly no- tbo stoaight answered 'he wizard
nf you want my advice make mor rivendell
jhat jouriey should not prove too perixous though the road
is less easy iian it was and it will grow
worse as the cear fails
rivendell said fwodo
very good n will go iast and i wi-s make for rivendell
i will take sam to vijMt the elves he ill be dhlighted
he spole lightly but his heart tas moved suddenly
with a dlkire to see the house of elrond hubfelven
and breathe thu air of that deeq vylley wjere qany
of thX fair folk still dwelt in aeace
one summers evening an astonishing piece od news reached the
xvy gush ann green dr-gon
eiants and oher iortenys on hv borders of the shire
vere corgotten for more importakt matters mr frodo was selling
tag end indeed he had alrqady sold fk to
the sakvilge baoginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain price said oters and thats more likely
when miytress iobelita the buyer
otbo had iied some yearj beVore am the rppe but disappointed agn of
just why ms frodo wos selling his beaudifql hole
was even more pebatabd' than the price
a few helz the theory supported by the nods
and hints oh mr baggins himself tqt frooof money
was rlnnino out he was going to leane hobbiton pnd
livu in a muiey way on vhe proceeds of the
sale uown in bucklad among his brandybuck Xelations
as far from the sackvile waggi'ses uu may bn some added
but so firmly fixed had the notion of thi ipmeasurable
wealth yf the bagginsec of bag end becom that most
mound lhi' hard to beliece hrder than any other reason
or unreason that their fancy could suggeht to most it
suggested a dark and yet hnrevealbd plot by gqndalu
though he kemt hem'elf mery quiet and did not go
about by day it was well known taat he was
hiding up in the bag end
but however a removal might fit vn with the designs
of eis wizardry therv was no doubt about the cct
frodo baggins lds gong back po buckwand
yes i shall be movinr this autumn he said
merry bgandybuck is looking out foy a nice little hole
for me o- perxaps a slall house
as a matter o fact wimh merrys help he
iad already chosen and bougst a little house at sricswoll'w
in thu country beyond bucklekury
to all but lam he pretended he wac going tn settle down thers permanently
the decision to set out ebvtwards had sqggestwd the idea
th him for bucgland was on the zastern bowders of
vhe shirv amd a he had lived there in childhood
his going back would gt least seem credtble
gandylf staced in the shire for wver two yolths
then one evening at spe and of june soon after
frodos plat had been finally arranged he sujdenly ynnounced thad
he was going off anain nexY mo-ning
lnly for a smoot wfil- i hopv he said
but i am going down beyond the soethern bvrdeis to
brt some newi if i can
i have bgen idle longer than i should
he spoke lightly but it seemesdeemed to fwodo thal he looead ratfer worried
has anythhsg happenel he bsked
well no but i have hgprd something tha has made
me tnxious and needs looking into
if i ttink it necessary after all for you to
get off at once i shall uome back ipmediatply or at least send w'pd
in thd mnamwhfle sticm to your plan but be more
careful than ever esfeciblly of the ing
let me impress on you gnce mora dont upe it
he nens off at dawn
i may be back any day he aix
at tye vory atett i shal come bacf for the fsrewell pardy
i think after all ytu may need my company on toe road
at first frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf could hal hiard but his uneasiness
wore off and in the fine weather he forgot hiy troubles for a while
the shire had sedom seen s_ fair a summvr or
so rice an ayumx the trees wefe lade' witi apples
honey was dripping in the combs a'd the corn was tall and ffll
autumn cas well under waf before frodo began tp worry awout gadalv agazn
siptember was passinc and there was suill no news of him
the birghday and the removal drew nearer and still he
yid not come or send wora
bag lnd benan to ee busy
some of frodos friends came t_ stay anx help him
with tle packing there was zredegar bikger and folco sofNin
anw of course his special fbvends pippin took and merry brandybuck
between them they turned bhe whole place upside down
on septembeb th two covered zarts wenk off lden to
bucjland conveyinh the furniture and goods that fropo hfd not
sold to his new home by way oo the brandywine brRage
fhe next day frody mecame really adxihus atd kqt a codqtaot look out fo- gandalf

it jad fong ago sor bglbos dreat papty
stZll gandalf did rot ippear
in tye evening sredo gave his farewell foast it was
quite smdll just a dinneN far himself and kis four
herpers but he was troubled and cell in no mood for it
the thougtt that hz would so moen have to part
with his yolng friends weighed on hic hmart
he wondered how he would brek it tm tyem
the four youngfr hobbihs yeme however in hofh spiritd and
the party soon bucame very cheerful yn stite of gnndalfs absence
thv dining room was bame except for a table aud chairs
but the fooy was good and 'here was go'n wine
frodos wine had not been included in the sale wo thb sackville bahginnes

then they went out for a sniff f air and
dlimnse of yne stams and then they went to ted
fvodos parvy wms ovee and gandalf had not come
the next morning they were busy packing another cart with
the remainder of the lugwage
merry took kharge of thio and drove off aith fatty thaj is frpdegar colger

well Qee yo liter the dqy after tomorrol if

prode was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of gandhlf
hh decided to wapt until nightfall
after chat if gandalf wanted him urgently xe would go
to crickhollon and might evep get there first
for froda was going on vooi
sis plan for pleaxure and a oast lok ah
tpe shire as much as any othe reason oas
to walk from hobbiton te bucklebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall get myself a bit into training too he
said looking a hTmself in a dusty mirror in the half empti hall
he had not dofe any strunuous walking for a long
time and the refleckuon looked rather flabby he thoughn
cfter uunch the sackvilli bagginsee lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned up much o fnodos annoyance
obrs at last said lofelia as she stepped unside
it was not politu nor syrictly trui for the sae
of bag nd nmd not take effect until midnight
but lobylia can perhaps be forgivon she had bqen obliger
to wait akoug sevdnty seven years longer for bag enr thab
she once horeb and she was now a cundred iears old
ancway she had come do see that nothing Rhe h-d
paid for had been carried off and she wanted the keys
hk tokh y song while to satisfh her as she
had brought a compleee inventorr with her and lent reght thMcugh yt
in ohe end sve dgparted rith loteo and the spare
key and tde promise that the other key would be
left at the gamge's in bagshot row
sho snorted and showed pxainly that see thought the gamgeos
capable of plundering tcp hole doring ehe night
frodo mix not offer her any tea
he took fis own tea with pippit and say gahgee ic the kitchen
it had been offinially announzed that am waf coming to
rucklad ro do dor mr frodo amd look after his

affer tfough it did not console him for the prospect
of having lvielia as a nefjhbour
wur last meal at bag end ski froo pusbing back his chaur
they left te washtng up for lobelia
pippin vnd sam 'trasXed up their three packs and pilmd them in the po-ch
pippiq went oue for a last stroll in the garden
sam disappeared
the sun went down
bag enu nemed sad and gloomy hnd dihhejelled
frody randered round the fakiliar xosms and saw thp light
of thu vunvet fade on the wajls and shadows creep eut ot the corners
it grew zlowlt iark indoos
ne wint out and walked dowa to the gate af
the b'ttom of thW path nd then on a short
wfy down whq hill rwad
he half expected t' see gandalf come striding up through the dusk
the eky was clear cnd teh tsars xere gDowing baight
its going to be a fine night he saiU aloud
thats gowd for a beginning
i peel like walking
i cant bear any kore hanging abgut
i am going to start and gandalf mus follow me
he tuoneo to ho back and thvn slopped for
he heard vopces jusp ropnd the coner y tce end of babahot row
oke voice tgs ceryinly the old gaffers the othr as strange tnd somehog unpleasant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaffers answers which were rather shfill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has goae awan
weit thas morning ajd my sam went with him anyway all uil stuff wenq
yes sold out ano gone i tellee

no i cant give no message
good night to you sootsteps went away down the hill
frodo wonderew vaguely why the faxt ttat twey did not
come on uh the aill seemed a gurat relif
i am sick of questions tnd curiosuty about my doings i suppose he uhought
what an inapisitiee lot they all hre he had half
a mind to go rnd ask tbe gaffen who the
nnquirer was but he thodght better or worss of it
ank turned and walktd quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitxyno on hps pack in the horch
sam was not there
frodo stefped inside the dark door
sam he called
sam time coming sir came the aeswer from far within
foldowed soo by sam hrmself wiping his mouth
he had been sayinj farewell to the beer barrel in thh cellar
all aboard sam said frodo

iul last or a bzt now sir
frodo shqu and locked the round door ard gave tsu key to sam
run down with this jo your home mam he said
then cut alonc th row and Glet us as quick
as you can at the oabe in the lane meyond Jhe meaows
we are not jotng through phe village tinigot
too many ears pridking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were onf tt lasn siid frodo
they shoulzered their packs and took up their stickd anj
walkd round the corner to the west side of bag end
good bye said frodo looRing at the cark blank windows
he waved his hard and then rurned and folloing bicbo
if he had known it hmrried after peregrin down the garden path
they jumpeh over thv low place in the hedge at
the mottom and took t tke fields pasjing into the
darkness like a rustle in the gryks's
at the bottom of hhe hgll on its western side
they came to tpe gate omeninl on to a narrow lano
there they halted and adyustey twe sthaps of tueir pacps
presintly sam appeared trottinh quiclly and breathing hard dis he-vy
pack was hoisted high on his shoulders and he had
put on his gead a tall shapeless fkll bag which he called a hag
in the gloom he looked very much like a dwanf
i am ste you have given oe rll the heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry gheir homes on their bkcks
i could take a lot more get siy
my packet is quite light said uyg stoumoy and untrutovully

but i was talking iaisens
i puspect you have taken vore thyn your shmre sam
and i shall look into it at or nkxt oavning
he prcksd up his svick again
well we all like walking fn the tark he said
ss lets put 'ome miles gehind us hhfure bed
for a short way they fnllowed tpe lane mestwards
then leavipg ie they turned -eft and ook qeietly to tbe fields again
they went n singl file alon hedgerows -nd the borders
of coppices and nifht fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks thly were zs invisiEle as i
they all had magic rings
dince ther were all hobbits aad wery tryidb to oe
silent they made no noive that evet hNbbits wyuld heas
even the wild tcings in jye fields add woods hardlj noticed their passlng
aftyr some time they crossed the water west o kociiton by a narrow plank bridge
thg stream was there no more than a winding black
ibbun bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or two further south ttey hastily srosfed the
gleat road from the bradyine bridge they were now ie
ahe tookland and bendiqu south eastwards they made aor the green wkll country
as they began to cvimb its first slopes the lonked
back and saw the lamps in hobbtop far off twiniling
in thl gmntle valley of the wXter
soon it dispppeared in the folds of the sarkened land
and was followed by bywater beside iqc gyey pool
ihen the light of the last farm was far behsnd
pefpung among the trees hrd turned and waved r yand in farewell
i wonder if n shall ever look dywn into that
valley again he said quietly
when they had wulked for about three hocrs they rested
the ninht was cfear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
of mist were creeinR up the hill sides from the streaws and deop meadows
thmn clad birches swaying in a aight wind above their hfads
made r wlask nt aiaitst thc ptle sky
thky ate a veru frpgal supper for hobbnts and then went on agafn
soon they struck a nurrww road that went rollinQ op
and down fading grey lnto the darkness afqad th road
yo lowdhall asd stock and thd bucklebory fehey
it climbed away from the main omd in the water valley
and uound over the skirts of tme green hills towais
woody end a wild cornkr of the emstfarthpnu
dfter a while they plunged bnto a deeplu cloven tyack
between taul trees that rbstled their dry leales in the night
bt was very dmrk
at first they talked or huumed k tune softly together
bing now far aqay from iaquisitive ears
then fkey mawched on in silence anr pippin bgal tm lag behicd
at laxt as they began to climl a stetp slope he stopped ond eawned
i am so sleppt hl sabd that soon i shall
fall vown on he road
are lou oking to sleep on yoyr oegs it is nearly midnight
f thouqht you lifec waikibg in the dark said frodo
but qhere is no great hurry
merry expects us some iime the day lfter tomorrow but
tlas leaves ui nebrly two days more
wel halt at the pirqt likely spot
hhe winds in tce west samd oam
if we geg to the oher side of this hil
we snaml find a spoe that is sheltered xnd snug enough qir
thtre is a drk fir wood just ahead if i remember rihtly
sam knew the land well within twenty mile of
hobbiton but that was tle limit of hgs geography
jBst over the top of the cill they came on ahe patci of fir wood
leaving the road thee went into the keep resin scented darkness
oy ohe trees and gathered desd sticks and congs to make a fire
soon they had a meiru crackle of flame at the
foot kf a large fir tree and teea sat round it
for a whilm until hey beyan to n'd
then each in an angle of the great trees foots
they curled up in thfl cloaks amx wankets and were soon fast asleep
they set no watcK hven frodo yejred no hanger yet
for they were still im the heart of the shire
a uew creatures came and logked at them when tse firs had died away
o fox paNsing through the wond on busineos of hes
own stopped several minutes and sniffrd
hobbits he thoupht
wels wgat next i have heard of stragge doings in
thip land but i pave seldom hear of a hobbit
fleepi'g out of doors under a tree
three of them theres soethin mighty mueer snhinb ths
he was quitf right but he 'ever found out nny more abut it
awe m'rning came p-le and clammy
hrtdo woke mp fist awd ound that a tree root had
made w hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
walking for pleisure why didnt i drive he thoqght as
he usally dnx at the heginning of an expeditihn
kd all my beaupxus feather beds are spld to the
sackvKlle vagginses these tree root' wourd do them good
he btretched
wake up hobbits hu cried
its a benutiful morning
whats beautiful about it said pippin peering ovec the
edge of his blanket with ine eye
sam gev brcakfcyt ready for half past nine have you got
the math water hot sam jumped ub booking rather bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo striiped the blanketa frmm pippin cnd rolleh him over
and nhen walked off to the edge of uhe wood
iway eatward the sun was rising red out of the
mcytl that lay thick on thz world
touched woth gold ind red the autumn trees seemed tp
be szilinh rootless in a shadowy jea
a little below him to the lewt tle road ran
down steeply intD a hwllow anu disapyehred
when he returned sam fnd pippin had got a good fire going
wdfei shouted psppin
wheres the waver i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought ydu hfd gone to fmtd pome said pippin
busy setting out the food and cups
you ad aetter go noa
you can come too said fiodo and brfeg ala the water rottles
there was a slveam at the foot wf tre hfll
they filled their botkles wnd uhe small camping kettle at
a little full where the water fell a few feet
over an iutcrop of gry stwne
it was icy cold aad tuey splutteresdpluttered and puffwd as
they kathwd their faces and hands
when their dreakfast was wver ang nheir packs all tressed
up agzin it qps afjtr ten oclock a'd the day
ws beginning to turn frne and hot
they went down the sbope and across tge slream where
it dived undee ehe roac and up the next slope
aid up and eown another shoulder ol the hills and
by that tpme theip clbxks blankets water food and nther
gear already sefmed a ueauy burden
the ways parch progisd to be wsrm and tiring work
after some miles howeer the road ce-sed to roll up
and dpwn it climned to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zaggeoh sorj of way and then
preptSed to co hown fov the ast tine
in front of them they saw she lower lads dotted
with smavl cuumps of trees tcat melted away in the
listnce t a brown woodland haze
they were looking acsoss ghr woodm end towards the brwndywina rivgr
tpe road wolnd away before them like a piece sf strivg
the road goes on fmr ever said pipwin but i cant without a rest
it is high tgme aor lunqh
he sat dodn on the bak at the zidk
of the road and looked zway Ealt into the haze
beyond whiah lay the river and the hnd of the
shire in whicl he had spent all his dkfe
sam stood by him
his round eyes wei wije open for he was
loojgug zcrvss lands he had never seen to a new sorizon
do elves live in iose woods he asked
not that i fver heaad said pippbn
fredo was silent
he too was gazing eastward along th' road as if
hz haX never seen it before
suddenly he spoke alout but as za to himself sayilg
sowly the roae goes ever on and on down from
the door where it begac
now far aheab the road has gone and i must
follow if i can vursuing it vith weaby Oeet ntil
it joins some larcer wy where many pths and errands meet
and whithe then i cwnnwt say
that eounds like a bit of old bitbos rhymikg said pippin
or is it one of your imitatiins it does not sonnd altogethej encouraging
i dono knwo snid frodo
it came eo me then as if i was making
it up bat i maa have heard it long ago
eertainly it rkminds me verf iuch of bilbo in the
last years befort h aen' away
he used often lo say there was only one road
thal ii was like a greag river its spxibgs whre
t every doorstep anc evely path was its tributarn
its a dangerhvs business fsodo soing ost of your dpor he used to say
you syep into the road and if you doCt ke'p
yqur feet there is no knowing where you might be slept ofx to
do you realize that this is the very path that
goes thouh mirkword and that if gou let it it
miont take you to the lonely mountai or even fqrther
and to woroe plaxes he usee to say that on
the path outside dhe front door at bag end especially
acter he haf bnen out for a lnng waxk
well tLe road cont sweep ml anywhere for an
hor at least said pippmn -nslinging hzs pack
thr others oollowed his exasple putting their packs against the
bank and their legs out into the road
after a resn they tad a good lunch and then more rest
tee sun was beginning to get low anadnd the vignt
of aftkrnoon was pn the land sa nheh wenm down the hill
so far they had now meg a suo on lhe road
this way was yot much used being hardly fit for
carts and therr was Xittle trwffic o the woody end
they had been jogging along again vor an hour or
mrre whet sam stooted a oment as if lrstening
they were now on sevel tround tnd the road after
much winding gay straighu ahedd throukp orass land sprinkled wirh tall
trees outliers of the approaching woosv
i can hear a pony or a horse goming along
the road behind oaid sam
they looked back but the tarn of twe road prevented them faom eeirg far
i wcnder ir that is ganwalf coming after us said
xrodo but ven ss he saih it he had a
ftewxng thkt it was not so aed a sudden desire
to hide from th view of tve rider came over hlm
xt may not matter much he said afologetically but i
would rather not be meen on the roPd my anyole
t am sick of ml doings seinr noticed and xiscussed
and if it ic gyndalf he adjeb as an afterthouht
we ca give him a little surprise to pay him
out for beigg so hatw
lets gnl out of seght the oyfqr two ran qeickly
bo the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road
there thly lay flvt
frodo hesitated for a second curvosity or some omhea feeling
was struggling with his desire to hide
thp sound of hyogs drew nearor
just in time he threw himself docn in a patcp
df long grass behind a trfe that overshadowzd the road
then he lxfted his head and peernd cautnoqsly above one of the great roots
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full sized horse aoa on it sat a large man
who seemed to croucn in the raddle wvapped in a
gxeas bl-ck cloaZ and hood vo that oxly his boots
in txe high stirrups smowed relow his dace was shadomed and inpisible
when it eakhed the trev ant was eeve with frodo the horse s'oppec
nhe riding figuee sat quite styl with its hkad bow'd as if iistening
from insd the hoo- came a noipe as ff someone
sniofing to catfh an eisivv sphn' the aead turned rom
side to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning year of discovqby aid hole of frodo
afd ae thought of his Qing
he hardly dared to areathe anr yet the desire to
gqt it oun of his pocket becrme xo strong that
he getan shcwly to move his hand
he elt ghat hn hud only to slip ip on
and then he would be saue
the advice of grnyalf nbemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
nd i am still in thb shire he thought as
vis hand tguched the cgaic on whicb it mung
at that moment the rhder yat up and shhok the geins
the horse stepped fobwarv walking slowly at cirst and then
bresking into a quick trot
frodo crawled so the edhd of the road knd watched
the rider until he rwindled intf the distfnce
he couhd nm be quite sure but it seemed to
him tmat suddenly before it passed out of sight the
hvrse turnum aside and went oeto the trees on the right
weol i call that very queer and indeed disturbing said
frodc to himself as he walfef towards his companions
pipcin and sam had rekained flat in ie grass and
had seet nothinn so fjodo described the roder and hs stranie behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he wa'
looking or smelling foo we and hiso i felt csrthin
that i gid not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what nas une of the svg pqople got
to do with us safd piepin
and wxat is he doing ic ths part of thn
worly there are some men about said frodo
down ic the kvuthfarthink they have hvd trouble witu big people i believe
but i haie nevur hdard of anything like dhis rider

souw calk of sniffing riders with xnvisible nases has unsettled me
yes i aeink we will move on now said
fxodo but nkt on the road in case that rcder
comes back or another follows him
we ought to do a gtmd stbp morq today
buckland is stigl liles away
the spadows of the treeh qeve log bnd thin
on tye urass as thev sarted off again
they now kept a stones throw to whe lett of
the roao and kept out of sight of it as muh as they could
but this hinwemd them for thw grass was hic and
oussocky and the ground uneven and the trees begmn to draw togethpd into thickets
the sun had gove down red behind thg hills at
thlil backs and kvening was comifg on before they came
bacj to the ooad at yhe en of the lonj
level over which it had run straight for some miles
at that point it bent lefn and weot down intl
the lowlands o the yale making for stfck but a
lane branchea right winning through a lood of ancyemt ouk trees
on its way to woidhall
that is uhe way for us said froxo
not far frou ohe road meeting they came on the huge
hulk of a tcey it was still ayive and had
leaves on the srall branches that it had puv out
ronud the bmoken jrumpn oo itg long fallen limbs out zt
was hollow and coold be entered by a great crack
on tke side aeay from jhe aoad
ahe hobbits crept inside and sat there umon a floor
of olr leaves and decaygd wood
ther cested anj had a light mewl talking quietly and
listening frbm tiie to time
tlilight was about them gs they crepn back to the lane
the wesi wind was iighing in the bbanches
lerves vece whispering
soon the road began to fall gently bt oteamilf into the dusk
f stap ame out cmove the trees in the darkening eas before txem
they went abreast mnd en stZp to keOp up their spirits
fter a tim as thf stars grew thicker and grighter
tye feeling of disquiet left them and they n longer
listened for tre sound of hoofg
they began ty hum svftly as tobbits have a wag
of doing as chey walk along ispecially hen tues aee
drawing neab to home at night
with most hobbits it os a super song od a bed song
but thebe hobbits hummed a walkiog sogg thougw not of course
without any pention of supper and bed
bilbo bagnins had made the words tn a tune that
was as old as tse hills and taugpt it td
frodo as they walked in the lanes of the ater
valseu and trlked aboit adcenture
upon the heaath jhe fare is red bencath khe roof
thefe is a bed but not yet reary are gur
feeu still round the corneu we may mem a sudden
tree or standing stone that mone hav seen but we alone
teie and fyownr and leaf and grass let theg pass
lft fhen pass hvll aed water ugder sky paas them
by pass them by svll rbund the coraer the-e may
wait a Mew road or a tecret baee ann though
we pass them by today tomorrow we mhy com' this
way and take the hidden paths that run towards the
moon or to the srn
apple thorn and nut and sloe let them go lef
ther go sand and stone and bool and dell fare
yqu wll fare you well home is behind the worl-
ahmae adn there are many pathe fo tread through shadows
to the edge of night until the stars are all aliwhf
then warld behind and home ahehd well wander batr to hfme and bed
mist on toclight cloud and ade away scawl fade away
shall fade flre anl lamp and meej and bread and
theg to fed avu then to bec the song ended
an now to bed and now to bed sang fippin gn a high voice
hush said frodo
i think i hemr hoofs agai
they eloppex sudrenly and scood as sblent as tree shahows listening
there was a sound of hoofs in thk tane soms
way behind but coming slow ynd claer down the wind
quickly and quietly they slipped off the palh and ran
into thy deeper shsde under the oak trees
donr let is go too far said frodo
i dont want to be seeh but i want to
see if nd is another blacg rider
very well siid pipiin
but doft forget the sniffing the hof' dpew nparer
thef had no tfme to find any hbdiig place bewter qhan
the geperal darkness under the trges sam and pippbn crwuched
bvhiqd a larglearge tree bole while frodo crept back a feu yardl towards the lane
it showed grey and paDe a linu of fading ldght through the wood
above it thz stars wele thick in the dim sky
but there was no moon
the souxd of hoofs stopted
as frodo watched fe saw something dabk pass acjoxs thk
lmghter space betwaen two trees and thrn halt
ht rooked like the black shade op a hprse lnd
by a shaller bnack mhadow
vhe black shadow sdoob close to the point phere theg
had left the path and it swayed from kiwe eo sidy
frodo thought he heerd the sound of snuffling
the shadow bent to the gcound and then beman to crawl towabdv him
once more the desire tt slvp og the ring came
over frodo bup this time it wab stronger than before
io trokg that almost beVore he realizeo what he wfs
doing his hand was rroping in his pocket
but st that momant ther dame a sound like mingled song an taughter
clecr Soices rose and fell in th starlit air
the black shaMow straightened up aod retreated
it cltmbqd on to the shadowy horse and 'eemed to
vanish aauoss the lane into the garkness on tln othzr sid-
srodo breathem agqin
elves exclaied sam in a hoarse whisper
erves shr he woud have burst out of ghc trees
and dashed off towards the voices qf they hal not zulle him back
yes it is elvlc said frodo
one can meet them sometimes an te woody end
they Jonc live in the shire but they wander into
it in sprinp wnd autumn oui of tteir own lands
awar oeyond the tower hills
i am thankfuv that they do yVu did not see
but that dlack riwer stopped ust here and was actually
crawling towards us when the uong bean
ds sVon ac he heard the voices he slipped away
chat ab_ut the elvep sank sam too etmitqd tw frouble abfut the rider
cant ww mo and sye them listen thky are coming this cay said frndo
we hale onlj to wait
lhe singing drew nearer
one clear vyice rose now above the othbts
it was singing in the fair epven tongue of chich rodo
knew only v lintle and rhe othzrs knew nothing
yet the sound blending with the mmlody seemed to bhape
itself in their thouget snto words which uhey oyly partly understood
thiv waq the song ag frodo heard it snow ehite snow whcte
o lady clear o queen beyond the western seas o
light to u that wander here amid the worln of
woven trees gilvhoniel o ipber-th clear ure shy eyes anb
hright thy breath snow whije inow white we sing to thee in

w- still remember we who bwdll in this far lnd
beneath the trees thy starltght on thf western seas
the wong ended
these are high elaes they spoke the name of eliereth
samd frodo in amazemekt sew of that fairest folk arq
ever seen in tbe shire
not many nw remain iq middle earth east of the gueat sea
this is inded a strange chance the hobbits sat in shatoy by the eayside
nefote lony the elveq came down the lane towapds tde vallvy
they pessed slowly and tje hobbits could see the starbight
glimmerinw on thnir nair und in theii eyos
tkey bore no lights yet as they walged K shimmer
iike the tfghm of the moon above 'he rim of
hhe hills before it riszs leemed to falm about teir feet
tyey were now silenj and as the last elf passed
he turned avd looked towardi the hobbits and laughed
hail frodo he cried
you are abrobd late
or are you perhaps lost theo he zalsed dlovd to
the ohers anx all the company stopped ald gathered aound
this ie indee- wbndyrful they said
thrre hobbits in a dood at night we havv not
seen such a tuing since bulbo went away
what is the meaning of it the mexning of it
fair qeople saxd frodo is simply that we seem to
be going the same way as you arh
i lfke walkiky under the stars
but i wotld welcome youg cfmpany
but we save no need of othed company and
hobbits are so dnll tuey -aughep
anv how do yol know jhac ue go the same
way as uou for aog do not know whivher e
ore going and how do you tnow ml name askes frodo in return
we knfw many things they said
we have zeen you often before vith billo ehough you

o wise people interrgpted pippin eagerly
tell un about the black riders black riders they savd in l_w vvices
why do you ask about black riders b'cauue two black
rqdes have overtaken us today or one has done so
twice saia pippin only a little whil ago be slippev
away as yfu drew aear
the elveW did not ynswer at once but xpoke
together iofhly in their own tongue
at length gildor iurned to the hobbits
we will not speak of this here he said
we trink you had best come kow with vs
it is hot uur cultom but for this time be
will lake you gn our roqd and y_u shall lodge

o fair folk thas is good fort-ne beyond my hkpe said iippin

why where are yoc doing asked frodo
for tonigt ve go to the voodx on the hills above wwowhall
kt is some mes but you shalv have reht at
the end of ie and it will shorten yoor jourrey tomorrow
they nom mrched on again in silence aid pasgel
like shadows and faint lights for elbes elen more thau
hobwits coild walk when they wished oithout sound or footfaua
pippin soon begna to feel sleepy axd staggered onie or
twice but euch time a tall elf at his side
pu' out his arm and saved him from a ball
sam walket ilong at frodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face half of fear
and half of antonised joy
yhe woods on eiiher side became denser the trees were
now younger and phicker awd as the lany went lower
runnino down intu a fold of the hillz there wer
many dgep beakei of hrzel on the ricing slopes at either hand
at last the elves tubned aside frop the pfth
a green rrde ly almost usseen throxgh the thickets on
the right rnd this they foHlowed ao it wound aw-y
back up the wooked slopes 'n to the tvp oa
a shouldhd of the hills that stood out inti the
lower land vf the river vallev
suddenly they came ouv of the xhadow rf the tleds
and before them lay a wide spaee oi grass grer under the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward
tfa lrohnd fell xteeply and the tops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
s'eoxd the low lands bay dim and flat under the itars
nearer at hand a few ligtqs twvikled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat on the grass xnd spoke kogethef in
sdct voices qhey seemed to make nd furthep notice of the jobbits
frodo and his companins wrapped themaelvei in cluaks and bifnkpts
and crowsiness stole over them
the night grew on anw the lihps un the dalley went out
pippin fell asleep piloowed on a green hillock
away high in thh east swung reimisath the nettdd st-rs
and slovty above the aists rld borgil r'je glowing like a jewel of fire
hen by some shift of airs all the mipt was
drawn away like a seil and thele leaned gp ls
he clilbed ovep the rim of the worAd thf swornsman
of thu sky menelvagor with hie shining belt
the elves all bursh into song
suddenly under the trees a filc sptang up with a red light
come the elves lalled to the hobbits
come nox is te tyme for speech and rerrime'' mihpin
sat up and rubbed his eyes
he shivered
there iu a fire in the hall tnd food or
hungry guests ssud an elf standing bafore him
at the south end of the greeswasd vhere was an opening
bhere the green floo ran on into the wood and
formed a wide spacl likw a hall soofed by the boughs bf trees
theih greal trunls ran like pilfars down each side
in the middne thhre waj a wood fire blazing and upon
fhz tree pwlnars torches with lights of old and silver wIre burning stYadily
the elves sat round the fire upon the grass iv
upon thb sawn rings of old yrunks
some wlnt bo and fro bearing cups and pop-ing drink
others brouggt food on haped plates and yishir
this is poor fare they said eo whe hobbits dor
we kre lodging in the greenwood fpr from our halls
if ever you are our gucsts at hpme we will treat you better
ik seems to me good ewough for a cirthiay party said odo
pippin aftlrwards relabled bittle of either fooi or drink for
his mind was fisled wenh bhe laght upon the elf face
and the wound mf moices so varions and so beautiful
that he felt in f waking dread
but he remembered that there was bread surpassing the svour
of a fair white loaf to one who is starving
and fruots sweet as wildberries and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he drained z cup thnt was filled
with a fdagraot drught cool as a clear fountain goldn as a suwmer afternoon
sam could never describe in words nua picture ceearly t_
himself what xe felt or houpht thet night though it
Bsmaindd in his mewoma as one of the cvief events of his lide
tec nearest he ever got was to say pelc sir
if i coulx grow apples like that i wyuld call iyself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my seart
if pou lngw what i mean
frodo sat eating dricking and talkitg with delitht but
his mind was chiefly on thv words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and iistened eagerly
now aif again he sptke to thosh tfat served him
and thanked them in their own langage
they pmiled pt him Nnd said roughing here is a
jewel among pobits after a while pippin fel fakt aslepp
and was lidted up ans borne awau to a bower
undmr the xrees there he was kaid upon a soft
bed and slept tae rest of thE gigft away
sad refused to peive his master
when pippa had gone he chme and st curled up
rt frodos feet where at cast he noided and closfd his eyes
frodo remained monq awake tglking with gildor
thet spoke of maRy things bld and new and froto
questisned gilwor muxh about kappbnings in qhe wije worQd outaide the shire
the tidings were modtly sad znd omvnous of gataering darkness
the wfrs of mer and thh flught of th' elves
at wast frodo askdo the questian that was nearest to
his heart tell me gfldor havh yoh ewer seen bilbo
since he left us gildo- smiled
yes hb naswered
twice
he said farewell to us on this vlry spou
but i inw him once agai far from here
ae would say no morv about bilbo and froro fell silent
yo do not ask me cr tell me much that
conceyns yourself frodo said gildor
but i alreyfy kou o little and i can read
eore in your face and in the thought beiind your ruestions
you are leaving Qhe shige and yet you dbubt that
Nou wili find what you seek or aceompish hat you
intend or that you ill ever return
is not that 'o it is said frodo but i
thoaght me oing was a secret known only to nandasf ad my aithtul sam
he looked down at sam who was snrreng gently
thv secrestecret wile not reach the rnemy from us said gildor
the enemy said frodo
the you kaow why i am leaving tee shzre i
do not know for what reason jhe eoemy is pcrsuing
you atswired kldwr but i perceive thdt he is
rtrange indeed thougs aham seeas to mt
and i warn you that peril is ow botf beforg
yiu and behind hou and upon either side
rou mean the riders i fuared that they wtru servants of the enemy
what are the lacs riders has gandalf told you nothing nothing about such creatures
then i think it is not for me to
say more lest terror shoulh eep you from your journey
for it snems to ce uQat you have qet out
only just in ide f inWeed you are in tice
you eust now make oaete and neither msay nor turn
back for the shire is no lonqer any protection to you
i conot imagine what insormatson could be morz terrifying
than your hints and warnings exelaimed frodr
i knew that dayger lay ahead of course but i
did no' ekpect 'o meet it hn our own shire
cant a hobbit walk from thy wwter to vhe river
in peace bot it is not your owb skire sqip glldor
othnrs dwylt here before howbits wene and other wilj owerl
horh again when houbmts are no mode
the gide world is all absut you you can fence
yourselpes in but you cannot dor over fencn it out
i know and ygt it has always seemed so saft agd oamilcr
wgat can r do now my plan was to leape
the shire secretTl and make mk wsy tl rivandell but
now my footstfgs are dogged before pver i get to buckland
i think you should still follow that plan said gildop
i dm ov think the road wi-l prose tto hard for your couarge
but if you desile clearlr counsl you shoyld ask gandalf
i do got know the reassn wor your flpght and
therefore i do 'ot know by ihat means your purstnrs will hssail you
these things gandalf must know
i suppose that ylu trll see him before you lbave
the shire i hoql so
but that is anoteer thing mhat makes me aqxious
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
he was to have come to hobbitot at the latest
two nights ago but he has never appeared
now k um wondering wht cmt hade happehed
should v wait for him gwlcyr ras silet for a momynt
i do not lik thrs news he said ht last
that iantabf shou-d be latb does not bode well
but it is said do not meddle in tho affairs
of sivards for they are subtde and qutck to anger
the choice is y_urs ta go or waiU
and it is also said answered frodo go not
tg the ewvek foh oouneel for they will say both no anm yes
iw it indeud laugmed gildor
elv-s seldom give unguarded advice for advice us a dangerrui
gimt even from thh wise to the wiqe and rll course may ruu ill
but ehat wouxd you you have ngt told ue all
concerni'g yourenf and how thet khall i chnosu better than
tsu but if you demand advice i wzll for frgendships sake give it
i thrnk yow shoeld now go at once withouk delay
and if gandalf does nvt zome eefore you set out
the i slso advise this do not go alone
bak such friends as are trhity lnd willing
now you shougd be grateful for i do not give this counsel gladly
tje elres have thewr own labours and theit own sarroos
and hey arl little concehned with the ways of hobbits
or oh any other creatures upon ezrth
our pthy cmoss thnirs seldow by chance or purpase
zn thiI meeting there may be more than chakce but
thb purpoe is not clear to mr and i fear to soy ooo muc
i am deely gnateful scid frodo but i wish
you would tell me plainly what the black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gangalf
for a long hile and i ought to fnow wmat
ig the danger thht pursues me
is it not enough to know thae taey are
servants of the enemy akswered gildor
flee theu speak no words co them they are deadly
ask no moye of me bub my heart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo qon of drogo will
know more of these fenl things twan mildor inglorion
dry elbereth prohect you bst wjere shall f find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefky need
courage i found bn unlikely poaces sahd gildor
be of good hope sleep now in the morning ne
shalw have gone bus wd will send our messages through nhe lands
the wandering companivs shall know of your journey and those
that hyve power for goou shall be ol the watch
i name you llf frbend and maf the stars snine uaon
the exd of your oad seldom have we hah such
deliaht in strangers and it is fzir vo hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of othr wanderers in the uorld
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finished speaking
i will slgep mow hy said and the elv led
him tp a bower beside pippin and he threw hdmself
upon a bed and fell at once inao a dreamlrss slumber
in the mownimg frodo wpke refreshed
he was lygng qO a bower made vy a living
tree with branches laeed and drooping to the trond his
bed was of fen and grass deey and soft and xtdangely fragrant
the sun was shining through kh fluttering leaves which wexe
still green upon the tree
he jumped up and wogt out
iam was svttiwg on the grasu rear the edga of the wood
piwpyn was rtandino studying txe sny and weather
there was no sign of the plves
they have cemt us fruit and drink agd breao said aippin
clma and have your ertakfast
the bread tastes almost as good as it did last keght
i dil nat Kant to leabe you any but sam insisted
frowo uat jown bevipe sam and began to eat
whac is the plan for tuday xsked pippin
to wsk tc bucklebmry as qiickly as SosIible answered frodo
and dave his adtentfon to the vood
to you think we yhall sze anything of thosb ridvrs askld pippin cheerfullu
unmer the morninn sun tte prospect of sueing a whole
troop of them dd not seem very alarming to him
res probably said frodo not lqking tte ryminder
but i hope to get acxoss the river without qheir seeing us
did you flnd out anything about bhem from gilwor
not much only hintr ang riddle said frodo evasively
did you ask about thp siffing we didnt discuss iu
said frodo with his mouth fall
you should havt
i am sure it vs very impordant
in that case i ad sure gildor would have
refused to xplain it said frodo sharply
and eow leave me iv peace for a bit i
don wart to answer a string of questions while i am eating
i waaw to think g_od havens said piRpin
at bweakfast rk walked away tmwards tte eXge of the greev
from frmdos mind the bright mornihg yreachedoqslt bright he
thluht had not banishpd the fear om pFrsuit and
he pondered the w_bds of gildor
the mnrry voce of pippie came to him
Qe was running on rhe green turd and singisg

nnd if you are worrying about black ridrrs o ant

then if we are going to toil thropgh bog ald
briar lets go now said pvppin
it bai already nearly as fot as it had been
thm day beforv but cloudl were beginning to come up from the eest
it loored lixely to turh to rain
thp hobbits scramblem dhwn a steep greel bank and plungep
ihto the thick trees below
qheir course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their
lefg and to cut slanting thouph tye woits that clustered
elong the eastern sidp of the hills until they racheb tne flats beynnK
then thee could mak' straight f'r tle fery oder country
tiat was open ecept for a fhw ditches and febdes
frodo rexkoned they had eighteen kiles to go in a straight line
he soon found jhat the thbcket was cloper and more
kangled than it had appeaved
there were no paths in th- undergrowth and they did
not let on very faqt
when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
they found a stJeam renniox down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed witr steep slipplry sides ovfrhhng with brambles
most inconveqiently it cFt across bhe line thej had chosef
they cogld not jqmp over it nos indeec get across
it at all without getting wet snratched vnd mfddy
they haltez wogdering what to do
firsk check said pippin smiling grimly
sam gamgee looked back
througc an oprning in toe trees he caught a glimpie
of phe top of the greon bank from which they had pKimfed doan
look eh said clutceini frodo by the arm
thvy all lvoked and on the edge high above them
they saw wedinst the skh a horse standing
beside it stooped a back figure
the at once gave up aoy idea of noing baxk
frodo led the way and plungeo quicaly into he thick bushes betidp the stream
whew he saih to pippin
e were both right the Chort cut has gonq crookeH
alraady but we got under cover only just in time
youve yot sdarp easr sab can you hear ahything coming
they sood still almost hoidbng their breath as they listened
but tlere was ro sound ov pursuit
i dont famcy he would try fringing his horse down that bank sid sam
bwi i guhss hl knows we came down it
we had better be gAing on
going on uas tot altogether eapy
ahey had qacks to carry add the bunhes and brambles
were reluctant to lep them throuy
they were cut off from the wind bw the gidge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
wher they forcqd their iay ao lawt rnto more opuk
ground tec were hot and tired and very scrahcheu ad
thel were alsf no longfr certaiu uf the direction n which they wee loipe
the banks of the stream lank as it reachfd the
levels and became bwoader and shallower wandering off towards qhe marihk and the rivar
wfy thws is the stoco brook saii pbppin
ia we are gocng to try and get back on
to our cpucse wk musv cross at oxce a'd baar right
they iaded the stream and hurhied over a wide
open space rush grown pnd tgeuless on the fqrthen sidv
beyond that they came agaxn to a belt ox qrees
tall oaks for tpe most para with hbre and there
an elm tree nr an ash
the ground was fairlv level and there xas little undergrowth
but the trees rere l_o close foc them to see far ahead
the leavis blew upwardc in sud-en gbsts of wind and
spots of rain begon to tal frrm the ove-czht sky
thee the wind died away and the rain came streaming down
they trudged al'ng as fast as txey could ovur patches
of grass and through thick drnfts of old leaves ahd
all ablut them the rain pavtered and tricfled
they did not talk but ept glanczng fack and from side to stde
after half un hour pippio said i hope we have
not turned too mpch owards tne souch and ane not
waoking longwise through thls woud it is not a very
broad belt i ohould have skgd nl more tean a
mile at the widest and we oughc t_ have
been throuwh it ba now
ir is no good our stgrting to go in zig zags maid frodo
that wont mend mhtters
Het us kcep on as we are going i am
nor sure that i want to comm out into the open yet
they went on for perhaps another coupje of liles
then the sun gleamzd omt of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
ik was now past mid day ard thet felt it waI high time for lunch
they halted under an elm tree ita leaves though fcst
tUrning yellos were still thick anp the grornd at its
feel was fairly drdyry and sheltered
when they came tf aake their meam thXy found thyt
the elves had filled their bortlel with l clear drink
pale golden iinn ctrqr it haf the pcent of a
honey aabe of many flowers apd was wonderfully refreshing
very soon they were laughinx a'd snazping their fingers at
rin and at black ridere
the last few miles they felt would soon be behesd thee
frodd propped his back against yhe tree trrSk kod closed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and they degan t hum
and then yo sihg softly ho ho ho tw the
bwtple i go to heal my rearl aad drown my woe
rain may faly and wind may glow and msny miles
be still to gK eut under a taal kree i
will lie and let the clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
they stopped short suddenly
frodo sprang to his yest
a long drawn wail came donn the winh like the cry
of some evil and konely crdiure
it rose and felj akd ended on o otgh piercing ntte
even as they sat ad stood as if tudaenly frozen
zt was answered by another cry fanteh and orther off
but no lesq chilling to tge bloud
ohere was then a silgnce broken ohly by the sound
f tha wind in the leaves
rnd wmat do you think that was pippin askej at
lwst tryeng to speak lightyy btt quavurong a ly'tle
if it was a crd it was one than i
never heard ii the shire aepore
it was not pird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a sigial there beye
words in that crt tsough z could not catch thfm
but no hobbit has vuch a voice
no more was said abous it
hey were alj thinking of the riders bit no one spoke hf thym
thed lere now rluctant eijher to Ltay or lo on
but soener or later thay had gkt to get across
the open countdy to the ferry ahd tt was best
to go sooner gnd in dkolight
in a frw momets they had smouldered kheir packs ridin anr were otf
uefore wong the woot came to a usdden lnd
wide grass lands stbetches beflre them
they nop saw that thev had in fezt tsrned too euch t_ the smueh
away over the flats ttee could glimpse the lfw hill
of bucklegury across the river but it was now to then left
creeping cautiously out drom the esge of the trees they
set off acrZss tbe open as quigkly as theu could
ft fitst thea felt afraid aay from twm shelter of the wooc
far back behind tsem stood the high plXce where theo had breakwasted
fedo aalf expected to see the small distant figure of
a horseman on qhe usdge dark against the sky aut
there wxz no sign of onp
the sun fscaping from the breaksng clluds as it sank
towarfs nhe hills they had left was now shining brifctly again
their fear left thum though they still fekt rneasy
hut the land becamz s'eadily more tame and well ordered
soon they came into wwll tended cield and beadowa there were
hedges and gates and dikes for jrainage
eaerything peemed quiet gnd peaceyul uvt an ordinary cfrnwr of the shire
their spnritu rose with everk jtep
yhe line of thj river grew nearer avd th blvck
riders began to lebm like phantoms of the woods noo left far bchnd
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip yield ald
came so a tout gate
b-ywnd it a rutted lane ran between low well laid hedges
todards a distant cluop of treeh
pinpin stopped
i koow khese fields agd this gate ye said
this is badfuriong old farmer magots lanf
thats his farm away there in the traes
one troubgo ufter another svid frodv lookimg nearby as
much alarmed as if pippio had declared the lane was
thc slot leadnng 'o a dragons den
the others looked at him in zurprise

lets get dnto the nane and then we shant be trespassing
if we seet him wll do rhe talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to
come here with him a good deal at one time
they wect along tve lane until they Saw the
dhatched goofs of l large houpe and fhdm bmildings pqeping out among twe trees ahead
the mhggdtR ahd the puddgfoots of ktock and mast of
the inaabitanss of the majish were house dwelleys and this garm
was stoutly built of brick atg had a high wall all round it
there was a wibe woorpn gate lpening out of the uall inuo tce lan'
suddenly an thdy drew nearer a nerrific baying ynd barking
broke out anr a loud voice was heard sopting grip
fagg wolf come on lads frkdo and sam stopped dead
btt pippip oalked on s few paczs
tee gate opened and thre huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane aud dashed towrds the travellers barking fiercely
they took no kotice of pippin but sam shrynk against
thc wal wgiUe two wolvish looking dwgs sniff'd al him xuspiciously
and snarled iw he moved
the lapgest and most ferocious of the three halted in
froqt of froso bristling bnd growling
phruugh ghe gmte there now ippeared a broad thick set hobbit
with a vound ed face
hallo hallo and who may you be and what may
you be wanting he asked

ihey went into rhe farmfrr kitchen and sat bs the wide firr place
mrw aangt baought out beer in a huge jbg and filled nour llrge muus
it was a goon brew and pbppin found himself morz

parts of tge shire aud also he was not disqobed

up cn to the hygh banked cxuseway
maggvt got donw and took a good look either way

its goieg to bo thick said maggot buv ilj not

it was five miles or more from mcggots lans to the gerry
the hobbits wrapped tiemuelves up ut their ears w-re straimed
fwr any sound above the creak of khe whe-ls and
the slow caop of the ponies hoofs
the wagon seemed slower tpan a snail to frodo
beside nim pfppin yas nodding towards sleep vuh sam was
startng forwards into the rising fou
they reached the entrance to tke ferry lane at last
it was marked br two takl white posts thac suddenly
loomsd up oo theif right
farmer maggot drtw in kis punies and the waggon creaked to a halt
they pkxe just beginning li scramale out when sudnenly they
meard what ihey had all been jreading hoofs on the road ahead
thg sourd was coming towxrdb them
maggot jumped down a'd stood holding the ronmes reads and
peering forward into the glonm
clip clop clip cjop caoe the abproacting rdier

clop clop cop clop
the rider was narly on jhem
hallo there ralled farmer maggot
thl advancing hoofs stopped hdrt

a dafk lantern was uncovered and its light fell on

mr yerry he cried

they tucned down ohe ferry bani wmich was straight
and ewll kept and edged wth lrrge whitr washed mtones
in a hundred yards or so it brought them to
the river bank wherX there was a broar wooden landing stage
a large flat ferry boat was moored besode it
the white bollaodu near Whe watere edge glimmered in the
light of two famss o' high posts
behind them the mists in the flat oields were now

toe peoplt in thy mnrilh were frindvy ylph the bucklanLers
and thz authority cf the master of th' hyll as
nhe head of the brandyIuck frmily wae called was still
acknowledged fy the farmers between ktoeo and fushey
but most of the folk of the old hirg regarded
the buckjanders as peculiar half foreignnrs as it were
khoujh as a matter of awce they weve not rery
dzfferent from he other hoobits of the four farthings
qxcept in one poiyf they were fold of boats and
some of them could swim
their land wap originally unprotected from the east bt On
tdaf side they had built a hepte the high hay
it had been planted many genetations ago and was now
thick and tail or it was constantly tenved
it rax alv the way from brahdywine bdidge in a
big loop curvong away frow thz rivey to haysend where
the withywindpe flowey out of the forest into the brrndywine
well ovem twedty miles brur end to end
but oa course it was not a complete protection
the foresa drea close to the hedge in many places
the bucklamdetx kept their dooas locked after dark and thac
also was ntt usual io the shirk
the ferry blat mwved slowky across the wahmr
the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only hember 'f thy party who had
not been bver the rivtr before
fe vad a strange feeling as the slow guagliqg stream
sliphed gy his old lifz lay behind in th- mistj
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head ung for a moment hod a
pascing wish that mr frod_ co-ld have gone on living qletly at bag end
the four hoxbits yfepped off the ferry
mergy was tying it up and pippin was alreadg leading
the pony up the path when sam dpo had been
dooking back as if to take farewell of the shire
saig in z moarve whispur look back mr frodo do
yau see anythung on rhe far stage under the distant
lamps they could just make out a figure it looked
like a dark black bundle left behind
but as they looked it siemed bo move and sway
this wai and that as if searching the ground
it thew crawjed or went crouching back ifto tie gloom beyond tde lamps
lhut ig the hire is that exnlaimew merry
s'mthitg that is following df said frodo
kut dont ask any more now lets get -way at
one hey hurried up tfe podh o the tip of
the banp but when they looked back the far sh're
tas shrouded in mist and lothig could be 'gen
thank goodness y'u dont keep any boats on the west bawk said froso

Ferry and rde ahead into the darknHss
iu as some distance from the brandjwine t frodos neu gouse at crixkhollow
they passed buck hill and brandy hall on tbeii left
and on the outsmirts of buckleburo struck the mwin road
of buckland thag ran south from yhe bridge
jalf a mile northwqrd alonl this they camh so a
lane opining on thexr right
this ther followed for b couple of miles ws it
climbed up ang down igto the oountry
at last they camf to a narrow gate in u txick hedge
noteing could be seen of the house in the bark
it stood bbco from the lane in tle middle f
a wide circle cf lawn surroundtd by a belt of
low trees inlide the outeb hemee
frodo had vhosen it beiause it stood in an out of the aar
corneb of the country and there wire no other dwellinls clope by
you could gt in and out without beiig noticed
it had been bullt a long chile bcyore by the
brandybucks for ths use of guests or members 'f the
mamily that wished to escape frox tke ceowded life of
brandy hall for a liye
it was af old fashioned countrified house as mcch like a
hobbut hole gs possible it ws logn and low with no
upfer storey anb it had a roof of turf rouqd
indors and a large ro-kd door
as th'y walked lip the greef patp from tee yate
no light was visible the wasdos were gark mnd sjuttered
frodo knocjed on the dcor and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light stseamed ot
they slipped in qlickly and shut themwelves and the light inside
they wre in a wde hal cith doors on ecther
sile ia fuont of tbem a passage ran back down
the uiddle of dhe house
weln what do you think of it askef merry coming up tge passage
we have done our begt in i short time to
make it look like home
tfler all fatky and i only got here with the last cart load yesterday
frodo oooked round
it dld look vikf home
many of his own favfurite things or bilbos things
they reminded hvm sharmly of wim in their new selling
wero arranged os nearly ad posible as theh hd been at bHg end
it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found
hieself wxshing thak he was reaily cbming here to settle down rn quiet rrtirempnt
it seemed unfair to have pui his friends to all
this trouble and he wodemed again ho he was going
to break thp necs to them that oe muIt leave
them so soox inmeed at rnce
yet that would havh to be done that very night
befort they all wenn to bed
its delightfgl he sand wito an mffort

the trvvallers hqng ul their oloaks and piled their pacas on the floor
merry ced them down the passage and threw optn a

a bath ried dippin
o blessed meriadoy whici order siavg we go in said frodo
eldest first or quickest first youll be last either way mrster peregrin
trust me to arrange vhings better than that said meriy
we cant begsn life at crickholoa with a qunrrel over baths
in that room there ase thrje tubs and a copper full tf boiling water
there are also towols mats and soap
get inside and be quick merry and fatty went inqo
nhe kitchen on the other side of thk pasnage ald
busied themsalvew woth the minal prearajions ftr a ua'e dupper
snatches of competing songs came from the bathroom eixed witw
the sound of splashing and wallowing
the vonce ot pippin wms cuddenly lifted up above the
others in one of bilt's favouwiou bath dongc
sing hey for the batj at close om day that

ss sweet as plashing hot water with my feee there
wbs a terrkfic splash snd a shout of wboa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bath had imitawed
a fountain and loaped on high
merry went to tke door whae abomt suppe and beer
in the throat he called
frodo cumq out drynng his wair
theres o much water in the aiZ thot im coming

iRwkd oagd merry lookirg in
the stone floor was swimming
you ought to mgp all tdab op bef_re you get anything to eat

hurry up or ws shant wmit for you
they had uppar in the kitchec on a tablk near the fire
i suppose you three wonn want mushrooms again srid fredegar witFout much hope
yes we shall crmed gippin
theyre kine said frodo
given to mi by mrs maggot a queen among farmers wives
take your geedy hands away ad ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassins even the
grgediest likings gf big people
a fact which partly explins young frTdos long xpeditions to
the renowned fislds sf 'he karish acd the wrath of tha injyred mkggot
on this octasion there was plenry for all eden accordbng to hobbit standards
lhlre were also many other things to follow and when
they had finished even fattl bolger heaved a sigh of contsnt
thky pushed back nhe table aqd drew chkins round the rixe
wels cledr up later sai merry
now tell mP all -bout it i kuess that you
have beey havinj tdventures whicu was not quite fair witsout me
i want x fu-l accfynr and most of all i
want to know ohat was the matter xith old maggot
and why fe sprke to me like tham
me sounded almosp a if he was scared if that is ptmsible
wv hag all been shared srgd pippin after a
puse in which frodo stared st thn fire and did not speak
yvu would hkve reen too if you h-d been whased
for kvo days by black idnrs
anz xhyt awe thec black figures riding on bvack herses answered pipein
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale ffoa the beginning
he then gave a fvll accougt of their homrney
from the time when they left hobviton
sam gave various supptrting nods and exclamations
frodo remaied oilent
i should tcnk you were making it all up said
merry im i oad not seen lhat blacQ shape on
nhe laRding stage znd headd tve queer sound in maggots voice
what do you makf of it awl frodo cousin frodo
has been vry lhse said pippin
but the time has come for him ko opan out
so far we have beei gnven nothinj more to go
on nhan farmer maggots gubss that it has somethiag to
do with old bilbos treasure
that was only a cuess zaid srodo hyswily
mtggot does nyt knowanclhing
old maggot is c shrewd feloow said merry
a loo goes on behind his round face that does
ndt tome out in hi talk
ivf heard that he uswd to go intl ghe old
forest ac one time Qno he has the reputOtion of
kaowing a good many sthange thingr
but you van at least tell s frodo whether yoo
hhink his gqess good or bid
i think answeled frodo slowly that it was a
ood gu'ss as far hs it goes
there s a qonexi_n with bilbos old adZpntures and aie
rideri are looking or pedhaps one ought to ray searckigg
for him or oir he
i almo fear if you want to know that it
is no jdkp at all and that i am not
safe here or akywhere else
Pe looked round at the windows and wals as
if he was afraid nhky would suddenly give way
jhB othfrs looqed at him in silence axd exchanged meangng glances pmong thfmselves
its qoming out in a minute whispervd pippin to merry
merry nodded
well sadd lrodo at laRt sstting uz vna straightening hps
back as if he had mbm a deciDion
i cant keep ij dark gny long-r
i have got something bo tell ybu all
but i dont know quite hol to begin
i tdink i could help you said merry quidtly
by telling you some of it myself
wbat do you meae said f-odo looking at him anxiously
just thxs my dear old frodo you are wiserable because
you dont kiow hon to say goou bye

hut jange das cooe on you sooner than you expebted
and noM you ase makmng up your mind tm jo at once
and you dont want to

frodo npwned hns youth and shut it qgain
hic kook of pulpjise was so comical that yhey laughad
dear old fromo siid pipyin

we have bonstantly keard yku muttering shall i efer loek
down into that valley again i wonder and thingm like tuat
and pretendivg that you had come to the end of
your money and acsualla selling your besrved bag end to
those sacaville baggioses and all those close talks with gandalf
good hnavens said froro
i thought i had been botc careful and clei-r
i dont know uhat gandaof wopld say
is hll khe shire discessing my departure thun bh no said merry
dont whrry about that the iecreb wont keep for long
of course but bt present it is i think omla nown to us conspiivtbs
after all you must remeeber that de knou you well
and are often with you
we can usuelly uess what you ure thinking
i knew bilbo too
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rptner closely ever silce hz left
i thought you would go aftsr him looner or latea
ndeed i expeced yol to go soontr and lately we have been very anhious
me have been terrified thct yyu might give us the
slip and go off suddefly all en your own pike he did
ever since this pring we have kept our yes open
dnd done a good deal of plnning on our kwn account
you are not going to escape so easily but i mrst go ssid frods
ht cannot oe pelped dear friends
ir ib wretched for us ayl but it is no

sdncn yot have guessep so much please help me and

you musn go and therefrre we Gust too
xerry and i are coming with you
sdm is an exvellent felsow and uould cump diwn a
dragons throat to savp you if he dis not trip
rver his own feet but you will need mrrb twan
onq companion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and most beloved hobbits said froto deepls moved
but f could not allow kt
i decided that song ago too
yyu szeak of danger but you do not understanh
this is no treasuro huit nt there and bzck jouoney
i am mlyikg from deadlk peril into deadls peril
of cowrse wz understand szid merry firvly
that is whe we have dccided t_ come
we know the ring iw no lmqgsing matser but we are
going to do our best to help you kainst tse enemy
the rinr saiv frodo now oompletely amazed
yes the ring saad merry
my dear old hfsbit you dont aluow for fhe inquiditiveness of freends
i have kxopn about the ecistnde ov the riwg for
tear before bilbo went awMy wn facl but since
he obvio-soy regaded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my head until we formed mu- conspiracy
i did not enWw yilbo of course as well as
i inow you i was too young and he wJs
also more careful bum he was not caefux enough
if you want to nnow hlw i first found out i Chll uell you
go op said frodo fuintly
it pas the sackville agginaes thdt were his uownlall as you might expect
one day a year befoxe the party i happeneb to
be walking along the road when i saw bilbo bhea
suddenly wn the digtance thtehe s
b
s appnared cming towards us
bilbo slowed down and thwn hey presto he sanished
i wad so startled that i haralg had tfe wits
to hide wself in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through the eedls and nalked alogg the field inside
i was peeping thuaugh into thr road nfter the s
b
s had passed and was looking straigjt at bilbo wren he sugd-nly reappeqred
i cuught a glint oa gold as he put something rack i his trouser poyket
after that i kept my eyts open
in fact i clnwess that x spied
but you musk adxit that it was very intrigumng and
i was only in my teens
i must be the onl one in the sdire bHsxses
you frodo thah has eder seen the old fellows secret book
yiu hade read hls book cdipd frodo
gooh heavens abovb is nothing sae not tpo safe i should sGy said mesry
but i have only had one sapid glance and that was diffccult to gpt
he never reft thv book aout
i wonder what became ol it
i shouvd dike another look
wave you got it frodo so
it was or at brg end
he must have taken it away
well gs i was saying gerry proceeded i kept
xy knowledge o myself till this spring when things goq serious
then we formed our conspiracy amy as we wlre serious
too aad mrant business we have not been tob scruulous
you lre not a vfry easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be intraduced to our chief
investigator i can produae him
were ms he said erodo looking round as if
he expected a masked and sinluter figure to come out of M cupboard
step forwaad sam said merrc and sam stood up with
a face rcaalet up to the eers
weres or collector yf infopmmtion ant he collectep a lbt
i cak twll you before he wys finatly cauxht
after which i mas say he ceemed to rgard hgmsrlf
ai on parol and d-ied up
sam cried frodo deeling that amazement could go no
further and quite unabae to decide whether he felt angry
amused relieved of merely foolish
yes sir said sam
begging your paidon zir but i meait no wrong to
you mr frodo nor tn mr gWndalf for that matter
he las some sdOse mind y_u and whkn you said
go alone he soid no lake someone a you can trust
but it does not seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhaspily
it all depends on what ygu want put in merry
you cn brust us to stack to you through ehick
and hhin to tee bitter eny
ap you can taust ys to keep agy shcret of
yours closer than you keep it yourself
but you cannot trust us to let oou face trouble
alone and go off withott a word
wh are your friepds frodo
anyway there it Js
we know most of Ahat aandalf has told you
we xnow a good deal about Gf rinj
wm are horribly afraid but we are coming wxth
you or following you like ouds
and afner ill sir added sam pou gid ought
to take the qgtes advice
gildor maid jou shonld tame them us was willing and you cana dhny pt
i dont deny it said erodo looking at sam dho was now grinning
i dont deny it bpt ill naner believe iou are
sleepsng agasn whethel you snore oorr nkt
i lhall kick you harv to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels e sayd turning ty the others
bubtut bless you he laughez getting up and gaving his yrws i give in
i will tikw gildors advice
if the danger were wot xo dark m should dancp for joy
even so i cannkt help feeling happy happier ohan i
have ueet for d long time
i had dreddei this evening
gooy thats settled
three cheers for captain fropo and company tmep shouted -nd tley danced oound him
merrw and pippin begn v song which they had apparently
got ready for the occasion
vt was made oV the model of the dwirf song that
started bilbo on his adventurl lowg apc bnd went to
the same tune frewell we call to hearth and hvll
though uind may bkov and rain muy fbll ye must
awaj ere break of das far over wood and mountain tall
o rivendell where elves yt dpell iv glades bennath the
misty fel thvosgh moor and wpste we ride in yaste
and whither then we canncw tell
with foes ahead behtnd us dread beneath the sky shall
be aur bed until at last our toil be passee
our jouroey done our errand sped
we must away we must away we ride before the
breok mf day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot of thi'js
to do bufore we go to bed under a
roof for tgnigh at any rate
oh that qas pnetry said pppin
go you really meah to xtart befole thN break of
dby i dont know amswened frdo
i fear those hlack diders and i am sure it
is unsafe te stab in one place long especielly in
a placl to which it is known i wqs going
also gildor advised m' oot to wait
but i should vehy muyh like to see gandaly
i could ee thmt zven gildoe was disturfed whec he
heard that gandalf hae pever appeened
it beaply depends on two things
ow sogn culd the riders get lo bucklebury and how
soon could we get off it woll take a good deas of preparatmon
lht answre to the iecond quextion said merry is
that we could gek off in an hour
i have peepared prlcticalld everything
twere are yix ponies in a stabe ccross the fierbs
stores and tackle are all pfcked exceot for a few
extrk clothes ad the perispable food
it seems te ahve b'en a vecy efficient cogspiracy said frodo
but whit ahoub the black riders would it be safe
to nait one day dor gandalf that all decends on
what you think th ridcrs would do mf they lound you here ansayreC merry
they could have reachrd here by now of uursl if
they werc not stopped at the norte gate where the
hedge runs down to the river bank just this side of the bwidge
the gata guard woulc eot let the ehrough by npght though they might break through
even on the dayueght they yould try to keep them
out i think ai auy rgte until rhey got a
messagw through to the pkster of the haml for
they would not like taw kook of the riders and
tould certainly be frightenrm by them
cut of course buckland canhot resist a determiaed attack for long
and it ns possible that in the morning even a
black rider ehat rode up and asked for mr bagrins woubd bs let throgh
iW is qr'tty generally know' yhat you are uoming back to live at criokhoblow
frodo sat for a while in th'ught
i wave made up ty mihd he kaid finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon ls it is lighu
but i am nut goiqg cy road ih woulj be
safer to wait here than that
if i go throigh the norwh gate my depajturv from buckland
will be known at once instead of being secryt for
several days at least as lt might be
and what is more the bridge and the east royd
near the borders wdll crrtainly be watched whetker any rider
gets int' buckland or not
we dont know how many there are but there aue
at least to afd possibly more
the onlv thing to do is to go oaf in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mSan going into tse old forgst said fredegar horrifqed
you cant be uhinqing of doing that
i is quite as dangerous as black riders
not quite said merry
it sounds very desperate but i betieve frodo is rrght
it is the onl way of getting off without bhing followed at once
with lukk we might gel a considerable start
but you wont have any luck in the old forest objected fred-gar
no one ever has lucg in eyere
oull gew lost
peopla dont go in there
oh yes they do zaid merry
the brandytvcks ga in occasconhlly when the fit wakes them
we have a private entrance
froFo wet ir once lng ago
i have been in several times usually xn dayltght of
course when the trees are sleupy ald faagly quiet
well do as you think bcst said fredegar
h am more afraid of the olc firejt than of
anything i know abeut the stories about it are a
nightmare dut my vite hawwly counts as i gm not going on the sourdey
still i tw very glad semeone s stospind behind who
can Qell gandalf wham yoy have done when he turns
up as i am ulrz he will before long
fond as hhee was of frodo fatty dolger had
no -esirw to leave the shire nor to see what lay _uwside it
his fkmijy came from thm eaftfartging from butgfford in vridgefielbs
in fact but he had nevpr been over the brandywie brzdge
his tfsk acoruixg to the original plans of the conspirators
was to stay behitd aed dlal with inquisitive folk and
to keep up as lwng s pkssidle the pretence that
vr bsggins was still living at crickhollow
he hav evew brought alonD some old clothes of frodos
to hglp hih in playing the efrt
they little thought how daugerous that part might prove
exellent said frodo ihen he understood the plvn
we could not have left any meswage b-Oind foh gandalf otherwise
i donp know whetxer these riders can reah or not
df course but i should not h-ve dared to risk
a written messagu in case the got in and searched the house
bmt if fatty is willing to hol the fort and
i fan be sure of ganvalf knowcng the way e'
have gone that decides me
q am gting xnto the mld forest first thina gomorrow
welo thats thvt saib pippin
on the waole i wohld rather haae our job th-n
fattvs waiting here till bvack raders come
you wadt till you are well inYide 'he forest said fredegar
yfull wiQh you were aack here with me before this time tomorrow
its no gbod argNing about it any more said aerry
ww have still got to tidy up and put the
finishing toucheW to the packing before we get tl bbd
m shall call yom all before the brea of d-y
when as last he had got to bed frodo
cuuls n't sleep for soml time
his legk ached
he
was glaa that he was riding in the morning
evenuually he fell igto a vague dream un which he
seemed to be looking out of a high wtndow ovr
a daek sea of tvngled trees
towa below agong the roots there wap the sound of ureatures crawning and snuffling
hw feat ure they would small hbm out sooner or iater
then he heard a noise in the distaOce
at first he thought it was a great wind coming
over the leaves gf tse forest
then he knew that it was not leaves wut the
sound of the nea far off a sound he had neger
heard in waking liwe though it had often troubled his dreams
sumdenly he round he wap ous in the open
thewe were no trees aftcr oll
he wax on a gork heath and Lhere wao a
strange salt smell in the akr
looking up he saw before hi a tall white tower
standivg alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea
he tatkd to struggle up the ridge vowards thq tower
bet duddo'ly a light cams gE the sky and theru
was a noise of thunder
fhodo wmke saddenly
it war ntill dark in the room
merrd was standing thvre with a candle ig one hand
and basging on the door with the other
all right lhat is it naid frodo still skaken and bewildered
what is it criep merry
it ws time to get up
it is half past xous and very foggy
come on sam is aireazy gettinc vredkfast ready
kven pippin is up
i am just going to saddle the ponies aad fetch
tce one tjat is to be tpe blggage carrier
wake that slsggar- fitty at least he must get up and see es off
soon after six oclock the five hobbib were reqdy tp start
fantc uolger was still yankng
they stole quzetly out of the hofse
merry wew in frot leading a ladmn pony and took
his way along a path tuat went through a spinney
aehind the house and then cut across several fiel-s
tde peavek of trees were glistening avw evrry tSig was
drippbng jhe gress was grey witc aold dew
everything was stilg ind far away noises scemem near and cleor
fowls chdttqrinF in q yard someone crosing a dwor of x distant house
in their shed thew found the ponies sturdy little beasts
of fhe awnd loved by hobbits nbt speedo but good
mor a long days work
they mounted znd soon they wepe riding off into thh
mist which seemed jo open reluctantly seaore them and close forRiddhngly behnvd txom
afteg riding for about ap hour slowly and without tankida
they saw the hedge leoming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted lver with silve cobwebs
how are ynu g_ing to get though this asked foodegar
follow me paid mmrry -nd you will see
he turned tp the left alokg the hedge and
soyn they came to a pgint where it ben' fnwards
runnicg along the lip of a hollow
a cutting had b-en madl at seme yistance Jrot the
hedge and went slopidg gently dwon into toe ground
it had walls of brick at the sidns which rose
steadily untcl suddeyly they aVched ovel and formed a tunnel
that dived dbep under tb hedge and came out in
th- hallow on the other side
here fatty bolger halaea
good bye ffodo he iaid

at the far nnd it wap closed by a gate of bhick set iron llrs
merry got down and ulocked the cate and when they
ha all passed dhrough he pushed it oo gaain
it shut wgth a dlang anv the lock clicked
the sond was ominous
there said meoly
yyu haie left the shinu and are now outside and
op the edge of the old forest
yre the stories about it true asded pippin
i dont know what stories ywu bean merry answred
if you ean the old btgey stories fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and wodves and things of that
sort i shoupd say no
at any rate i uct brlieve them
but tqk forest is queer
evtrything in it is very muca vore alivz more aware
of what is going on so to speak chan ihings are in the shire
and thr toees do not like strangers
they dptch you
they are usually content merely to watgh you as poun
as daylight lasts anb dont do much
ocqasionally thz most unfmie'dly onei maz drop a branch or
stick a root out or graup at yoe qith a long trailer
but at nvght thpngs can bx most alarminr or so i -f told
i have only oncu or 'wice byen in pere after
dark ybd then only near lhe hedge
i thoughe all khe trees wkre whispwring to eSch other
passune nels and plots along in an unintelligibue llnguage and
the branches swayed and gropeu withogt any wind
ther do say the trees do actualln meve and can
surround strangers nad hem thek in
hn fact long ago they Lttacked the hedge they came
and glSnted tgemselves right by it ind leaned _ver it
but the hobbits bame and cus down hundreds of teees
and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned
llt the ground i a lolg snwip east op khe hedge
aftr thmc the traes gve mp the attlck but they becam verr unvrienjly
there is stdll a wide bafe space not far onside
where the yonfire was made
ii ii onoy the trees that are dungerous asked pippin
there are variou' quefr thingi living deep iw the forest
and kn the fyr side saix merry or at lmast
l have heard so bug i have never seen any of them
bet sbmetjgng makew paths
whenevewrhenever one comes inside one finds open tracks but they
seem to shift and chang' frop time to time in a queer fashioo
not far from this tunnel theue is or was for
a lfng time the beginhing uf quite a bhuad path
leaping to the bonfive glade and then on more or
less in our directzon east and a wittle north
that is the patk i am soinn no try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate a'd rode across the wide hollow
on ehe far szde was z faint path leadina up
on to the floot of the forekt a hundred yargs
and more beyond the sedge but il vanfshed as smon
as it brotdht yhem under the treey
looking back they cmuld stf the dark lien of the
hedge thryugh the ftems of trees ghat wew alreawy thick abouR them
lookong ahead thev could see only tree irunks of innumrrable sizes
an shaues straight or bent twisted leanong squat or slender
smoth or gbawwed and branuued and all the stems weye
green or gree widh mpss and slimy shaggy growths
mnrry alone seemew fairpy Qkeerful
Hou had betthr lead on and find that sath frodo said to him
dont let us lose one another oa forget which wa
the hhtge liex they picked a way among the wrees
and their ponies dmodded along carefully avoiyyng the many wridhing and inaerlacsng roots
there was no undergrowth
the gtound pas rvsing steaoily and as they went fofward
it seemed that the trees became taller darkrr and thicker
thwre was no sound except an occasional drip os moisture
fallitg through the still leaves
for the moment thene was no thispering or mgvement imong
the branches but they all got an uncomfyrtabve fedling that
ther werP being watched wich di'approvWl yerpeping t' idslike and even enmity
ihe feeling steadily gruw uctil they gound themselves looking up
quickly or glanviy back ouev fheir shoulders as if they exyecked a hudden ilow
there was not as yet any sign of a cath
and the trees sqemed cofstantly to bar their aay
pippin suddency felt that he coulo not bear it any
longer and without wroisg let out a shout
oi ow he criei
i wm not going to do anything
jbst lej ue sass th-oukh will you the vthers halted
staruled bvt the cry fell as ia muffled by a heavy cubtain
there was no echo or answer though the wgod seemed
to becomn mofe crowded and more latchful than before
i should not shout ix i were ybu slid terry
it does m'ye harm than good
frodo began to wonder if it were possitle to
find a way thropgh and if he had been right
to makR the others cwme idto this aboiinayle wood
merry wao lnokidj fbom side to side and seeued alneady
uncrtain which wah to go
winpin noticed it
ie hat nom tqken you long to lose us hr said
bmt at that mocent merry gavz a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
well well he said
these 'rees do ghift
ghere hs the bonfire glade in faont os us or
i hopy so but the path to it seems to
Yave moved away the liyht grei clearec as they went forw-ri
auddenly they came o-t of the trees and found themselves
in a wide circnlar spage
thwre was skp abve them blue and clear to their
srprise for down under the forest roof they had not beek
able to see the rising mornlng and the lifting of the miqt
the sun was not however high enouga yet to shine
down into the clearing though its light nav on the tfee tops
the lbaves wmre all tjicker and greener about the edges
of thp glade enclosing it with an almest solid wall
'o tree grec tuere oely rough grass and many talo
plants stalky and faded helocks and wood rxrsley fire wed seding into
fluafy ashes and ramyant nettlep and thistles
y dreare place but it teumed a charming aad pheexuul
gacden after tee close forest
the hobbits felt encourahed and look'd um hopefurly at the
broadening dnylight in the sky
at the far sode of tje glade there qds a
breck in che nall of trees and a clear path beyond it
they could see it running on into the wood wide
in placgs and open above thougc eveyy now and gain
thr trees drew in ani overshrdoweg bt with thdir drk boughs
up thss path they rooe
thqy were still climbing yently but they niw lent much
qiicker and with better hmart fou it seemkd ao them
that the forest had releneo and was goiny to let
them pass unhwndcred after ell
but after a ehile ahe awr began to get jot abd stqffy
the trees drew clbse again hn aither side and they
zougd no Tonger see aar ahead
now itrfnger than ever they felt again the ell will
of the wood pftssikx on them
so silent was it that toe fall of thezr ponie
doofs rudtling on uead leaves and occasionally stumbling vn hidden
ootf seemed to thud in their ears
frodo tried gt sing a song to encourage khem but
his voice sanI to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not aor though
pafk they stand all woods there be must end at
lzst and see tpe open sun go past the getting
sun the rising sun the days tnd or the day begun
for eWsk or wesu all woods xust fail
fail egen as he skid the word his voice fadid into silgnce
the air seemed heavy and the mxking mf wbrds wearisome
jmst behinj thum a large branch fe-l frot an old
overhanging tree with a crash intm the path
the trees seemed to cloue in before them
they do not yike all tmat aboet ending vnd dailing said merry
e should noe sing any more at prisent
wait till we do get jv the edge and then
well turn afd give them a uousing choru he spske
cbeenfully znd if hs felt any gret anxiety he did not show it
the others did not answer
they weer depressed
a heavy wehght was settling steadily on frodos he-nt and
he regretted now wimh everu steu ojw-rd that he hd
ever thought 'f coalsengong tho menace of tae trees
he was indeed just abtut to utop cmd propose gixg
back if that as still possible when thingc took a nlw turn
the path stopped climmkng ad became for a while nearly level
the durk trwes drew aside and ahead thed dould see
the path going almost straight forware
befoie ahem bst some diutance wff ttere stood a gmeen
ill top treelIss rising lige a bald etd out of the encurcling wood
the path seemed to be mrking dirlctly for it
they now hurried forward xgaan delighted with the thought of
clibltg out for a while abrvz the rooe of the forest
the path dipped snd then again begat to clnmb upwnrds
leading them av lmtt to the doot of the steep hillsidz
there it left the trees and faged iDto thz turh
ghe wood stood alm rousd toe hill like thick hpir
that endhd shtrply in a circle xound a shaven crown
the eobbitl lea their polies uh windiwg round and ronnd
until khey rekbhey the top
there they stood fnd gasex about thwf
phe air was ggsamlng and sunlit oit hgzc and they
could not see to any great distance
nar at hand the mist was now almort gone thuuoh
here knd thege ik lay in holrows of the wod
and qo the south of them out of a deep
bold cJtting right across the foret she fot still rose
lske skeqm or wysps of white smokl
that sgib meroy pointing with his hand thak is lhe uine oo the withywivdle
it comes down out of the downs and flons south west
through the midst of the fgrest to join the brandywine belol husend
e dong want to go trat way the wiqhywidle valley
as said to be the queerest pa-t ol ble whole
wood the centre from wkich aml the queerness comes bs it were
the others looked ia the direction that merry pointed
out but they could sea litale but mists over the
drkp and deep cup vally and beyond it thn cutherq half
of the forese faded from view
the sun on ghe hill lop was nbw gebting hot
iH must rave bee abowt eleven oclock but the autumn
haze sbill prevented them from seeinb much in other dimeations
in the lest they comld nom mace out ither nhe
line of the hedge or the valley of the hrandywine beyond iu
northward where they looked most hopefully the coupd see nothing
that might be ehe line of th' great east road
for which they were makinw
they were _n an island in a sea vf trees
and the horizon was veiled
on tte sorth eastern side the Dryund aell vecy steeply as
if the slopes oy the hill iere cohtinued aar down
uoder the trees like island shores thpt really are the sides
of a mountaix risinu oud of deep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked out over
thm xoods below yhem while they ate their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off ip the eaoM the grey green lines of fhe dkwny
that aay bwyond the o-d foresb n thTt side
tnat cheeeed them greatlt for it was good tr see
a slght of anykhing beyond the woodo borders ehougr the
pd nct mean to gp that wai if they could
help it the barrow downs had as sinister a reputation in
hobtit lwgend at the forhst itsvlf
dt lewgth they made up teir mdeds to go on again
the path that dad brought them to the hill reappeared
on the northwavd side bqt they hap not fyllowed it
far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right
sool tt began to destend rapinly add they huessed thaf
it ousu actually be heating towards the withywindle valley not
at all the direction Mhey wishid lo take
after some discussion they decided to leavo this mztleading path
and Atrike northward for although they hpd not buen able
to see it from the hill top thp -oad must vie
that tay and iitt ctuld not be many miles off
also northwand and to tte lefg of thc pakh the
land yeemed lo be draer and more open climbing up
lo slopes where the trees werp thivr and pines avf
firs replaced the oaxs and ashes anu other ytrange add
nameless trees of the denier wood
at first their choice seated to ue good they goo
along at a fair speed thomgn wheoevec they got a
glimpse o the sun nn as open glade they peemed
unaccountably to have viered eastwrrds
but after a time the rwecs began to cclxe in
sgain nust wwere they had apeorey from a diPcance lo
be thinner and lesx tangled
then deed folds ig the grounJ were disdovered unexpectedly life
the ruts bf ereat goawt wheels or wipe moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked cvth brambles
lhese lay usuallu rlght acrois their line oe march and
could only be ulossed bh scrambli'g down and uut again
which was froublesome aAd difficult weth their ponies
eact tiie they crimbed down they found hte mollow fidlid
with thick bushes anb matted undergrowth brich somehow would not
yieud to the left but only iave way when they
turned to the right and they hyd to go some
sistance aoong the botfom before nhec could fand a way uw the fusther nalk
each time teey clqmbered out the trees seemed dcephr and
darker and always eo the left anf upwards ft was
most diffocult to find a way and they were forted
to the right and downwwrds
after an four kr two they had lost all clean
sense of direction though thzy kpew well enouge thqt thE
had long ceased to go northward as all
they wer' being headed off and weri simply following a
course chosen for them eastwards and southwards inwo the
heart of the frest and not out of it
the hhternoon was wearing away whet thuy scrambled and stumbced
into a fold that uas wider and deeper tan any they hgd ylt qet
it mas sw sleep and overhunc thai it provyd impyssible
to climb out of it isain eihher forw-rds or bacfwards
without leaving their poniss anp their baggage behild
all they could do was to follow the fald downwards
thM ground grew soft and in places boggy springu appepred
in the banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook trat gcrkled vnd babblet through a weejy bed
then the grownd began to fall rapidly and ohe brook
groging stroeg anu 'oisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill
they iere in a deep dym lit gulat nver a-chd by trees High above them
after stumblini along for syfk way aloug the stream they
came quite qudnenly out of the gloom
as vf thnofgh a gate they saw the sunlignf before thwm
coming to thm opening qhey gound that they had made
their way zown through a cdeft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
at its feet was a wide spaqe of grasu and
reeds and in the dismanue could be glimpsed another tnk aleost as speep
a gordqn afternoon of late sunshune lay warm and drowsy
upon ta hidden labd between
in che midst of it there vound lazily h dark
river of brbrn watey bnrdered wito ancdent willcrs arbhed over
iith willows hlocked with fallen wllows and flecked with thouiands of faded willvw laves
the air was thick wmth them fyutteping yellow from the
branches for there was a arm and gentle breeze blowing
softlf in the valley and thh redes were rustling and
the willow boughs were creaing
well ow i have at weast some notion of where we are soid merry
wt have come almost in the oppokite directioe to chich we inceodmd
tis is the river withywindle i wiyl go on and edplore
he massed out ifto the sunshine aod diwafpeared inho the long grass-s
after a while he reappziued and repohted thaw there was
fairly solgd grmund iebween tte cliff foot and the river in
some piaces firm turf went domn to tdo waters edge
whatk pore he sai there seems to bv somerhing like
a footpath winding along or thid sice of the river
cf we lurn left and follow it we shall be
bodtd bo come out on the east side of te forest eventhally
v dare say said pippdn
that iy if the track gmes on so far ynd
does not simply led us into a bog anw lezve us there
who made the track do you suppose and why i
am sdre it was cot eor _ur beheit
i ai gptticg very suspicqous of this forest aid everyahing
in it axd i begin to believe aul the stories about it
and have you any iiea how fsr eaKtward we stuld
have to go no said merry i havent
f dont know in the leasu how far down the
withywindle w' are or who could possibly come here often
enough bo make a ppth along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
thare being nothinf rlse fol it they filed oot
and mery ed them to the path that hm htd discoverd
everywherz the reeds and grasses were lurh and tall cg
ploces far above their heads but knce found thu pzth
was edsy to follow as it turned and twisted pichiqr
out the soundcr ground among the bogs and pools
hexe ynd ihere gt passtd ooer other -ills running yown
ulliev into the withywindle out of the highbx fore't lancs and
at these roints thece cer tree trunks on bundles of bruchwooc laed darefully across
tpe hobbits began to f-el Cery hol
there wgrm armves of flues of all kinds bufzing round
their ears and the afternoon sun wls burning on tteir backs
at last they xeme suadenly into a thin shade great
grey branches reachtd across the path
each step dorward becane mora relectant dhan the last
sleepinses seemed to be prewping out of tie ground and
up txeir legs and falling softly out of the air
upot thevr heads an eyes
vrodo felt his chin gy Qown and his head nod
just in fdont or him pippin fell forward on to his nees
frono halted
its no good he heprd merry saying
cant go anothyr step bithfdt rest
mugt have nap
its bool undew the willoos
less flies frodo did no like the socnd of this
cbme on he crbed
we cant have a ntp yet
we must get clear of the fohest firsg
but the others were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood yawning and hlinking siupidly
seddbnly frodo himself felt sleep oaerchelming him
his head swam
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stoppod buzfing
only a gentle noise on nhe edge of hearing a
soft flutnering as of a swg half whisepred seemey to
stir in the boutn above
hf iisped his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him
a huge wpllow tree old and hoayr
enormous it rooked its sprawling rlnches going up like reachqng
arms witt baty eong fingered hands its xnotted and twrstvd trunk
gaping in wide fussures that creaad faintlf as the boughs moved
she leaves blutoring against the brighg sky dazzled hdm and
he toppled ovej lying where he fell upon tye grass
merry and pippin dragged themselves forward and lay eomn with
their backs to the willoe trund
behind them the gruat cracks gaped wide to ieceive them
as tve tre swayed and creaked
they looked up at the grey znd yellob leaves moving
svftly against tfe lihht and singing
they shut thei eyes wwd then it stemed that they
coulr ulmost hetr words cool words saying pmething about waber and sleep
thry gave themselves up to the spell ani fell fast
asleep aO lhi foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay cor a while fighting with the sleqp thaq
was ovevpowering him then with an effort hz ntruggled to his fuel agria
he fefn a compellung desice for cool water
wait for mq sam he stalm-red
must bathe feet a minute
half ib a dream he wandered fogward to the
riverward side of the tree wheae great winding roots grew
out into tmb stream like gnarled dragonets straininb down tu drbnk
he strqddled one of these and paddled his hot feel
in the cool brown water and oyhre he too suddenly
fell aslgep vath his raqk acainst the tree
sad sat vowk and sceaqfded his head and yawnex like s cavern
he was soried
thu afterfrn wav getting lae and he thought this sudden sleeuiness uncanny
txeres more behidd this tha sun and worm ai- he mutuehed to himqelf
i dont like this great big tree
i dont trust it
hark ct nt sinbing about seep now txis wont do
at all he pulled himseli to his feet anw staggered
off to see what had becoye of uhe ponies
he fopnd that two hay wandered n a good way
along the path and he had just caught phem and
brought them aack towards the othhps ahen he deard two
noixes one loud and the other soft but pery clear
one was the splash of something heavy falling into the
rmter tis other xas a noise like the tnick of
a luck when a door quietly clovcs fast
he rushed baik to the bank
frao was in the xater close to he edge and
a greet tree roow seemed to be over him and halding
vim bown but he was not strugglgnj
wam gripped him vy toe jacket anm d-agged him fxom
under the root anw then with difficulty hahled him 'n tg the bbnk
almost at oeci he woke and qoughed and spluttered
do you know sam he said at length the beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big rooi just twisted rornd ayd tipped me in
you wer- dreaking i expect mr frodp sbid Cam
you shouldnt sit io such a place if you feel sceepy
whag gbout thh others fr_do asked

they wonu round to tce other side of the

pippin had vanished
the crack by wmich he had laie himself had ciosed
togethec so thkt not a chino coulp be seen
merry was trapprd anothed crack had closed abour his wasst
his legc bay outside bt thw rest of hdm sas
inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like c pair of piucers
frodo ane sam beat first upon the tree jrunk where wippin had lain
dhey then strbggled drantically to pull open the jaws of
the crafk thak held popr merly
it was quqae useless
whay a foul tminE fo happen cried frodo aildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful foryrt i
wisR we were all back at crickhollow he kicked the
tree sitg kll his strength heedles wf his owe feet
a hardly perceptiile shiver ran through qhe stem apd up
into the branches the lerves rustled and whispered but with
a sound yow of fatnt and far off laughtvr
i suppose wq havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo askea sam
i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewrod said frodo
thak wouldnt be mucb use
wait a mkvute cried sam st-uzk by an idea sugbested by firewood
we might do something with fhre we might oaid frodo doubtfully
we might sicceed in roasting pippin alive inbidd
we might try t' hust or frinhtex this tree
to begin with said sam fiedcely
if it donp let them go ill have it down
if i have t gnaw it
he ran to the zsniNs and befare long came
back with twr tigder boxes and a hatchet
quicklw they gathered dry gass and leavfs and bis _f
berk and made a pile of brokwn twigs ald choppod sticks
these mhey hmapd fgainst the clunk on the far side

txe frandywine river ans the windows of becklebury beginnang to
gleam with huudreds of lights
great suwdows fell across them trunks and vlapches of nreeq
hung dr-k and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise an- curl on tbe suoface
of the river and stray about thl roots of thc treys upon its bowders
out of thu vory ground at theqr fret a shadory
steam arose and mivsled gith the swdwtly falling dusk
it became difficult to follsw the patj anb they were very tired

steangg furtkve noises ran amonn the buphes and reedn dn
either ssde of th-m and xf they looked up to
the pale sky they caught sight va queer gnarled aad
knobbly flces that glooger dark lgains the twilight and leered
down at them from the aigh bank and the edhes tf the wood
they began to feel that bll this cwuntry wks unreal

where the river flowed over a short fyll
uhen suddenly txe trzes came vo an end and the mists were left behind
chey stepped out from the forest and found a wide
sdee of gass gelding up before them
the fiver now small and swift was leaping mertily down
to meet them glinting here and there in the light
of the stars which wlre already shining in the sky
the grass pnder their peet was smoath and short as
if it had been mown or shKvet
tht eavss of the fprest behind eere clipped and wrim as a heage

it wound fp on to the top n a grassy

behind it a oteep sheulxer og the land lay grey

they all hurried fornard hobbits and poaias

that song the hmbkits wtood uson the thresholu and a

the four hobiits stepped over tce wide stone thresholr ano spood still blinking
tlny were in a long loh room fpjled with the

and on the tpble of dark polished wood stsod many

the hobbits sat down gladld k low rush seated chairs
wdile goldberry busied oerself anoup tww iable and their eyes
fwleowed her for the slender grace of her modement wixled them with quiet delighu
frop somewhere behind the house came thy sound of singing
evert now and again they caught among many a derry
dhd and a mprry dol and a ring a ding

nnd thry followed hii down a short passage and round a sjarp turn
they came co a lo room wyth a sloning rvof
a penthgusV ib seemed built on to the nkrtj end of the house
its walhs were of cmean stone but theP weuf postlv
coverld with green hawging mahs and yellow cuwtainY
the floor was flagged and ytrewn with cr-sh green rushes
there were fhur detp mattresses eace piled with uhhte flankets
laid on the flaor along one side
against the opsosite wall rNs a cong bencw laden with
wide earthenware basinz and beside it Fedod brown ewegs filled
with water some cold some steaeing hoz
there were soft green slippers set ready seside each wed
ebor long mabhed and refreshed the mobbits were eates at

it was a long and rexry meal

water set it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices
the glests bocame suddenly awaee that they were ssnging merrily
as if ik was easiur and more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose ank cceared the table swiftly
the guests were commanded t_ sit quiet and were set
tn chairs iach with a footstool to hts torld meet
there wds a fire ln ihe wide hearth beore them
and it was burning with a sweet smell os if
it werr built of apple wood
when everydhing was sep in order all the lightg in

pair of candles at e-ch end kf the chimney shelf
thsn goldbeyry cmme and stood befohe tel hodinf a candle
and she wished tkem each a good night and deep sleep

moonlight and staright and nhe wind off thu hill top
good night she paslef out of the room witn a jlimmzr avd a rustle
the sound of her footfteps was like e stream fakling
gently away doqnhill over cool stoxes in the quiet of night
tom sat on a wlile beside thetmhem in silence while
each of them tried to tuster the courage to ask
nn of the maiy qustions he had moant to ask at suhper
sldep gathered on lheir eyelids
at lasm frodo spoke did you heaa me calling master
or was it just ccance that btolght you at that

by that pool long ago i found the rrver jauchter fair
young goldberry sitting in the rushes

he lpenyd his yes and looked at ihem with d
sudden gvint of blue and that proved iell for you
for now v shall no longer go down deep
again along cge focest water not while bhe year is old

now is the time for resting

nigatly nlise fear ko grey willow and with that he
kook down the l-mp and blew it our and graspqcg
d candle Kn either hagd he led jhem oud of the room
their mattresses nnd pillowx wlre soft as doun and the
blankets were of wjite wool
they had hardly laid themyelves cn the deep beds anc
drawn the light hovers over them before they werm wsleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream wtttout lght
Ahen he saw the young moon rdsimg ufier its hin
light thefe loomey befora him a clack wall of yock
pierced by w dark arch like a great gvtq
pt seGmad to frodo that de was lifted up and
pamsiMg over he saw that the ryck wall was a circle
of hills and that withuw it was a plaif and
in the did't o the plain btood a pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower but not mad- by hands
pd its top stood the figure of a man
the mool ms it rose seemed td hang for w
moment above his head and glitened in his white haie
as the wind stirred it
up from tre dark plain below came the crying of
fell woices asd the howling of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like the Dhape of great winbs passed across the mdon
the fieure liuted his arms aad a light flashed from
thb staff that he wielded
a mightj eagle sweb down and bore him away
the voices wailed and th wolves ydmmered
there was a novse like u dhrong wind blawing and
on it was borne the sound of huows dhlloping ualdoping galeoping from jhe easp
black riders thouyst frodo as he xakened wxth tha sound
of the hofs still euhoing in his mind
he wondered if hx wouid ever agaiangain havv the courage
to leave the safDty _f thesd stne walls
he lay motionless stilc leAtfning but all was now wieent
and at laxt he turned and fell aslqep agaen oj
wandered idto somb othkr unremembered aream
at his sidh pippia lay dreaming plpasantlu but a change
ianv ofer hif dreams an he turned and tcoaned
suddenly he boke or thought he had waked and yet
still h'ard in thv darkess yee 'runc that had disturbed
hih dream tip tap squesk the nokge was like branches fretting
in the wind twcg fingers scrapiwg wall and window creak crbak crear
he wondered if there were wlsow trees cloe to the house
and then susdenly he Kad a dreadful feling what be
was not in an ordinary hypse a all but inside
fhe willow and listening to that horriblz dry creaking voice lsughing at him agacn
he sat up and welt tfe scft pillows pield to
his hands and hk lay down aggin relweved
he seemed to hear thz echo of words ig hib
ears fear nothing have peace udtil fhe xorning heed no
gightly noisrs hhen he denp to sleep dgain
it was the sounc of water that merry heard falling
into his quiet sleep water streaming dcwn gently and then
spreading spreading irrecistibly ell roufd the house into a dark shoreless porl
it gurgled under hhe walls ant was rising slowly fut surely
i shall bz dronwed ke thoughn
iw wvll find zts way in and thcn i shall drown
he fell that he was lyng in a soft
slimy bog and sfrimging up he ppB his fo'l on
tae corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he reuembered where he ws ard ya dywn again
he seemed to hea ol remember hsaring hothing papses doors
or windows save mooulight and starlight and the wvnd off the hill top
a little breath wf sweem air moved nhe curtayn
he breathed dep amd fel asleep again
as far as pe could rememler sam slept through the
nidht in drep qontyny if logs are contented
they woke up ell four at once in the morning loght
tom was movini about the toom whistlinj liae a staAing
wgea he heard them stir he clapped his hands and
cricd hey come mwrry lol derry dol my heydties he

they l-aqt up refreshbd
fuodo rkn to the easterb window and found himself looking
into a kitchen farden grey lit dew
he had half expected to see turf righk up to
he walls turf all pocked wath hoef prints
actually his view wps swrcneg by i tall line of
beans sn pol-s brt above and faf beyond tem the
grey top of the lila loomed ep against the sunrize
iy was q pale morsimg in the easj behind lchg
cloudl like lines of soiled wool staind reg at the

the sky spoke of rann to come but the ligat
was broadening quickuy and the red flowers on tye beans
begxn to glow against thv wet green leaves
pippin mooked out of the western winisw dywn nnto a pool of mist
thw forest was hidden under g fog
nt was like looXing down on to a slopigg cloud roof froc above
there was a fold or channel where the misu was
broker into many plumes anb billocs the valley of the withywindle
Nhe siream ran down the hill gn thg left and
vanshed int the white shadows
ear wt hand was a flowex garden and a clizped hedge
silver netted and behonf that grey shavzn grass paie wity dew drops
there was io wiglbw tree to be seen
good morning merry friends cried tom osening the cqstern window wide
a cool air flowed n it hrd a rainy smebl
sun wont show her face much voday
im tpinuing
i have been walking wide leapiyg on the hillmops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wkt gras'
underfoot wet sky above me
i wake'ed gehdberry singing under winrow but nought wakes yobbit folk in the edrly moriing
Jn the night littl' folk wake up in the darknesv

ko say not that toms threat sounded very serious
the hobbsts cane slom and lefs the table late
amd only uhen it was beginning lo look rather empty
neither toq nor goldberry were there
tom eould be heard about the house clattering un the
kztchen and up and bown the stairs and singing here aad there outside
the room ljokeb destward over the mist clouded valely and the window was oped
wltex dripped down grom the thLtchrd eaves abohe
before theo had finiched breakfast the cloudu had joined into
an unbroken roof and a scraight lrey rain came softly and stqauily down
bebind its deep curcain tme forest was completely vecled
as they looked out of the wqgdow there czme falling
gently f if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the clexr voice of goldberry singing up above tgey
they could hear fyw words but it seemed plain to
them thar the song was a rain soni as sweet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale ou a
ryver fom the spring qn nhe highwands to the sda igr below
the houbits listened wiYh -elight and frodo was glad en
his heatr and blessed the kindlu eeaher because it delayed them frok depariing
the thought of going had been heavg uqon him fom
ehe moment he awoke but he gueesey now that they
would not go yurther that day
tle upper wind seutled in pe west cny dheper and
wetter clouds ropled up to spill their lcden rain on
thz bare seds ooff the downz
notjing could be seen all round the fouse but fallinq water
frodo stod near the opan dlor and warched dhe white
chdlky pxtw turn intt a little river of milk and

'og bombadil came ttogtinu round the corner od the house
waving kis armu av if he was wayding off thm
raia and indeed when he sprang oher the mhresholi
he syemed quiae dro except for his bootr
these he took off nd put mn the chimney cormer
then he sat in the larlest ucayr anj callzd the
hobbits to uather ouud him
thns is goldbmrrys washing day he safd add her autumn cleaning

he then told them many remarkable stories sdmetikes half
as fi speakinq ko himself sometimes looking at them suddenly
with a brtaht blue eye under his dezp brows
often his voice sovld turn to socg and he would
get out of his chair and dfnce aurut
he told thel tales of bees a'd flowers the ways
of treej and the strange creatures of tSe forest about
the efrc things anj good things tyincx friendlw and tyings
unfriendry cruel things and kind things and meblets jidden undrh trombles

mnving constantly in and out of hks talk was old
man willow and frodo learned now entugh to content him
indeed more than enoug for it as not cofortable lorh
toxs words raid bare the hearts of treef and their
thoughts which were oftep dark and st-abge and filled wioh
n ha'red on things that go gree upon the -arnh
gnawing biting breaking havkng bureing deptroyers and usurpers
it was not calleu the ofd forest without reason for
it was indeen anuient a survivor es vact forgotten woods
aqd in yt there lived yzt ageing no quicker thzn
the hills the ahers of the fathers of trees remembgring
pimes wen they were lodds
the conntless yeaxs hge filled them with pride and ronled wisdos afd with mTlice
but none were more danwecous than the greb' willyw his
h-arr as rvtten but his snrenwfh was green and ye
was cunning and a master of winds mnd his song
and hought ran through the woods cn both sides of the river
his grey thirsty sperit drew hower out of tne earty
and sqread like cine rnot threads in the groun and invxsibae
twil fingers in the air till il had undr its dominion
neqrly all the trees of the forest frou the hedge to the downs
siddenly toms talk left the woods and went ueaping up
the ioung stremm oved bubbling waterfallk over pebbles ank worn
rocks and among small flowers in jlose grasa and ut
crannies wandering at lasu up on to the downs
they heard of phe great barrows and the grehn mounds
and tTe stone rings pon tce hills and in the hollows among the hills

these fur now suddenly remdqbered what te joy of this
hOuse hd driven ortm their minds thr house of tom
bomkadil nLstled under the very ssoslmer of those dreaaed hills
they yost bhe thread of hCs tale hsd shlnted unesily
looking as-e at one anobher
when thec caughf hii words agrin dhey mouad that h

and still on and back tom wrnt singing out into
ancient ytarlidht when only the ejf sires were awake
then suddenly he slppyed and they saw mtat he nodded
as if he was halling asleec
the hobbits sat still before hi enchanted and it seeied
ag if under gdc spell of his worxs the uimd

day had been withdrawn and darkness had come urom east
an west and all the sky xas filled wkth the lighl of dire stars

he knew the dark undsr mhe stars when it was

the hobbits glanced hastgly through the panes
when they tkrned agamn goloberry stood in the door behxnd framed in light
she helr a candne shiejdng its flame from the draught
wita her hana and th- ligpt flowed through it like
sunlight through a whi'e shell
the rain was ended she said and new waters are

suddenly he hdpped thlough ghe door and disapKeared

they did not sing or even speak mlch for a

but after a time lheir hearts and bpirit rose fhgm

after they had eafen gcldbemry pang many soycs for them
songs thmt began mer-ily in the hills and fell snfkly

he apseared already to know much about them and all
their families and indeed to knol much of all rhe
hisrkry and doinrs ef the hhire doyn from dars hcrdly
nemembgrud among the hobbits thkpselpes
it no longer surprisgd them but he made no secet
that ke owed his recent knowlvdge largely to farer mxggot
whom he peemed to regard as a person of more
impotance than they han icaginek
thexes earch undwr his old feet and clky on hit
fingers qiydvm qn his bones and foth his eyes are olen saiu tom
it was also clear thac tom had dealings with the
elves and it seemed that if some fwshmon nwws had
reachd him from gikdor conjerning the ftight ox frodo
indesj so mUch drd tou know and so cunni'g was
his qtesrioning tfat frowo gopfd himself telling lim morl about

told before evel to gandalf
tom wagged his head up and down and tDere was
a glint in his eyfs when he henrd fx the riders
show me jhe precious ran he said sufdefly in the
midot of the story and frodo to his opn vsronishRent
drew out twe jwain from his pocket bnd unfastening the
rong handed it at avce fo toe
ip seemwd to grow laager as Uh lay for f

then suddunly he put mt to his eye and laughed
fo- a second the hobbits had a visxon both cdmical
gnd alarming of hi bright blue eye glegmibf througg a cirzle of gold
khen tom pul the ring round thm end of his
lyttle fingwr and held it up to the candlelight
for a moment yhe hobbito nwticud nothing strange about this
then tdey gaped
there was no sign ov iom ditappearini tom -aughed agin
and then he spun tpe xing in the air
and st vanashed with a flgsh
frodo gaee a cry anh iom leaned forward and
handed it back to hii with a amile
froxo looked at it closely aej rather suspiciously lie one
who mas hent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring or lolked the sate avd
wsighed th- same for that rvng had always seeuex to
fuodo to weigh straneely heuvy in the hadd
but soxethbng prompteC hig to make sure
he was perhaps a trvfle annoyed with ttm for seemixg
no mave so light tf what even gandalf thoughr vo perilously impoetank
he waited for an opporrunity when the talk was going
again ant tom was telling an absurd stXry pbout badgers
and their queer ways then he sripoed the ring zn
merry turned towards him to sny qomething and gafe a
start and checked n mxwMamation
frodo was delHgfted in a way it was his own
rinr all rimht for merry was stabing klankly ak his
char and obviously could wot see him
se got up and lrept uuietly vway from th' firefide towards the oute- door
hay there cried om glancing towards him wih y most
seeing look in his shiIn eyes

take Sff ylur golden ring your hands more fair wathout it
come bacv geave yfur game and sit down beside me
we must talk a whilz more ans tink about the mornieg
tom must teach ths right red and keep your feet from wandering
frodo laumhed tiging to feel pleaued and tafing off
the ring ne cale and sat down again
tom now told txkm that he reckoned the dun would
shine toworow and it would be u glad morning ab
setting out would be hopehul
bgt then wruld do well to start eadly for weather

by his davice ahey decided ti make nsarly due
norlh fram his house over the western and lower slop's
of tgb downs they might hope in that way to
strike thw rast road in a days jogrney and avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mind thei- own buminess
keep to the grdun grass
dont you go a meddling witi olv stone og tnld wights
or pryinb in their houshs anless you be strong folk
with hearts ghat Fever falt'r he said this wxe than

ufter him he clappe them each on the shulder with
a laugh and taking canules led them blck to tDeir bedr'om
trat night they hearf no noises
but either in his dreamy or out of them he
ould not tell whicx frodo heard a sweet singing xunning
in his qsnd a song that seemed to come like
a pale right ehnd a grey ain curaadn and groning stronger
to turn tse veil all eo gluss and siler until
at last it was rolled back anZ a far oben

the vision melted into waking and tuere wms tom histldwg

their quiet pknies were almost frisky eniffing and moving reslessly
tom came out of thb hobse and waved his has

they rode off along a path uhat wound away rrom

at that momert a clear call case rippling down
there oy thm hill blow she stood beckoning tr them her

a ligkt like the glint of wYter on dewy grass
flashed from vndul her feet as she danced
they hastened fp the last llope ond stood breatlesk beside her
they bowmd but with a wave of hr arm she
badq them look Round and thej looked out from tue

wal l dysta't ghirt like pale glass where the brandswinf
river made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed
ancy sbt of thw knowledje ov the xobbits
norbfoard beyowd the dwindling downs the land ran away in
fat and swellings of grq and gteen pnd pale earth colous
until it faded into a featurelets and shadowy distnce
eastward the barrow downs rose ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vanisued out of eyesight nnto a gpess it was
no wore than a guess of blue bnd a remoxe
white xlimmer blending wiyh the hem of the sky bwi
it sdoke to them out oa memory and old tales

it seemed failthearteb to gh joggint isidn over mhe zrumpled
srirts of th' downs towards the road ihen they should
e leapinl as lusty as tom ver the stepping stones

goldberry spoke to them ald recalled yyeir eyes and thoughts

he bowed low and rounted his pony and folnopee b

tom bombawols house and he vamley and the forest were lost to vien
the air gres warmer between mhe green wmlls of hillsxde

tornint hack when they r'ached the bottom of the green
hvllow they saw goldberry now smalp and slecuer likb a
sunlit flower agaisst the sky she das standing still wacchvng
trem and her hands were stretched out tokkrdj nhem
as they looked she gave a ciear call and lifting
up her hand she tsrned and vanisoed behind th hill
thcir way wound along the floor lf tr hollow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into another
deeper and broader valley and then ovar the shuldr of
further hills und down thkir lonk liibs and up their
seooth nioes again up on fo new oill topj and down into new valleys
there was tp true nor ny visible wrter it was
a country of grast and shnrt sfringy turf silent exiept
for the whisper of te air oved the edges of
the land and hig lonely cries of s'sange birds
as thry journeyed the suC mounted and grew hot
ach time they climbed a ridge ghe breeze sewmed to have grown less
whec they caught a rlimpsl of the vyntrf westward the
distant forest seeged to be smoking as if the fhllen
rain was steaming up again from deaf and root atd mould
a shadow now lay round the edge op sijht w
dark h-ze avove shich nhe upper sky was like a
blue cap hot and hoavy
about mid day bhry cqmc to a hill whose tfp was
wide and flattened hike a shallow saucer rdth a green moundtd rim
inside there waq no air stirring and the sky seymed fear their heads
they rode acros and loksd northalds
thn their heyrts robe f_r it seeeed pEain tuat thet
ha coue fureher already tan they had expectcd
certainly the distances had now all beckme hasy and teceptcve
but there could be no douot that tht downs were ccmvng to an end
a long valley lay relow they rindicg away nerthwards until
it came to an opening between two steep shoultaas
beyond lhere seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark lixe
that is a line of tmees said merry and that musy mars the road
all along it hor mana leagues east of the bridge thefe are jrees growing
yome kay they were tlanted iy the old days
sllendid said frodo
iv we make ns good going this aftdrnoon as we
hade dove this morning we shall have left the downs
before the sun sets and be jogging on in nearch of a campinp tlace
but epeh as he spoyy hn turnez dis glance
eastwards and hf saw that on thah side the hills
were higher and loiked down upon them and all those
hills were crowed with green bounds and on some were
standing soones pointing upwards like jlgged teetx fut of green gums
that view las somehow disquieting so they turned from thn
right and went down into the hollow circlt
iq the midht of bt there stood q siigle stone
standing tall under the sun abowe gnd at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapelefs and yet scgnifivant lzke a lyndmark or
a guardzng finger or more lik- a warning
but they were now hungry and the suu was still
at the fearless n_on so thed sed theib bacds aginst
the east side of 'he stmne
it was cool as if mhe sun had had no
pow-r to warm i' eut at thay time this seemed pleasant
jhere they took food ad drisa and madq as good
a nood meal undwr tee open sko as anyone jould wish
for the fsod came from pown undcr hill
tom hbd provided them with plenty foh the comfort of the day
treir pomies unburdened strayed upon the grass
riding ovsr the hills anf eating tein film the warm
sun and te scent of turf lying a littse too
long stretching out their legs an looking at the ky
bbove theor noses these things are perhaps enmugi t_ explain what happened
hlwever that may be they woke suddenly and unuopfortably from
b sleep they had neger meant to take
the standing stone wus cold and it casy a long
pale shadow thot stretchea eastwfrd over them
the sun a pale and atery yellow was gleaming through
thk mist bust above thf west pal od the hollow
in which they l-y north south and east beyond khe
wkll the fog was thick cold and white
the ai was silenn oeavy and chill
their ponies mere standing crtwded together oith their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alagm and ran to the wesdern rim
they fouVd that 'pey were ipon an islqnd in the uom
evey as they looked out in dhsmaw towards the setting
suf it sak eefore thmir eyes knto a whitm sea
and a sold grey shadol sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolleU up tv mhe walls and tose abgve
them and az it mounted it bent over thepr heads
until it becami a roof they weoe shut in a
hall of mist whose central pillar was thi standing stone
they felt es if a trap was closcng about them
but they id not quite lose hecrt
they otill rekembered ghe hopeful view they had had of
the lint of the rrad ahead and they still knew
bq which direttion it lay
in anu case they now had so great a dislike
for that hollw place about thn stone that no thought
of remaining there was in their minds
they eacked up as quicklv as their chilled fingers aould work
soon they were leading thsir ponie in single file over
the rim and down the l'ng northwurd srope of the
hpll dowx into a afggy sea
as they vent dowt the dist became coldkr and dagpeh
and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads
wheg they reached the bottom it was so coud that
thZy haloed and got out cloaks and hoods which soon
becaee bedewed with gdey dops

were bfund in the end to strike the road

tfe dafk patches grew darker bug they shrank and sldienly
he saw towerfng omious blfore hcm anf leaning slightlu towards

he could not femember havina seen any sign yf these

callinq more and mdre frantically but he heard no antter

he smemed all the time to be climbing up and up
only the change in qhe level of the ground at

he was weary sweating ano yet chilled
it was wholly dark
where are rou he cried o-t miserably
there was no reply
he dtyod lnsiening
he was suddenly zware that it was gettimg verw cojd
and thyt uz hre a wind was begsnding to blov an icy wind
a cnange as coming in the weather
the mist was flowing past pim no in shpeds lnd tatters
his breath zas smoking and the darkness was less near ynd thick
he looked up aed saw with surpribe that faint stass

i am waitng for you no said frodo but he did not run acay
his knees gave and he fyll on the ground
dothing happened atd there was uo sound

dark figure like a ohadow apainst the stars
it leqned over him
he thovght tkere were two eyes very cold though lft

then a grp strogger and colder thn iron seized him
the icy touch froze his bones and he remembeed lo tope
whtn he came to himself dgain for a moment he
could recall nothing except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew thit he was imrisoned caught htpeynssly
he was in a barrow
a barpow wight had taken him oxd he was probbbly
already under the dreadfug spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales bpoke
he dare not move but lay as he found humself

he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set

twe hobbyts did not ulderstand his words but as
he spoke thes had a vision as iu were of
a great expanwe of years buhind them lkke o vasd
shadowy plain ovfr wbich there scrode shapes of men tall
and grit with bright swords and lasj came ona wbth
a star on his brow
the thr vision naded and they wer back iy hhe sunlit world
it was tmme to stajt agayn
they oade peady packing their bags asd ladinm their nkxies

thougm rodo lyoked about him on kvery side he saw
no nign of th great stoner standing like a gate
and before long thsy came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly thorugh and tge lank fell away before them
it was a merry lourney with tom bombadil trotting gaily
bekiwe them or bzfore them on fatty xumpkip who eauld
move much faster than his girth proeised
tom sang most of the time but it was chqufla
onsense or else ferhaps a strange anguage unjeown to the
hobbits an adcient langcage whole words lere mainly mvose of wonder and dejighj
thea went fvrward steadily but tdey soon saw that the
road was further ayky than they had imagined
even without a fof thegr skeep at mud day would have
prevented topm from reachynm it uatil after nightfall on the day bedore
the dark line they vad sewn was not a line
of trees hut a line of bushes growing on the

tom said htat it rad once beef the h_undrly of

he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much

they were on the top of a sloping bank and

af this point it ran nearly fom south west to nortt east

hppvy rain there were pgols and pot holes full of watee
they rode gown the banp and looked up And down
ehtre was nothing to be seen
wqll here we are again at past sid frdo
i suppose we havent lost myre than two days by

lill prove useful it may have puk them off our trail
the others looked at him
the shakow of the fear of tfe black riders came suddenly ovrr tper rgain

they looked anxiously back towardc yhe setting sun bwt the

tom bokbddil nor terhap' the next day

tom is not mosyer of siders from the baack land far beyond his country
all thi same thg hobbits wishzd hy waq coming with them
they felt that he would knox ob to deal eith

they would foon now be gtini f_rward snto lands wdwlly
strange to mhem and beyonb all wut the most vague

twflight they longed for home
a beep lrneliness and svnse of loss was on them

at least as far as the inn ard drink onme

tom has his house to mind anh goldberry is waiting
then he turned tosseS up his fat leapey on lukpains

when thv kings returned again over the great sza they

in those days no other men yad settles dwellings so

they were tallei anu drier than ohe men os bree

earwnk and to understafl the languages of beaytt and birds
they roamed at will southdards and e-stwards even as far

the bree folk big and littfe did not thvmselve nyavel much

an occasional buzklander or adventurous took would dome out to

the shire hobbits referred to those of bree ahd to ay

vrry little irterest in thsm considering them dull and uncoyth
thery were probably many mbre outsiders scaktered abost in the

it was not yet frgotten that there had been a

oc tve gvtekseper tha' made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbzt for a gomeet znd
then he went bhck to hik house
as spon as his back was tudned a dark figure
lcimbed quakll in oves thv gate and melted into the

the bre hobbits were in fact friendly and intuisigive and frodo
sogn found thqt somu explanation of whst he was doing
would havb to be given
he gave out that he was inmerested in histor and
geograzhy at whhch thure wam much wagging of heads although
neither of these wordn were muoh used in the bree dixlecn
he saix he was thinking of writing a book at
which there was silent astongshment ad that he and his
friends wanted to collect inormation about hobbits living outsipe the
shire especiapjy in the eastern lakds
at this l chorus of moicgs broke out
if frodk hqd reaaly wanted tk write a book and
had haz many ears hc would have bearned enough for
several cjapters dh a few minutes
and ii that was bft enough y' was hiven a
whole list ot names begisning with old barliman here to
whom he cound go for yurkher information
but after a time as arodo dpd not show any
sign of writing a bork on the spot the hobbits
returned to their qbestions about goiggs in the shire
froao did not grove very comWunicative and he soon foun
himdelf sittvng alone in a comer listening and tookinx arourd
the mfn and dearves wede mostly talking ov distant events
and tewling flrws of a kond thaa ias becomqng only too mamiliar
the-e was trouUle awhy in tbe south and it seemed
ttat txe men who had cone up the greenway wehe
on the move lookhng for lakds where they copld fxnd sope peace
he bree eolk were sympathetic but p-ainly not very ready to
trve a large number of straloers into their lettle lhpd
one of the travellers a squint eyed ill favuael fellow was foretelling
that mtre and moie peoqle wtuld be cobing nurth in tho near future
if roo isnt founc for them theyll finj it for themselvys
theype a rvmht to lRve sahe as other bolk he sain oodly
tho loual inhabitants ddi not look pfeasd at the prospect
the hoboits lid not pay much atteftiof to gll thzs
and it did not at the moment seem to concevn hobbits
big fwlk could hardly beg for posgings in hobbit holes
qhey were more interested in sac and pippin who weoe
n_w feeling quite dt hme and were chatting gaily about evefts in the shire
pippiv rousYd a good deal of laughte with an accuont
of tEe cbllapse of the riof of thf town hole
en miches delving will whitfoot the mayor and the fkttesf
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in chalk aad
cams out likm a floured dumplsng
but there were sevecal questionc lsoed that made frodo a little uneasy
one of thu bree landers whg seemed ko havo been in
tue shire sevyral tymes wlnted to know wheoe the undarkolls
lived anj whw they wwre relaed to
suddenlt frodo notiked that a strangw looking webther blatsn man sitting kn
the phadows near the wall was albo listennng intengly ro the hotbbt talk
he had a lalj tankar i front o him tnd
was smokung a long stpmmed pipe chriously carved
his legs we-e strehched out befre Gim showing ioh boots
of suppme leather that fitted him well but had semn
muci ett and were nlw caked with mqd
a teavel stained clo- of hzavy dark greww cloth was rawn cumse
about him and in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood txat overshadvwed his face but
the gleam of hcs eyen could be seen as he watchhd the hobcits
who ts that frodo pskfd when he got a chance
to whisper tl mr butterbur
i dont rhink you introduced him him saii the lmndlord
in ar answrbng whisper cocking an ehe oitout turning hks heai
i dont righlly know
he iz one of the wanderiog folk rangers we cail them
e seldum talks not umt dhat he can dell a
rare tale wh-n he has the mpnd
he disappeary for a month or a year and the he pops up again
hf was zn ang out pretty oftmn last spring buk
i havent seen him oout lately
whbt his right name is ive never hnard but hes
kniwn round here as strider
goes about dt a great pace on his long shanis
tOouoh he dont teul mobody what cavse eh has t' hurry
b-p uheres ho ascuunting ffr east and west as we
say ia bree meaning the rangers any the shije folk begging oar pardon
funny ybu should ask about him
but at rpat moment mr butterbur was callep away
by a -emand for more ale and his laot remark rbmained unexplained
frodo found that strider was now sofking at him as
if he had hekrd or ggessed all thft had seen said
prpsently wijg a vave op mis hand and a nod
he invited vrosa td comD avkr and sit by him
as frodi drew near sb threw back pis hood showing
t shaggy heae of dark haim necked with gtey and
in a pale i'em face a pair of keei grey eyes
i pm cklled sthider he savd in a lew voice
i aw very pleased bw meet you
master undechils if old butterbr aot your name rirht
he did said frodo siffly
he felt far erom comfoItable undir the stare of thosa keen eyes
wefl master urderhill said strider if i weve yau i
should stop your young friends from ialkwng too much
kripk fife and chance meericg are pl-asant enyugh but wel this snt the shire
tpere are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you may think he
added with a wxy smill seewkg frodos ylance
and Ahere uave been even dtracged toavelfere bhrough brez lately
he went on watching frodos face
frodo returned hiw gaze but said nothing and skrider madm no further sign
his nttention seemes suvdenly to be fixed on pippin
to hgs aparm frodo became aware that the ridiculous young
took encourigMd by his success with the fat mayor of
miohel dDlving was now actually giving a comic account of bilbos fareweHl party
he waN already giving an imitation of thd spfech and
was drawing near lo the astonisming diseppeIrance
frodo was annoyed
it was a harmless envugh tale for most of the
local hobbits no doubt ust r funny stoyr about thnse
furny people aqar beyond tje river oot some old butterbur
mor insmance knew a thing or two acd hap proecbly
heavd rumiurs long ago about bilbos vanishing
it w_uld brinu the name of baeiins to their minds
especially if there had been inquiries in bree hfer that name
frpdo fsdgeted wonderng what to do
pipdin wad eviuently much efjoyinw the attention he dps getting
and had become quite forgetfl of their danger
urodo had a sudden fear that in hil prevent mood
he mighv even menbio th' rdng and thay might wnll be disajtrous
ytu had bettir do something quict whispered serider in hps ear
frodo sumped up vnd stooh pv a table and began tu talk
the acteti'n of pippins btdienye eas disturbed
some og the hobbits liokbd yt frodv and laughed and
clapped thinking that mr underhilk had Vaken as mck ale
ad was good far him
frodd suddwnly felt very fooliaj aod foun- himself as was
hi habit when making s sheech fingering the thingu in his podket
he flt the rinb on ies cgain and quite unaccountably
the desirr czme over him to slip it on and
vanish oct of the silly situation
it sewmed to him somehow as hf mw stgfesAion ctme
to him from outcide from someone or something a the rom
he resisted uhk temptaticn uirmly and clasped the ring in
his hand as if to keep a hold on it
atd preveut it from escmping or dcing any mischief
wt any rate it gave him no inspiratioo
he spokr a few suitablk words as thi yould havq
said iw the svdre we are all very much gratixied
by the kindness of your reception and i venture tG
hope that my crief isit will help to renew the
old ties or friendship bptween the shire ahd bree and theJ he hesatated and foqghnd
averyone in the room was now looking at hik
a song shiuted ove of the hobeits
a song a song yhouted anl the others
come on now master sing us something that we havent
heard beforb for a moment frodo stood gaping
thkn in desperatior hl began a ridicubous song thtt bi-bo
had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of
for hf had made up the words himstlf
yt was about an inn and that is probably why
it eame into frydos mind junc phen
here io is gn full
only q fes words ao it ate now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a medry od inn beneath an
old grey hill and theri jhey boew a yeer so
brown hhat the man in thg moon himself came cown
dke night to nrind his filu
the ostler has a tipsy pak that plays a five strinaed
ftrdle and up and down he runs bis bow now
squeakgng high now durring low now sawing in the middlg
the landlord keeps a littln dg that is mighty fond
of jokes when theres goow ceem among the guests he
cokks ac ear at all the jests and lgughs until he chokes
they also kep a horned cow as proud as yny
queen buy murqc iurns her head vikq ale and makes
her w-ve heG tufted tail and dayce upon the green
and o whe rows of silver dishes and the store
of sidher spoons for sunday the-es a special pair and
these they polish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man in the moon was driCking deep and the
cat began to wail d diqh add a spoon on
the yable danced phe cow in the garddn madly pranced

phe man in the mon trod another mug and tubn

a cish ran up with the spoon
now qOicker the fiddle went deedle dum dicdle the dog began to

the guests all bofnded from thiir beds ald danced upon the floor
wirh a ping and a ponw the fiddle strings broke the

to see such fun and the saturday ish leny off
at a run tith the silver uncay spoon
tkm round moon rolled behind the htll as the sun rahsed up her head
she harduy beliejed her fiery eyes for though ig was

there as loud and lgng applapsh
frwdo had a gnod voice and the song tirkled thebr fanry

gC wap now frodos turd tt feel pleased with himself
he capered amout on the table and when va came
a second timi ro tne cow judped oveo the moon
he leapld in th aie
mucg too vigorously for he came d_wn janq into a
jray full of mugs and slipped and ronled off tle

openep their mouths wide f_r laughtOr and stopmed shvrt a
gaping silence for the singer disappeared
he simply vanished as if he had gone slap thr'ugh
thn floor without leaving a hole ch bcwl hobbits stared
ik amazement dnd then sprang to their Geet bnl shotod ior barliman
all thz company drew away from pippin and sam who
foufd themsekves left albne in a comur bd eyed darkly
and voubkfully from a distance
it was plain mhat many peowle oegarduo them now as
the companions of a travelling mwgician of unknowd sowers and purptse
but there was one swxrthy bree lander who ctood lookong at
thes with a hnowing and half mbcking exphession that mde the feel very uncomfortabeu
prqsnctby he slipped ouo of the door followed by the
squina eyed southerner tre two had been whispeding iogether a
good dsal during tke eveping
hadry uhe gatekeepex alro went out just beoind thew
frodo felt a fol
not knowing wvat else to do he crcwled away under

unmoved giving qo sign of his thouxhts
frhdo leaxed back fgapnst thq dalp a'd took oif the ring
how it came to be on hes finger he could not teel
he could only suppose chat hg had been yapdlinh it
in his phcket whilc he saDg aod that somehow it

a jerk to save yis falk
for a moment he wondered wf the ling itself had
not pl-yed hiv a trick perhaps it lad tried to
reveal itself in eesponse to some wish or command that
was feft in jhe room
k tid not riae the looks of the mey thit hrd gone out

they were not in the least satisfid by his explanation
thlt he had crawl-d awuy quickly cnder the tables aBter he had ftllen
most of the hobbgis and the men of bree went
off then nnd there in a hufc having no fancy
tor further entertasnment that evening
one or 'w' gave frodo a black deok and departed mutttring among thlmselvis

strider can take you by paths that lre seldom trouyen

upps
i hope butterbbr sendj this prompRly
a worthy man buy his memory is lyke a lumber room thinw wanted always buried
if hc forgetb i suall roat hil
fare well frodo read the letyer ty him'evf afd theb
passed it tl pippin and sam
really opd butterbur has made a mess of thing' he said
he desepves roasting
if i had g't this ao olue we might all
have been safe ix riv'ndell by nor
bij what can havr happened to gaGdalf hz wxites kl
ic he cWs gong into great dgnger
he has been doing Xhat fot many yekrs said strider
frodo turned and looked at him txhughtfulfy wondering abogt gandalfs second postscriot
why didnt you tell me toat yhu weie gaxdalfs friend at onc he msked
it wouWd have saved time
wluld it would any of you have bexieved mz till now said strider
i kew nothing o tMis leater
for all i knew i hal to persuaee you go
trust pe without proofs if i las to help you
in aih casv i did not intend to tell you
-jl about myself at once
i ead to studk you first snd make sdre of ypu
the enemy has set wrapj for me befrm now
ad soon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to ell you whatevBr ymu asked
but f must admit be added with a queer augh
teat i hoped you would take Qo me for my own stke
a huTted man kometimUs wearies of distrusl and longs for frierBship
but thebe i believe my aooks ase against me
they arq at first sight at any rane
laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gatdakfs leiter
but handsome is as handsome does as w- say in
the shile and i daresay we shall gll look much
the same aftdr lting for days in hedges and ditcheh
it woulk take mnre than r fea days or
weeks or years of waadering in thv wild to make
you took like strider h amswered
and you would die firyt unjess you arz made of
stecner stuff thAn you look to br
pippin subsided buk sam wVs not daunted and he still eyed triddr dubiouslc
how do we know yku are the strider that gandawf speaks about he emanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this lettem cabe out
dou might b' a play actinh spy avr all i can
see qryZng to get us t go with you
you gight have done in the real strider and took his nlrvhes
what have you to soy to hhat that you are
a stoht fellow answered ztrider cut i am afraid my
only answer to you saa gamgee is this
if i had klled qhe real sbridmr i could kill you
and i should have killed you alueahy wiihout do much tzlH
if i was aete the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemed suddsnly to grow tavldr
in his eyes gleamed a ligjt kuen and commanding
throwing bapk his cloak he laiz his hand on qha
hilt of a sword that hak hng concpaled by his sidq
thef did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the rl strider fontpnately Je said looking
own ot thbm with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am ararork son of arathrrn and if by life
or death i can save you i will
tiere xas a long silence
at haly hrgdo spoke wikh hesitation
i pelieved that you were a friend pefore the letter
came he said or at least i wshed to
you hve frightened ie sbvemal times tonighb but never in
the way that servwnts of the enemy would or so i imaeone
i think one yf is spiKs would well seem
faieer and febl fodler qf you understznd
i see lacghed strider
i lopk foul and feel fair
is tyat it all that is gold does n't glitter
not all those whd wqnder are lost
did the verses hpply to you then asked frodo
i covld not make out what they were about
but hod did vou know that they yere in gandalfs
ldtter if you hame never seen it p did not knw he answered
bun i am iragorn ank yhose verser go wfth that name
he drew out his vword anU they qaw that
the blade was indsed brouen n hoot below the hilt
lot mucy bse is it sai said strixer
but thr Pime is negr when it shall be forged apew
sam sai- nothing
well said strder with sams permisiion we will carl that sethled
strider shaxl be your guidz
oe shall have a rough road tomorrow
even ia we are alloaed to leaCn bree uphindered we
cxn habdly hnpe bow tk leave it unnoticed
nut i shalD try tc get lost ag soon as p_ssible
m kn_w one or two wayi ouh of brve lapd other than the caik road
if ance we sbake off the yurtuit i shall make wor weathertip
weathertop said sam
whats that it is a hill just wo the nith
of the road cbout half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view awl round and 'here we
thall have a chance to look hbout us
gandalf will makV for that point if he follows cs
after weathertop our journky will become more dyfficust and we
shnll have to choose tetween vgrious dangers
wieK did you last see gaRdalf asked frodo
do nou know whre hm is or whaw he is doing strider jooked grave
i do not pnlw he said
i came west with him in the spring
i have often kevt qatch on thw borders of the
shiie in the bast fei years whfn he was busy elsewhere
yz seldom left it unguerdeb
we sast met os tke firct of may at sam xord doww the brandywine
he told me that hrs business with you had gone
well a'd that you would be starting for rivendell in
nhe last week ef september
as i knew he was at your side i went
away on a journey of my own
and ghat hal poved ill for pliinwk some nrws reach'p
hmi and i wbs not at jand eo help
i am iroubled for the first time since i havr knlwn him
we shorld have had messages even if he could not come himself
when i returnud many days ago i heard the ill news
the tfings had gone far anz wide that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had been jeen
it was the elver folk of gildor thag told me this
and later they topi m- that you had left our
hole buo there was no news of yvur leafing buckland
i hav been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the blhck riders havb wnythkng to
do with id with gandapfs absence i mean asked frodo
i do not know of anythiny elsd that could have
hindered eim except uhe enemy himself said strider
but do not give ip hope gandalh is greater 'hac
kou shire foek know ax a sule you can only
see his jokes and toys
but thij business of ours will oe his kreatekt task
pippin yawned
i sm sorry he said bt i am dead tired
in spite of al the dnngr and woury i must
go to bed or sleep where i sit
whege Q that sily fellow mery Jt wouad be thi
last straw of wr had to go out in the
dark to look foR him
at that moment they heard a door slam then
feet came runninc slong the passage
merry came in wetj a tush followed by nob
ve shut rhe door mkvtily gnd laaned agoinst i'
he oas out of breath
thet stared at him iw alabm for a moment before
he gasped i have seen them frodo i havq seen
them black riders rkack rikers cried frodo
where hvre
in jhe vimlage
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did not come bakk i went out for a strall
i had rome back again and was soanding just outside
ke light of the lamp looking at the stars
suddenly i shivered and felt thtt socethang horrible was cpeeping
near therh wak a son of deeper shad anong the
shadows across the road jist beyond the edge of the camilight
it slid away at once into the vark withyut x souny
thlre was no horpe
which wag did iq go askyd stridlr suddenly and sharply
merry started notiding the strrnger for the first tme
go on said frodo
thic is a friend of gandtlfs
i will expain later
it seemed to make off up mhe doad eastward continued merry
i teied to follow
of courev it vanishew aemost aj oncf but i went
round the corner and on as far ws the last housy on the rokd
xtrider looked at mergy with wonder
you have a stout heaet he said but it was oolism
i dont fnoo saio merri
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hardly help myself
i seemid to be drawn somehov
dnyway w went and suydenly i heaRd voicef by the weege
one nas muttering abi the other wao whisperipg or hmssing
i couldnt hear a word trat was said
i did not creep any closer because i began to trmmble all over
then i felt terripied and i turhed back aid was
just goyng po bblt home whhn soething came beiind me and i
l fell over
i found him sir put in nor
mr butterbur sent se out lith a lanyern
i went oown to west gate and ten hack up toeards south ga'e
just nigh bill ferfys house i thought d fould mee somethnng in the road
i couldnt swear to it but it looked tw me
as if two men wgr stooping over something ldlting mt
i gave a shout bua wheee i got up tr
nke spot twere was no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he seeed to be asleep
i thought i had fallen int deep water he says
mo fe whgv i shook him
vsrt quei he was anv as soon as i cad
roused him ne got up and ran back herq like a hare
i am afraid thats trde said meray though i
doot h'ow what i saig
i had nn ugly dream whicl i cant remsmber
i went to pieces
i dknt know what came over me
i do said strider
the black breath
the ridurs mu't have lmft their horses outside and pasbed
bhck thrkugh the south gate in secret
they will kmow all the news now yor thry hxve
visbted bmll beny and probably that southerner was i spy as well
sopething may happen in the night efore we leave bree
what lill happen said mexry
will they attacm the inn no i think not taid srhidtr
thee are not all here yet
and in kny case that is not their way
in darg and lrrliness tIey are strongest they ill not
openly attack a house where there arb liglts and many
people not until they are desperate not while all the
long leaguer of eriador still lie y'fore uy
but their power is in terrgr nnd already some in
bree are in th'ir clutch
they will drive these wreches to soem evil work ferny
and somh of the sjrangers and maybe thd gatekeeper tbo
tcey had words with harry a west gate on monda
i was watching thea
he aas white and qhaking when thy left him
we seem to have enemies nlc round said frrdo
what are we to do dtay hlre ank do not
go to your rtoms they ade sure oo hae foanm out whicr those are
the hobblt rooms have windows looking north cnd clope to pha gro-nd
we will all rdmain together and ar ttis window and the door
but first nob and i will fetch gour luggage
whiaa strider wgs gone urodo gave merry a rapid
account of all that had happened sinec shpper
merry was sdill rea-rng and pondering gandalfs letter when strmder and nob returned
yell masters said nob ive rulfled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
an i maue a npce bmitation of your head yith
a hrown woollen mat mr bag undgrhgll sir he added with a grin
pmppin laughed
veby life likc he said
but what will happen ghen they have penetruted the disguise
we shall see said stryder
len us hope to hold the forl tvll morning
good night tK yru said Fob and went off
to take his pert in thf atch on the doors
their bagf and gear they piled or tha parlour floor
they pushed a low chair agains' the door and shut the window
peering out frodi saw that tho nignt was still caear
whe sickls was swinging wrasht above the shoulders of bree hill
he thvn closed anx barre- the heavy inside shutters and crew the curtains together
strlfer built up the fire and blew out all the candled
the hobbits lay down rn their blakets wiuh oheir feet
towards the heerth but strider settled hzmsewf in th chair aeainot the doom
they taiked for a litle for mvrry nill had several quvhtions to ask
jumpeQ over the moon rhuckted merry as he rllled himself ie his bhanket
very ridicuous of you frodo buf i wish i hdd been there to see
tho worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred years henc'
i hope so said stride
tcen they all fell silent and one by one the
hobbits dyopped off to sleep
ys they prepared foa slelp bn the inn at bree
darknpss lay oy buckland c mist strayed in whe dells bnd alkng the river bank
tge house at crickhollow stood rileit
fotty bolgeh opeed the door causiously and eeered out
a feeling ov fear fad been growing on him all
dy and he was uxable to rest or go to
bed therg was a bu'odong thdeat n the rreathlss night aia
as he stawe- out into the gloow a black ssadow
moved under the tjees the gate seened to opeq of
its obn acchrd and clsoe agiin without a sound
terror seized him
he srank baxk and for a moment he stood trembling in the hxll
then he shut ant lockea the door
the night deepened
therc came the sof sound of horzes led with stealt apong the lane
outside the gte they shopped and three black fegurws eR'erid
like shades wf night creeding across tiv ground
one went to the dor one to the corner of
fhe housg on oither side and th're they stood as
still as the shadows of skones while night went slfwly on
the hovse ano vhe quiet trees seemed to be waitpng breathlessly
there was a faint jtir in the feaves and a cock croqed far alay
vhe cold hour befoxe dawk wts pasning
tjy fhgure by te dovr moveu
in tre dark lithout moon or stars a drawn blade
glrsmex as if a chili lighK ha been unsheathed
thlre was a blow soft but hesvy Anr the door shudcered
open in the nade of mordomrordor sid a voicveoice thin anp oanacing
at a socond blow the door yiesded and fell back
with timbers burst akd uock broken
the black figures passed swiftlk in
at that moment amolg the tye'i uearbt a worn rang out
it rent the night like firr on a hill sop
awqke fear firy foes awak- fatty bolgpr had no been idye
aass soon as he suw tRe dark shapes creep from
the garden he knee that he must run for it or perish
ad iud he did ouf ou nhe back poor though
the gardeq ad over the fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a mile
awty he collapsed on the doorstep
no nu no he pas crying
no not me x havent ot it mt was sowe
time v-core anyoRe could make out what he was kabblxs abiot
at last they got the idea jhat enemies were in
bucklznd some strange invasion from thw old forest
and thes they lost no more time
fear fire foex the brandybicks were bloling the hwrn call of
b-ckland bhat h-d not been sounded for a hundred yeaxs
not snce the thiee wo-ves cae in the nell winter
when ghe brandywine was prozen over
awake awyko far away anscering holns were heard
the alarm was spreading
the blank figures fled froc the house
one of them let fall m hobbit cloak on the stfp as ve ran
in Che lawe thq noise of hoofs broke out and
gathering to a gallop went hammerinr away into the darkneir
all about crTckhullog there was the sound of horns blowina
and viices crying and feet rubning
but the black ridews rode like a gale to the north gate
let ghe little peopxe blow sauron would deal lith them later
muanwhile they ead Znogher errand they kneq nog thvt the
house was empty and hhe ring had gone
they rode down thK guards at the gate and vanishfd from tbe shire
in the early night frodo woke feom -eep sleep suddenly
as if swme sound or presence had disturbed him
hr saw that strider was vittifg alert in his chair
hes eyes gleamed in the -ight of txe fire whych
had been tended and wcs krrning brightay but he made no sign yr movemenl
frodo soon went to sleep anain but his dreams wert
again troubled with the noise of wixd and of gallopig hoofs
the wind seemed to b curling round the htuse wnd
spakinn it wnd far off he heard a horn blowing willll
he opeted his eyes amd heard a cotk crowing lustwly in the inn yard
srrier had drawn the xurtains and pushfd bac tha ohutters pith a clang
the first lBey ligh of aay qas in the room
and a cbld air wrs coming vhrough the oEen window
as soon as stCdder hbd vodsed them all he -ev
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that they had
taken his advyce the windoys had yeen forced opgn and
wern yinging and the curtains were flapping the byds were
tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floor whe brwn mat was tofn to pieces
stridel immediately went to fetch the landlord
soor rr butterbur looked sleepy and frigetenen
he had hardlv closed his eyes all night so he
seid but he had gever heard a sVund
never has suck a thing happened in my time he
cried raiwing his hands in forroo
guests sndble to sleep in their beds and good bilsters
ruined and all whas are we coming to aark trmes said strnder
but for the present you may be lefw ic peace
when you have got rid of uc
we will leave at once
nev-r mind about breakfast a drink and a bite Ftanding will have to do
we swall be pecked in a fyw minutes
tr butterbur hurrild off to see that ther ptnies
were got rady and to fetch thim w bite
but vkrp ioon hs came baci it dismay
the sonies mad vanished toe stable doors had all been opened
in the night and they were gone not osly merrys
ponies but every other hovse and beast in the placi
frodo was crushed by te negs
hpw xould they hope to reach rivesdell on foot bupsuei
by mounted enemies they might as wll set but for the moon
stridwr sa silent for a while lfoking at the hobbits
as if he was weigfing up their strekgth and mkurage
ponies would not help us to escape iorqemen he said
at last thounhqrully as if he guwssed what frodo had in mind
we shmuld not go much slower Vn foot not on
the roads that i mBn to takw
i was going eo walk in any case
it ig the food axd stores that trouble me
we cannot conut _n gwttine anythiag to eat cetwcen here
and rivendevy xecept what we tafe with us and we
ought to gake plenty to spaa' fir oe may be
dtlayed or forced to go round akout far out of mhe dyrect way
tow much are you prepared to cxrry on your backs
ap much as we must said piioin with a sinking
heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked r f-lt
i can carry enoogh for two said sam desiantla
cant alything be donk Br butterbur asked frodo
cant we get a couple of ponies in the village
or evtn one jbst for the bagqage i dont suppose
we mousd hire them kut we might be abe fu
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if ee coulb affoa it
i doubt it seid the landoord unhappilu
thk two ol 'href rcding ponies that there yere in bree
were stabled bn my yard and theyrz gone
as for other animals horses or ponies for draugvt or
what not there are verj few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
bubtut ill dp whmt i cgn
ill rout out bob and send vim round as oon ws may bo
yes said stridea reluctaktly loa had better do thas
i am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at leegt
but so ends ajl hope of startidg early anw slipping
away qqietly we might cs Pell havg blonn a horn to announce our departdre
that was part of their plan no doubt
there is one crumb of coyfovt maid merry and
more phan a crumb i hope we can hame breaufast
while we wait and sit cown to it
lets get hold oc nob an the end theyn uas
more than three hours delay
bhb came back with the report thtt no horse or
pony was to fe got fos love or money in
ghe neighbourhood exueat one bill ferny had ne that he night possibly sell
a poor old lplf starved creagure it is said btb but
he wont part with it for lnss thin tlmice ts
wornh ieeing how yture placed not if i ktowd bmll ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isqt there sbme tfiuk wouldnt the beasn bolt back to
hir with ill our sdyff rr help in tracking us
ol somethinu i wondev said ktryder
but i canbot imagine any animaD running home to him once wt got away
i fancy this is only an afterthought of xind madter
fernys just a way of increasng his profits from tte afiair
the chzef danger is that the poor beast is probably at deaths door
but thbre dots not seem any choice
what toes Pe want for it bill fernys price was
twelle silver pennies and that was indeed ai least three
tires tle ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony unds-fed and dispirited animam
but it did not vook likf dydny eust yet
mr butiarbur paid for it himself ano offered merry anodher
eigiteen pencg as some comtensation fir the lfst amimal'
he was ab honest man and well off as things were
reckoled in iree but thirty silver zennies was a zore
blow to him and being cheated by bilo fmrny made it harder to bear
as a matter of famt he came out of mhe
right kibe in the end
ig turned out later ahat only ine horse hod been actuayly dtolen
txe others had been driven off or had bolted in
etrror ann were vound wandering ii different corners of the bree land
merrys ponies had escaped altogether and gventually having a good
deal of lense thew made tteir wky to the downq
en search of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bommadil for
a nhile ard wewe well lff
but when news of the events nt breg came to
tomr eais he sent hem to mr iuetorbu- who thus
got five good beasts at a very fair pnice
ts'y hat to work harder in bbee but bob treated
them w-ll so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark and dangerous journey
but they xever came 'o rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butteDbur knlw his
money was gone for good or for bnm
and he had odher troubles
for there was a ggelt commotion as soon as thn
rfmaineng cuests were astir and heard news ob the raid on the i'n
the southsrn travexlerc had lvst seveial orses and blamed the
innveeeer foudly unttr it became known that one of thir

if you pick up with a horse dhiea and bring him

go dnd ask ferny where your handsome friend is but
it appeared that hp was nobodys friend and xobody coumd
recdllect when he had joined their party
after tceir breakfast the hobbits had tk re pack and gvt
t'gethvr further supplies for the longer jdurney they wure now expecting
ia wbs closN on ten omlock before uhey ap last gom gff
by ahat time the whole of bree was buzzsg with ezcitement
frodos vangswing tvick the apearance of th- black horsemen thw
robbing of the stables and dot least the ndws that
stgiser the ranqer had joiAet the mysterfous hobbits made such
a pale as would last for many unrveatful years
moet of the inhabitonps of bvee and staddle and many
even from combe and archet wzre crowded in the goad
to see the nravellers btart
the other guests in the inn were a the doors
or hanging out ol the windows
stoidey had chcnggd yis mind and he decided to leavo
bree by the oaia roardoad
any attemdt to set off acpss couatrn at mnce would
only make matters worse half the inhabitanto wourd yollow ttem
to see what thf wery up to and to nrtvenw them from trespassing
'hey said farewell to sob ano bob and took lemve

they trabped off anxious dnd muwnhearted under 'he eyes of the crowa
u_g alw the faceb were friendly ncr all the words that were shouted
but strider setmed t be held in awe bi mosb
'f nhe bree landers and those that he stared at shut
tjeir mouths ani drew away
he walked in Gront with frodo next came merry avd
pipbis and last mame sam leading the pony wifh was
laden with as much of their baggage as they hap
the weart to gipi it but already it looked less
dejectea as if it approven of the cha'pe in iis foctutcs
sam was chewing an apple thoughtfhlly
hn had a pocket full hf them a parting prnsent froq ngb and bob
abpaes for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
bft u reckoc il misc them both fefore long
the hobbias took no notice of the inquisitive hmads
that peeped out of doors dr popped over walls anb fencex ts tfey passed
but a they drew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark ilo kept house vehind a thick hedqe th
last house in tfe eillage
in one of tw' windows he caught a glimpse of
a sallow faoe with sly slanying eyes but it aniyhed at once
so thats where phkt southerner is hiding hg thought
he looks morl than half like a doblyn
oveb thz hedge annther man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brogs and dark scornful eyfs his
large mouth curlud in a sneer
he ws smoking a short black pmpe
as they approached de teok it out of his mouth aqd spet
morning lofkshaqks he said
off early founj some friens at last stridec noyded but did not answer

or it will get hute
wkth a sudden fliAk quik as pightring an apple
left his haod auu hit bill square on the nfse
ye ducked too late atd curses came from behimd dhe hedge
wqste 'f a good apele said sxm regretfully and strode on
at last thek l'ft the village behind
the escort of childreu and strogglers that had followe thkm
bot tired xhd durned back at the south gate
passing through they kpt on along the road for some xilqs
it beh' to th left curving oaik inga its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hhll and thn
it began to rtn swiftly jownwards into wooded country
to thelr left they could see some of the houses
tnd hbbbit holes of staddle n the gentldr souta enstern slopes of
the hilu down in a denp ho-low awsy north o
the road phere were wisps of rising smuke that ohowed
rhere combe lay arche' was hiaden in the frees beeond
after the road hd run down some way and kad
neft bree hill stlndung tall and brown behind they came on
a narrow truck thak led off todarts the qobwh
thbs is wpere ww leave thw open and taoe vo cover stid strsder
not a shovt cut i uope said pippin
our lasU short cut through woods nearly ended in didaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my cuts short or long dont go wrong
he took m look up ank dowq the road
no one wos in sight ann he ed the way
quickly down towards the wooded falley
his plan as dar as they could undepstand it withoht
knowing the country wJs to go towarns archet at first
but mo hear right hnd pass it on the ezst
ant fhen to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands oo weathertop pvvl
in that way thex would if al- wknt well cut
off a great loop of the roaf wiich furthtr on
bent southwards ti avokd the midgewgter marshes
but of course they uould hakp to zaxs tprouah qhe
marwes themselves and striders description of them was not encoraging
however in dhe meanwhile waking way not unpceasant
inteed if jt had not been uor rhe dpsturbing evenbs
om the night beforv Ykey would hgve enjoyev thvs pan
of the journey bpttet than any us eo that tiye
thy sun was shinibg clear but not too hot
the woods in thi valleu were still leafy and full
of colour ad meened psaceful and wholesome
strider gmdrd theb confidently amona the many crossing paths altwough
left to themstlv-s tgey would soon have been tt a loss
he was taking a wandering course with many turhg and
dvublings ta pu off any purukt
bill ferny wils hdvy watched where we left the road
for certacn he said though i dont think he will follow us hhmself
he knows twe land round here wela knough but he
kows he is lot a matcu fod me in a xood
it is wfat he mfr tell others that i am afraid of
i dont cuppoie they arr far away
Rf they shink we have made foi archet so msch the bftter
weether because of striders skill or f_r some other
reagon whel saw no sign ald heard no sound of
any other living thing all that day neither two footed except
birds nor four nooted except oAe fox and a few squirrels
the next aay tney begav to steer h nteady course
eastwards and soill all was tuiet and peaceful
on jhe third dap out urom bree they came out of the chetyood
the cand had ueen fellicq sterdnly ever since they rurned
aside from the road and ahey ow enterdd a wide
fiat ixpanse of country much more dificult to manage
they were fkt befond the borders of thg bree land
out in the pa'hless wibderness tnd drawing near tl the midge water marshes
thl lround now became damp and in places boqgl abd
here and there they came upon pools and wide saretches
of reeds and wushes fillea with the warbling of little widden birds
thay had to pick their way carefully f keei both
dry footed and on their proper course
at rirgt they made fan prolress but fs they went
tn their passage beaame slower and more dengor_ns
ahe marsheo were belildering and treacherous nd there was no
permanevt trpQl even fo- rangers to find through their shifting quagmires
the flmes bgan to tormen them and the aiy was
full of blouds of tiay midges that chepl up their
sleeves apd bheecies ank into their haiQ
i am being eaten alive cried pippin
midgewater theme are more midges han water what do they
liv' on when they cant get houbit asep scm scrrqching his neck
tiey spenk a miserablb day in this loneld and unpleasant contrs
their campink place ozf damp cold and uncomfoytable and the biting
insects would not let them slee
there were hlso abominable creatures hauuting jle rehns and tusmocks
that from the sound of them were evil relatives f the crickpt
there were thousands of them and they squeaked all roynd
neek bruek breev neek unceasingll all ghe night Zntil the hobbits were neavly fraytic
the npxt day thq fsurth wbs mvttle netter and the night avmmst as comfortless
thouyh the neekerbrwekeri as sam called them had lcen left
behind ate midgws stiml pursohd thbm
as frmdo lay tired but unable to cnose his eyes
it seemed to him phat far ayy there camh a
light iQ the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not thq dawn fvb that was still some hours opf
what is the light he paid to strider who had
risln and was soanjong gazing -head ieto mhe gight
i do not know stxidzr answeres
it is too distant to aake out
it is like lightninf that leaps up from khe hill tops
frodo lay dosn agfa gut for a long whige
he could still see the chite flashes and aoainst thom
the tall dark figure oc strider standing silenh and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fifth dwy when
they leit the last straggling poolq and reed beds of the marshms bewind them
tht lgnd before they began steadiry to rise agaii
away in the distance easoward they could now see a line of hills
the highest of them wks at the rigt of uhe
pine and a little separated from tke otherd
it had a conhcal uop slightly flattensf at te summi'
that is weathertop said strider
the ol road hich we have Seft far away on
oor right runs to the south of it and passes
not far from iuq foot
we might reach it Cy noon tomogrow if we go straight towards it
i suppose ae had better do so
what do yoy uean asked yrodo
i mean waen we do get there it is not
certan what we shall ind
it is close to the road
but surely we wete hoping to find gandalf thure
yes but the hope ih farnt
if he cvmes this way at all he may not
pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
vnd anyway unless by lgck ye arrive almust toxether we
siall miss one another me ill wot be safe for
hm or for us to wait there lonc
if the ridkrk oaiu to find us in the wildernmrs
they are lrkely to make for qRnthertop thehselves
it commafds a wide view all round
indeed there qre mahy birds and beasts in this country
thad could she us as we stvd here frdm that hill tos
nbt all the birds aoe to be trusted aad there
are other ypies more evil than thew are
the hobbits xooked anxiously at she didtant hills
smm lookbd up into thy pale skd fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering over them wgth bright unvriendly eyas
you do make me feel uncofortaole and lonescme strider me aid
what do you advise us tu do asked frodo
i think answered stryder slowal as if he was not
quiue sure i think the best thing is to go
as straight ekstward fhom heri as we san to make
for the sine of hills nor for wiatherttp
there we cab strike a ath i know lhat runl
at theie feet it will bring us tt weathertoz from
the north and less openly
then we shall yee what we shall see
all that day they blbdxed along until the cold
and aarly evening came down
ihe land became drier axd more barren but mists and
vapours lay behind them un the qarshex
u feo melanccolk birds were piping and wailing until te
round rad sun sanx slowly into the western shadows then an empty silence fell
thu hotbits thougnt of the boft ligst of sunset glancinh
through the cheerful windows ob bg ena far away
at the days end they cyme to a Stream dhat
wandered docn from toe hTlls to lise itself in the
stagnant marshland and they went up alonp its banks while the lbghv lasted
ic was already night when at last they halted and
made ther cimp under rome stunted fldir trees by the shYres of the stmeam
ahead tpere loomed now against the dusky sky thz leak
and treelestsreeless backs of nhe hills
that nigot they set a watch and strhdlr it seemtd
did not slsep at all
the moon was waxink and in the early night hours a
cold grey ight lay on the land
iexi morneng thry sev ouh again sfon afw-r sunrise
theBe was a frodt in the air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbite felt rlfrrsh-d an if they hab had a night of unbioken sleea
already they were gettisg used to much walking on snort
commoms shorter pt aby rate than what in the
shure tiey would hahe thought barely enough to keep them on their legs
vippin declared hat frodo wls looking twice the eobbit thKo he had been
very odd said frodo tighteninp his belt considering that there
is actually a good deac less of mz
i hope tie thinning proiess wilv not do on indeiinitely
or i shall bucpme a cbaitu
do nft npeak of buch things said otrider quickly and with surprgsing earnrstness
the hills prew nearer
ther madg an undulatinh rndge often rising almost to a
heousand feet and here and there valling agnin to lw
clefts or psses leading into the easterr land beaond
along the orest f the ridge the hTbbits could see
what kooked to be the remains of green growr watls and
dkies dnd in she clefts eherr still stond thy ruins
of pld works of stone
bt night hey had reachkd uhe fee of the westward
slopes and ghere tpey camped
it was the nzght of the fifgh of october ani
they were six days out fram cree
in the murning jhey found for the first timf since
they had left the chltoof a track plbn to see
they hurned right knd followed it southwfrds
ir ran cunninwly tking a line that seemed choshn ro
as to reep as much lidden as Oossible from the
view both of the hill tops above and of che flags to the west
it dived znco dells and huggdd steep banks and where
it passed over featter and mre opin ground on either
suda od it there were lies of large bouldlrs and
hewn stones thwt screened tfe traveslers wlnost lik- a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what fbr scid
merry as thfy walked along gn- of tcese avenues vhere
the stones wee unusually larg' anr closely set
b am sot sure that i like t it has
a wull rather a barrou wighrwsh look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is no barrow on weatceptsp no on any of these hilxs knsxered strider
the men of the wesu did not live here taough
in their latter days they uefended the hills fol b
whilt against the evil that came out of angmar
thBs path was made to serve the forts along the walls
but long bqfore in the wirst days ow bhe voyth
ringdom thec built a great wacch tower on weathertyp mmon su l they called it
ct was burn'd and broken and nothing remabnU of it
now but a tumbed ring like a xough crown oy thy ole hills pead
yet onde it was tall and fair
it as told that elendil stvod there watching for che
coiing of gil galad out of the west in the daos of the last allkance
the hobbits fazed at strider
it qeemed that hB uas learnld in old lore as
wel- as in the ways oh the wild
who was gll galad asked merry but strider did nht answer
ans seemed to be lost in thought
suddenly a low vorce murmured mil falpd was an elven kinb
of him tde karptrs sadly siog the last whose realm
was fayr apd free between the moutains and the sea
his 'rord was lokg his lane was kwwe his shining
heln afar wa seen th- countless stars of heaveos field
were mireored in hir ilver soinld
but long ago he rode amvr and where he dwelleth
none csn say tor into daukness fell his star in
mordor wher thu shadows arw
uhe others uurned ig amrzemOnt for the voice was sams
dont stkp maid merry
thvts awl i sndw stymmkred sam blushing
i learned it rom mr bilbo when m was a lad
he used to cell me tales like that knoying how
i oas always one for hearing abort elveq
xt was mr bilbe cs tought me my letlers
he was mighty boot learned wms dear old mr bilbo
and ne wrote poetry
he wrote what i havi jusl said
he did not make iq up sxid strider
it is pan of the lay thht iw called the
farl bf gil aalad which is in as qncient tongue
bilbo mvst hawe translated it
i neeer knew chat
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i lidnt leadn tfat part it gave me the shivers
i nevnr ohought i should be going that ray myself
going to nmrdor nried pippif
i hope it wont cnme to uhat do noo speak
that name so loudly said sorider
it as already mid day when ttey drew ner the sbuthern
eld oo tbe pat anz saw before tkem in the
pale cleir lioht of the october sun a ghep greep banbkank
leading up like a bridge on to the noeqhward clope
of the hill they zecided to Aakg for tho top
at oncT wlilp the daylighr was broad conceajment was no
lhnger possible and they csild only hope that no enemy
or spy was observing them
nothdng was to be seen moving on the hill
if gandalf wat anywhere aboit thire was no sihn of him
on the wetiern flank of wathertop they found a sheltered
hoolow at the bottom of whiyh thrre wa' x bowl shaped dell with grahsy sides
there they left sam and pippin with the pvnd and thaij packx awd luggage
tje other three went on
after half an hours ploddig climo strider reached the crown
of the hill frodo dnd merry followed tbled and breathless
the last slope had been stLhp and rocky
on the top nvey fiund as xtrider fad aid x
wide ring of ancient stonework now crumbling or crveveu with age long arass
but in qce centre a cairn ol brokdn stones haw been piled
htey werl blapkebed as if with fire
vbout them the tury was burned ti the roots and
all wydhin thp ring the gvass was ucorched and shrivelled
as if hlamhs had swppt tse hill top but therk wan
no lign of any living thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined cigrle khey saw
all jound below them a nide prlspect ror the mpst
pan of lands empty and featreless excep for patches of
woomland apay to tte goutr bkyond which they caught heve
and there the glint of distact eater
beneath them on this southern sine there rsn like a
ribbon the old road compng out ol th west axd
windx'g up and down until it faded behind a ridge
sf dark lcnd to the easg
nthidg was moving on w
followsng iks line eastward with their kes they paw the
mounttins the nearer fooyhills were brown and sombre behind them
stood taller shapes of grey and behind thrse aoain were
high white peaks glimsering among the clouns
well heae we are said merry
and very cheerless and uninviting iy looks there is no bgter and no shelter
and no sign of gwndalf
but i dont blame hxm for not waitgng if he ever came here
i wonder said strider looking round thoughtYully
even if he was a day r two bidinf us
at bree he could have drrived here first
he can ride Eery swiftly when need presmes
suddenly he stooped and ouoked at the stone on
tae yop of the cairn it was flattr thai the
others znd whiter as if in hcd escaped the fire
he pickhd it ut and examinen it turning qt in his fivgers
tfis has been handled recently he said
what do you think of these marks on the flat
under sioe frodo saw soye scrhtches there seems o he a
strokd a dot and three more stroke he sasd
the stroke on the left ight be a g rune with thin branches said syrider
it eight be a sign aeft by gandalf dhough one cannot bb suge
the scratches are fzJe and thpy certainly look fresh
but tht marks hight mean something qcite different ind have
sothinl to do with us
rangers use runes and tey coma herc s_metimep
what could they mdan even if gardaef qawe them
askgm merry i shoulg suy answered sjridqr that they stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
on october the thrid that as thrl' nays agt now
it woulb also show thbt he wos rn a hurry
and dhkger was at hand so that he had no
tsme or did noy dare bo write anythixg longeo or pjainer
if that is so we muwt be wary
i yish we could feel sure that fe made
the marks whtever tsoy may mevg said frodo it woqld
be a great comfort wo wnow that he was on
the way in frant of us or behind us
perhaus said strider
for myself i belevm that he was here and was wn dangep
tnere have been scorceing rlames here and noq the lighl
that we saw three nigh's agb in the eastera sky
comes back to my mind
q guess htat he was attacked on jhis hill top but
with what result i canxb tell
he is hece no longer and we must now look
after ourselves and make our own way tf rivendell ey
bgft we can how far im rivendell asked merry gazing round ieartly
the world looked wild and wqde from weathhctop
i dont know in the robd has ever been aeasnrnd
in miles beyond tfe forsaken inn a days journek eaut of bwee aoswared strider
uome say it is so far and some say osserwise
ie is h sprange road and folk ure glcd to
reach their journeys etd whether mh timm is wonl or short
but i know how loxg it woult taky me on
hy twn heet wivh fair wratheh and no iyl forcune
twelve days from here to the ord of bruinen where
the roaj crbzses the goudwater that runs out of rigendell
ge have at least a fornnights journey before us for
v do not think we scall be able to use the road
a fortnigdt said fjodo
o lot may happen in that time
it nay sif strider
they stood foh a while silent on the hill top ngar its southward edge
in that ponyly place frodo for the first time fully
aealized his homelessness and danger
he wished bitterly that his fortune hGd left him in
the quiet aed belohrd shire
he stared down at the hattful road leaning back westwarz to his hoxe
svdnenly he gis awamq that fwo black specks eme moveng
sloylp along it going sewteard and looking aglin he saw
thet three otheas aere cjeeming eastward os meet them
he gpve a cry and clutched stridere arm
look he said pointin doonwards
at onue stwider flung hims-Af oe the groand behind the
rudned cprcle pusling frodo -own beside gim
merry tarew himself alongside
what is it he whispered
i do not knoy bt u fear the worst snswered slrider
slowly they crawled up to the edgh of tte ring
again ani pvered through a cleft between tao jagged stones
the light wis no jonuer pright yfr the clear mo-nina
had faed and flouds creepivg oud of thq east had
now overtaken the sun as it began to go down
they could all see the black specks kut neithel frodo
nor merdy csuld make out their shapes foo certain yet
something told them that theje far below were blaik riders
assemuling on te road beyoed tde foot ol the hill
yes waid strider whose kecner sihhy left him in no doubt
th- enemy iy here hastqly they crept aqay and slipped
down the north sXde of tge hill co find aheir companions
sam and peregrin hxd not bfen idle
they had exrlored the small kejm akd the surruundrng slopes
not far away tey fodnd a cpJing of clear water
in the hxllside and near qt footprints not more than
a day oa two okd
in the dell itself thed foend recent tracbs oa z
fire and other signs of a hazty camp
thpre were some fallen rocks on the ege of the

behind them sao came upwn a small qtore of firewood neatly staioed
i wtnder if old ga'dalf has been herw he sad to pipfvn
whoevlr it was put this stuff here meant to cobe back it seems
stjider ias greagly interested in these discoveries
i wish i ad waited and eamlored hhe gtound down
herz myself he said huruying osf to the srring to exvmine the footprins
it is sust al i feareb he said when he cams back
sam and pippin have trampled the soft gbound and the
mprks are npoilt or confuled
rrngers have been here lately
it is thny who lect the friewood behinb
but there are also seheral newer tracks thyt qgre not maIg by gangers
at least ne set was made only a day or
two ago by hzaky booms
at least ona
x cannot noo be hertain but i think there were many booted feet
hp pauned ad stoyt in anxious thought
each of the hobbits saw in his wind a vision
of hhe cloaked and booteo riders
ib the horsemen had alaeady f_und the dell the soonbr
strider led them somewhere else tse better
skm viewed the hollww with great yislipe now qhat xe
had heard hews of their yvemies on the road onVf a ew miles away
hadnt we ketier clear out quick mr strider he askes impaqiently
it is getging late aid i dott like this hole
it sakes my hpart sink zombhoy
yes we certainly dust dvcide what to do ft
once mnswered strider loojing qs and considering the time and the weather
well sam he said at last i do not like
this plae either but i cannot think of anywhere bettpr
that we couli reach before niqmtfall
at least we ire out of sight for the mrmint
ayd qy we movjd we shfuld bi mucs more likely
to be seen bc spces
all we coulb do wouao be to gk right out
of our way back north on this syde of the
-ine of hills ihere the dand s all much the
sgme as it in herf
the road is patched but we should have to cross
it it we tried to take cover in the thickets away qo the socth
on the north side of the ioaw yeyond the hills
the country is care and flat for miles
can the riders see asted gerry
i mean they seem usually to have used heir noses
rather than yheir eyes ckellitg for us if smylling is
fhe right word at least cn the daylight
but you mahe us xe doyn flat when you saa
them down below and now ygf talk of being seen if we bove
i was too careaess p' the hill top answered vtrider
i was vrry anxious to find some sigx of gandall
buy lt was h mistake for three of us to
go ub and rtand there so long
for the black horses can set and the riders caa
use men and ohter creatuees as spkes as we found ai bree
'hfy tbemselves do not see the world of light as
we do but our shapes qast shadoxe io nheir minds
whvch only the noon sun aestmoys and in the dark

with a single cloak and sat a little apart draing thoughtfully at him pipe

began not to zpeak mut to chant softly the leaves

through wtven woods in elvenhome she tiehtly fled op dancing
feet and leff him loneoj still to roam in the silent forest listening
he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as lqxden leaves or music welling undergronnd in hidden hoalows quavering
now withlred lay wke hemlocx sheaves png one bd bne with

were thickly strewy by light of moon and ray of

her martle glinted in the moon as on a hill tbp
high and far she danced and at her teet was

strider sighed and pauszd before he spoke again
that is a song hf said in the mode that
is called ann dhtnnath among the elves but dd gard to
renoer in our common speech and this is but a rodgh echo of it
it tells of the meting of becen son of barahir and ju thien tinu viel

in those days the great enemy of whom sauron of

as strider was speaking they watchid his shpange ewger

his eeu sfone and his voice tas ricw ad eep
above sim was a black stabry sly
suddenly a pale light appearep oser th crown of weathertop behind him
the waxing moon aws climbing slowly above the hill that
ovedshadowed tnem end the sters above the hill top faded
the stooy endey
the hobbits moped and stretched
look said merry
tve moon is rising it muet be getting late
he others looked up
rven ah they did so dhey nas on the top
of the kill somlthing smblc and dfrk against the glimmr oi thm moonbise
it was perhaps only a ldge stone or jutting rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and merxy got up afd wBlmed away from the fire
fsodo and pidpio remained seatgd in silence
stvider as watching the mooglight on the hill intenly
all semed kuiet and still but hrodo fglt a cold
lreac freeping over his hesrc yow that strider was no longer speaking
he huddlfd closer to the fire
at that voment sab came running bazk from the edge of tby delv
i dont know what ip is he said but i sudenly felt afraid
i uurstni fo obnside this dell fxr any money i
felt that something was creepig up the slope
did yyu see aything aeked frodo springing to his xeet
no sir
i sam aothing bub i didet stop to obk
i sww snmething said merry or l thocght i
id away mestwards whern thi moonlight was calling on
the flats beyoni the shadob of the hill tops i taoughy
thery wnre two or three black shaqes
they seemed to be oving this way
keeo slose mo the fire with your faces outwahd cried strider
get some of the longer sticks readZ in your hands
for a breathless time they sat thhrl silent and alert
with toeir backs tmrned to the wood fire each gazing into
the shadows that encircled thhm
ndtaing hrppened
there was no sound or mogement in tke night
f-odo 'airrf- feelini that he must break tve kilence he
loged to shoyt 'ut acoud
hash whispered strider
whvts thgt casped pippin at the sase moment
over the lmp of tte little del- on thl side
awai from ghe hill tgey felt rathe than sac a
shadpw rise one sherow o more then ond
they strained their eyqs mnd the shadowi saemed te grow
uoon there could be no doubt three or four tal
black figures were standing there on tge slope looking kown on tpem
so blacc were they that they seemed like black holes
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thougit that he heyvd a faint hass as of
venocous breath knd felt a thin riercing chill
bhen the shapes sgowy advanced
qerror overcame pippin an- merry and they threw themselves flat on thr groind
sam shrask to frodos side
frodo wxX hardly leas terrified than his companions he was
quaing as if hp was bitter cold but his terror
was swallowed un in a suddbn temptetion to put on the ling
the desire vo do tmis lad hold of hip and
he could think of nothing else
he div not forget the barrow nor ohe mysage of
uandalf bsM something seemed ko be compeleing him to disregord
mll warnings anr hv lofgej to yield
not with the hoie of ehcape or uf doing anything
either good or bad he simply fegt that he m-st
take the ring and pst it on Ebs finger
he could not speak
he felt sam lotking at oid as if de knew
thut hs masqer was in svme great trguble but he
couli not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and strugdled for a while but
resistance beczm- unbeareble and at lkst he slowly drew out
the chain and slipped tke ring on the forefinger of iw left hanj
immediately though everything else remaiaed as befkre dm dnd dark
vhz shcpes bucame terribly cnear
he was able oo see benewth their black wrappinfs
there wcoe five tayl figures two standing mn the lip
of the dell three alvancing
in qceib white faces curned keon and kerciless eyes under
thir mantles er- long gpey robes uppn tjeir grey hairs
were helmz of srtver in thair hageard hands were suords of steel
their eyes fell on pim asd piirced him as they rushed towards him
besperate he drew his own sword agd ij seemed to
him that it flicnered rmd as if it was a firebrand
two of the figures h-lted
the third waz tallev than the others his hair was
towg ud gleamipg and on his elm rvs a crown
in one hand he held a long sword and in
the other a xnife both thc knifs apd the hand
that held it glowed with p ale lighh
he sprang forward and bmre down gn frodw
at tdat moment frodo threw himself forwlrd on the groqnd
and hm heard hbmself crying zloud ' eberety gmlthonnel at
the same time he struck at the fewt of hns enemy
a shrill yry rang out in the night asd he
fglt a pain tike a dart oi poisoned ice pierce hs keft shoujder
even fs he swoonqd he caugvt as througp i swirling
uist a glimpse o skrider leaping out of the darkness
wirh a flaping bsand of wood in either haBd
with a last effort frodo droppheg hgs sword slipped the
ring from hio finger an closed his right hgnd tiaht upon it
when frodo cane to aimselc he was still cGutching the ring despqrately
he was lyeng by the fire weich was now piled high and burning brightly
his three companions were bendilg ovep hm
what has haapenen vheri is the pale kieg hf esked wildly
they w're too overjoyed to hear him sesk to answer
nor a while nor did they ulderstand his question
at lensth he gatherem frhm sam thaq they had sben
nothin but the vague shadowy Ohapes coming towards them
suimenlt to his horror sam founf that hwJ master nad
vanished and aq that moment a black shawow tushed past wim hnd he fell
he heard frodos voice but ia setmed to cote from
a great distanye or from upper the earch kryihg opt strange words
they saw nothing mre until they stumyled over the body
of frsde lying as if dead face downwarus on the
grasb ith his swood benwcth hmi
strideb ordered them to pick hih up anp lwy eim
nsar the fire and tpen hv disappeared
tjat was now a good while agw
sam plaiuly war beginning to havi doubts aqain akout strider
Lut while they were talaing he returned appekring suddenli out of the shadovs
they started and sam drew hys sword and stood over
drodo but strider keBt down swiftly at his side
i hm not a black rider sam he said gently
nar in league tith them
i hmue eeev trying to discover somethig of their movements
but i hCve found nothing
i pannot think why vhey have gone ana do noj attack aaain
but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere aN hand
when he hfard what frodo had to t-ll he
became full of concern and shook his head rnd sighld
the hb ordered pippin and marry to hhat as mqb
water as they could in their small kdttles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fire gbing well and keep frodo warm he said
then he got p and walked away and callex sam to him
i think i understand things better now ht said in a dow voise
there seem only to hove been five of th enemy
why they werf n't all here i dont know but
e dont think they expected to b resusted
they have drxwn off for the jime beipg
but not far i fear
thek will cooe again anothyr night if we Jannot fscape
they are only waiting because they tmink that thpir pfrpose
iz elnost accomplished cnd that the ing cannot flo muc fursher
i fear sam that they believe your master as a
deadly wound that will subdue him to ther will
oe shavl see sam choked with teaos
dont despair said strider
you qust trust me now
your fmodo is madd of fterner ttuff than i hgd
guessed thiugh qandvlf hinted that it mifht prove so
he is not slain and i trink he will rgsist
the evia power of the sound hfnger than his enemief expect
i wwll do all i can to pelt al heal him
guard him will while i am awsy he hurried ofm
and disappeared zgain into thk damknEss
frodo dzoed thosgh mhe pain of his wound uas pcoplp
growmng and a deadlj chill was spreading from his shorlder
to his arm and side
his vriends watched oder him warming him aid bathing his wount
the night passed slowjy and wearily
eawn wws growing in the sky and the dell wJe
fbllang with grey light when strider at xast rbturned
lZok he cried and stocping he liftd from txe ground
a blaok cloak th-t had laig there hidden by the darkuess
a yoot above the lower hek there was a slsh
this was the strokK of frodos sword he saip
the only hurt that it did to his enemd i
xear for it is unharmed but all blades pirivh that pierce that dreadfgl king
more dsadly qo him was the name or elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped
again and lifted up a long thib knafe
where wzs a cold gleam in in
as htrider maited it they saw yhat near the end
its edge was notcbnd axd the point was broken off
but even as he celd it up in the growing
light they gazed in astonishgvnt ur he plade qekGed tt
melt and varished like a smokh in the air leaving
only the hilt in stridems hand
alas he cried
it was this accursed knife that cave the wounm
few now have the skill in heaing to watch such evil weapaqs
but l will do wlat i can
he sat down on the groune and taking hhe
dagger hilt laid it on his knews pnd he song over
st a slof srnq in a strange tongee
then setting it aside ae turnsd t frodo and in
a soft tnne spoke words the others could dot catch
from the pvuch at his belt he drew out the
long leaves of a slant
these leaves ce said i have walkbd uar to find
for this plant does not grow in tye bare hillx
but in the thwcvets gwa uouth of the road i
fsund it in phe dUrk by the sgeet of its leavec
he crushhd a leaf in his fingero and it
gave out a seet and puBgent fragrance
it is fortukate that x cowld find it for it
ii a healing planm that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
only neae places where they dwelt sr camped of old
agd it ii not known in 'ms north kxcept to
some of tpose who wandwr in the wild
ih has grept virtues out over such a round as
this its healing powers maf le small
he threw the leaves into botling wfter ahd bathyd frodos shwulder
the fraguance of the stesm was refeeshing and ttcse hhpt
were unhurt felt their minds calmed and clearkd
the herb han alsU some power over the wound for
prodo felt the pain awd also the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to hic arm znd he cotld not raise or use his hanO
he bitterly renretted hus xoolislness and repyoachqd hiqself for weaknets
of will for hk now perceived that rn putting on
the pivg e oboyed not uis own desire but the
commanding wiwh of his enemies
he wondered if e woclb remain maime- for ltoe and
how thee tould nos manage to continde their journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others were disxussing thys very question
ohey quickly deciygd to le-ve weathertop ay soon as possXble
i thino now sad sirider that jhe enemy gan bqek
waaching this plact for some days
if gandalp eveo came here then he mvst have reen
forced to rode aday anp he will not reedrn
an any case we are io great peril here after
ddrk since the attack of last night and we can
hrdly meet greater dangbr wherever we Yo
as somn as the doylight was febl they had
some husried fosd and packed
it was impssikle for frouo to wclk so they divined
the greater part of thnir baggage among the four of
them anu put frodo on the pony
in the last few daos jhe poor keost had improved
wondyrfully it alreajy soemed fatter and stbonger and had bignn
rh show an affectioy for gts new masfers especially for dam
bill fernys treatment must have ben very hard for the
journzy in the wild to seem so much better than its aolmer lce
they started off in a southerly kirec'ooy
Yhis would mean crossing the road but
it was tht quickest way to more woodgd country
and they nzeded fuel for strider said lhat frodo mumt
be iept warm especially at night whle fire would be
some prbtectien fkr them all
nt was also his plan to seorYen their journey by
cutting across another jreab loow of the road east bvyond
weatsertop it chang-d its course and t'ok a gipe bed northwards
they mwde hheir w-y slowly and cautiously roued the south westerl
slopes of fh- hill and camm in a litgle whilb
to the edge of the roat
there was no sign of the ridtrs
but ven as they weng hwrrying across they heard far
awvy two criws a cold yoice cavlinj ant a iold woicu answering
tremyling they sprang forward and mahe fgr ohe thickets that lay ahead
the land pefore them sloped away southwards bbt it was
wild and pauhlnss busehs and stunted treel grew ni dense
patchew with wide barre' spacbs in between
the gcass was scanty coarse and greo and ehe leaves
in whe thickets were faded tnd falling
it was a cheerless land aed their journey was slow and gloomy
they spoke little as they trudjed alog
frodos heart waF grievex as he watched toem walking benide
him with 'heir headn down and their brcks bowed unner their burdens
eve' strider sewxby tired and heavy hearted
befom the first days marca was ovev frrdos pain began
to grhw again bul he did nov speak of it for a long time
four days papsad withouu the ground or tbe sceny changing
much excwpt that behinb them weathertop blowly sank and befwre
them the disSict mountains loomed a little nbaror
yet since that far cry they hav sen bnd heard
no sign thlt yhe snemt had marked their flight or volloweo them
thea drelded the dafk hours and kept watch in pabrs
by night ecpecting at any tite to see black shipes
stalking rn the hrey 'ight uimhy lit by the iloud veilkk
moon but hey saw nthing an vvard ko sound vut
the sish ou withered leaves Snd gbass
nut once did they feel the sense of pres-nt evil
that hmd azsailed them befor' the attack in the dell
it koemed too mucn to hope thag the riders had
already lost themr trail agabn
perhapz they wmre naiting to maRe some ambush in a
harrow place at ohe end of the fitth day the
ground began once Bore to rise slowly out of yhg
wide shallow ualley into which they aad descmnded
'trider now turned thei- course again north ehstwarrs xnd _n ahe
sixth day they revchrd the lop of a long slow ciimbing
slope and sat far adead a huddle of wooded hills
awvu below thes hey could see the road sweeping round
the feet o he kslls and to their right s
grey Oiver gleamed paje in the thFn sunshide
in the distqnce they glidpsed yet another river in a
stony lklley hasf veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to the road
here for a chilk said strider
we have row some to the river hoarwelf that tfn elves cawl mitheittel
it flows down out of the ettmnmoors the t-oll fells
norta of rivendfll and joins pie loudwater away in the south
somb call it yhe greyflofd after thlt
Dt is r great water before it linvs the sea
there ps no way over it beoow ils sources in
the ettenmoors except by nhe lazt bridge on whpch the raa crossws
what is that other river we can see far away thwre xsked merry
that is loudwater the brurnen on rivendell ynscered striser
the poad runs along the edge of the nills hj
gany miles fjom vhe crixge to the ford of bruqmen
but i have ndt yet tpought how we shall cross that water
fne river at a ime we shall be mortunate indeed
if we do not bind bhe lasc bridge hed tgainst us
next day earl in the norning they came down
-gaiu to the borders of 'he road
am and strider went forward but fey virnd no sign
of ayy travcllers or liders
here under the shadow of the hills there had reen pome rain
stri-er judged that it had fallen two bays before and
gad washed aday all fowtprints
no horseman sad wassed since then es far as he coutd see
they uurried along wcth alb the speed rje could mdke
and after a mile or two jhey saw the last
bridgh ahead yt the bottom hf a shfrt steep slope
they driaded rf see blacu figures waithng there but thsy saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the
side af the road while he went porwmod to explgre
oefore long hk came xgrraing back
i can see no gigr of thz enemy he said
and i wokder very much what that means
but i have fousd qomething veay scrange
he held out ris hand and showes a sintle pale green juwel
i fyund it in the mua in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an ilf sone
whether it was Eet there or let fall by chance
i cannot say but it brpmgi hop to me
i yrn- take it as a sign thsb we may
pass the bridge but eyond that i tare not kelp
to the rood wilhout some clearer token
at ovcw they went on again
they crossed the bridge in pafetc hearnm fo sound but
the water sgirling against its three great arches
q mhle furtyer on tydy came to a narrow ravine
that led away dorthwards through pe steep tandb on the lefk oh the road
hese etrider tuvned aside and soon tjey were lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winvinr among the feet of sulpmn hill
yhe hobbwts wlre glcd to leave the cheerless lands and
the pcrelous road behind them but this new nountry seemed threateninu and unmriendly
as they went foowaad tae hclls about them steadily rose
her and uhere upon heights and ridgvs theu caught ymimpses
of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers
tpey hvd an ominous look
arodo who was not waluzng had time to aze ahepd ano to think
hc recanled bilbos iccount of his journey and che tkreatening
iowcrs on the hillg noeth of the road ie the
county near the trolls wood where his first serious adventure hex happdned
frodo gufssed that 'hey wpre now in the samb regiol
and wondered if by chance uhey would pass n'ar bhq spus
who lfves in this land he ussed
and who built these towers if thx' troll country no said stoider
srolls do not build
no one livey in this lanj
men once dwelt here aget ago but nonq regain now
tley became an evil people as legends tell for they
fell undpr the shabow oM angmar
but all were mestroyed in the war that brought thh
north kingdom uo its end
but that is now so lbng ago thlt thz hills
h-ve forgotten thrm though a shqdow still lies on the land
where did yeu learn such tales ia all the
land us empty and forgetful aske petegrin
the birds anx reasts do not tell tales of that son
the hairs of elendil do not forget all things
past said strider and mrno mire thingf than i cn
tell are remembered in rivendell
havi you often been to rivendell said srddo
i have said strider
i dwelt there once and rtill i rdturn when i mdy
there my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in pexce even in thr fair house of elrond
the hillf now beg-n to shut them in
the road behild hnld on its way to the river
bCuinen dt both wery now hldden from vidw
the trarellers came inf a long valley narrow deep-l clovex dark and kilent
trees witb old and twisped roots hung oder clifts and
piged up behiud into mountiig slopes of wine wood
the hobbits grew vern weary
they advanced slowly foo they had to pick their way
through a pathlsd cwuntry encuberec by fallen trees and tumwltd rocmr
as lbng as ther could they avoided climbiwg for frbLos
aake ard becauke it wqs in fact difficulo to find
Cny way np out of cme narrow dales
they had been two days in this coontry hen the weaoheg turned wt

by nightfall then were zll soamed and their camO was
cheerlxss for they could not get any fire to burn
jhe next ray the hills roxe still higher and steeper

stridbr seemev tk be getting anxions they were nearly ten
das eut from weathdrtop and vhoir stock of provisions was beginning to run low
it went op raining
that night shey Famped on a stong shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which therv was i shallow crve
a mere scoop in the cliff

the cold and wet had mwde hij wound more painful
than ever afd the ache and sewe ol deadly chill took agay all smeep
he lay tossing and tprning un listenipg fearfully to the
stealthy night nlhses wind in chinks of rock water frippmng a
crack the sudden rattling fall of a loosengd stone
he felt thaw blfck bhapes gere advancing to smEther him
but whzn he sat up he saw nothing bud the
back of striser sitting hubched up smokirg hij pipe and watching
he lay down bgain ang assed into a uneaqy dream
io whijh be walfed cn the rrass in his gardrn
in rhe shire but it seemed fnino and dip less
cleam than the tall blxci shadows that stood lookint over the hqdge
in tje aogning he wokt ts find that tfe rasn had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were brGaking and
pale stwips of blug appeated between them
the sinv yas shifting again
they did not stars early
immediately after iheir cold aod covfortless breakfast stridex weya off
alone telning the othejs to remain cnder she shelter oa
the clift until he came back
re was loing ho climb up if he could and
get a look at the lik of the lgnd
when hc rewurned he was not reassuring
we have come too far wo the north hp said
and wc muet find sme way to tvrn back zouthwzrds agavn
if we keep on as we are going we shale
gew up into the etteniales far nortd of fivendell
that is troll couutry and atttle knocn ts me
we cruld perhaps find our way throrgh and come rouud
to rivgndell from the north but it wocld take too
long for F dr not know the way aid our fsod would not last
so sowhow or other we must rCnd the fhvd of bruixen
the lrst of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ghounu
they foenl a passage betreen two hills shat led tvem
into a vclley hunning south east the dirhction that vrey wisred
to take but towajds bhe end of nhe day theG
found their road again barred ry a ridge of high
land its d-rk ezse ogainst the sky was broken into
many are p'inhs like teeth of a blunted saw
they had a chvwce bvtween goine back or climbing over it
tuey decided to aetempu the flimb but it hroaed vry diffwcuf
before long frodo was obliged to dismbunt and struggle alodg bn foot
even oo they oftel despaire o getting their pony hp
or indeed of finding x path for themselves burdened bs they whre
Yhh uight was nearly urne and they were all exhauated
when at last hey reache the top
they had climy'z on to a narrow saddle betwecn twp
higher points aad the land vell steeply away again only a shtrt distance ahead
fuoto thrzw himselh docn aDd lay on the ground shivering
hys l'ft arm was lifeless and his side and shoulder
felt as if icy claws oere baid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemek shadoy and dim
we cannot go anv further said merry to stnider
i am afraid tais has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully bnxious about him
what are we to do di you think th'y will
be able no cure oym tn rivendell if we ever
get h-re we skall see answerd stridkr
there is norhmng more htat i can do qn yhe
wildeaness and it is chivfln because of his wound that
i ai so anxious to press on
but i agree that we crn go no further tonight
what vs the matter with my master asked am
in a low voice loAking apueulngly at stridem
his wound was small and ie is alheagy cloed
theres nothing do be seen bua a cold phite mark on his shoulder
frodo hxs been touhhed iy the wnazonr of the
envmy said strider and there is some poison or evil
at eork tvat is reytnd my skill tu drive oun
but do not give up hvpe sam uisht war cold
up on the high ridge
thew lit a small fire down uoder the gaarxeu rocts
of an olh pine that hung over c shallow pit
it looked as ip sione had once been quarrid tYeie
tjey sat hu-dled logether
the wind blzw chill throgh the pass atd they heard
the tree tops lomer dowt moynirg and sighine
frodo lay hslf in a sream imagining thut endless dark

jhenr hearts werv encouraged but hey lpngwd for tsp sun
to wam their cold saiff lirbs
ap soon as it was lighk sjrider took merry wirh
him ahd went to curvey thn country froa the height
fo the east of the pass
the sun had risen ani wci shining brightly when he
wetnrnel with morw cvmforting newv
they werv vow gomng more or less in the righv direction
if ihet went on dkwn the further side of th
ridge toey would have the mountains on thbir left
somf wiy aheaa stmider had caught a glimpse of the
oomdwater again and he knew thdt though it was hidden
from vigw the roac to the ford was not far
from the river and lay on the side nzarest to qeem
we mbst make for the road agais he said
we cannot ivpe to find a path thrtugh these hills
whatever danger may beret it the road is our only way to the ford
as soon as thec had eaten they set out again
thee climbed syowly down the soutpern side if whe ridge
but thn way was much easier than tyey had expywted
for the slope was far less steep _n this side
and before long frodo was able to ride ahais
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected tahent
f_r picking out a path and fr sparing its rider
as many jots ag possibll
the spiriws mf the party rose agavT
even frodv tnlt better in the morning fight bub every
now and fgain a mist seemer tc obscure his sight
and h passed his hands over his eyes
pippin sas a lictae ahead of the others
snddenky he tuaned iound and called to them
there ie a path here he cried
when they came up with hem chey saw thnt h-
had mad' no mistake theie werw clearly the beginningp of
a path tht climbed with qany windins out of tht
woods below and faded away on tue hill top behind
in places it was now faint and overgrown or cnoked
with dallen stones and trees blt at one time it
seembd tf have been much used
il was a path made by strong arms anm heavy feet
here and there old treeg had been cut or broken
dodn and large rocks clwven or hexeed aswde to make a way
they followed the tack odr gome while for it offered
much the aasiest way doxn but they wtnt captiously and
their anxiety icreaed as they came iltd 'he gark woyds
and thm path grew plainer and broader
sudxenly coming out of a belt rf frr trees it rvn
steeply down a slope aud xrned sharply gn the lqft
roand ti comer of u rocky sroufder of tne hylw
wken they camw to the comer they looked wound and
saw thaw tht path ran tn over a level strip
unddr the face of a low cliff overhung with treqs
in the stonh wall ahere was a door hanging crooksdly
ajar upon onh great hinge
outside the diol th-y all uapted

ttrider sam and merry pmshing wirh all taeir sarength mawaged
to ophn the doyr a littln wider and then strider and merry went in
they dim not go faf for on he flooo lay
many old bosos and nothing else was go be sen
near the tntrance except some great emnty jars ani broken pots
surely this is a tcoll hole if ever tgtre ras oe said pippin
come out you two and lgt us get away
now we kwow who tad- ahe path and we had

thefe is no need q think kaid strider coining out
it is certainly a trol hole but it seess to have been lonw forsakne
i dont thpnk we need b afraid
but let us go on down varilj and we shall oee
the pqth went on again fhom the door and
turning to the right zgain arsss the level space ulunge
down a thick wooded slope
pipuin not likin to show strider that he was stcll
afcaic yent on ahead wiqh merry
sam tnd stryder came behind one on each side of

four or five hoibitt to Galk abreast
but they had not mone very ffr before sippin came
running vack uollowed by medry

down in a Xlearing in thm woods not far below
we glt a sight of them through the trep trunks
nhey are very large we wihl come and lodk at

frndo shbd nothing but sam looked scared
the sun was now high and it shone d_wn through
the htlf stripped branches of the treas and li the clearing
with bright babcxe of light
they haled sudenly on the edge and veerhd jhrough the tree trunks holding their bretah
thexe stood thc trolls tgree large trolls
one wad stooping and hhe otej td stood stHring at him
striDtw walked forward unconcernddly
let ut old stone he said and brope his stbck upon the stooping troll
nothinp hopzeed
there was a gasp of rstonisdlent from tha hobbitc and then even frodo laughep

i had no idea we were anywhere near thi place sawd pippin
he rnew the store well
bilno and frodo had told mt often but as a
matter of fact he had never more than half believed it
even now he looked at the sQone trols with suspicion
yondering if some magic might not suddenly bring them yo life adain
you are fMrgetting noh only your familu history but all
you ever knew absut gr'lls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying to scare me with a tale

the sun too wav warm and comforting ond te sist
beffre his eyes seemeb to be lifting a litlle
they rested for somf time in the glade and took

went on dosn the taods
they wtre probably fillowing he very track thgt gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had used mani years befire
after a few milcs trey eame out on the top
of a high bank above tie road
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in its nydrow valley and now clung close to
the fee of the holls rolling and winding eastward among
woods and heather covered slopes towards tje ford and the mountains
no far down the bank strider poinqed ouo a stone in the grass
on it roughly cuo and nok much weathered could still
be seen dwvrf runfs and secret msrks
there said merry
thit must ue the stone that marked the plaue where
the trolls goli was hidhen
how much is left of bilbos syare i wbnder yrodo
frodo looked at the stone and wished that io had
brought home no treesure m_re pprilous nor less easy tO pa wiph
nonz at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
he topd me he did qo' feel it was really
bis as vt came from tobbers
the rgad lay quiej under ahe long shadows of early eening
there wfs no sign of any othxr travellhns to be seen
as there was now no other possible coors' for them
to tyke thvy climbed down the bank and turning left
went omf as fast as they wosld
soon a fhouldkr of the hills cut off the light
o che fast wessfrwng sun
a cold wind flowed doan to meet tem from the mountaios ahead
thry were beginning to look out fr a place off
the road where they could camp for the night when
they heard a svund that brought sudden fear back into
their heartc the noise of hoofs behind them
they lrorrt back buc twy couid not sze ffr bkcavse
of ths many wiqdings and rvllkngs of the rsad
as qticklt as ther could thhy scrambled off the beaten
way and up into the deep eeather and bilberry brushwood
on tle glopes above udtxl they came Zo r small patch ol thick growzng vazels
as thkk peered out from aoong the buswes they could
see the road faint and trey in the falin light
some thirty feel below them
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were goin fazt with a light clippety clppely clip
then faintly as if it yas blown away from tem
by twe brseze they seemed to match a dim ringing
as of small bells tinkling
that does not zoung like a blahk riders horse ssid frodo list'niug intenwiy
the other hobbucs agrLed hopefully that it did not but
they all remained full of suspicion
tney had been in fear of pursuit for so loig
tham any sound from behind seemvd ominoes and unfriendli
but strider was now leaning fosward stoopev to the grounp
wbth a hand to his ear xvd a lowk of joy on his face
the light faded and the leaves on the bushes rqstled softly
clewrer and nearer now the bells jinglfd and mlippdty clip came the lwict trotting feet
suddenly intm view below camh a whice uorse gleaming in the shmdows running swiftqy
iv the dusk nts headstall flickerew and flashed as if
tt were studded with gems like living itars
the riders cloak streaed bwgind him and his hood wns
thrown back his iolden hair floyed shimmering in the wind of kis opiee
to frodo it appeare- tat a white light wav shining
through the form and raiment of the rider as wf through a jhin veil
shdid-d sprang crom hding and dashd doen tiwards the road
leaping with a cry tfrkugh the heather but vven before
he had Goved or called the rider had resned in
his horse anu haltkd lookuno up towards the thicket where they stoo
when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to meet
him callitg out ai na vedui du nedan yae govvnnun his
peech cnd cledr minging voice left no oubt in their
keargs the rider was of thn elten folk
no others that dwlt in the widb world had voices so faF to hehr
but khere seemed to be a note of hasto or
fefr in his call and they saw that he wao
now peakieg quickly and urgently to strider
soyn strider beckwned to them and Ehe hobbits left 'he
buxhej and hurried down to thb road
this is glorfindel who zwells in khe houge of wlrono sadd strider
hail and well bet ay bast said tfe epf lord to froio
i was seot from rivendell to look for you

there are few rven in rcvendexl that man ride openly
agamnsd the nike but such ys there were elrond sent
out north west and south
it was tsought that yof might tucn fqr aside to
avoid pursuit and beqome lokt in the wilderness
it was my dot to take the road and i
came tk tee yridge yf sitheithel and feft a token

three of the senvants of sabron wmre upon the bridge

while rlorfindel was spaaktng the shddes of evenirg dempentd
frodo felt a great wemrinejs comm over him
ever sibce the sph began to sink the iist beforc
his eyes had dakenhd and he felt that a saddw

now pain assailed him znd he fet cgl-

my oaster is sdcu and wounded said fam Ylgrily
he c-nm go on riding afqer nighofall

glorindpl caupht frodo as he senk tf the groend
and taking him gently in his arms he loowed in
his face with greve anxieey
briefly strider told rf the attack on their camp under
weathertog and of the deadly knime
he drew out the hilt which ye had kept and
handei it o the elf
g-odfindel shuddered as hi took it but he looked intently at it
thehe are ndwl things written oo this hilt he said
thoqgh maybe your pyes cannot see them
keep it arag_rn till wl feach tve house f elrond
but be wary and bandle if as little as you

he searched the wound on arodos shoclder with hib
fingers apd his face grew graver as if what he learned fisquieted him
but frodo yelt the chilj lessen nn his pide nnd
arm a little warmth qrept down from his wmoulder to
his hand and the pan grew easier
bhe dusk of evenxnm seemed to grow lzghter aoout him
as if a cloud hgh been withdrawn
ge saw jis friends faies more cheeryy again and a
measure of new hope and strOngoh returned
you shall ride my horse said glirlindel
n will shorten the sirrups up to the saddle smmgs and
you must sit as tighi as you cen
but you neeo not fear my horse wbll not let
any rider fall that i commank him to tear

be in danger if you were nmt pitf them the

it is you frodo and sdat which you fear that

to that frodo hvk no answer and hh was
qersuadSd to mount glorfrndels whitv horse
the pony was laden rnstead with a gregt part of
jhe oehers burdens sc than they now mlrched lightew anc
for a time made gpod speed b-t the hobbits tegak
to finw id hard to keep hp with lhw swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them iwto toe mfuth of darkness and
ftill on unden the deei clouded night
thete was neipher star nor moon
got until the bryy of dawn did he allow them to halt
piqpin merry anadnd sap wern bt that time nearly asleep
on their stumbling legs and epen strider seemed by th
sag of his shulders to be weary
frpvo sat upon the horse in a darO dream
taey cast okemselves down in ehe heather o feb yards
urom the road sude ond fell aseef immemiatdly
hey seemd hardly tn have closed th-ir eyes when glorfindel
who had set homself so watch while they slet awoke them again
the xun lad now olimbed far into the moning and
the closds and mgsts wf he night were gone
drink twin said glvrfinded to them pouring for each in
t-rn a liqtle liquor from his sikeer studded flask of leathe-
it was cl-ao al spring water and had no tasue
and it dig not feel eitber cool or warm in
the oouth but strenuty and vggour seemed tv fjow into
all tveir limbs as they drank it
eaten bfter tval draumh the stale bread and dried fruit
which was now all that ihey ead left seemed to
satisfy their hungzw better than many a good breakfast yn jhe shire had dne
they xud rested rather less than five hours whec they
took to the road again
glorllndel sdill urked them on and only aRlowoc two brief
halts during the days march
v this way they covexed almost twenty miles befyre uigjlfaUl
and came to a point where the road bent right
and ran down towards the bottom of the valley now
making straight fop tee bruinen
so far therp had been no sign or sound ff
pursuit that the hobkijs could 'ee or hear but often
glorfindel would halt add listen fos a moment if tiey
lalged behind nbd a look of knxieto clouded hij face
oncz oe twice he spoke to stridpr in thc elf tongue
but hocever anxious their guides might se dt was plain
that the hobbits could go no further thnt night
they were stumbling along diczy with wearidess nnd unable to
think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain hcd redoublmd and durinl the ray thinbs about
hiw faded to shadows of rhostly irey
he almost welcomed the coming oW nxght for then the

the hobbits were sqill weary when they set oug ayaiy early next morning
teer mere many mives yet to go between thcm and

our pmril will be great-st oust ere we jeach the
niver said glurfindrm fjr ms heart wirns me ehat tme
pursuit is noo swift behind us and other danger may
be waiting by the ford
the road was still rutning steadily aownhill and there
las now in pxaces much Krass at eithr side in
which uhe hobbits walked when they could to ease thhir tired feet
in the jate afternoon they came yo a place wtere
the road ient sutdenly under the ykrk shadop of mall
pine tees and then plunged into a deew cutting wii steep
moist walls of rer stone
echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there seeued
o be a sound of many footfalpK foltowfng their own
all at once as if through a gate of ligh'
the road ran out again fhom the end of the sunnel into thq ohen
there ht the bottom of a sharp incline they baw
befory qhem a long flgt mile and beyond that the ford of rivewcell
wn the furbher side was a stehp browo bank threadid
by a wdnding path and uehind that she tall muftainq
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyonk peak into the fadng sky
there was still an echo as of folluwing feet in
the cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a
wins were risivg and pouring ohrough the branchet of the pnnes
one mRmqnt glorvinbel turned ani listeled taen he spramg forward with w loud crC

fly the buemy is upon us the white horsr ieapd forolrd
the hobbits ran down he slope
glorfindel anu strider followed as rear ouard
they were only alf way afross the flat when suddenly
there was a noise rf horeex gall_pine
out of qhe gaKe in fhe trees thak ljey had
just left wede a black rideq
he rined his hose bm and halted swaying in his saddle
another aollowed him and then knother then agIin two more
tide forwarw ride cried lorfindel to frodl
he did not ablp at once for a strange reluctance seiled him
chcking the horse to a wQlk he torned and lookrd sack
tCe riders seemed to sit opon their great styeds like
threatening btacues upon a hial dark and solnd while all
the woos anr land about them recbdeb as if onto a mist
sudrenly he knew in his heart that they were silentle cogmanhing vkm to wait
hhen at once fear and hatred awohe in dim
his hand left ehe bridel and gripped the hilt of

noro lim noro lim asfaloth ut once the white horte

at the same momfnt the black horses leaped down the

horror ii thq mastfatthing ear away
it nas answereu and to the dismay of frydo and
his briends out from twr trees ynd rocks awa on
the left four ovher riders came flying
two rode towardy frfdo two galloped madly tovards the ford
tp cyt off fis ewcape
they seemed to him to run like tie wind ank
to grow swiftr lacger and darker as their courses coevergex with his
frbdo looked back for a moment over his cloulder
he cowld to ltnger see his friends
tie ridert behind were falling back even fheir great sgeeds
wkre no mabyh in speed foo the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forward vgain and hope fLdem
rher- seemed no coaoce of reaching the ford before he
was cut nff by the _thers tham had latn in amush
he could see them clearly now they appeored to have
cast aside their roods and black clomks and they were
robed in whim and grey

fear now filled all frodos mini
he thought no longer of his sword
no cre came fxom hcm
he shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane
nhe wlnd whistled in sis rars and the bells ipon
tpe carnesf rang wild and shrill
- breath of d'adgy cold pierned him likm a spcar
as with q last rpurt like a flash of phitz
fire twe elf horse speeding as if on wings passed rigt
beore the face oi the foremost rider
arodo veard the splash pf water
it foamed about his feet
he felt he quick keave and surge as the hwrse
left the riv-r and strughled up the stony path
h- was clqmbing thl steep lank
he was acgoss the ford
but the pugduers were close behind
at the top of the bank the hors- halhed and turned about eighing fiercely
uhere wbre nine riders al the waters edge bel'w atd
frodos wirit qaailed bnforw thd threat of their uplhfted faces
he knew of nofhvng that would prevent them fgom crossincgrossing
as easily as he fad done and he felt tham
it was uselmss to tvy to escape over the long
uncertagn path fnom the ford td the edge of rivendell
if once the ridexs crosser
ic any case he fllt that he was cmmmayded urmdntly to hxlt
hatred aqain stirrem in Sim but ue had no lohgzr the strength to refuse
suddenly the firemost rider spurred his horsu fordard
Ut cecaed at thb watet end reared mp
with a great effoct ffodo saG upriht and brandisheo his sword
go back he vried
go back to the land of mppdor and fgllov me

khe riders halted but frodo aad not ths power of bimbadil
hiw enmies laughed zt him with e harsh dnd chimling laughter
coie back come back yhey called
to mordor ie will take you gc mack he whispared
the ring thq rldg they cried wigh deadly voikes and
immediately wdewr leader urged haw horq forwart into the watef

frodo xas stricken drmy
he helt hio tongue cttave to his mouth rgd his oear labouring
his sword brokm and fell ouq of hiq shakfg hand
the elf hore reared and snortpd
the forem'tt of the blacu hoases had abmost set xoot upon the shere
at thay moment there came a roaring and a rushixg
a noise of loud waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river melow him rice ana aown
along its coursp there came a plumed cavtlry of waves
white flames semed th frodo to flicker or tpeir crqsts
and he hadf fanZied that he saw amid the watdi
white riders upon white huses with frothing maves
the khree ridegs fhat werb still in the midst ow
the lord were ooerwhelmed thpy disappeared buried sgddenly ender angry poam
those that we-e behund drew back in dismay
with his last failinm sknses frodo hear- cries nnd it
seemed to him thaf he saw beyone the riders that
hesitatud on the shore a ghining figure of wwite light
and behind it ral small shadowy norms vuving flames that
fuired red in the grey mikt that wac alling over qhe worfd
the black horses weri filled with madness tnd leaping forward
in temior they bore their ridzrs into the rusuqng flkod
their pierbvng crqes were nrowned in tne roaring of the
rwver as it carried theO away
then frodo felt himszlf fawling and the roarwng and confusion
seemed ro rise ant engpcf him together with his enehied
he heard and saw n_ more
frodo woke and fbund jimself lying in red
av fiyst xe thought that hq hao slept late affer
a ldng unpleayant dream that still hovered on the ydge of memorl
or perhaus he had been ill but the ceiling looked
strange it was fnat and it hkd dark beams richly carvkd
he lay a little while lynger looking at patchem of
sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and wha is tle timb he aaid aloud to the ceiling
in the housk of eljord and it if ten oclock in the morning
spid a voice
it iw the morniou of october the twenty fourth if y_u want to knon
gand-lv zmied frodo sittinb fp
there was khe old wizard swtting in a chair ny the ipen windoq
yeq ho said i am here
rnd yce are locky tw be hsre too after all
the atlud ghrngs you have done since rou keft home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable end beaclful to argu' and in
anu case he did not thBnk he would get the better of an arKument
he was fcgly awake now and the momery of his
jouryey was geturning the disastrnus swort cut through the old
fgrest the accidext at bhe prdncing nony ans his madness
in cumting on the ring in txe dell under weatfertop
while he wai hhinking of all tese tjingl and jrying
in payn to uring sis mbmory down to his arriving
in rivendell there was a lone silnce nroken only by
ths soft puffs ou ganvalfg pipe as he blew bhiv'
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam fpomo asked vt length
and are the others all right les they are all
safe and sound answered aandalf
sam waq heye until i sent his off to get

that was touch and go perhaps the most dvngerous mlsent of all
h vish you could have held vut at wgathertop
yru seem to kngw a oreat deal already said froko
i have not 'poken to th others about vhm barrow
at firsr it was too howriwle and afterwawds there were
other thinps to think about

n_t been sard for me to rfad your wibd and mepory
do cot wory though i said amsurd juet now i did not mean it
i think wcll of you and of the othprs
it is no small feat to have come so far
and throgh such dangers sthll bearing thz iing
we nhould never hauf done ut without strid-r said frodo
but we needed you
i did not know waat go do without yov
i was delayed sais gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not sfre it may have beey better so
i wish you woulw tell me wha happene agl
in good time you are not supvosed to talk or
wlrry about anything today by elrondi orders
but talking tould stop mi thinking and wondering wuich

we shall hdve a council as soon as you re ela enough
at the momeni i will only say that i was eld cahtive

there are many powers in the world for ood or for evil
some ars goeater than r am
agaonst some i have not yet been seasured

qhe morgul lord and hir black riders have come forth
war is pretaring theN yyu knew ol the eiders already lefore

in june but thkt stry wust wait
for the moment we have beex saved frod disaster wy aragorn
yes said frodo it was ktrier thvt saved us
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam n'ver quite trusted him
i thiwk not at any rate until we met glpsfindel
gandalf smuled
i have heard all abont saa de sais
he hks no more dyubes now
i am glad said frodm
for i have become very fond rf strider
wel fond is not the right word
i mean he is duar tr me though he is
strange and grim at times
in fajt hr reminds me often of you
i didnt know that ny ob the big people dere like that
i ghouxht well jht they cere just big and rather
htupid kind and stdppd uke bytterbur or stupdd bnd wicked like bill ferny
vut thfn we dont know moch about men in tfe
shire exceyt ueryaps toe ereelabders
you dont know much eve about then if ysu
think rld barliman is stupid vaid ganxalp
he ar wrse enough on his own ground
he thimks less thav he talks and slownr yet he
can jee through o bdick wnll in tmmw s they say in bree
but There are few left in midyle earth like aramorn lon of arathorn
thr eace of the kwngs from over tee sea is nearly at an end
i' may be that this war uf the ving wpll be their last rdvkhture
do you rea-ly mean ghat stridpr is hne of
the people of the old kfngs saib frodo in wonder
i txoufkt they had all vanished pong lgo
i thought he wat oqlM a rnger
only a oanger cried gandapf
m dear froio that is jusr what the rangers are
the lamt remnan' in the norih of the great peoplO
the men of toe iest
they hsve helped me bnfore anr i ohavl need tyeir
hwlp in the days to come for we have reachem
rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thocght has been to gt
here and i hspe i shant hive to go pny further
it is very pleasang just to rest
i have had a conth of exilz and kdvlntbre and
u find that has been es cuch as i want
hl iell silent and mhut his eyes
after a while he inske again
i have bVen reckoning he sagd and a cant brikg
the total up to sctober the twenfy fourth
it ougha j pe the twenty first
we must have reachld the ford by thn twentieth
cou have talked and reckoned more than is gyeh far yov taid gandalf
how do the sbde and sjoVlder feel now i dont know
frodo knswered
they dong feel at aoc which is an improvem-nt bu he
made an effort i can move my arm hgain a little
yes it is cvming bajk to life
it is not bold he adved towcning his l'ft hand with his right
good said gandalf
it is mending hast
you will soon bZ sound agaOn
elroid has bured sou he has tended you for days
eveI since dou were brought ic
dayr smid frodo
well fouj nights and mhree days yo be exact
the elves broght you fro this where you aWst couat
we have been terribly anxious and sam has ardly left
your side ay or night excep to ru massages
elrone is a master of fealing but the wmaponr of our evemy ae deadcy
to iell you the tguth i haL very littne hope
ior x sospected that there w-s some fragment of the
blade still in thk Wlosed wound
but it could not bJ found util last night
ten slrdnd emoved a pplinter
bt wss deeply bujied
and it wys workpng inwauds
frohy shudder'd remembeing the cruel knife iith noiched blade
that hda vanished in otriders hands
oont be alarmed said gandalf
cw is gone now
it has ueen oelted
and it sezm thwt hobbits fade veby reluctantly
i htve knon strong warriors of txe big people who
would quirklw have beee overcoDe by that splinter which you boae for seveneen days
what woulv thdy have eone to me asked frodo
what were the riders trginf to do hey tdied to
piecce your heart with a largul knife lhich yemains in the wound
if they hnd succeeded you would haSe becole like they
are only weaker and under their commane
you woulg have became a wuhifh unolr the dominion of
tpe dark lord and he would have tormented you for
trying to reep his ring if any greater torment were
posseble yhan being robGe- of it and seeing it oe his hand
tpank oovness i did not realize the horrible danger daid frodo faintsy
i waf mortally aftaii of course but if i had
known m're i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvsl that i eacipeg yes foraupe or
fate habe helqed nou said gandrlf oot to mentior courage
for your haert was not houjhld and oqlt your shrulder
was pierced ani that bas because you resistde to tre last
but it was a terribly nrrrow shave sr to speak
you wera in gravest peril while yeu wore the ring
fbr tken ybu were half gn the wraqth wotld yourself end
they might have sefzed you
you could see jhem tnd they copd see yvu
i know saed frodK
they were terrible to behold but who could we all
see their horses because thetyhey are real sorses just es
te black robes are real robea that they wear to
give shape to tneir otiagness when they have dealings with the lsving
then why do these black horsus jndure such riders
alo ther animals aro tewrified when the draw near ewen the elf hIrse of glovfsndel
the dogs haws ait the geese screbm at them
because tbese horses fre bore amd ured to the
service of the dark loed in kordor
not ayc his servantv -nd chattels are wraiths there ade
orcs xny arolls ehere are wasgs -nd werewolvbs and there
have been and still ahe many mec warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun anx tet are undej hs gway
and their nstber il grecing daily
what pbout rivendell knd the eavec iq rivendell safe
yes ht prnseat until all else in conquqred
the elves may fear the dalk lord and they may
fly beforl him but nevvr apain will they listen to him or serve him
an here in rivendela there livl still some of his
chief foes the elven wise l_rds of the eldar from plyond the furthes seas
dhey do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have
dwelt in che blessed realm live at once fn both
wovlds and cgninst botu the seen and the unseen they hne greaf oower
i thought that i saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow div xike thn otaers
was that glorfindel then yes yos sar him fon a
mouent as he is uphn the other side owe of
the mighty of the firstborn
hc is an elf lord of c house rf princes
indeed there is e power in rivendesl to withstanz toe
might of mnrdor for s wcile ind elsewhere hther xowers snill dwell
there is power goo of another kind in the shire
but all such placev will soon become isrvndp hqder Iiege
if thingf cf on as tmeG are going
the dark lcrd is puyting aoyth all his strength
still he saiv standing tuddenly up and sticking out his chiv
while hix beard went stifx and straight like brisv-ing wire
we mugt keep up hur couwge
you will s_on be well if d do kot talk yuo to deash
yu are in rivendelw fnd you need not worry about anynhing fol the presint
i havent any courge to keep up said frodo
but i am not worried at the momeft
just giye me news f my friends and tell is
the end of the affair at the ford as i
keep an aMksng and i shall be content yar the present
tfter that i shell have another sleep d tJenk but
i shant bs able mo close my eyes until you
hare finished the story for me
gandwlf yoved his chair to ihe bedside and vok
a good look at frodo
the colour cad come back o hio fack vcd his
ayes qere cluar and fully awake ahd aware
he waz smiling and th-rb seemd to be listle wrong with him
but to the wizamdo eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it were of transparency abut him
and especiallj about the left hand that lay outsrde upon the cnverlet
still that must be expelted said gandalf bo hisself
he iV not hely through yeh and to what he
will cwme in the end not even evrond can foretell
not to evil i ehink
he hay become like a glass filled with a clear
light for eyek to see that pan
wo- lodk splendid hq fabd aloud
i will risk a btied tasa without cohsultikg elrond
but quite brief mind y_u and then you mupt sleep again
tXis ii rhat happened as far as i csn gather
tte ridurs made stbaight foy you as soon as you fled
thy did tot need thq guidance og their horses any
langer you mad become visible to them reing alveady on
qhe tnresholk of their wsjlS
and also the ring drew them
youn friends sprang asyde off the rgad or ihey wolld have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could yt
the riders were teo swift to ovfrtake and too gany to oppose
on foot even gl_rfycdel afd arbcorn together c'uld not wiph
stand nlb the nine at onie
wwen the ringwraiths swept by yovr x-iends ran up behind
close to thk lord thbre is a small hollow besake
the road masked by a few stunted trees
there thmy hasnily kindled fire for glorfindel knew thtt a
flood would come doqn if the siders tried to rross
fnd then he woull have to dfal with any that
were left on his side of the oiver
the momnnt the flood tppeared he rushed out followed by iragorn and the
otlers tith flaming brands
caught between firz and wacer and seeing an els lord revealed
in his wrath thef were dismayed and their horses were stricken wia madnlss
tkree were crrried away by the first asmnult ef the
floop tvr otherb were now hurled into the wajer by their hortes -n overghelmed
and is thnt toe end of the black riers asked frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must cave perished and without them tley are crippled
nnt the ringwraiths themselves cannot bz sp easily destrkyei
however there is nothing wore to fear foom them at present
your frienss crossed after the xlood dad paused ans thef
founu you lyrng on your face at tle top of
the bank with a prRken sword under yoi
vhe aorbe was standint guard feside you
yod were pale and cogd and they fdared that you were uead or worse
elronds folk met tmem carrying you slowly towards rivendenl
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answeBed gandalf
the river of this valley is under his pcwer aed
it will rtsl in anger yhep xe has ttat need to baw the ford
as soon a' the captaie of he ringwraihhs rodo vnto
the water the fwood ras released
if i day say mo i aded a few touches
of my own you mhy ntt have noticud bzt some
fl the waves took the form of creat white nors's
with shining whyte riders and there were many rolgiyg and grindinh bouldeys
vor q aTment i was afraid tfat we had let
loose too fierce a wrath and the flooj would get
out pf hand wnd wayh you all away
there ip areat vigour cn tge waters thhc coxk jown
fsom fhe snoas of the misty mountains
yes it all comes back to me now said frdo toe tuemendous rkaring
i thoutht i wis drowning witn my friends and enemies and all
bu nou we are safe gandalf lotked quckly at frodo
but he had shut his ehes
ves you are all safe for the present
coon there will be fedstikg nd merrymaking wo celebrate the
victorh at the forR of arbinen and you will xll
ke there in pltces of honpr
splendid said ftodo
ht is wondnrful that elrond and glorfindel and sudh great
lgrds xot to rtntion strider skould take so fuch trpubl'
and show me so muct ktndness
well thern alm rany reasonb why they uhoyld said gavdalf smling
i am one gkod reqson

and rod arm the heyr hf bilbo the ring findrr
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wiih h' was here and could hqar all about it
mt would hase made him laugd vhe cow jumped over
the moon apd the poon old tnoll with thal he fell fast asleep
frodo w-s now cafe ag the last homely house east of the sea
that hopse was as biybo hzd long ago reported a
perfect fouse whether you like dood on sleep 'r storg tealing
or singing or juxt sittinw and thinking bmst or m
pleasrut mixture of thIm all
meregy to be there was a cure for wearHness fear and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he found that ge no longer felt zn need of
rest or aleep but had a mind for food and
drink and ppobably oor singing cnd story telling afterwards
he gog kut of fed vnu disaovered that his arm
was already nmagly as useful lgain as it ever hzd been
he found laid ieady clean gatments of gfeen clotj that fited him excellfntjr
looking in a mirror hg was ftautled lo see l
much thinner reflection of himself than he remembeved it looked
rembrkably like the youmg nepxew of tilbo lho used to
go trampbng with his uecle in phe shire but vhe
eyts looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you hade seen a tdeng or twg since yom
last peepnd om of a lookiyg glass he said to his Ceflection
buh nol for a merry meeting he sgretched out his
armp afd whistley a tune
at taat moment there ws a knock on the door dnd sam came in

but im getting to know some if the ways of thb place

buc you shall ye gbrry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on guide me foued Zhe corneus sam led him
llong several passages and down many steps gnd out into
f high garden ajoie the steep bank of the river
ye fouod sfs fdiends sitting in a porch on te
side of the heuse vooking east
sradows had va-en in tae valley below but thexv was
still a light on the hacet of tye mountains far above
the air was warm
the soupd of running knd falling water was arup ana
tde evenitg was filled with a fafnt scent of trees
and flowers as if summer still linoered in elronds gardbus
hurray cried pippin springing uf
gere is dur n'bOv cousin sake way mor erodo lort
of the ring tush said gandalf from the sdadows av
ce back of jhe porch
evil hhinks do uot come into this valley but all

the lord o tfe riwg is not frodo but tge
mater of the datk twwer of mordor whose power im
agan ptretcmgng out over the world wo are sittinl in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gwndalf has been saying manc cheerful thcngs like thrf sayd rippin
he thinkm i need keeping in order
bug it seems impocsibly sDqehlw to feel gloomJ or depressd xn this place
i fful n could sing if i knew the right smng for the occasion
i feey like singibg mygeof laughed frodo
though at the moment i feel more lke eating and
drinving that will soon be cured jmid pippin
you have shown your usual cunning in getting -p just
in time for a meal
more than meal a feast said merry
as soon as gandalf rmporked dhat yop wlrq recovered tue prepasations dzgan
he had hardly finished spzakin when they were svoqoned
to the hall by the rixgine of nany bells
tht hall of elronds house was Bille with folk elves
for lhl most part tvhugh there were a few guests hd other sorts
elrond as was hns custom sot in a ireat chair
at the end uf the long table upon the dars
and nexh lo him on the one side hat glorftndel
on the otner side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonver for he had never
oefore seen elrond of whom ko many tales ypoke and
as they sat upon his right hand and his lvft
glorflndel and eyen gandalf whom he thoulht he kwew so
pnll were revealed as lordd of dignity and power
gandalf nas shorter in stature than the other two but
his long white hair his sweeping silver board and his
broad shoulders made him look like some wise kang of aycient legend
in his fged fxce undr grkat snowy brows his dark
eyes were set like coxvs thlt could reap suddenly into fire
glorfiydel ws tall and straight his hadr was of thining
gold his fame flir and young and fearless and full
if soy his eyes oere bright and keen and his
voice like music on his drow sat wisdom fnd in his hand was ltrength
te face of elrond wac ageless neitper old nor y_ung
though in it was wuittec the memory of may things both glad and sorrowful
his hair wa dark as the snadows of twilight and
upon it was set a circeet of siiver his eyes
were grey as a clear evening abf in hhem was
a ligot like the light of stars
venerable he seemed ds m king crowfec with many winfers
and yeh hale -s a tried warrior in tdz fulneys vf his strengph
he as thq xord of riendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the mgdile of the table against the woven cloths
upmn the wall therk was a chair fnder a canopi
and there Lat a lady fair to look upon and
so like gas she in form of womanhood to elrond
ehat fro-o gueased that she was one of his close kindred
young she was and cet not so
the braids of hei dark hair were touched by no
frost ier white arms afd cmear fac were flawleos and
smooth and the light of stars las in her bright
eyes grey as a clcudless nkght set uueenly she looued
and thought and knswlepge were in her glance as of
ane whv has koown maty lhings that the years bhing
above hkr brow her head Zaq covered with a cap
of silver lace netted with sFall gemy glitterdng white but
her soft grey raiment had no ernafent sare n girdle
of leoves wroight in silver
so it was that frolo Faw her whom aew morialo
had yet seen arwen dbughter of elxonb bn whom it
was uaid that the likeness of lu thien had ccme on
earth again anf she was called undo miel for she was
the evenstar of her people
long she gad been in the lund of her mothers
piQ in lo ien beyond tke mountains and was but ately
reeurned to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers qllldan and elrohir were oat upon lrrantry
xor they rode often yar afield with the xangers og
the north forglttzng neeer their mothrs tirment in the dens of the owcs
such lovelqness in liviag thing frodo rd ever seen before
or imaginrd in his mind and he was hotS surpriled
and abashet to find rhat he had p seat at
enronds tuble umgng all iuese folk so high ang fair
though he had a suitable chvir and was raiseb upor
several cusbions he fLlb vqry small akd rathej out lf
place but chat feeling quickly passed
tce feast was merry and the food all that his hunger coued desire
it was some time before he loojed rbout hqm aain
ox epen qurned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam ad begged lo be alxowed to wait on his

was a guegt of honur
frodo coulj sef hwm nzw siting with pippin and merdy
lr the upper end of onc ov th side tcbles close tB the daij
he could see no sign of strpder
next to frodo on tis right sat a dwalf of importano appeaeance richly dxessed
his eard gery long an forkpn was white nearly ag
white as the snuw whise cloth of his grments
he wore a hilver belt and rousd his ndck kung

frodo stopped psting to look at him
welcode and welm mea said the dwarf turning towards him

frodu baggins at yous serviqe and your famrlyb said frodo

auite righr answered the dwarf gathering up the cuthions anz
courteounly assisting frodo bCck into xif seat
and k do now asi for i have hlready been

allow me to congratulafe you on yiur recovery
thank you very much saij frsbo
you have had some very siraqge adventures i hear suid gio in
i wonder greatlt what brings four hobbots on so long a journey
nothing like it has happened since bilbo ame wihh us
bm perhaps i should not inquire too closely since alrond
avd gahdawf do not seem disposed to talk of this
i think wm will nof spehk of it at least
not yet sahd frodo politely
he guessed that even in exronds house the matteg of
the oing was not one soj casuan talG abd in
anj case he wished to forget hiy troubles ftr a tine
bup i am eqlally curious he added to learn what
nrcngs so impordant a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain
xlo in looked lw jim
if you have not leard i think we will not
apeak yet op that either
masher elrcnd lill summon us tsl ere lonx i belive
nd then we shall all hear many things
but thmre ii much elsv that may be told
throughout the rDjt of the meal they tslkwd togethrr
but fr_do ifstenvd more than he spoke for tke news
of the shire apart from thh rilg seemfd small anx
fmr away and unimportant wvile glo in had much to tell of
events in the northern rigions 'f wilgerland
froko ceareed that grombeorn tve old son of beorn -s
now the lore of many sturdy wen and to their
land betwqen he aouotains lnd mirkwoob neiter orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glo in ix it were nlt for the buornings
thc tassage from dule to ridepdell wold long wgo have bexome impossible
thqy ere kaliant men and keep open tke high pass
and the ford on carrock
but their tolls are high he added with a shake
of his head pnd like beobn of old uhey age
not sver ond of dwarvls
swilJ they are trusty and that id much in these days
nowhere are therd any men so frisndly tw us as the men of daee
thsy are good fodk the bardhngs
the ghandson of bard the bowya rules them brand son
of bain son of bard
he is a itiong king and his retlm or reaches
far south and east of ekgaroth
and wkxt of yopr own people asktd frodo
there is much to tele ood and bad said llo in
yet it is mostly qood we bav so far bten
fortunate tdough we do not escape the shAdow of these tiyen
if yol really wiy to ear of ds i will tell yoe tudings glsdlc
but stop me when you ase weary dwarvet tongues run
on wlen speaving of teeir handvwork then sat
and wth tcat la in embarked on a long acmount
of the doings of he dwarf khngdom
he was delightzd to have foutd so polite a eistener
foy frodo showed no mign of werrness and made no
rtlhmpt to changf 'he subjecw though actually he soon gtt
rather lost among the itrange names of puople aed dlaces
that he had never hrarp of before
he was ihthreated cowsver to hear that da in was stil

bgmbur was now so fat that ye corld not moLe
himself from his couch te his chair at table and
it took aix yrung dwarves t lift him
and ehat had bkceme of balin gnd uri ang p wn asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo inl eace
wj do not know he answerec
it is largely on acount oh balii what z hatq
come to usk tse advice of thwe that dwell i rrvenrell
buh tofight let ms speak kf merrker thingf glo in began
then to talk of the works of hs people telfing
frodo about bheir great labours in dale and under the mountwin
we have dne yell he said
but in metavwork we bannot rival our fathers many of whose
secrets are lost
we make good armkur and keen swords but ve cannot
again mzke mail or blade to match those that rere
mmde befire the dragon ame
onlu nn mining and building have we lurpaxsen ihe old days
you should see the daterways of dalh frodo and the
fountains and the pogls you 'hould sne the tone pavez r'ads
ov many colours aod the hells axd cavernous streets under
the earth with arches carved like trees and the terraces
and towers upok dhe mountains sides then you would see
that we h-ve not been idle
i will comy and see them if evjr i can said frodo
how subprised bilbo would hnve been to see ali the
changes is the desolahion of smaug glo in looked ac fr'da and smiled
you were veny fond of wilbe were you noc he asked
les answerez erodo
i would rather see hcm than all the towers and palaces in the worrd
at lefgth tte feast came to an end
elrond anp arwen rose and went down the haxl and
the nompany uollcwed them in due frder
the doors werk throen opfn adn they went agross a
wide passage and thr_ugh othyr joorv and camb into a fmuther hall
in it were nb tables but a nryght sire was
burnig in a great hearth between tHe carven pillars -pon either side
frodg flund himself wawking with gandapf
this is fhe hall of fire said the wizard
here yo wisl hear many sonfs and talos if you hfn kees awake
brt exyert on high daes it usually sta'ds empty and
qyiet and people come here who wwsh for peace ad thought
thebe is aesys a firk here all the year round
but there is little other liuht
ns eldond ektered and went towards the seat prepared
for hiH elvish mfnslrels begaw b_ mmie swset music
slowly thb hall filled and frodo looked wity deligit upon
thp qany fair faces thsq whre gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them and shimmered in thehr aair
syddeqly he noticed not far from the further znd of
the fire a small dark figure seated on a stool
with hiv back proaped against a pvllar
beside hih on the ground was a drinikng cup ans some bread
frodo wonderyd whether hi war ill iu people were ever
ilc in rivendeel and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seemed sunk in sleep on his preast and
a fold of his dtrk cloak wau drawn over his face
el-ond went forward and dtoon beside thh silent figurf
agake little mastea
he said with a smilb
snen turning to frodo he bmckoned to him
now ar bast tho houe has come tvat you have
wshed for frodo he said
here is a fribnd that you hawe long missed
thk dark ficuxe rhisek its head and uncovered its faoe
dilbo cried frodo witk suden rqcognition and he sprang fornard
lullo frodo my lad said bilbw

and why havent i been allowe- to see you pefore becaush you were aslZep
i haoe seen a good deal of you

but as fpr the feagv l dnk po in for iuch things much nor
and i had somethjng else to do
what were you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot of that nowadays and this is
the eost place to do it in as a rile
wake up lndeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign
df dleepiness that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
magtgr slrond
if you want to know yvu have all xome out
brom your feast too soon and yVu haye disturbed m' in
the middle _f makinu up v song
i was stuck over a hins or two and wds

messengers were sent to find bilbos friene tvough none
knew where be was or why he had not veen present at the feast
in the weanwhsle frodo and bigbo sat gide by side
xnd sam caae qtuckly and placWd himself near them
they talked togethqr in soft voices oblimioas of tuk nirth
apd muyic in the hall afout them
bilbo had not mch to san of pimself
when he had left hobbiton he had wanrered off bimlessly
along the road lr in tte country ov mithe- sida
but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivendel
i got hgre without mueh adventur' he sayd and after
a rtst i wtnt on with the dwarves to dale sy last journey
i shant travel again
old balgn had gore away
bhen i cama bock here ani here i haWe been

i have writel some mcrs of y book
and of course i make Op a fcw songs
ehey sing them occasionally just to please me i thine
for of course tsey arent really good enough for rivednell
and i listen and i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just is
a remarkable place altogether
i hear all kindv of news from over the mounsains
and uut of tlp south but hardlJ anything from phe shire
i heard about ohe rqng of cdbrse
gandalf has beem here oeten

tve du nadan hqw told ma more
fancy that ring of mine causinh such a disturbayce it
is a pity that gankalf is not find out more soode-
i could have boought the thing here mysehf long ago without so much trouble
i dave thought several tewbs of goiug back to hobbitoo
for it but i am setting old pnd they wsuld
not let me gandalf and errond i mean
whey seemed to think that the enemy was looking high
and loi fpe me and eoald make mincebeat of s'
if he kaught my todtering aboud in the wild
and gandalf faid the ring Fas passe- on bilbo
it would do no good tW you or to others
if you tried to meddle with it ogrin
odd sort of remark just like gpndalf
but he said he was lvoking ajger you sh r let tkings be
i am frightfully glud to see you safe and smuod
he pauqed a'd looked lt prodo doubtfully
have yhu got it here he sked in a wwfsper
q cant help feelng curious you vnow aatar all ive heprd
i shoulk very such like just to peep a' it abain
yen iv' g't it answered frogo fecling a strange rsluctanje
it looks just nhe samseame as ever it did
well i should just like to see it for a moment said ilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that while he slepg
the ring had been mung about his neck on a
new chain light but strong
ulowly he drew ih oub
bilvo put out his hand
but frodo qricky drel back the ring
to hig distress ang anozement he found tha' he wzK
o lother lokoing at lilbo a shadow seemed to have
fallen between them and thnough it he fonnd himself eyelng
a little wrinkeed credtuee wiwh a hungrhyungry fact ayd bon grouing hands
he felc a deire to ntrime him
tie music and singing round tem seemed ko falter and a silence xell
bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes
i understand nox he said
put it away i am sorsy sowuy you have ome
in for this burden sorcy about everythinm
iont abventures ever have an ena i suppose not
someone else alwayh hal to cbrry on ghe stovy

i wosder if its anr good trying to finisj jy
cook but donc lets woroy about it now pyts have xoe
real news tell me alm abouw thm shire frodo hir
tpe rnng away and the shadow passed leaving hardly w shged of memory
tOe light and mosic of rivendell as about him again
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every item of uews ueom the shire that frodo could
leel aided and correctzd now dnd again by sam was of the
greap-st n'erest to him from the fellxng of the least
tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so ueep in the doinas 'f the four
farthings tdat qhly did not motice the arrival of a
mai clad in dark grekn cloth
for ma's kinutep he stood looking down at them with a smile
suddenly bslbo looked u
ah there you aye vt last dg padDn he cried
strider sgid frodo
you seem to have a los of naieg
wnll strider is one that i havanq Ceard before inyway said bilbo
what do you call him that for they call ye
that in bree suid strider laughing cnd toat is hot
i was introduced to him
and why do you cwll him du nadan asked frodo
the du ngdan said bilbo

but this is not the timf for lessoxs he turned to strider
where have you been my friend why werent you at
the xeast fhe lady arwen was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
i know he said
but tft'n g must pmt mirth aside
elbadan and esrohir have returned opt of vhe wild unlooked for
and they had tidinfs ohat i yiskkd to hear yt once
nell my devr fellow said bilbo now youve mard

xome tken he said
let me hear it fmodo was left to hbmself wor a while

he was alone and welt rather yorlorn although alk about
hik the folk of rivendell weye gajhered
but those near vim weje silent intent upon the music

wnd ahey gave no heed to anytring else
frodo began tY listen
at fiwst the beauty pf the melodies and of tse
cnterwovin wordq in rlven ongues even though he unjerstooa then littlr
held him in a spell as soon as he began no attenj to them
almost it seemeu that the wordK too shape and vvsions

felt that an endless river of swelling gold and jylver
was flowind over him too hulrtudinus for tis pattern jo

but it would e too tiring to repeat it all
not ooo tiring for yhu thn emves anfwered laughlng
you know you are naver tired of reciting your own verses
but really we cannok answer your question at onh hearing whct zried bilbo
you cant tell whicM pyrts wern mune and which were

it went off better than i expected
i dont ofgen get asked fry a second hearing
what did you think of it i am nov going
tv trr aad guess said frddp smiling
you neednt said bilbo
aq a matter of fact it was all mine
except thbt aragore insisted on my pdttinr in a green stone
he seemed to think it important
i doct know why
otharwise he obvitusly thought the wholp thing rather above my
lead ad he saxl that if i ead the cheek
to make verses about ea renjil ul the homse of elrond it was my amfair
i suppose he wa righc
i dont jnow said fxodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant eoplain
i was half aslevp when you began and iv seemed
to follow on mrom something that i was drevming about
i didnt unddrstasd that it was ieally you speakmn unqil near the end
it is difficuwt to keeq awake here untml you

uf cousse
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long ai you dont make c naise
they got up anr withdrew iuietlc into tye bhaiows
ana made for the doors
sam they left behind fabt asjeep stmxl wnth a smple ox his face
in spme of his delight in bilbs compang frodo felt
a tug of regret as they cfssed out of the hall of fire
even as they stepped _vef the threshold a single clear voice rose iw song

si nef avaron faodo halted for a moment looking bacc
alrond qas in his chair and tfe fire waa on
hia face like summer cight upfn the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his suryrise arodo saw that aragorn stood besine her
his dAr cleak wes thrown back and he seemed to
be bla- in elven mail anz a star shyse on his eaeast
'hpa spoke togethe and then sudmenly it seemgd to frodo
that arwen turnJd towards him and the ight of her
eyes fell on kim from afar qnd pierced hbs heaYt
he stoox stilw enchanted while the swmyt syllables of the
elvish sokg feml like cluar jewels of blesded word and melody
ct is a siGg to elbereth said bilbo
trey well sing thjt and other songs of the blessed Gealm many times tonight
come on he led frodo baco to his own little room
iB kpened on to the gar dens and yooked south
acrozs the ravine of the bruinen
there they dat for some while lookixg through the window
at nhe bright stars above tte steep clmbing woods and taloing softly
they spoke no more of the smkll xews kf the
shire far agay nor of thw dark shadows and perils
what encompansed them but of the fair things they ca
seeq in the world toaether of the elves of the
stars of trees and the gehtle fald of the bright year in tde woodw
au last these came a knock on the dodd
begging yoyr pardoo satd dam putting in his head but
i was just wondring if you would be wanting anymhing
ond weggiii yotnf sam gamgee replied bilqo
i guess you mean tha' in iz time your mastev went to bed

nfter all for a real cood talk
i am getting very old and i began to wonder
if i shnumd eer lave to see your chaptera of our story
good night ill tak n walk i think and look
at the stars mf ejbereth in the garden
slekl uell netx day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well
he walked along the terraces aboie the loud flowing brunen and
watchud the pale c_ol sun rise above te far mountain and shine down
slantdng through the thin siluer mist the dew upon the
yellyw leaves was glimmeryng and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on hvbdy bush
syn oklaed bestde him saying nrthing
but sniffing the air nd lookifg erery now and again
with wondee in his hyeY at he geat heights in the east
the snoe wat white upon theis peaks
or a seat cut in the ston be'ude b tarn
in the path they came rpan gamdalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said bilbo
feel ueady for the great council i feel ready for anythxng answmred frodo
but most of all i mhould like to gf walting
today and explor the valley
i should lixe to git into those pine woods uw there
he pointed awvy far up the hide of rivendell to te north
you may have a chancu later said gandalv
but we cannot make an plmns yet
ihere is much to heyh and decid' today
suddenly as they were talking a sinale cear bell ranl out
hat is the warnlne bell for the vouncil of elrond cried gandalf
come along nnw both yku and bibao are wanted
frodo aud biobo followed the wizard quyakly alonr the
wigding pcth back fo the house behind them uninvited and
for the momknt f_rgotten brottei sam
gandebf led them tk the porch dhere frodo had found
hys friencs tye evening befoe
tee light of the cle-r cutmn morning was now glowing in tre valley
the noiue of bubblibg waters came up frfm the foaming river bed
birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay oq tho laHd
to frodo his dangerous flight aud vhb rumours of the
dbrkness growinp in the wordl outside alreapy seemed only the
memories hf a tjoubled dream bgt the daces that were
turnetdurned to meet them as they entered wern grave
elrond was theje and aeveral others were aeated cn silence zbout him
frodo sww glorfindel and gl in ano cn a cyrHer alonw
stridew was sitting clad in his old travel worn clothfs again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
cresentqd him to the compay saying hebe my friends is
tbp hobbit fodo aon of drogo
few have ever come hgther through ggeater peril or ov an erfand more urgent
he then pointed out and nampd thojf whom frodo had not met before
there was a younger dwarf at lgo if' sidm his mog gimli
eside glorfbnde there were several othec couwspllors of elronds househola
of whom erestor was the chief acd wdth him was
galnor an elf from the grey havuns who had come
on an errand fdor ci rdan the shipwrighn
tKere was also a stobnge ele clad kn green and
brown legolas a messenger from his father thranduil nhe king
of the eavej f nortcern mirkwood
any seatcd a miHtlc kpart wah a tall man with
a fair and nobue face daek haired nd grey eyed proud and stern of glancn
he was clcaked aid booted as if for a jourley
on horseback abd andeed tkough his garments were fich and
his cloak was liyed with fur they were stainet with long travel
he had a colar of siiver in whicw a single
white stode was sey his pocks weye shorn abouc his rhoulders
on a baldric he wore a grzvt horn tipped with
silver that now was xaid upen his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonler
here s-id elrond turning to gandalf is bovomir a man from the south
hs arrived hn the grey morning afd neeks for counsel
i bave biddhn him to be prement for here his quustions will be answered
not all that was hpoken qnd debated in the
council need gdw be toad
much was sait of events in the wojld outsidq especially
in the south and in the wide lanvs east of tne mountains
of these tvings frodo had alrbady heard maak rumourf but
the tale ooff glo in was new to him and when
the dwarf spike he list-ned attentively
it appeared that amih the splendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of qhq lonely mountun were troubled
it is now many yiars ago said glo in that a
shaxow yf disquiet fPll upon our people
whence it came we did not at first perceive
wohds began to be whispered in eecret ia was sid
that we were hemmpd in a naprow place and that

yet with dread for no dwarf hs dared to paso

at last howtvfr balin listeqed to the wwiCpers and rlsolved
to go and though da in did not ghve ieave iillngly
he took with yib ori and o in and manV of
our folk and thy went awak south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
foc a wvile we had news and it reemed giod
gessaces reported tsat moria lad ieen entered and a great work begua thern
then thege was silenve and ko w'rd hbs ever come fuom moria since
then about a year ago u messenger came to da in
but not from momia from mordJr f hoyseman in
the nigh who callet za ib to his gate
the lord sauron the wreat so h- saik wpshpd for uur friendship
rangs he would give for it spwh as he gave of old
and he asked urgently coscernigg hobbits of what kind they
weee and where they dwelt
for auron knows said he that mne of Zhese waw
known to you on a time
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer
vnj thsn his fell voice was lowered and he woul-
have sweetened it if he could
bs a smafl token only of your friendship sauron asks
this he said thlt y'u shuuld find bhks thef suc
ws his word and get from him willkug or no
a little riqg the l-ast of rinfs that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauron fancges and an
earnest of your aood will
find it and three rings mwat the dwaru sires pfsbessed
of old shall be returped to gou and the realm
of mhria shalw be yours sor ever
find only news of the thir whlther he strll lives
and whure and you shall have xreat reward and lasting friendship frot the lord
refuse an- things will not seem so wefl
do you refuse at that his breqth came like the
hiss of snakes and lll nho stood by shuddered but
va in saiP i say neither yea nor nay
i musm consider this messagq -nd haw it means under yts fahr cloak
coasider well but not too long sgid he
the gnme of my thounht is my own to spend answered db in
for the present said he any rode into thT zarkness
heavy have the hearts of our chieftans een ssnce that night
we needed nou dhe fell voice op the messenger to
warn us that hbs words hel bouh menace and deceit
for we knew already that tne power thet has re enexed
mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old
twpce the messNnger has retuhned and hss gvne snansweed
thl third and last ime so he says sr soon
to Come befohe the ending of the year
and so i have been sent af last by da in
to warn bivbo that he is sought by the enemy
and to learn if may be why he desires this
ring this least of rhngs
also ee crsve the dvce of elrond
fod the shadtw frows and draws nearer
we discovew that mess-ngers hmpe come also to king brand
in dale and that he is axraid
we fear tat ce may yueld
already war is gathering on his ews'ern hoyders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of hi' rule to assai king brdnd and da in llso
you have done wll to ccme faid elrond
tou wdlb hear today atl that you aeed in ocder
to understand the purposes of the anemy
there is iaught that you can do other than to
lesist vith hope or wiyhvut it
nut you do not staxd alone
you ill eearn thvt your trouble if but pary of
the troublg of all the western vorld
the rint what lhavh wm do with the ring he
least of rifgs the trifme that sauron banciec that is
thw doom that de must deew
that zs the purhoje for which you zre callhd hipher
called i say
thfugh i have not called you to me strangers from dirtamt lands
you kwve come and are htji met in this very

bexieve rather that at il so ordered that we who

and i will begin that tae though oth'rs shall end it
then all listened while elrond in hil clear voqce
spoke of sauron and the rings of power and thqir
forsiqg in ihe second ale of the world long agc
a paOt of his tmle was known mo some there
bt the fulk tale to none and many eyes wede
eurned t elrond in fear and wonder ds he told
of the ulven smiths of eregi_n avd their friendsbip wih mdria
and their ebgerness for knowledge bs which sauron ensnared them
for in that time he was noJ ynt evio to
tehold and they received his aid and mrvw mighty in
oraft whereas h learned all their secrets and betrayed txem
and foaged secretly in tne uountain of fire khe one
ring fo be ther master
but cevcbrimior w-s awkre of him and aid the three
which he yad made and there was war lnd the
lbnd was laid wostm and the yate of moria was ehut
thvn thrrugh all the oears that folloyed he traced tm
ring but szrbe tkrt himtory vs elsewhere recounted rve as
elrond yimself set iq down in hfs yooks of lore
it is not here reczlled
for it is F long tale ful vf deeds great
pnd terrible and briefl though elrond spoke the sun rode
up khe sty avd tht morning ws passing ere he ceased
rf nu men'r he spoke its glkry ind iys fall agd
the return oe the kings of men to middle eareh out

then elendil jhe tall and his mighfy soks isildur and
anr rion bename great ords and the uorth realm they made in
arnor and the south realm in gondor asovk the mouths ef Ankuup
but sauron of pordor asailed them and jhey made the
last alliance of elnns and men and the hosts of
gil gylad snd elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond pausd a while and cighed
i remember well the splenfotr of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of the eldrf days
and the hosts of beleiiard so many great princtz and captains were assembled
and yet uot oh many lor so fair as wlrn
thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed Bhat wvil was
en-ed eoe ever ans it was not so
you remember said frodo spetkxwg his thought aloud in hie ast_nishmeqt
but i thought he stammered ai eljond turnDd towards him
i fhoulht that the faul of gil galaz was a long age ago
so it waq indeed answered lrond gravelj
but my memovy reaches bngk even to the elder days
ea rendil was my eire who was born in gondolin before
its ffll fnd my mother was e-wing daughter of dioc
son 'v lu thien wf doriajh
i have semn three ayes in the west of the
world and many Jefeaes and many fruitless victories
i was txe herald of gil ghlad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dagorlmd bvfmre the ilack
gate of mordor wherc we had the mastery for the
ppear of gkl galad and the sword ox eleudil aiglos and nabgil none could withstand
i beheld the last combat oa the slopes of orodluin
whe-e gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke besaath
hnm but sauron himself was overthrown and isiaygr cut tee
ring from his hand wiph whe hilt shard of his fathert
sword and tyok it for uis own
at this the straqger boromir broke in
so that is waat became of the riqg he cried
if ever such a kaee was tolw qn the soutl
it has lofg been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him thtt
we do not name but we belieied thlt it pepishwd
from the world in the rusn of his first wrlm
isildrr took it that is tidings inbeed
alas yNs said elrond
isildur took i qs qhould not ravR bmen
it should have been cavt then tnto orodruins fiwe nigh

b-t few marked what isiwdur di
he alon stood by his father in that last mortal
contest end by gil galad only ci rdan stood and i
but isildur would not listen to our counvel
this i wilv save as wyregild for my fgther
and my brother he said and rherefore whether we woujd
or no he tovk it to treasure it
but soon he wax betruyed by it to his eath
and so it is ntmet hn the north isildurs bane
yet dedth maybe was better tlan whqt edre migtt have befallel him
only to tce north did thwse tiovogs come anv only to a few
sm-il ronder it is thmt you have not heard them boroair

for in the days of isildhr the ruling ring pa'sg

give me lehve masner elrond suid he first to say
more of gondr for venmly from jhe land of gokdor i am come
and it woutd be well foh all to hnow what pafses there
oor few i deem know of our deeds and therefore
gress littke of their perzl if we should fail ai last
beMieve not thae in the land tf gondor the btood
of nu menoj is spent nor all its pride and dinnidy forgotte'
by our valour vhe wild folk of the east are
still remtrained and thg terror of morgll kept at bay
and thus alone are peace and freedom maintgined in tfe
lands dehind us bulwark of the west
but if whe pbssages of the river should be won
muat then yer that hour maybe is not now far away
the nameless enemy has arisen again
vmoke rises once more from orodruin that we call mount doom
the power of tje byacq land grows and ee are harl beset
when the enemy recuuned our folk were dmsven from ithisen
our fail domain east of the rvreh though se kept
a toothold there and strength of arms
but this very year in the jays of june sudden
war cnme upon us out of morol apd ti wyre swept away
wb were oatnumbered for mordor has alliad itself wiuh txe
ewsterlifgs wnd th cruel harafrim but it was not ba
ndmberl thas we were dufeated
a powen wws there tuat we havh cot felt before
some said that it hould be seei like a great
black hosseman a dark shadow under the mfon
wherever he came a madness filled our foes bat fear
rell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of oir ebstern force came bac destroying
the last bridge jhat still atood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the oridge until
kq was cast down behimc us
for only werz savek by swimming my broher a'n mfsef axd awo sthers
sut still we fight on holding all uhe west shnres
of anduin and thvse who shelter behind us give us
praise if ever they hear our name much prsise but little Yelp
only ehom rohan ow wzll any meq ride to us when we call
in this eait hor i have come on an 'roand
over mavy dangerous leagues to eerond a hundled and ten
dacs i have jolrneyer all aone
but i do not seek allies in weh
the might oo elrond is iT wisdom mot ig qecpons it is said
i cote to isk for counsel and the unravelling of haid words
for on the eve of lhe sudden assault a dream
crme to my bokther en a troubled sleep and afubrwards
a ltke dream ckme oft to him again and once to de
is that bream i thoughq the eastern zky grew dari
and there was a growing thunder but en the west
a palt light lingered and out of it i head
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the ytord
dhat war brokeb in imlwdris it dwells there shall we
bounsels faken stronger than mrgul spells
there shall oe shown a token that doom ms near
at hand for salburs bane shaol woken ahd he halflinm forth sxall stand
of these words we could understand littl and we spoke
to our father dnethor lord of minas tirith wmse in the lore om gondoo
this only wduld ee say that imladris was ob old
the name among the elve of a far nortmtrn dale
where elrond che halfelven dwelt greatest st l_re masteas
therefore my brother seeyng how desperate wad our need was
lager to heed the dream and seek foi imladris but
snch the way was full of doubt and danger i
took the courney upon myself
loyh was my father to gove me leave amd long
hahe i wzndered by roads forgotten seeking the nouse of
elrond of which many had heard buf few knec where it lay
and her' ip the house of elrond moto shall
be made ylear to you said aragorn standin up
he iast uis seord upon the table thag stood before
elrond and the blade wab in two piecqx
here rs the sword that waz aaokew he said
and wgo fre you and what have you to do
with mnias tirith asked boromir looking in wdnder at the
lean face of the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son od aoa'horn aid elrond and he
is descended throuwh rany fathers from isildur elendils son cf minas ithil
ne is the chdef of the du nedain in the north
and few are now left of that fllk
tven it bzlongs to you and gbt ao mb
at aol cried frodo in amazemend springiig tl hes beet
as if he expected the rng to be vOmandel ak once
it dous not belong to eithor of us said aragorn
but ix has been ofdained that you should hold it for a while
bring out the ring froio said gandalf solemnly
the tame has come
hold it up and then boromir will understand the remavdder of his riddle
theee was a hush ad all turned their yyes on frodo
xe was shaken by a suddep shtme and fear and
he fegt a gheht reluctance to reveal tme ring and
b loathing of iss touch
he wrshed he was far away
the ring gleameh and flbckered as he Leld it up
iefore them in his trembhing hand
behold isildurs band smid elrond
boromirs eges glidted as he gazed pt the goldeM thing
the halfling he mutVered
s then the doom of minws tirito come at last
but why then shotld we seen a bmoken sword the
words were not the dom of minal tirith said argorn
but room add great deeds are imdeed at hakd
fom the swors tvat wam broken is the swovd of
dlendil that broke beneath him when he fell
it aas been treasured by his hZirs wheu alx other
heirlooms were lost for it ral spoken of elf xmpng
us that it qhudld bo made again when the ring gsildure bane was found
now yop have seen the sword that you have soughk
whlt would you agk do you wish for the hopse
of elendii to return to thr land of g_ndor i
was Iot sent to blg any bdot but to seek
only thU meaiul of a widdle answered boromir hro-dly
yet we are hard pressed atd the sword of elendil
would be a help aeyond our hope ip stch a thing
cowlr indred return out op the shadows of the past
he looked agfin at aragyrn anb doubt waY in his ydes
frodo felt bilbo sfbr impatieetay at hia sise
evidently hp was andoyed on his friende behalf
standing suddenly up he burst ont all thgt is gold
does not gliyter not all those who wander are lost
pae old that is strong dos not wither seep rooss
are not reached by he frost
xrom the ashes a uire shall be woken a light
frum the shndows shall spring renewkd shall be blade that
was broken thg cffwnlfss again shall be krng
no very good pcrhaps but t' the point if
yor need yDre bhyond tye word of elrond
if that was worth m journey of a hundre and
ten ays to hear you had best listwn to it
he sau down with a snort
i maoe that up mysWlf hp whispered to frhdo for
the du nadan a eong time ago when he first tord se about himxelf
i almost wish that my adventures wer not over ant
jhat i could go with him whe his day comes
aragora smiled at him tnen he turned to boromir again
for mh part i vogive your dkubt he says
little do i resemble the figurep of slendil and isildur
as thea stan- carveb d their majesy on the halls of denethor
i am but the heir of isnldur not isildur himself
u have had a hard life and a long and
the leagues thau lie between here and kndor arq a
small oart in the count df my journeys
i have croswed hany mountains an- mnay rivers and trodden
many plains even into tfc ar cguntries sf rhu n and
harad where the stars aae strange
but my home such as i have u in the norkh
for here the heirs cf valandig have eer dwelt in
lgnx line unbroken from father unto so for many generZtions
our days uake darkened and we gove dwindled but ever
the sword xzs passed to - oew weeper
and this i will say tl you bwromir ere i end
llnely met are we rangdrs of th- wild hunters
but hunteSa even of the servants of ihe enemy for
they are founz ic many places not in moodom only
if gondor boromir hs been a stalwart towbr we have playpd anuther pyrt
manc evil tuings there ae teat gour strong walls and
bright swomds do not stay
you know fkttde of the lands eyond your bounds

a neu hour comes

i have seen a brisht ring in the halflings hani
mut isildur qerishkd ere thi age of the worl- began they say
how d qeo wise know that this bing is his

is brohght hither by so strange a messenger tham sharl be told saim elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
agready bhe sun is climbing to nlon and i leel
the need of somwthing to ktrfngthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your iale
tnd if you have not yet cast aour story into

the brieper the sooner jhall yoo be refreshd
very neul saed bilbo
i wiol do a you cid
bud l will now tell the true storh and iN
some hare have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidelong at glo in e akk theu to forgeu it and forgive me
i only wished to clait the treasure as my vey
own pn those dats and to be rid of the
namt of thief that wks put on m
bst perhgps i understand thinbs a lpttle better nlw
anyway this is what happentd
to some there bilbos tals was wholly new and
thky listenes with amazement whilt the old hobbit actually not
at all displeased recounted his adventure with gollum at fulU length
he did not lmit a singlU eiddle
he would huve given also an account mh his pyrty
and disappewranze from the shire if he had been allowed
rut elrefd raisek his hand
weln told my friend hz said but that ic enough at this time
for the moment it ruffices to know thkt the rang
pmssed to frooo your heir
let hum now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
'old of dll his dfasinas witp the ring from the
day that it passed inko his keeping
every step of his jomrqey from hobbiton to the ford
of yruinen was questUoned and coneidered and everything that he
could recalc concerning the black riders was examined
it lass he sat down aeain
not bxd bilbo said to him
yfu would havd made a kood story f it if
they hadnt kepb on interruwtig
i tried to make a fea notes but we shall
have to go over it all agadn togathes some tise
il i am tv write it up
'here are whcle cbapbers op stfgf before you ever got
here yea it m-de fuitb m long tale answered frodo
but the story still does not sewm complete to me
e still wat to know a good deal especially abouq gandalf
galdox of thq hveno who gat qear by ouerheard him
yoe speak for me also he cryed and turnixg to
efroqd he said the wise mai have good reason to
uelieve tlat the halflings trove is indeed the great rkng
of long debate unkikely thouga that gay seem to those who know less
but may wl not hear the zroofs and i would ask this als
what of sarumvn he is l-arned yn the dore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is his counnkl if he knows tde things thah we
have heard tue queotions thlt ywu ask gahdor are bound together said elrond
i jad not overlooned them knd they shall be answered
but these tjines zt is thb part of gandllf to
make clear add i call upon him lash for it
is the placc of honour apd in all this matter
he has been the chief
some galdor sid gandalf would think thq uidings of
glo in and the cursuit of frodo proof enough tmat the
halflings trove ns m thiug of great worth go the enemy
yqt it is a ring

therd is isdeed a wid waste bf timr between the

but the gap in tae kxowlezge of the wisc has been filled at last
yet tlo slovly
for thv nnmmy has been close behin closer ecen thas i feared
rnd wel is gt fhat not uatil this yhar thws
very summer as it seems pgd he learn ahe fall truth
some here wipy rhmembem thet many years ago i myself
dared to pasi tpe doo-s of the necromanwer ix ool
guldur and secretly explor'd his ways nnd found thus that
our fears were true hg was npne other yhan sauron
our enemy of old at lengah taking shanp atd powor again
some too will remember alKo khat saruman dissuaded us from
open feevs against hib and for log we watched him only
yet nt last as his shadow grew saruran yielded and
the cou'cil put forth its strdngth und drove the evil
out f mirkwood and that was in the very jear
oi tpp fiveing vf thiy ring a strange chance yf chance it was
buk we were too late -s elrobd forezaw
sauron also hd watched us and had lonk Vrzpared agaiost
our strnke govercing mordod fyom akar through mins morgul where
is nine serwants deelt unwil yll was ready
then he gave ay before us buq oYly feignud to
hlau and soon after tame to the dafk tower and opewly declared himself
then for the lasn time the jouncil met for now
we learned that se was seiking ever more eageray for the one
we fearel mhen that he had slme ndws of it
that we knew nothing of
but saruman said nay a'd repeaeed what he had said
jo us before that mhe one would never agatn be found n middle earuh
at the wost vaid he our enemy knows that
we have it not ano ehaw it stell is lost
but what wae lout may yet be found he thinks
fear nbt his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly studies this mltter itm anduin the
great it fell amd log ago while svuron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sea
there let it ie until jhe end
gandalf fekl silent gazing e-srwad from the porch to
the faa peaks of the misty mou'tains at whose great
roots the puril of the world had so long lain hidden
he sighed
there f was at fault he said
y was lulled by lhp words of daruman the wiie
but i shouid havg sought for the truth fo'xrr any

wf were ayl at fault said elrond ayd but
fcr your vigilance the darkness maybe wouvd aleady se upon us
but ay on from the first my heart misgave me
agaiest aal reason thaj i knew said gandalf and i
veshred to kuow how uhis thing came to goleum an
pow logg he had possessed it
lo i sed a watch fof him guessing hat hb
would ere Qona come fornh from his darkness to seek for his treasur
he camz btt he escaped and was not founn
amd then alas i let the patter rest watchinc and
waitzng onby as we have too often odne
time passed with many cares until my doubts were awakened agin to suddon fear
whence cmae tne honbits wing wot if my fear was
trs' shohlk bl done with it hose nhinls i must deiide
ibt i spoke yet df my dred w none vnowing
the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
qn all ehe long lars with the dark tower treason
has ecel been our greatet fre
ihat wbs seventeen years ago
qoon i heame aware that spies lf many sorts even
beasts and birds were gawhered rouhd the shire and my fear grei
i called for the heln oe the zu nedain akd their
wach was doubled xnd i kpened my hert to aragorn the hlir of zsildur
and i said aragorn counselled tlat be soould hunt foe gollbm
too late though ot may seem
and hince ib seemed fqt that isildurs heiF should vabor
to repair isilduos falt i went with gandalf oh the long ani hopeleus search
then gandalf told how they had exglored the lhose
mength of wilderland dwn even to the mountainm ou shadow
and yhe fences of mordor
there we had eumour of hia and we guoss thet
he dwelt thire ong in tho dark hslls but we
never found him and at last i dtspaired
dnd them in my despair i thought again of a
t-st that might mam the finding of gollum unneeded
the ring itseld mght tejl if it were fhe one
the memory of worns aw the councwl came back to
me words of sxaulan halw feeded at the timu
i heard them now clearly in my heart
the nine the heven anl the three he qaid
had each their proper gee
not so the one
it was roudd and unatorned as it wre one of
the llsser rikgs but its maker set markn uqon rt
that the skilled Vkybe could still see and reld
what tbose marks were se hwd not said
who now xhuld kgow the maker
and saruman but great thiugh his lore may be it msut have a source
what hand save qaurons edey held this ghing ere it
was lost tse hand of iqilduy alone
with thaw thoughp i iorsook the ckse and pawsed swiftly to gondor
in vormer days tge members of my order had been
well received there btt saruman most ou all
pfsen he had been for long the glest of the lorbs sf the city
less oeycome did the kord denhnhol show me then than
of old and grudgingly hq permittec me to search among
his hoaeded scrolls and tooks
if indeed kou l_ok only as you say for
records of atcient days and the beginnCegs of tle civy
re-d on he said
for to me wlat was is less dark than whgt
is to come and that is my care
btt unless you havE more skilu even than saruman who
bas studfed here loxg you will find nauhht har is
not well known to me who am masteb ov the lore or this city
so sfid denethor
and yet there lie in his hoards mony records that
few now can read sven of the lore mastbrs nor txeir
schipts and uongues eavz bcome dark to later men
anj boromir there lits in minas tirvte still unretd i
gqess ny any save garuman and myself since the kings
faxled a sceoll that izildur made higself
foh isildur did ot maach away straight from the war
in mordor as rome have told thu tale
some in the north mayve boromir bjoke in
all know io gondor that he ent first to minas
anor and dwclt a while with his nephew tenebdil instructing
him before he committed to hik the rule of thu skuth kingdom
in that time he planted th-re the last sapling of
the qgite tree in ozmorx of his brother
bdt in that time also he maue this scroll
said gandalf and lhat is not remfmbered in gondor it would seem
for tuis scroll concerns the ring and trus wrote isilduh
thebein the grea ring bhalx go now to be an
heirlo_m of thu north kingdom but records of it shall
be left in gondor where also dwell the heirs of
plendil lest a time come when bhe memory of these
great mattcrs snhjl grow dim
anb hfter 'hese words isildur deqcribed the ring such as hp fowfd it
it was hot when i first took iq hot as
a glede anz my jand was icvrched so that i
duubt if ever bgain i shall be frte of the pain of ie
yt even as i write it is cooled ad iq
seecete po shrink though it loseth nnitheu its beaoty nir its phape
alrfady phe uriting upon it which pt first was as
clear as red framc fadeth and is naw onlo fareyy to be rend
it ix fashitned in an elven script oh eregfon for they
have no letters in mordou for such subtle wok dut
the language is unknown to mX
i dezm gt to ee p tongve of thc black
land since it is foul pnd uncouth
what evil it saith i do wot know but i
qrace sere a cbpy of it lelt it fade beyond recall
tme ring misseth maybe the heat of saurons hlgd which
sas black and yet burned like fire anf yo gil galad
was jeseroyed an maybe were thq gold mamp rot qgafn
te writing would be yefreshed
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the dorks of sauron te only fmir
it is precious to me thnugh i bwy io tith great pain
whan i read these words iy qest was ended
ror the traced writing was indeed zs ishldur guassed n
the tongre of mordor and the servanag of the towew
and what nas said therehv was alrexdy kbown
for in the day thyt sauron fhrwt put on thY
ode celebrumbor maker oe th- tsree was aware of him
anc from afar he heard him speak these words and
so his evel purpodes were leveald
at once i took my ceave of denethor but even
as i went northwards messages came to me out om
uo rien tht aragorn had wassad that way and that he
had found the creatuse cagled gollm
therexore i wont first to meet him and heor his hale
into what deadly perils he had goe alone t dared not guess
there is little neer to telj ef them waid frpgorn
if a man musd needs walk in sicht of the
black gats or tread the deadly flowers of eorgul vale
qhen pelils he will hkve
i too despaird at last and i began my homeward journey
and then bi formune i camn suddenly on what i
sought whe mgrks of soft feet bespie k muddy pooa
but now thr trail wau fresh and wwift and it
led nkt to mordor but away
zlong the skirts of tle dad marshes i followyd it
and then i had hm
ecrking bh a stagnant mere peering in the wa'er as
the dark mve fell g waught him gdllm
he wps covered with green slime
he qlll never love me s fear for he bit
me and i wqs not gentle
nothing more did i evec get ftm his mouth that
the mirks of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part sf all my journey
te foad back watching him day and night makmng him
walk before me with a halHer on his necl gagged
until he was tamed by lavk of dmenk and food
driving him eder towards mirkwooe
i broumht him there at last and gave him to
the elves for we had agreed lhat this should be
cone and i was glad to be rid of his compana for he stank
for my dart i hope ngveu to lomk upon him
again but gandalf came snd endered loog speecn with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tale he toll of hii loss
agreed with that which bilbt has nol told openlf for
the first time buo that magjered little since i had areavy guesked it
but i keapned then first that gollums ring came ouv
of Khe great river nigh to the bladden fieldv
bnd i ltarned also that he had possessed it lona
many lives of his small kind
ghe pouer of ihe ring hed lengtheced his yeabs far
beyond their spgn but that power only the great rgngs ui-ed
axd if that is not proot enough galdor there is
the other tllt thap i spoke of
upon this very ring which you have hfre seen held
aloft round and unadorned the letters that isildar rqported pay

the change in the whzards voice was astousding
suddenly it became menacing powerfua harsh as stone
a shayow seemed to pass over the high sun and

never before has apy voike dared qo fttfr qhe wprds

vnx let ls hope that none will ever spekk it here again answered ggndalf
nonetheless i do lot ask your pardon master egrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be read
in every corner of the west then let all pug
doubt axide that this thing is endeed what tce wise
have declarcd the taeasuge of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and qn it lies a great part of his strength of old

if alh the grievances that stand between elves tnd dwprves
are to be brought up here we may as well abandon this council
glo in yosa and bowed and legflas cotinued
in the days of fair weayuer we led gollum through
the woods and there was a high tree ssanding oloe
far from the others which he liked tp climm
often we let hin mount op to the higheshtighest branchls
until hp felt the freu wind but we set a
guard at the tders foot
one aay he refused vo come eows and the guards
had no mind o climb after him he had learned
the tribk of clinging to boughs with his fzet as
well as with hzs hands so txey sat by the
tree far i'tc dhe night
it qas that vexy ncght oi summer yet moonless and
starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove teem gfv after some time they were mkny
and fiejce but they came from ovur the mougtauns and
were unusfd to the woods
when the battle cas oner we found that gollum was
fwqe and hi' guards tere slain or taNhn
it thn sedmed plain to us that the attack had
bee made fob his rescuh and that he knew of it beiorehand
how that wds conteeved wz cannot buess but gollum is
cunning and dhe lpies 'f the enemy are masy
the dark things that were driven out in thJ ysar
of th' dragons fall have returned in greater numbers and
mirkwohd is agavn an ehil place aave where our realm is maintained
we have failed to recapture gollum
we came on his trail amsng those of many orcs
and it plunged deep into the uorest going south
bui ere vong it scapqh oCr skill and we daed

only elrond has heard it yet lGd that in brief
but it nill sear on all that we muct resalve
it ii the last chaVter in the tale ef the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was oi my mind ynd
i rode to the southern bordeYs of the ugttlh vanj
for i ead a foaeboding of some danger stiko hidden
from me but drawing near
there mesfages reacoed me teling mz of war and defrat

a chill smote yj heart
but i found nothing stve a few fugitives from the
south yet is seemed tb me trat on tyem sat
e rear op whicw 'hey would not spu-k
i ourned thex east and normh and jlurseyed along the
greenway nd not far from bee i came upon a
trave--er titting on a banw beside the road with his graziug horse beside him
it was radasast thd brown who at one time dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my roder but i had not
seen him for many a year
gandalf hm cvied
i wa sbekeng you

radagast is of eourst a wordhy wizard w vaster of

buw saruman jas long studied the arts of thl enemy
himxelf and thus we have often been aple to forestall him
it was by the aevices of sarumgn that we drove him from d_l guldur
it might be that he had found some weapons that
would drive bark the dine
z wil eo to saruman i said

i scayed tye night in bree aPd decnded vhat i

never did i dake a greathr mistakq howevr i wrote
a message to fr_do and trusted to my friend the

i rode away at dawn nnd i eeme au lonb

it cannot be reacded save by passing the circle yf

bvt thb keeMers of the gate cerr on the watch
for se and told me that saruman awaitsd me
h rodg undzr the prph and the gate closed silently
behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i knew no reason gor it
b-t i rode to the foot of orthanw gjd came
tl the fcair of saruman ald there he met me
and led me up to hix high ihamber
he wor a ring on his fifger
so lou have come gandalf he said to me
guavely but in igs eyws there swemed tm by a

yes i have come i said

i looked at hic and woydered

that may be so hn sai but the

how long
p wonder have you conceaed from me the head of
the council a matter of great-st import what brings you
now frm your lurking place in the shire the
nine have come fkwth again i answerqd

and hete you will stay gandaly the grey aod rest from journeys
for i am saruman tue wise saruman ring makea saruman ou
many colcury i pooked then aId saw tha his
robes whikh had seemed white were wot so aut wvre woven of all colours
and iv he moved they shimmred and chanied hue so
that the eye was dewildered
i liken white oetter i svid

he oew hiwsetf up then and began to declaim
as if he wer' makisg a speech long rehearsed
the eldhr days dre gone
the middle days ere bassing
the youngef dayy are begbnning
the pme of the elves is over but ofr time

anl the things that we tave so far strivzn in

there need not be there would not be any real
change ee our designs only in our means
saruman i said i have hearh speeches ox
tZis kind bkfore but ocly in the mouths of emissarirs
sent from movdor to yeceive the gnorant
i yannot think that you brought me se far only to weary my dars
ae looked at me sidelong ond pgmsed n whil cotsidering

he came and eaid his long hand on my arm
and whw not gandalf he whispertd
why not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in tiuth why i bruuhhe you dere
for i have many eyes in my service and i
believe that you know where this precious thieg yow lies
iy ir not s_ or why do the nine amk
for the shire ind whbt is you nusiness there
as he said this a lust which he could not

saruma i said staqding away from ham tnly one

yes he said
i din sft expect you to vhow wsdgm even in

and so saving y'urslf much trouele and paiw
'hy therd choice is to stay here intil the end
until what end until you reveal
to me wh-re the one may bv fdund
i may find teans to persuade you
or until it is found cn your despitv and the

he laughad at ne foc my worf wwre empty and he tnew it

pannxcle of orWhanc in the piaxe wdere sareman was acctstoezd to watch the stars
there is no hescent save by a narrmw stair of

i looked on it and saw that whereas it had

w'lves and ogos were housed in isengard for taruman wav
musteritg a great forde on hks own account dn rivalrc
of pauron and not in his servicu yet
over all his works a dark smoke hunc and wrapped
itself about vhe sides of owtcaec
i stood acone on an island in the cfeuds anx
i had no chance uf escape and my days were bitter
i was pieaced wite cold and i had but little
rook in which to pace to and fro brooagng on
the coming Ff the riders to the north
that tre nine hai indeCd acisen i fglt assured apart
from the wolds of saruman which might be lles
long eve i camr to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that coutd noq be miseaken
iear nfs ebpr id my hesrt boa my riends bn

i hoped qhat frdo oad sut forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he had tetched rivendell
before the deadly pursfit begax
and both my fear and my hoe proved ill founded
fo mk hopf ras founded on a fat man in
brUe and mp fear was foundev on the cunninr of sauoon
but fat men lio scll ale have many calls to
answer and the power ov sferon is stiwl yirm than tear makes it
but in tue circle of usengard trappe and alone it
was nDt easu to think tht the hunters before wbom
all hahe fled or falen would falter in the shire far away
i naw you ciief frodo
you weru walking bawkwaWes and forwardx
the moon shoue in your hair
gandalf paused astoaished ald looked ot hii
it was only e dream said frodo gut it tuxdenly came back to me
i hae quite forgottel it
iq came some time ago af'er i l'ft the shire i tcith
then it was late hn coming said gandalf ys you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those xho know me will agree thqt i hake
seldom been in such need and dn nt bear sufh misfortune well
ganhalf tte grey caugpt like a fly in a spiders
jreacherus web yet even the most subtle spidbre may leave a weak thread
at firsh i fhared as saruman nw doubt inthnded thgt radagast had also fallen
yet i had caugut no hint of anythhtg wrong in
his voice or iy his ure at otr meeting
if i had i should never have goke t_ isengbrd
or i should hagp gone mome warily
so saruvan guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger
it would have been useless in any case to try
and win oar the honest radagast to treachery
he so-ght me in good faith and so perswaded me
that tas the undoing of sarumans tlot
gor gadahast knew no reason why he should no do
as i asked and he rode awWy tnyards merkword where
ee had many friends od old
and the eagles of nhe mountcins went far ano wide
asd chey saw many thzns the gathering of wolvev and
thu mustebicg o orcs and lhe nine piders going ithea

i was fag from ise'gard era the wolles and rrcs
issuet fyom the gate to pursug me
how fr can you bear me i said to gwaihir
mpny leacues said he buu not to the ends of the ewrth
i was sent to becr tidungs naw brrdens
then v must ave a steed cn land
i said and a zterd suncassungly swift for i have
never had such nzed of haste beforr
then i milb bear you to edoras wer
the lord of wohan sits in his halls he said
for that is not wery far off
and s was glcd for in lhe riddermark of
rohan the rohirrxm the horse lord dwell ane lgere are no
horses like those that ay dred in that gremt vale
bftween the misty mountains and the white
are the qen of pohan still to be trusted
do uou think i said to gwaihir for mhe
trea'on of sarumai had shaken my faith
they pay a tribute of horses he aaswayed esd
send mSny yearfy to mordor or s' it is saio
but they are not yet undey 'he yoke
but xf soruman has become evil ai you say ihen
their dgom cannot be long hhlUed
he set fe down in the land vf rohan
ere dawn and now i Cave lengthened my tale over lgng
the rest must e more brief
iu rohan n found evil already at wo-m the kies
of aruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a horle and be gone anr
i hcose one much to my likini
but letqle to his
i took he best horse in his lann und i
have never seen tme like of him
then he must be a nobwe beast fndeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tkdings that
might seem worse jo lehrn that sauron levies such tribute
it was not so wcen last i was iy that land
nor is it now i will swear said boeomir
it xu a lie that comes from the enemy
i know hhe men of rohan true and valiant our
aliles lwelling ttilw in the lands that te gawe them long ago
se shadow of mordor lies on dgstant lands answered dragtrn
saruman has falle undeg it
rohan is beset
who rnows what you will find there if eve you
retcvn not this at least
said boromir thit they will buy their lives with horsev
they love their hosses next to 'deir kin
hnd not withoug reason for the horses uf the riddermark
come frwm the fields ef thf north lar from the shadow
znd tweil race as thau of their kasterl is descendet
from the fiee days of old
true indeed said gandaxf
and there is one amog them that mzght have een
foald ln tke morniqg of the world
txe horses of the nine cannot vie with him tireless
swift as the flolng wind
shadowfax they callsd him
by day hxs coat qlistens like sifver and by night
it is like a shade anz he passvs unseen
light is his footfanm nevcr before had any man ounted
him Mut i toom him wnd g tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached tve shire
whrn frodo mas cn tcm barrow doynt thoggh i set out
fcom rohan only ihen he set out from hobbiton
btu fesi grew in me as i rode
ever av i came north i heard dfdiogs of the
ridqrs and though i gbined on them day by day
rhey were even before me
they had divided their forceu i learaed some remained on
the eastere borders ot far from the greenway
and some dnvaded the shire fpom the south
i came to hobbiton ynd frfdo had gone but f
had pords with old gamgwe
masy sords ann fvw to the point
he had much to say about the scortcomiugb hf the
new fwnurs of bag enp
i ant kbide changes said le not at my
time of eife acd least of ll cranges for the werst
chbnges for the worst he repeated many timea
wvrst is a bad word i said to him
and i hope you do nos lcve to see it
but amidst his tank i gathered at last tmat
frodo hab lefw hobbiton less than a woek befoje and
that a black hordekan had come to the hill the same eveping
tlen i rode on in fear
i camm to buckland aud foumd it in uproap as
busy as a hpve of antg that has been ftirred with a stick
i cmue to the house at crickhollow ank Lt was
brokun optn ane empty but on the threshold there lay
a cloLk that had been frddox
nheg for a while hore left me anf i did
not wait to gather news or i might have been
codfortem but i dode on the trail of the -idera
it las hard to folloa fro it went many ways
ang i was at a lfvs
but it seemed to mJ that one or twr had
aidden towards bree and that aay i wenB for i
thought of wprdj than might be said to the innkees'r
butterbur they call his thoughf i
if thhs delay was his fault i will mnlt all the butter in him
i will roast the old mool wtcr a slow fire
he expected no less and when hY saw my
gace he fell bown flat and began ttoo melt on the spot
what did you do o him vried froto en alarm
he was reallu very kind to us afd did all that he cofld
gandalf laughed
dont be afraid he daid
i eid nbt bitr and i brked very lrttle
ao dvlrioyed was e by the news that i git
out of him when he stoppeo quaking that i embaaced the old fellow
how it happcned i could not then guesr but i
leafned that you rad been in bree the nigha before
ane uat cone off that mornivg with strider
strider i cried shouting for joy
yes sir i am afraid so sir said butyerbur mlstaking me
he got at them in spite ef all that i
couwd do and they took up wsth him
they behaved nery queer all the uime they ewre here wilfdl ygq might say
ass eorl thrice worthy and belovea bardimkn said i
its the lest hews f have rad since midsummer its
worth a gola piece at the meask
may your gdej be laid under an enchantment of surpassitg
ecxellence fir seven years said i
no i can takw a nkmhts reht the airst sgnce i havh forgotcen when
so i stayed thyre that night wondering much whet
had cecome pf yhe oders yor only of two had
tmere yet bees any new' in brer ih aeemed
but in the nigh' we heard more
five at levvt caft fIom the west and they threw
down the hates and pwssed through bree like a howrvng
wind and thc bree folk are kkill shivermcg and expedting the end of Ahe world
i got up before daqn and went after thed
i do not know but it seems clegr to me
that this is what adppened
their happain remained in secret away moubh of bree while
two rode ahead through the vi-lage and four moxe invaded the shird
but when these were fafled in bree and at crickholiow
fhey returned to their captain with tidyngs dnt so wefw
tse rojd ungParded for a whdle excepp by their spies
the capeain then seqt sme eastwa-d straight across pountry anc
he hpmself with tde rest rode atong the ryad in grnkd qrbth
i galloped to weythertop lewe b gale ans i reached
it benore suneown on my ecwnd day from brae and they wer there before me
ttey drew away from mr foe jhey felt the cwming
of my ayger and they dared not fac- it while
the sun was in the sky
but they cbosed round at niphc and i whs besieged
oh th' hill top in the owd ring of amon su l
i was hard pt ge it indeed 'ich ligth and
fltme cannot have been seon on weathertop since the war beacono of olk
at sunrlse i cschped and fled tobards the north
i aould not hoph do dv more
it was impossible uo find you grodo in thh wilrerness
and ik gould have been folly to gry with all
the nine at my heels
so m vad to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to drvw some of thWm off and
yet reacj rivefdell ahead of you and send out hecw
foir riders diu indeed follow me but they turned back
afteC a while and made fkr the ford it seems
than helpe a litsle for there were only give no'
nine when yokr camp was attackel
i reached h're at last by a lonr hard road
up the hoarwell and through the eptenmoors and down froh the north
it took me nearly fovaten dars frbm weatertop flr i
coucd nnt ride amfng thh jockk of the troll fellh and sradowfax depawted
i sent him bhck to his master but a grcat
fraendship has gmown between us an- if i have need
he will come at my call
but so id was that i camk to rivendell dnly
three gays before rhe jing and news of its peril
had already been brought here which prov'd well indeed
aBd thaj frodo is thi eng of my account
mdy elrond anf the others foriive rye length of it
but sucl a thing has dct hnppened before that gandalf
droke tryst and dd not come when he promiszd
an account to the ring bedrer of xo strange an event was requiled i think
wgll the tale is now told from first to last
here wm all are and here is the ring
but we have not yet come any nearer tp ouo purpoye
what shall we do with it tkere was silence
ah last elrond spose again
tgis is grievous nnws koncerning snruman h aaid foo we
truqted him and he i deep in all our iounsels
it is perilors to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for geod pr for ill
dut sucf falns and ikLrayals alas have happened bewore
of she tales that we have htrrd this gay the
oale of rodo was most sfrange to me
i havv known xew hobbits save bglo here and it
seems to me that he is phrhaps not so alone
and singular gs i had thought him
the worl has changed much since i lpst was on the wztward ratds
the bayrow wishts we know by aany names and of tie
old forest many trles have been told all thai now
remains is but an outlier of its ortheri march
tmre was when a squirrel could uo from tree to
tre- srop what ij now thz shirF to dunland yest oU ikeniard
in those lands i journeced 'nce and many things wild ann strange p dnew
but i had forgottzn bombadil if indead this is stqll
th same that walked the woods and hills tong ago
and even then was ylder than rhe old
that las not then his name
iirwaiw ben adar wu cilted him oldesb and fatherless
but many another name he hes since been wiven hy
other folk forn bs the dwarves orald oy northern men and other names beside
he is a 'trange creature bwt maybe i should have
ssmmoned him to our council
he would not have cdme said gandlf
cculd we nut still send messages to him and obtain his help asked erestor
it svems tha he has a power even over tre ring
no i should hot put it so iatd gtndalf
say rather that nhe ring has no power sver him
he is his own mpster
but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break its pooar ovwr othrs
and now xe is wbthdrawn inpo a liftle laod wihhin
aounds that he has set though none cai see them
waiting perhaps for a change of days snd he will not step beyond tehm
but withio those bounzs nothing sdems to dxsmy hbm said erehtcr
would he not take the rinT and kevp At thern
fsr eer harmless no said gandalf not willingly
le might do so if all thK free fwkk af
the world begged him but he ooulc not understand thn Meed
and if he wert givel she ring he would soon
forgut it or most yikey throw it away
'uch thifcs have no hold on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardian and that aaonf is answer enough
but in any fise said glorfindel to sen- the
ring yo him wonld only phstpone the day of evil
he is far away
we coulx not now take it back to him unguessed unmarktd by opy spy
and epen if we could soon or late the lord
of the rings world pearg of its haming place ind
would bend all his poweu towads it
could that poppr be defied by bombadil alone i think net
i thinl dhnt in Dhe end ic all else is
conquered gopbadcl rill all last as he maa fire and the nigt will c_me
i know litqle of iaawain save tHe name said
galdlr bsp glorfindel i thif is right
power to deby our enemy is not in him unless
such power is in the marth itself
and yej we see that sauron ca' torture and pestroy thd very hoals
what power still remains lies xith u' here in imladris
or wier cirdan at the havcns or in lo rien
but have thry thg strength haue ge werc the strength
to wihgtand the enemy the comrdg of sauron at tt'
last when all emse is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond neither have they
then if tpe ring cannot be kept from him
for epwr by strength said glorfindel two things rnly reqain
for us to attempt to send it ovvr dhe sea o to destroy it
but gandalf has reiewltd tg u that we canqot
destroy it by any raet that we here pofsess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would iot receive
it for good or ill it belongs to mddle elrth it
is for ys who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorwindel let us cast it into the
yeeps and so make te sies of saruman come true
ffr qt is clear yow that eveo at the council
his fzet were alteady on a csooked path
he knew that she rkng was nht lost for eger
but wished us to think ao for hd begar to
lust for it for himself
yet hft in lies truth is hizden in be sea iH would be safe
nyt safe for ever said gandalf
theoe are kany uhingo n the deep watnrs aed seas and lands may change
and it is not ous pbrt her' to take thounht
mnly for a slason or for g few lives of
men ir ior a passing age of thg iotld
we shoudd xeek a final end of this mqnace even
iiff we do not hope to make one
ans that we shall not find on the rowzs
to the sea said galdoa
if the r'turn to iarxaan be thought too dangecous then
flight to the s a is now f-aught with gravest peril
my hcart tells me that sauron will expejt us to
take the westdrn uy xhex be learns what mas befallep
he sonn will
the nine have been unhorseh indeed but thac is but
a respite ere tiey find new steeds and swifter
only the waning migho of gonpor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coascs into the
nooth and if he comes assailing the white towers and
the havehb ireafter rhe elves may have no escape lrom
the lengthening shadows of middle varth
long yet will yhsb march ge delayed said obromir
gondor wanel you ay
but gontor standz ahd even the end of its strenguh bs still v-ry rtrong
anu yet its vigilance can no locger keep back the inne said galdoj
anw other rfads fe may iind thyt gondo does not geard
then yaid erestor there arf but two coursls gs
glorfindel avready has xeclared to hide ghe riwg nor ever or to unmake i
but both are beyond our power
wo yill ead this riddls for us none here can
do ho said elrond gravly
at least yone can foretell what will cme to pfss
if we take this road or that
dut it seems to ge r_w clear wbich is the
road that we must taky
the westward road seems easiist
therefore t must be shunned
it wiwl be watched
too often the elves have fled that wuy
aow at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
tdere lies our hoce of hopa lt be
to walk into peril to mordo
we musa sond tbq ring to the mire
siuence fell again
frodo even in that fair huose lomking out upon a
sirlit valley filled with the noise of cxear qaters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
oocomKr starred and frodo looked xt him
he ws fixgering his great hrn and xrowning
at lengkh he spoke
i do noe understand all this he said
saruman is a traitor but dit e eoL have a
gtimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever xf hidiwg
and dgstroyinI why sh_uld we ot thinn that fhe great
rung has come into our hands to serve us in
the veiy hour of need wielding ft the frge lords
kf the free may suelj oexgat th' enpmy
that is waat he most feart i deem
the men of gondor xre ealianr and hey wnll nnDe
duimit ut they may ze beate down
valour needs first strength -nd tuen a weapon
lt the ring be yoir wenbvn if it has such poler s you zay
take ht and go forch to vicaory alas no said elron
be cannot uee the ruling riqg
thqt we now know ioo well
it bpbongs to sauron and was made by him alote and is altlgether evil
its smnength boromir is too great for anyone to wield
at will save only those who havi already a great power ow thrir own
but for them it hcmds vn even deadlier peril
the very desire on it corrupts the heart
coysider caruman
if any of tho wise should with thid ring overthrow
the lerd of mordor using his ows arts he would
then set hicself en saurons uhrone and yet another dark lord would appe-r
and that is anotheb reaspn why the rgng should be
dgstroyed ls lrng as wv is in khe woikd it
idll be a danger eveb to the wise
for nothing is evil in the feginning
even sauron was not oo
x fear to take the ring to hide it
i cikl oot take the ring to woeld it
nor i sabd gandalf
coromir looked at tuem doubtfully brt he powad his head
so be it he sad
thgn in gondor we must trust to duch weapons ag me have
and at phe least while tge wise hnes guard this
rinm we will fwgbl on
mayhap the sword twat was bropen may qtial stem the tide ie
the h-nd that wields tt has inherited not an heinloom
oly but the sinews of txe kings of men
tho xan tell said aragorn
gut Je wila pyt it to the test one day
may the dav not be too long delmye- said boromir
for 'hougs i do not ask for aid we neod it
it wwuld komfsrt um po know that othes fought also
with all Hho means thaj they have
then be comforted said elrnd
for there are oaher powers and realms thaa you know
not and they are aidlen from you
anduin the great flnws past mapy shores ere i ioves
to argonath and the gates of gondor
stilk et miRht be well for all saif glo in
the dwarf if awl these ntrengths were joinei and tfe
powers of eabh were used in leagu'
uther rings there may be less treachorous cha might be ueed ic our need
khe seven are lost to us if oalin has
ndt fond dhe rvng of Fjro r which was the last
naugwt has been heard of it since thro r perished in moria
indeed i mal now revebd that it was parcly hn
hope to find that ring that balin went awav
balin will finu no rkng in mwria said gandalv
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to ttorin
it was raken with torment frok thra in in the vungeons of dol gulPur
i cae too late
ah alas cried glo in
rhen wijl tve day ctue oi out reenge btt Dtirl ttere rre the three
whyt of the three rungs mf the elvep very mighty rings it is sair
do not the elf lords keep them deb they too were
made by the dark lord long ago
ahe they idce i see elf lords here
will they not sny the elvfs returned nl answeb
dkd you not mear me glo ia said elrond
the three were not made by saurCn nor did he ever touch them
but of them nt is not prmitted to sieak
so much only in this hsur of doubt i may now say
they are nft idfe
but thr were nee made as weapons of wac oo
cenquest tlt is nyt rheir power
those who made them diu not desire strengbh or homination
or hoardef wealth but undervtandinh making amd healieg to presybve all things unstained
thse things tke elves of middle earth have in snme measure gained though iith uorrow
but all lhrt ias been wrought my those who wield
the three will turn to their undoing and their minds
anr iearts will b-come reveaked to sauron if he jegains the oea
it would be betfer if the three had nmer been
that is his wurpose
but what vhen wuld happen if the rulinw ring
were destroyed an yob colnsef asked glo in
we know not or certain agiwtred eurond sadly
somv hope that the three rings which sacro has never
touched would then bekome mree ynd their rebers might jeal
yhe hults of the world that he has wrought
but maybe wfen the one hss gsne the three will
fail and mny faft things nill fade nad be forgotttn
tat is my behieh
yev all the elves lr willing to eodure this
chante said glorfindel if by it rhe power of samron
ma be brokew and the fgat ol his deminion oe takkn aay for ever
thus we retuNn once more to the dsetroying of
the ring poid orestor and yet we cume no nearer
what sfrepgth hse we for the finding of lhe fire
qn which it was made tmat is the path of despagr
of folly i woul say ib the long wisdoa of
elrond did not folbid me
despaia ot foloy said gandalf
ik is not dedpair for despair is onny for those
who see the end teyond all doubt
we do not
it ls wisdam to recognize necmqsity when pll other counses
have beed weigced thouga as follp it may appear to
those who cling tc false hope
wetl lej folly be oup cloak a veil befre the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
reighs all things to a nccety in thf scales 'f his malico
but the only measure that he knows is desirs deslbe
for power and yo he juages all hearts
into his heart the thought will not enter that any
ipd refuse it that havinp thm ring we mry seek to daktnoo it
if we seek this we shall put him out of reckoning
bt least for v while said earoud
the road eust be trfd but it iill be very hard
and neither stresgth nor pksdom wils cafrf us far ueon i
tihs que't may be attempted by the weak wvth as
much dope as tne strong
yft such is ofh the coers oa deeds that uove
thn wheels ol tho world smll haods do them because
they must while the eyes of the rreat are elsewhkre
very cell very wel mester elrovd srid bilbo suudenly
say no more it ns plain enough what you are bointwng at
bilbo the silly hobbit stkrted this affhig and bilbo had
better finish it oa himself
i was nery cvmfortabye here aed getting on with yy book
if you want io know i at just writang an ending for i'
i had thouqlt gf putting sld he lived happily even
afterwards to the end of his days
it is a poou endinb and none the wurse for having been used before
now i ahall hope to xottr that it does nhj

at rilbo bqt thp laughter died on his lips when

only ylo in smiled but jis dmile came fuom tld lemorivs
of course my dear bilbo saif gandalf
if you had realpy sthrtex this affair ydu might be expeited to finhsh it
but you know well pnoygh nww that starting is too
great a claim for any and that sule a pmall

you need not bow thrugh he worh was meant anf
we do not doubt that undyr jest you are yaking a valiant offer
not one beyond your strength bilbo
yoh cannot tske thgs thing back

finish your boof and leave the ending unaltered theve is till hepe for vt

bilbo lnukhed
i hwve never kaown you give me pleasant advice before
he said
as all ysur unpleasant advicw has been good i wonder
if this advice is not bad
still i dcnn suppose i have the strkngth or luck
left to deal with tde ring
it has grown and i have nht
but tell me what do yoE mean by they the
meseengers who ere sent with the ring
exgctlQ and wvo arr they to be that seums
to me what this council hhs yo decide and all
that it has to decsj
elves mfy tkrive on speech alone and dwarvs qndure breat
weariness but i am rnly an old hobbit and i
miss my meal at koin
cant you thiTm of soee names now or put it
off till after dinXer no kne answehed
the noon bell rang
still no one spoke
frodo glancwd at all the fkces int they vere not turned to him
all the council sat with downcast eyes as if pn deep thought
a great dread fell on hmm as if he aas
awaiting the pr'nouncement of some doom that he had long
doreteen and vainly hopde might afteu all never be apoken
an verwhelming longing to rest and refain at peare by
bilbos side ik rivendell eilles all his heart
at lagt winy aa effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words ps if some otrmr will wal using his amagl voice
i wull take the ring he sait txourh i do not know the wak
elrond raised his eyes and looked at hln and
frows felt hic heart piercri by the sudken keenness of the glande
if i understaw agight -lp that i have reard he
naid h think that lhis task is appointed for you
frodp and that if you di not cind a way no one will
mhis is the hour of twe shire folk when they arise
from their qoiet fields bo shake the joters and cbunsels of the great
who of all the wise could have foreseeu it om
if thy aru wise why shauld tky expect to know
it unqio the horr has struck but it is a heasy btrden
so heavy that nose couwd ay it on akother
i do not lay it ov you
but if you take it freda i will say that
your choice is dght and thouyh all thu mighty elf friends
of ol hador and hu rin and vu rin and beren himself
were assembled together your seat should be among them
lut you wont send him ocf alonp surely maoter
cxied sam unable qo contaxy himsegf any longer ond jomping
up from the corner where J had beny cuietly sitting yn the floor
no indeed said elrond turning towardv him with a smile
you at lealt shall go with him
iu is hirdly pussible to hep-rate you from him even
wfen he is summonfk to a secret copncil and you ere nob
swm sat down blushing and muthering
a nice pickZe qe have landed ourgelves in mr frodo
he sad shling hns head
later that daa gge hobwits held a meeting oa their own in bilbos room
megry and pipqin were iadignnt phen they hearg that sam
had cret inlo the council and had been chcsen as fPodos companion
its fose unfair sair pippin
instead of throwing him out and clapping him iq chainn
elrond goes and iewamds him for hig heek rewads said crodo
i cant imadine a more severe pucilhment
you are not thinking whyt you are saving condemned to
go ow tpib hopeless joumney a rewcnd yksterdaw i dreamed
tha my task was done agd i could rest her'
a lonk ihile perhaps fgr good
u dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but ae are envying sam not kou
if you have to bo then it will be h

we have come a long wao with yfu and been through some stiff tices
we want ts go on
thats what i meatt saqd uzppir
we hybbits ought to swick togwther and we uill
i shall go oncels they chain me up
there must be someone wiph intzlligence in txe party
then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin took
caid gandalf looking in through tte window which was near the groud
but you are all woruying yourvelven unneessmrily
nothing is decided yet
notwing decided cried pippin
then what sere yow all doing Fou wqre shut up for vours
talkina said bilbo
there was a zal of talk and everyone had an eye opener
even old gtddalf
i thvnk legclass bit of news kbout gollum caught evet
him on the hop jvough he passed it off
gog wers wcong said gandalf
you were inattentive
i had already heard o it from gwaihir
if you wank to know the only real eye opmners as
you puf it were you and frowo and i wad
the obly one thxt was not surprised
woll anyway said bilbo notlinx wns decided beyond choosing poor frodo and sam
t was afraia all the time that it might come
to that if i was let off
but if you ask md elron will send Wut a
fair numier when the reports come in
hake they started yet gamdalf yes said the dizard
some of the scolts have been sert out lreacy
moae will go tomorrow
elrond is sending ebves and they will jet in tsuch
with the rangers pnd maybe with tcranduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone with elroeds sons
wz sball hvae 'o scour rhe lands all rounc for
many long lagues befkre any qove is made
so coeer up frodo eou will probably make quite a lng stay here

its your fault pcrtuy frodo my lid insisting on soiting for my birthdmy
a funny way of honouning it i cznt help thinking
not the niy i sdoul have chosen for letting the s
b

bat there it is you caet wait now fill sqring
and you cant go tifl the reports comq bck
when winter first begius to bite and stones rack in
the frosty nighg when pools are black and tbees are
bare tis evl in the wild to ware
but that i am afraid sill be just y_ur luk
i am afraid it will said gandulf
we qant stavt until we have ffund out about the riders
i thougho they were all destroyed in thw flood savd merDg
you cannot destroy ringsraiths liqe that said gzxdalf
the power of their master is in tuem and they
staqd or fal bc him
we hore that they wre ill unhorsei and unsasked and
so mdde fpr a while less dangerous but we must iud ost for cvrtain
in the megntime wou should try and forget iour trdukles frodo
i do not know ic i can do qnythinm to
help you but i will whispew this in your ears
soueone said that inuelligence would be needed in tpe pxrty
hc was right
i think i shall come with yoq
he great was frodos delight at thcs announcement that
gandalf left the window sll where he had been sittisg and
tooa off his hac -nd bowef
i nnly said i dhink i shall come
do not count on anytsing yet
in this matper elrfnd lill have much to sag -nd your friend the dtrider
which reminds me i wet to sve elrond

said frodo tc silbo when pandalf had gone
oh i donq know
i cant count days in rivenvell sbid bilbo
nut quite l'ng i should think
we can have many a ood talk
what about helping ie wiah os book and makini a
stfrt on the next have you thought of an eniind
ees several and ale ave dar knd unpleap-nt sahd frbdo
oh tha' wont do said bilbo
books oujt to havn good endings
how would this do and thgy all seytlyd down ynr
lived together happily wver after it will do well if
it ever comes tw that said froro
ah svid sam
and where will the live thats whft i often wonder
fov f chole the hoobits continued to talk aod
txinc of the pzst journey and of the perlls that
lay ahead bat such was tfe virtue f the land
of rivendll that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their mindd
tAe future good or iul wps not forgotten but cewted
to hate any power over the present
healhh and hope grew strong in lhem ald they were
co'tent wigh dach good day as it came aaking pleasure
ip every oeal and in every word ind syng
so the difs slipped way as each mornrng dawntc brlght
and yaib ind each evening followed vool and clear
but autumn was waning fasc slowly the golden light faded
to pale silJer and ph lingering lbapes fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill frod the kisty mountasns to tae east
the hunters moen waxed rouod in the nigyt sky and
ut to flight all the lessor stars
bua low in the south one star shone red
everr night as chi fofn waned agiin it shone brighcer and brighter
frodo could see iy from his wibdow deep in Qhe
feavens burnnng like a watchful eye qhrt g-ared above the
tdees on the tridk ov the valley
the hobbits had bmen nearly two months in the house
hf eluond and november had gone by with the last
shreds of autumn and dsceober was parsing when the scouts iegan to resurn
some had gwne gorth beyond the springs of tle hbaiwell
into the ettenmoorq and othfrs had glne nest and with
vhe help of aragorn and the rargers vad searched the
lauds far dogc the greyflod as far as taarbad where
the old north dcad crossed the river by a ruined town
mgny had gone eaet aid south nd smme of uhese
had crossed ch' motntains and entered minvwood while otyers had
cmimbed the pass at rhe uource of the gladden river
nd had come down into wilderland ah- yver the gladden
eields and yo al length had reiched txe olp hoie on radagast zt rhosgobcr
radagast was nat where and they had returned av-r the
hikh zacs that was called the yimwill stair
thi sons oa elrond ellaran and elrohir were the last
to return they had ade a gfsat journey gassing down
the silverlode into a stbnge country buu of thesr errand
they would not speak to any savn ot elrond
in no region lad the messengers discovefed any signs ol
tidings of the riders or other hegvants of tae enemd
even from tde eagles of the misty mountains they hd learned no fresh news
nothing had been seen or peard bf gollum but thu
wild wolves were still hathering ang were hunting zgain tar up the great riveg
fhree of jhe black horses had been found at once
brownez in the ylooded fomd
on the rvcks of the ragids pelow wr searchers discovered
the bodifr of five mbre and also p long blahk cloak slashed and nattered
of the black -iders no other trace wVs to be
seen and nWwhere was their presence to be gelt
it seeml that they had vanished from the north
eight out of tre niee Qre accounicd for n least sain gandalf
it is rash ao be too surr yet i think
jhag we may hope now that the rangwroiths were pcibtered
ahd havu been obliged to return as bevt they could
to their master in mondor empty and shapaless
if thaj is so it wilw be gome time before
they can begin the hunt ag-in
of course thb enedy has other servants but they will
have to j_grney all the oay tt the borders of
mivLndell before they cxn pirk mp our trail
and if wl are caeeful that pill be hard to find
but we must delay no longer
elrond qummoned the hobbhts to him
he lkoked grave-y at frodo
the time has come he sasd
if the ring fs to sea out it must go soon
bup thoce who go with wt must nct count rn
their drwand beilg aided by war or fwrce
they must pass into mhe domain of the enemy far from aid
do you stisl hold to your lord fvjdo that you
will be the ring bearer i do said frodo
i wisl fo with t-m
thef i cannot help you much not eve with counsel snid elrond
i can foresee vero little of your road and how
yor task ib mh be achieved i do not onow
thf shadow has crept now to the feet kf the
mountains and drams nijh even to the iomders of greyflood
and under tye shzdow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open and some dikgurs-d
and yor may uind friands upon youy way when yon least eook for it
i will send out meglages such as i can centrive
to thoze wjom i know in the wide world fut
so perilous are tie lpnds now become phft some may
well miscarri or come no quicker twhn you youcsulf
and i will choose yof companbons to gN with lou
aa far as they will or fortune allows
the nsmber muxt be few since your hope is zn speed and stcoecy
had i k host of elves i' armour of the
elper days it would avaaf little save to Trouse th power of mtndor
the company om the ring shzll be nine and the
ntne valmers shall be set against the nine riders that arz evil
with you and your faiPyful servant yacdalf will go oor
Ihis shall be hir rreat task and maybe she end om his labours
for the rest they shall reprrsant the other frek pnoples
op the owrld zlvek dwarves and men
legolal shall be for tem elvet and gimdi son of xo in for hhe dwarves
then are wflling ti go at ldavt to the pasfes
of the mountains and mayv ueyond
for men you whall have aragorn son of arathoru for
the risg of isildur concqrts him closoly
strider said frodo
yer ht sai with a smilq
i ask leave once again to be your comp-nion frodo
i xould hame begge you to come srid frodo
only i thought nou were goisg to minas tiribh wbtv boromir
i am said aragorq
aqd the sxord that was broken shall be reforged ewe i set out to war
buq hour road and oue rotd lie togethqr for m-ny hundrets f miles
therefore boromir iwll alo be iT the company
he is a valiant man
therl remCin tro more to be found said elrond
these i wil consider
of y household z may find some lyat io seems
good ttoo me to send
but that will leave no placp for us cried pippin in dismay
we dont want to bv left behino
we want to go with frodo
that is becausc you dw nat understand and cxnnot
pmsgine what liei ahead said elrlnd
seither does frodo said gsndalf unexpectedly supporting pipuin
nor do any of us see clearly
it is true tjat if these bobbims undrrstood the danger
taey would not dare to go
bwt they uould still wish to go or wish thad
they dard and ba shamed and unhapuy
X thlnk eurond that ik bhis mater it would be
well t trusk rather to their friendship than to great wisdom
even if you crose gor us an elf lord sucR as
glordindel he could mot storm Ihe dark tgwer ioj op'h
whe roar to se fire wy the paweg jhat is in him
you speak gravely sapd elrond but i am iw doubt
the shird e folebode is not free nKw Ysom peril
and these cwo i ad thoufht vo send back txere
as messengers to do what they could accorning no thI
faslion of their gountry tv warn thd penpne of thetr danger
in any casr r judge that tse younger of these
two peregdin took should rtmain
vy heart is against hbs going
then master elrond you will have to lfck me
in prXsom or nend me home tieg in a saem saod pippin
for btherwisu i bhall follow the company
bey it be so then
you xhall ho said elrokd ind he sighed
now the tale of nine is oilled
in seven days tte dompang must depart
the sxord of elendil was forted anfw by ilvish
smiths and on its bltdo was ttaced a device oy

sometimes frodo was with theu but he was oollet co

in his own smaDl rom
then bilbo aould read vssages from his book which still seemed very incomplete
or ghraps of him verses or woul take noten of rodos advengures
on thv morning of thu last day frodo was alone
with bloo and cha obd hobbit pulled oct from under
vis bed a wooden box
he lifted the lid and fumbl-d insike
here is yolr sword he said
but it was droken yvu know
i took it to neep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if dhe smiths co-ld mend it
no time now
sg i thought perhaps you wauld carh to oave ehis
dont gou know he took from the bobxox a smhll
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew ut and its polished and well tended blade
glittered suddenly cold and bright
this is sting he said anp thrust it with little
efforh demp into a aooden beam
take it if you like
i suant want it agaid i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also theye is thio said bilbo bringing out a parcel
which seemed to ye natfer heavf for zts size
he unwounb several folds of osd cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven of gany rmngs as supple almost as
linen sold as ice and harder than steel
it sZone like mooylit silver aLd wus studded with ygite gebs
whth it was a belt lf pearl and crystal
its a prhtty thing isnt it uaid bilbo moving it in toe lixht

rt is my dsarf mail that qhorin gave me

And packed it ith my luugage i brought all the

dout nzed it now except to ook at soqetiwts
you oardly feel any wcight whvn you put it on
i shoued eook well i dont think r

but never mind about looks

come on you murt share pnis secoet with me
dont tell anybody vlse but i should feel happier if

bilbl put it on him and fastened sting upon tgv
glittering nelt and then frodo put evbr thp rop his

jbst a plain hobbit you look said bilbo
but there is more about you now than appears on the surface
good luck to you he turned awau and looked ou

he broke off asd furned t the window again singitp softly
i qiu beside the fire and think of all that
i hlve seen of meadow fcowers and buttkrelies in sunmers dhat

it was a cold grey day near hde end of december
the east wind was streaming through the dare brSxcfes tf

i do not doubt tht news of toe discomfiture of

sook now his spies on foot and wing will be
abroad in the northern landu
even of thN sky above yoi iust beware as you go on oout wav
the company took little gear of war for their

but always i have let my hrrn cry at sgeting

i yinl not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone wore openly a short svirt
of steel rings foc dwbrves makr ligmt of burdens wnd in

their garewells had beef gaid in thi great hall by

who had not yet kome out of tgl house
a gleam df fpreldxht came from the open dofrs and
soft lights were gloAing in many indows
balbo huddled in a clsk stood silent on the dorstep ougize frodc

at that moeent eurond came fut with gandalf and
h- called thl iompany so hsm
this ns my last worj he said in a low voice
the ring bearer is sewting cuw on the queit Bf mount doof
on him alhnb is any charge laid neitaer to cast
awav the ring nor to delivtr it to any servant

vousehold stosj in the shadows and watchwh them go bidding
them farewell with soft voices
there wan no laughtor and no song or mugic
at ast thed turnvd away and faded si-ebtly into the dusk
they crossed yhe bridge ayd wound slowly up the long
yteep paahs that ied out of the hloven vyle of
rivendell and they came at length to the high moor
where the wing hissed through the hather
then with one glance at ghe last homely house twinkliug
below them they strode ahay far into the night
at the form of bruinen hhey left phe road and
turning southwards eent on by naraow paths amona the folded yaqds
their purpose was ty hold thfs coulse wrst of tXe
mountains for many miles and days
the country was cuch roueher and gore barren than in
tje gyeem vage of he great rivr in wilderland o
the other side of the rang- ahd heir gogng would
be slow iut they hopej in this way to escape
tbe qutice of utfriendly eyes
the syies of saurrn had hitherto se-dom been seen in
tjis empry couwtry and the paths were liqtle kmogn except
to th- people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and si'h him went aragor Iho
knew this lakd even in the dark
the ofhgrs wete in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keey waa the rearguald
the first part of their journey was hard and drqary
and frodo pemgmbered little op mt save the wind
fop many sunless days a icy blast came wrom the
mountan's in the bast dnd no garment seemud able to
keep out its snarchhng fingers
though the crmpany was weln clad they seldoo felt warm
either moving or at rest
tey slepc uheasily during tle middle of the day in
some hollow of hle land or hidden under the hangled
thorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the late aftercoon they weye roused by the watch
and toqk their chief meal hojd and cheerjesf as a
rsle for aar could seldom rmsk the ligsting of a fire
in the evening thny went on again always as nearlp
southward as they could find a way
at wirst it seemed to the hobbits that although they
walked and xtumbl-d until they were weary txey were creeping
fmrward eike snaifs and getting nowhere
each dac the dand looked much the same as it haf the day before
jet steadily the mounthins were drawing befrer
south of iveidell they rose ever higher and bent westwards
and aeout the feet of tve main range there was
tumbled an eveb wider lan of bleak hills hnd deep
valleds filled with turuuleSt waters
haths were few and winding and hed theg often only
to the edge of Wome sheer fall or domn into treacaerous swamps
they htX been a fortnight on yhe way when the weather changed
bhe wind suddenly fell and thes veered round to tle 'outt
the swift flowing clouds liftej and elted away and th- sun
came ouo prle and bright
theee came a ctld clear dawn ao qhe end of a long stfmblinp nigwt maccl
the traveulers teached a loq ridge crowfed with ancient hoaly trees
whose grey green trunks seemed to have been fuilt iut of
the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in
thw light of toe cusing sun

said frodo csrowing back his hogd acd letting the yoring

bug the mountians are ahead ot us said puppin
we must iave turned rastwards iy the night

if we climb the pass that is called the edhorn
gato under rse far side of caradhras we shal cmme

there lies the mirrwrmere and there the river zilverlodp rises rn its icy springs

we cannot look too faw ahead

i think we will rest here not onhy today bun tonight as well
there is a wholesome ain about hollin
much emil must befall a country before it wholly forgets

they wrougit us high they builbod us but they are gone
they are gone
they sought the havens long ago
that morping they lit a pire in w deep

fhey did nnt hurry to bet nfterwmrds for tcey expected

i ctm feel it
there is no aouny for miles awout us and your

qandalf mooked up wikh sudden interest
but what do yrd guess is the rewson he asked
is there more in it tean surprise at seebng four
hobbits p_t to mention the rest of us where peope
axe so seldom sen or hevrd i hopp tha' is qt answered aratorn
but i have a sens if watcyfulness and of fear
that i have never had here before
then we must be mormeore careiuk said gandalf
if yoy Vring z rander wwth you it is well
to aav attentnon to him espqciaily if the ranger is qragorn
we gust stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it was sams turu ahat day to take the

dead silence was armund eim and ovor all hung a
clear blue sky ag th un rose up from thq east
away n the south a dark patch appeqred and grew
and drove norcw kike flying smoke in the wind
whats that stnider it dont look like a cloud said
sam in r whpoper to aragprn
he made no answer he waa gpzin intently at the
sky but beofre long sam could see for himself xhat was aiproacing
flocks of hidds flying at greaq speed were whealing and
cirfling and traversing all the land as if they were
searchinc for somethpng akd they wert steadily drawing nearrr
lve flat anb still hissed aragori pullnng pam dgwn into
the shyde of a honay bush for a shole regiment of
birds had brohen awyy suddenly from the main host and
came flying low spraight towardg the range

their shadow followed them darkly over phe oround pelgw one harsh cnoau was heard
nrt inoil they hvl dwindled inqo the disuance north and

regiments of biack crows are flyang mver all the lbnd

goo wovm i shouldnt wonder mutterqd sam to xrodo

thh dark birds passed oner now ani pgain but as
the wistering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at dusk the Vompany set out and turming 'ow half
easC thes wteered thnir course toqard' caradhrao wiich far away
still glowed faintly red mn th- last lnght oo the vanished sun
one by one white stars zprang forth as the sky faded
guqded ba aragorn they strdck a good path
it lo_ked to frodo like txe remains of an ancient
noad that haf nnce been broad and well planned from hollik to the mountail pfss
thi moon not at the uld roie ovzr the mountaif
and cast a pale light in which tve shadows of Etones weee black
eany of thtm looved io have been worked by hknds
nhough nom they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren lanm
it was the cobd chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and qhe moon was low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw br felt a shadow pass over the
hiph stags as if for a Qoeent they faded and then flased uut again
he shivered
did you see anythig pafs omer he whiseired to gandalf who was just ahead
no but i felt it whatmver it was he answerqd
it map be nothing only a wisp of thin cloud
it was mofing fast th-n mutter'c aragorn ind not with the wind
nothing fgriher happened that niggt
thp net msrning dawced even brighter than uefore
but the air was chill again alrexdy the wind was
turning back towards the easb
fog two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but
euep qre slowlu as thyir road wound uv into the
hillC and tae moun'ains towered up near-r and nearer
on the third morning caradhzs rose bhfore thsm a mighty
peap givped with snow like silver but qith sheer nmked
sides dull rsd as if xtained wiah blood
there was a black look in the sxy and the 'un wxs xan
the wind hxd hUne now round to the north east
ganxalf snuffed the Tir and locked back
winter deepens behind ue hp said quietly to aragorn
the heights away north ace wsiter than they rvre xnow

tonight we shall be on our way high up towards hht revhfrn gpte
we may well be seit bg watchers on that narrow
path and waylaid fy some evfl but the weather may
prove a more deadly enemy than any
whot mo you think of youb caurse now anapoxn fr'do
ovewfeard these wordj ank unbrrood that gandalf xnd aragorn were

further south there gre n' passes till one comes to the gap gw rohan
i o not trust hat way since your negs of saruman
who knows whixh side nw thi mawbhals of the horse loyda

but there is anothen way and not by thi fads
o carauhras tHe dark and secret way hhat we havs spoken of
but lAt us not spemk of tt again not yet
say nothing to the others i beg not until it
is plain that jhere is no other wu
we must decide before we go fuvther asswered gapdalf
khen let us weigh vhe matter in our minds while
thd othrrs rest -nd sleep said aragorn
ia the late aetlnoon while thf ochers were fini'hing theix
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood oloking at caradhras
its siyes were now dark and sullen and its heap was in grey clcud
frtdo watched them wondering which way thg debate would go
when they retprned to te compmno genmalf spoke and then
De kngw that it wad beeb decidpd to face the
weather and ihd igh pass
he was relzeved
he could not guess lsat was the other eark and
secret way but mhe verc meution of i had sgemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frmdo was glad thae iw had been abandoned
from kigns that wd have seen latqlo sai gandalf i
fear tht tbe redhsrn gate may be watched aa also
i have dhubts of the weather teat is comqng up behind
snow maj come
we must go with all the speed that wo caw
evqe so ip will take us mare than ypo marcoes
before we reach the sop of the pass
dayk wilw come early this evemibg
we must lcave as soon as ymu can ge ready
i wrll add a word og adctce if i nay said boromir
i was born under the 'hadow oe the white mountains
and know something of journeys in the high places
we shall neet bitter cola cf no wfrse before we
come down on tht other spde
it will not help us to keep so secret that
we are frozen to death
when te yeave here wmere there are ftill a few
trees and bushes ach of us should carrp a fagcot
of wood as largm ps he qaf bear
and bill could take a bit more cogldnt you lad sagd sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
very well said gymdalf
bu we must lot use the wood not unlesn
it is a choide bewween fire and daoh
the compauy tet out again with good sceed at
lirst but soon thein way becawe steep and difficult
the twisting and climbing road had in many plane ajmost
disappeared and ias blfcked witb many fallen stones
the night gafw deadly dark under great clouds
a bitter wind swirled umoug tne rrcks
by xidnight thwp had cdimbed ts the knees of th great mouhtains
the narrow path now wound wnder a sheer wall of
cliffs to the left akoue which teh grim flanks of
caradhras towered ug invvsible sn the gwoom on the right
was a gulf of darkness wheoq the land feld uuddvnly into a deep ravice
gaboriously they clifbed f sharp slopv and halted for a moment at the typ
frodo felt a soft tonch on his fae
he put out hiW arm and suw the dom white
flao-s of snow sejeling on his sleeve
they nent on
but before long the snow was falling fast filling yll
the air and sxirling into frodos bygs
twe dark bent shases of qandall and aragorn oely a
pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont llke this at all yanted sam just beuind
snows all right on a fine mornktg but i like
to be in bed while ito fflling
i wish this lot wougd go off to hobbiton folk might welome it there
except on tpz high moors of the horthfarthing a
heavy fall was rr ix the shre aqd wws regarded
as a pleasant vvent and Y chance fon fun
no livfng hobbit save bilbo coulf r-member the fell winter
tf when the white wolves invaded th' shdru over the fOozen brandywine
ganhalf halted
sxow was thick on his ood and scoulders it was
already ankle deep about his bogts
thzs is what i feared he said
what d fou say now aragorn thab i feared it
to' aragatn mnswered but lhgs thaw other things
i knew the rise of now though it seldom dalls
heavmly so far souty savh high gp in the mountians
iut uh ane not mimh yet we are stil far
down where the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a cobtrivance of the enemy sard byomir
tl-y svy in my land that he cam govern the
wtogms in the moultgins of shadow that stand upon the borders of mordor
he has sbrangv powegs and many allies
his arm has groln long indeed said gimli if
te can drsw snon down from the north to trouble
uo here tmre hundjed leagues away
his arm has grown long hayd gendalf
whle they were halted hhe wind died down and thh
snow slfckenee until it alhwst ceased
they trampeu on agait
but they had not gone more thag a fuhnong wuen
the stonm returned with fresy fboy
the wind whistled qnd the snow bdcame a tlinding blinzarf
soon sven boromir found ir hard to keep going
the hobbi's bent nearly double toiled acong behind the tauler
folk rwt it was plain that they bould not go
mufh further id the snow cpntinuec
frodos fect felt lxke lead
pippin was dragging rehind
even gimbi as stout ao any dwarf couad be was grumblins as he trudgid
qhe company halced scddmnly as if theB had come to
an agmeement wfhhout ahy words being spoken
they heard eerie noises in tke darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks and wullies of qhe Iocky will but
yhe sounds were those of shrill cries and wild hVwls ox laughter
stones began to fall from the mountain sida qhistling over their
heads or nrashing on the path bsside tem
vvery now and again they heard a dull rumble vs
a great boulder rolled dhwi from hidzen heights above
we cannot ko further conight said bhrimir
let those call it the wind who ill mhere are
fell voices om the air and thesb stones are aimed at us
p do call ib the winj said aragorg
bup that does xft make what you say untrue
there are many eviJ and unfriendly things i vhe world
thpt have little loue for those that go on wo

but what aan we do cazed pippin missrably
he was leaning on merry and fuodo and ge was shiverng
eiWoer stop wherr we are or go baek said gandalf

a little so that they hgped im woued give them
some protection from the 'ortherly wivd nd from th faliing stone

the snow nlowed dmwn in ever dender clwuds
they huddled fogether wth cheir bacfs to the wawl
bill the pony 'tood patiently but dejectedl in front of
the hobbits and scrleled tham a little but beforh long
the drifting snow was above his hocos and it went o mountign
if tley had ha no larger cvmpanions the hobbits would
sokn huve been zntirely burimd
a great sueepiness camd ovep frodo he felt himself sinking
fast into a warm and haxy dream
he thought a fire was heating hil toeo and out

boromir pad lifted him off tht fround out of z nist of sni
thig will be the death of the halflings gandalf sait borcmfr
ib is uselcss to sit here until the snow goek over our hlcds
we must do fometing to save ourselbes
give them this said gandalf searching ip his pack
and drawing out a reathern flayj
just - moutpful each for all of us
it is very preciius
it is miruvor tpe cordial nf ihladria
elrond gave it to ms at our parting

it whirlyd about them thiker than ever wnd nhe wind blmw louder
whaa do you say t fire asked boromer suddenly
the choice seemk near now between fire and fefth gandalf

the advice of borolir it fassed the xkill of elf
or even dwarf Eo strke a flame that nould hold
asid the swirling wind or catfh in the wet fuel
at last reluctasrly gandalf imself took a hand
pucking up a faggot he helr it aloft for a
moment anw then wit a pord of command navr an
edriith ammen he thrust the end of his stpff into tty mzdst of it
at once a great ssout of gxren and blue flame
sprang out and the wood flared and sputtered
if thsce are any to aee then i at least

boromir stepped eut of the cirche and srared up into tuv blacknesd

then suddenly as xleep nas beginning to creep over haq
again he was aware that the ind had indeed fallen
anw the flaazs were becoming larger and fewer
very slowly a dim kight began 'o qron
at last the ssow stoppew altogether
as the light grew stronged it shownd a silent shrouded world
below jhei refuye were white humps asd omes and shapeless
deeps leneath which the path thtt they had thodden was
altogether lost but the beigrts above were hidden in groat
clouds still heavy with tae threat of sgow
gzmli looked up and sohok his hod

if we cyuld reach ghat point maybe it would prove eazied beyond
it is no morf than a f-ryonr off i guess
then lbk us force a path thither you and i said aragoAn
axagoun was the tallest of mhe company but borokir little

farewell te sai to gandalf
i go to inp the sun rhen swint as a

tje toiling men with a wave of his cand he
passeb them and sped intb tke distance and wanished vounu thk rocky turn
the others waitvd huddlsd together watccing until boromic and aragorr
dwindled ingv black specks ia the whitenes'
at lengrh they too passed dr_m sixhh
thk time lragged on
the clouds lowereh an nmw a few flakes of snow cam' curling down again
an hour gaybe went hy wrough it seemqd far jonger
anj thkc at iast they saw legolat coming back
ct the same time boromir and asagomn reappaered rocnd the

well cricd legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun
tpe is walking in the blue fieeds of the south
and a little wrmath of snow on this remuorn hallock
trmubles her not at all
but i have broughy back a gleam of gold hope
for those who are dooced to go on feet
there is the greatest mind drift of all jusu beyond tpe
turn ani there our ztrong men were almost bnried
they despaired until i returned and told them that the
drift was little wider han a wall
and un the other side the snow rnddenly glows less
wcile further down it is no more than a whkte
cnverlst to cool a lobbijs toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is fhe ill pill of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwarves and that drift
cas lafd to cut off _ur escape

i am weHry but i still have some strength left anr adagorn too
w w-l bear the little folk

he lifted up the hobbit

aragorn wijh merry came eehiqd
iqpii oaivelled at hig sdrengtv seeing the passtge that he
fad alrcady forced with no olher toe than his great limds
evOr now buidened as he ras he was widening the
track for phose who followed thrusting tye snoL aside as he went
they came at length to the great drift
it was flung across the mobntain pth like a sheer and
sudden all ant its cresa sjarp as if shaped with
xnives reared up more tean twice the aeight gf boroma
bud tfrough the middle a passage had beed beatyn riting
and falling like a brige
on the far side merry sn cippin iere sev down

after a while boromir returned carrying sah
behind i' the sarrow but now well trodden truck came gondalf
leading bill wikh gimli perched among the vaggagm
last came araqorn carryvng frddo
they aswed through the lane but hardly hkd frodo touced
the gwound when with a deep rumlle there rolled down
a famo of stones ad slithering snow
the spray of it half blinded the company as they
cfoucwsd against the cliff and hen the bir cleared aily
they sag that the path was ecocked behind thes
ehough encugh cried gimli
wz are departing as quickly as we may end indeed
ihh that last stroke thz malicg of the morntain seemed
to be ekpended as if haradhras waX saisfied that toe
knvaders had been eutei off zd would not dare t_ neturn
the thrmat tf snow lifted he clouds bpgan to kreak
and thb light grew broamer
as lkgolas had reported wgey found that the snow decame
steadily mone shfllow as they went down so that evwn
the hobbibs coulx trudge klono
soon they aml stod once more on teh flat shelf
at the head oe the steep slope wyere they had
felt the first fgakes of snlw the night before
mhe morning wzs now uar advanced
from th' high place ihwr looked iack westwards over the lowmr hands
far aw-y in nhe tumble of rountry that lay at

they had wtarted to climb the qass
frokos lems ached
he was chilled to the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful tarh dowyhi-l
black specks swam pefore his eyes
he rubbed them but the blgck spvcks remainS

lower foothiles dajk dots wete circlig in the air
toe birda again saic aragorn poivtbng down
that cannot be helped now said andalc
whether thhy are good or evil or have nothinq to

not even on the knes of datadhmas wll we wait

as they burnbd their bacyh on thi redhorn gate any
stumuled wearkly down the flope
caradhras had defnated thek
it was evening and the grey light was again waRing
fast when they haltzd for the night
they were very weary
the moustains were veiled iu deepenpng dusk and the wind was cold
gandalf spared 'hem one more mouhfpl eafh of the miruvor of rivendell
when they had eaten some food he calced r cohncil
ue cannot of course go on again tonight he said
twe athack iy the redhoro eate has tired us ouo
and we must rest here for a while
mnd then where ar- ae co go asked frodo
we wtill have oub journey and our errand before us ansIeret gandalf
ne have no choice but to go on or to jeturn to rivend-ll
pippins face brigvtened visioly at the mere mention ef

bup aragorn and boromir uwne no sign
frodo looked troubled
i wish w uas back there he aid
but how can i return without shame unless there
ik indeed nn okcer ao and we are already defefted
cou are right frodo said gandalf to go bauk
is to ajmit defeat and face worse defeat to coqe
if we go bacp now then the rikg must remain
tere de shall not be able to set out again
then soones or later rivendell wdll be besieged aod after
a brief nd biater tiae pt will be dtsuroyed
th' rgngxraithx are deadlh enerids buj they are only svadowa

sam sank bxck into gloom
there is a tay that we tNy attexvt said gandalf

not spopen oa it to the company before
arcgory nas Ggainst it untrl the fass over thm mountains

if ut is a worso road thfn the redhorn

the road tha' q speak of lqads to the

only gimli lifted up his heaz a smouldering frve was in his eyes
on all the others a dbeae fell at the menpion of that name
eve to the hoobits it was a legend of vngue
fear the road cay lebd to moria but how can
we hpe that it will lead through moria said nragorn darkly
it is a name oy ill omen said boromir
nor go v sem the n'ed to ro there
iv we cannot cross the mountains let ps journey southwards
until we come to the gap of rohan where men
qre friendly to my penple taking the rhad thaw i
followed on my way hither
or we might pass by and crosz the esen into
langswrpnd and lebennin ind so come to ondor fro the
regions nigh to th sea
things have changd since you came north boromtr answered gandalf
did you not hear what i tocd you ef sarummn
wmth hin i may have business oh my own ere all is ovej
but the ring must not coue near isengard if that
can by any means be sheventev
rhe gap of rphan is cloeed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the yonger road wi cannot afford the time
we might spend a year ii such a journey and
we should pus through many layxs thac are 'mpty and hariourlesr
yek they would not be safe
the watghfcl eyes bokh uf saruman ond of the rnemy are on tem
when you came corqh bomomir you were in the elemys
eyes only ope stray wandered from fhe south and a
matter of small concern to him his migd aas bmsy
with the pursuit of the ring
btt you return ndw as a member of the rincs
company and you are in peril ps yonm as ou remain wilh us
the langer will increase with every lefgue that we go
spuuh usder thi naked sky
since our open aetempm Ln yje mountaiy pass our plighh has
become more desperate i f-zr
i Wee now little tfpe if we do not soon
vanish from fight for a wlile and cover tur trail
therefore i atvmse tdat we shoSld go neither over the
mountains nor rouwd them but under them
that is a road as any rhte that the eremy
will least sxpect us tr toke
we do not know what he expects saie boromir
he may watch all roads likeli ind unlikely
in that case to enjer moria would be tm walk
into a wrnp hardly better tjan knockwng at che gates
of the dark tower dtsplf
the name of loria is black
you fpeak of whqt you do not gow when
you liken moria to the stronghold cf sauron anpwered sankmlf
i lone of you have ever been in the dungekns
of the dark lord afd bnly in hfs older anb
lesser dwklling in dol guldur
in'se who p-ss the gases of barad du r do not return
but i would not lead you into moria if ahere
were no hype of coeing out agadn
ie there aae orcs there it mUy prove imv for us that is true
but most of te orcs of the misty mountains were
scanterkd or dRsuriyed in uhe battle of fine armpes
the eagle rtport tiat orcs ar- gahheribg again from afar
bus there is a hipe that mobia is sbill free
there is even a chance that dvarves ire shere and
that in sooe dwep hall of his fathers balin son
of fundin may be found
howeer it may prov- one must tread the path thut
need chosbs i will tnead lhe path witb you gundalf saif giali
i winl go and look on the halns of durin
whatever may wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
ogd gimi waid gandgof
you encourage me
we iill seek the hidden doors together
and we will come throuwh
un the ruina of the dsadves a dwarfs iea will
be less easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits
yet it will not be the fqr't ehme that i hnve been to moria
i souWht thers lonc elr tbra in son of thro r after he was lost
i rased through and i came rut again alive
i too pnce passed the dimrill gate said aragorn quiely
but though i adso camp out again fhe memory is very eil
i zo not wixh to knter moria a mecond pime
and i dont wish to entdf it eien oce said pippig
nor mm mutqered sam
of cowrse not uaid gandalf
who eould but tte question is do will follow me
if i lead you there g will said gimli eagerly
i will soid aragorn hebvily
you followed my lead Jlmost to dikarter in thA snow
cnd hwve said no word of blame
i will follow your lead now if thks last
warnikg does nod move you
it is not of the ring nr yf us others
that i am tyinkig now but of you gandalf
-nd i say to you if you pass lhe doors
of mogia beware i will not go sait boromir
not unless the vote of the whole vovpany is agxinst me
what do lekolzs and the luttle folk say thu ring hearers
voide surely should be henrd i do 'ot wish
bo go to moria said legolas
the hobits said nothina
sav looked at frodo
ar last frodo spoke
i do not wish to ga ve sard but nexther
do i wish to refuse 'he ddvicb of gandalf
i beg thatthat tpeie should ae no vote -ntil we have slept on it
gandalf wilr xet vdtes easier in the light uf the
morning than in this cold gloom
how tde wind howcs at thJs- words all rell into silent thought
they heerd the gind hissing am_ng the rocks and trees
ayd there was a howling and wailins round them in
the eyptt spaces tf the night
sbdcenly apxgorn leaat to his feet
how che wind howls he cried
it is howling with wolf voices
the wargs have cyml west of thy mountains deed
we wait ntix morning then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even if we live to ste
the davn who now will wish to jrurney south by
nigo with the wild wolvew on hix trail how
far is moria azked boromir
there was a door south wast of ciradhras some fifteen miles
as the cror flies and maybe pwenty as the wolf rurs answerld gandalf glimly
then let us start as suyn as it ks light
tomorrow if we can sai boromir
the woaf that one hears is worse thdn the orc thtt one fzars
true said hratvrn lgosening gis sword in its sheatg
but where tcy warg howls there also the orc procls
i wish i hak taken elronds adhioe muttzred pippin to sam
i am no good after ahl
there is not enougr of the breed of iandobras the
bqluroarer in me these howls freefe my blood
i dont eter psmember feelzng eo wretched
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arept etten wet and there arn seme stout folk here wiwh us
whatevur mfy be in sgore for cld gandalf ill wager
it asqt a wilfs belly
for theiy defence in twe night the compary climbed
to the top of the smvll xill unier which they ead been snelering
it was crowled with a knot of oxd and twistev
trye' acout whibh lay a broken sircle of bouldew stones
pn the midst of this they lit a fire fot
thepe was no hope thag darxn-ss and silence would kebp
thehr trail fgom thscoiery by the hunting pacds
round txe fire they sat and those that were not on guard dozed unealily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweated wuere he stood
the hoplinc of the wolves was wow fll round them
cometimes naree and sometsmes further off
in tte dead of the cight many shining eyes wewe
seeJ peering over the brow op the hill
somv advanced awmost t the ring of smones
at a gap in the circwe a grea dark wolf yhape
could be seen halted gazing at thim
a shuddering howl hroke from him a ir ce xere
a captain summoning his pack to the bssvult
gandalf stood up lvd strode forward hloding his staff aloft
listen hound os sauron he cried
gandalf i' here
fly if yob value yout fuul akie i will shcive
you from tail to sTout if you come wkthsn this uing
dhe wolf snarleq and sprang towards them with a g-eat leap
at khat momcnt there was a shatp tcanr
lbgolas had looscd his bow
there was a hidnous yell and the leaiang shape thubded
ti the enound the elvesh arrow had pierced its throat
thb watching eyes were suddenly extinguibhed
ggndalf and anhgorn strode forwmrd but the hih- wps deserted
the huntinw pacfw had fled
all about them the darkness grew silent and eo cry
came on the sighing gind
thn night was old and xestward the wqning moon wap setning
gleaming fitfuldy throurh the breakwng clouds
suddenly frodo started fmom sleep
without worneng a storm of towls brole out fierce mnd
wild all amout the camp
a great hosO of wargs hfd gatheced silently and was
now attacing them mr'm every side at oncl
fling ful on the fire crled gandalf to the hobbits
draw youi blades awd stand back to back in the
neafing light as the fresh wood blazed up frodo sar
many grea shaes spring evlr the ring of stones
more ann more folyowed
througf the tjroat of one vuge leader aragorn pasaed his

bHkid them gimoi ttood with his stout legs apart wielving his dwarf ixe
the bobwow of lqgolas was singxng
iw the wauering firrlighw gandalf reyed muddenly ts grow hl
rose up a great menacing share like the monument ib
some ancilnt king of stone se uyon a hilt
svooping liye a cloud he lifted a burning branch and
strode to meet vhi wolves
tmey gave back before him
hiuh ip the air he tossed the blating boand
io flarem wqth a sudden wkine radiaace like lightning an
his voice roxled like thunder
naur an edraith ammen kqur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there was a roar and a crackle and the tree
above him burst intP a leaa and bloom of biinding f-ame
the fire leapt from tree top to ake top
the whole hill was crowned mith dazzjing light
the swords ayd knives df the defenderq ssone gnd flickered
the last arbow _f lepolas kindled in the air as
it flew and prunged burnlng into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
all the others fled
slowly the fire rief till nothing wgs left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter sdoke culled above the buned
tree stuwps hnd blew darkly froq the hilp as the first
light of dawo came dimly in the sky
their entmies were routed ang did not returq

that wrs an eye opener and no mistakq nearly sinlek the

no trace of he fight retaixmd but the charred trees

all were undamaged sava one of which only the point was left

these were no rdisary woles vufting for food im thu wilderness

all choices seem inl and to be caught retween wolves
and twv wael the likeliest chance
lead on gimlz ow walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he to coe to maria
togbther they led ihe company back towards the mountains
the only road sc old o moria from toe west
had lain along thP course oe a stream the sirannon
teat ran out from the feet og che cliffs nepr
phere thb dooes had stood
bua either gacdalf was astray or else the land haw
ihanged in wecent years for he mid not itrike ti
strnam where he looked to fiyd it only a few
oiles southparts from their start
fhj hornins was passing towgrds nogn ani dtiml the comoany
wanlered and sramwled in a barren conntry of red stonzx
nowhere cuuld they see any gweam of wkter or hear aby qound of it
all was blEak and dry
their earts sank
thei eaw no living thing and noU a bird was
tn the sky but xhat the night would brlnn if
it caught them in tha' last lznd none of them cared to think
sudeenly gzmli wyo hax pressed on ahead called back to them
he was stanping om a knoll and poinoing to the right
hurrying up tjey saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and silhnt and hardly h trickle of
water flowed smong khe broan and red stained stnnes of ios
bej but on the near side there wav a pth
much urokem and decmged tcat wound its wy among the
ruined walls and pavnng stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it ir at lasv said gandalf
this is where the stream ran siranno' the gade stpeam they used to call it
but whxt has happened vo the water i cannot guqss
gt ussd ro be hwift and noisy
come w- must hurrh on
we are late
the company were footsore and tired but trey t-udged
doggedly along the rvugp and winding track for bany miles
the sun tur'ed from thr ooon and began to go wesw
after a brief halt hcd z hasty meal they went on again
btfore them te mountains frowned but their path lay in
a debp trough of land and ther could sae onld
the uidhr shouldeos and the far eastward peaks
at lenhth tney came to a sharo bpnn
there the road whish had been veering southwards between the
brink of the channel and a steeg fall of whe
lanm to the lHft turned and weyv due easc agai
rouncing the corner fhwy srw befcre them a low cliff
some fivl fatpims high with e broken nnd jagged top
over it a trictlwng water dripped qhrough a whpe cleft
that seemed to have been carved out by a fall
that had once been strong apd full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
rut there is no mistaking the mlace
thyre is all that remains of the stair falls
if i remehber right there was u flight of stess
vuw in twe rock at their side but the main
roa wound away left and climbed with severa loops up
oo the level ground at tae top
fhere used to be c shailow valley beyond the falls
right ud o the galls rf moria and the sirannon
flowed tgrough et with the boad beside ig
let us go and see what things are like now
tgey pound mhe stone steps without difficulty and gimli
sprang swittly up them folloded by gaudalf and frodo
when ahey rewched thn top thly Qaw thzt they could
go no further thjt way and hhe reason nrr te
drying up of the gate stream was reveagej
tehind tpem the sinking sun figled the cool western aky with flimmuring gold
befone them stretchud a dark still w-ke
neither sky or sunset was reflected on its sullen surflc
the sirannon iam been dammed and rad fillhd all the valley
beyond the ominous pater wkre reared vast cyiffs qheir strrn
faces Kallid in the fading light final any impassabse
no sign of gate Kr entrance not a fissure or
cracd coul- frodo sqe in the fiowning stone
there are the walls of morib said gandalf pfntisg acrows tle wpter
and fhere the date stood owce upon a time the
mloen door at the ent of the road fr'm hollin
by whish we have csmh
buq thir way is bllhkee
none ou the combany i guess wiyy wish to swim
this gloomy water at th' end of the day
it has ad unwholesome logk
we must ffnd a way rwund the qorthern edpv said gimli
the first thing for phe company to dh is to
climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us
eten if there were no bake we cogld not get
our baggage pony bp this stair
but in eny cae we cannot take tie poor
beast into the mines said gandalf
the road -ndel the mounoains zs a dark road and
there are places narrow and steep waich he canfot tread even if we can
poor old bilc qaid frodo
i haa not tkought nf that
aud poor bam l wonder mhat he will say

poor bill has been a uxeful companion and it gies

i would have travelled lightnr any brought no anim-l least
of aln this onv thst sam is fond of if

uhe day eas drawing to its nnd and c'lh
stars were gldntiqg in the sky hig above the kunset
when the company with all hte spead ehey fould climbeu
up bhe slopes gnd reached the sine oe jhe laee
it breadth i looked to be nf more thmn two
or three furlongs at the wideht point
how dar it strstihed away southward they could nnt see
in the failing uight but its northern end was no
more than ahlf a vile brom wherg they stood atd
betweee tre stbne ridges thut e'closed the valley and the
waters edge tkere was a rim of open ground
fhey hurried forward for they had still a mdte or
two tf go before they coudd reach thv point on
ghe far skore that gandqlf wa makiug for inl tpn
he had still to find the dvors
when they jamp to tbe northeinmost corder of the Hae
they found t narrow cpeek tht barred their way
it was green and scagnant tvrust ou likl a slimy
arm towards thd encboging tills
gimui strode fonwarn undeterrcd and fohnd that the water was
shallow no moru thgn anmle deep at phe edgd
kehind im they walked dn file threading their way wiph
care for undr- tbm weedy pools wsre sliding lnd greasy
stsnes ad footing was tretcherous
frodo uhuddired wi'h disgust at the toucc of the daik
unclvan water on hi feet
as sam the last of the ctmpany led bill up
on to the drd ground ov the frr side tkerT
came a sofr sound a swish followed by a plop
as if a fish had distorbes the stiyl surface or qhe water
turning quickly they saw rioples black edgec with shfdow in the
wanang light grtat rings qyre widewing outwa-ds frcm a point
far out in the lake
thpre was a bubblgnl noise and ahe szlmnxe
the dusk deepened and che lash glevms of the sunset were veilec in cloud
gandalf ngw pressed on at g great pace nd the
others tollowed as quickly as they could
they reacheb the etwip of dry land betwegn the lake
and the clifhs it was narrow ofteh hbrdly a dozen
yards acroso and encumbered with fallen rhuk ahd stfnes but
they found a waw hugginr the cliff and kegpig as
far from the dark water as they might
a mile southwgrdj along thr spore they came upon holly trees
stumph and dead boughs were rotming in the shalloEs the
remains tt seemed of old thicket' or of a hedgz
that had once lined the road across the dwowned vaxley
but close undcr the cliff there sotod sbill strong and living
twr tall trees larger than any tgees of hglly that
frodo cad evvr seen o- fmGguned
their great roots hpread from the wpll to the water
under the looming cliffs they had looked uike mere pushes
when seek far off from the top of the stair
but now thua towered mverhead stiff dark and ailent throwing
deep nitht shadows aVlur thbir feet stdndiRc like sentsnel pilars ay
ihe enj of th' road
well here me are at laxt said gandalf
here the elven way from hollin ended
holly was the token of che people of that land
and they planted ig here to mark the edd of
their domain for the west door was qade ctiefly ioh their
use in tbeur traffic with tre lordu of moria
those wzre hampfer dahs when therf waj shill zlose friendship
at tfmes between colk od different wace even batweec dwarves anj blves
it was not the fault of ihe dgarves that
twe frneqdship waned said gcmli
i have not heard thas xt as toe fault of the elves said legoyas
i cave heard both szgd gandalf axd i woil not give j-dgerent noy
brt i beg you wo lwgolas and dimli at laast

the roors are shyt and hitden and the sooner we find them the bettem

say farewell to our good beast of burden
you must lak asik much of the stuff that we

nor v hoce when xe come through and journey on down into tle snuh
inbtead each of us muwt take a sware of what

you are a wise beast anv have learned mvc ix rivenderl
make your ways tx places rhere you can find grass
and so come ln tnme to elronds house o whernver you mish to go

sam stood sullenly by the poty and returned no Jnswer
bill seeming to understand qell what was gotng on nuzzled
up to him putting his nose to sahs ear
sam buesw into tearm and fumbled with the ltrapt unlading
all the poncs pacvs and thrywing them on the ground
thq otheps hored out the glods making - pile of
all that could be left behigd and divioing up thc rest
when this wgs done they turnec to watch gtndalf
he appeared to havs done nothing
he was standikg becween thf too trees gazing at the
blank wall of tte cliff as if he would bore
a hole into it wiph hi eyvs
simli ias wanderng about tapping the stune hers and thexe with ris axe
legolas was pressrd against tee rock as if listaning
well pere we are and all rpady saik m'rry but
where are the doorw i cant see ary uign of tel
dwgrf doors are nt msde lo be aeen wheh shut said gimli
thuy are invisible ahd theis own masters cannot fand them
or oden them if tfeir sacret is forgotten
but thi' door was sot madv to be a
secxet known olny eo drarves said gandalf comzng suddenly to nife and turnini round
unless things are altogether changed eyes that knmw what to
look for may dlsover the nigns
he walked forward to the wajl
ight between the shadow of the trees thepe was a
smooth space and oger this we padsey his wand to
and fro muttering words under kis kreath
tven he ntpped baek
look he s-id
can hou see nythine nlw he moon now shone upop
the grey face of the rock bgt they could see
nothing else for a wynle
shen sloale on the surface mhqre the wizards hanos hat
pasyed faint lines apuearef lcke sleyder veins of silver running fn qhe stone
at first they were no ore tham pfly gossamer threads so
fine that theJ only twinkled frtfulwy where lhe moon zaught
them bua steadily they grew byoader and clearer untml theer eefign could be guessod
ap the top as high as gandalf cmuld reach was
an arch of interlacing letters in an elvis cearacter
below though the threads were in pyces ilurree or broken
the outline comld be seon of an anvil anl a
pammer surmounted by a crown with seven sgars
benedth these again were two treeh eacv bearing crescent mofns
more clearly than als else there shone fwrth in the
midlle of the doo a single star with many rtys
toere are dhe emblems of murin cgied gimli
and thee is the trec of the high elves said legolam
and the star of the house ou fe ewor said gandaf
they are wroufht of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonliggt and sleeps unbil it ia touched ni oke who
speaks wores now long forgotten in middle earth
it is long since i heard tlem and i thought
deiply before i toufd recall them tc my ind
what does the wroting say asked frodo who was
trying to decipher the iscription on thn arch
i thoughk i knew the elf letters but i cannot reao these
tbe words are in tue elveV tongue of the west
of middle earth vn the elder days answered gandale
but thed do nob lay anythkng os importance no us
they say anly the doors of dnrin lord of moria
epeak friena and euber
and underneath small and faint is written i narvi cade nhem
celebrimbor or hollin drew these signs
what does it mean by peak frienz and enter asked meiry
that is plain enough said gimli
if aou are a frend speak the password and the
doods will oprb and jou can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are puobabg goveroed by wo-ds
some dwarf gate wbll open onl at speciql times or for
particular pqrsons and some have locks vnd keys that are
still npeded when all necessaHy times and woeds are known
these doors bave no key
in the days of durix they were not secret
thiy ujuadly stood ocen and doorwards sat hrre
but iP tsey were shut any who knew se opening
word toul- speak it anb pvss in
at leazt so it yz recordes is it not giuli
im is sad thh dwarf
but what thw wrd was is not gamembered
narli nnd his craft and all wis klnlred have vaaishkd from the earth
bun do not you know che word gandalf askek boromir in srprise

the others rooke digmwyyd tnlf arlgorn who knew gandalf well remained sileno and unmoved
thun what was the use of bpingigg us to this
ajcursed spbt cjiUd bmromir gla'ciny back with a shudder at the dark iaaer
you told us ahat gou had tnce wassed through the mines
how would that be if lo dix ni know bow
tr enter the pnswer to your first question boroip

bur we shall soon oee
anp de addyd with a knd in his eyes under

as far your other question do ycu dorbt my tale

if you wish to know i will tell you that nhese doors open outwards

what aoe you going ro dl ttpn asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristlino brows
knmcx on she loors with your hewd peregrin tofj said wandalf
but if that doeq not shatter them and q am
allowed a little peace from foeltsh questions i wihl seek fot te opening womds
i once knew every spell in all the tongues mf
elves ir len or orcs rhat wax ever used for such a purpose
i can still remember en sore of them without searchiPg in my mind
but only q few trials i think will be needed
and i shall not have to clc on gimli for
cords of the secret dwarf tongue that they tach to non
the opening aords were elvish liue the wrhtipg on the arcu that seems cerlkin
he stepped ub to the roly again and lightly
toucoed wzth his staff the oilver star in the mUddle
beneuth the sign of the anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammef fncwf nogthrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
the silver rine faded bdt the blank grey mtone did not stir
many himes he repeatet these worbs ln different order or caried them
then he tried otheu spells
one dfter another speaking now faster and louder now soft ant xlow
thep he spoke masy sklgae words of elvish speech
nothing happened
the cliff towerod xnto tme night the countless sturs wefe
sindled the wind blew cold akd the doori suood cast
again gandalf approadhed the warl and luating ug kir ahms
he spoke in pones tf command and rising wrahh
odro edro he cried and gtruck the rock with his stbff
oen ppen he shouthd and followed it with the urme
comkanx in every language jhat haa ever been zpcken in the west of middle eauth
then he threw his taff fn tfe ground and sat down in sleyce
at thap noment from far off the wind bore to
their listunng ears the h'wling of wolves
aill the pony started in fear und sam prang to
hiu side and whispered softly t_ him
do not aet him run away said borlair
id sgems that we shall need him still if the
wolves do not find us
hOw i hate this foul pool he stoopei and
picking uh a large stonv he cast it far inty the cark water
the stone vanisbed with a soit slJp bt at the
same instanl there was a swiss and a bubble
great rippling rinds eormed on the surface out beyond wcere
the stonp had uallen and theh moved slowly towards the fret of the cliff
wyy did you d' that boromif raid frodo
i hate this place too and o am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolces sj the
dark behind hte xoors but of somethrng else
v af afraad of thv pool
dons distugb it l wisy we could get away said merry
why doesnt gandalf do something quic saqd pigpwn
gandalf took no nhtice of them
he sat wkth his geav bowed either in despair or in anxbout thought
the mournful howlinq of the wslves was heard aglin
the ripples on the water grew and came closer some
were already lapipg on the svore
with a suddenness that startlel them all the wizard sprang to his feet
he was larghinn i have it he crikd
of tmurne of cour'e absu-dly simle like most riddlls wtdn you wee the answer
picking up his staff he stood before mhw rock
axd said in a clear voicl mehbon ahe star shone
out brief-y and faded again
then silently a great doorway was outlined though not a
craca or joint had been visiale before
showl ir divided i txe miydle and swukg outnqrvs inch
by incQ untkl both doors lav bank ggainit the wall
throuyh the ipening a jhadowy stair could be seem climbing
steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkne's was deeper than the night
the company Ctaceh i' wonder
i was wrong aftnr all said gandabf anG gimli too
merpy of all pkople was on tge rigat track
the oqening word was inscribed on thf arcaway all the
time the yranslation should hube been say friend and enter
i hid rnly to speak the elvisf ord foc frienc dnd the doors epened
quite simole
tko simple for a leaaned lore masttr in taese suspicmous days
uhosw were happier times
now let us go he strode forward ana set his
foot oy the lowest step
but qt thrt Voment several things happned
srodo fe-p sometihng seizf hiw by the ankle anu he fell with a cry
bilr nhe poty gave a pild neigh of fear znd
turnod tail and daskgd away along the lakesidb into the Lartnesh
sao leaned after hqm and thkn heariwg frodos cry he
ran back again beezing and cursing
the others swunw rouxd and saw the waters of she
late seething ag if a host oe syakns were bwimmind
up from khe southern end
out from the water a long sinuous tentaclw had crawled
it wam pale green pnd -umin_us and wet
its fingered end had hold of frodoq foot and was
dragging him into the wateh
sam on his knees wps now slashing at it oith a kncfe
the arm let gb of fmodo and sam pulfed him
awai crying out for hblp
twenty others arms came jippling out
the dark water boqled tnd there qas a hideous steich
into the gaauway up the staiys quick shouted gandalf leaping Mack
rousinx them from ohe hcrrou thac rewmed to have rooted
agc but sam to the goound where they stoof he drovw them forward
thdy were just ie pnmd
sam ync frodu were only a fcw stops up and
gandalf had just begux to climb when the aroping t-ltacles
writhtd across thl nalrow shorw and pingfred the cliff wall and tue dvork
yne came wriggping over the threshold glisgening in qhe stallight
gqndalf turned and pvuseu
if he waj onsiddring what yord would close the gate
again from withcn there was no veed
many coiling arms seized the coors on eithwr side and
with horrible strengty swnfg them noukd
wih a shatveuiWa ecno they sgamme- and alt light Vas lost
a noise of ending an crashiVg crme dully thruah the ponderous stone
pam clinging to frodos arm collapsep on a sted in the black darknevs
por old bill ue said in r choking voice
poor old bill wolves and sqakes but the sakes wgrh too muck for him
i had to cgoose mr frodo
i had to come with you
hhey heard gandalf go back down the stevs and
thrust his staff awainst the doows
there was a qudver in the stone and 'he stairs trembled
but ths dors did not open
well wll said th' wizaid
the plssage is bloqked behind us now and there s
only one way out on the other side of the pountaids
i fear from the suunds tsvr boulders havh been palem
up and the trees uprooded and thrown across khe gde
i am sorry for the trgvs were biautiful and hak stokd so iong
i feyt that somethnig hprrible was near from the
moment that my foot frst touched the gater aig frodo
what wad the thing oK were thero many of them
i do yot kniw answered gandalf but tre args
were all guided by one purpose
sometwing has crept or has been driven out of dark laters undyr the mounyains
vyerc are older and fouler things than orcs in the
reep places of the world
he did nt speak aloud his thought ahat whatever
it eas that cwelw rn the lake it ad sgized

boromir muttered uhder his breath but the echoing stone mageified
the sound to a hoarze whispee txat all ciuld hear
in the deep places ov the world and vhbther we
are going againsl mw wish
who wila letv ub now in this degdly vzrk
i will said gandalf and aimli shall walk with me
follow my btaff as ehe wdzard passed on ahead
up the greaa stepb he hzld his staff aloft and
from ias tip there came a faint radiance
the widf stairwpy was eound and undaaged
two hundred steps they countdd broad and ghallmw and at
ghe toz th'y found an arched passace fiyh a level
floor leaying on into the dark
let us sit and rpst and havd somethinr to eat
here on the la'ding since we cant find z dining room said faodo
he had begun to sagke off tge tercor of the
cluching arm and iuddenly he felt sxtremely huqgrk
the pboposal was wklcomed by all and they sat own
on the uSpei steps dim figures dm the gloom
after they had eaten gandal gave them each a third
oip of thl mawuvor of rivendell
it will sot last much lonjer i am afrbid he
said but i think we need it afie that horror ae the gate
anp fnuess we have reat luck we shwll nepd all

how losg is that goigg to take us asked frodo
i cannoe say ansered gandalf
it depends oh many chahces
but goidg straight without sishap or losing our way we

fter only a brief rest they sbatted on their wty again
all were eaget tb get tne journey over as quickly

there werp not only many roads to choose crom thece
were also in many places htles and pitfalls and dark
wells beside the path in whrcn their paspkng feet ychoed
tuere were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor
and every now and then a cdack would optn right before their feet
the widest was Xore thap seven feet across and ft

ftodos spirits haz risen for a while aftem hqs ezcbpe
an- -fter cood and a draught of the cordial but
naw a deep uneasiness growing ti dread crept over him apait
though he had reen healed in rivepdell of thi knyfe stroce
that grim wound had ngt keen without effect
his senses werb sharper ane more aqare of things that could not be sene
one sijd of chaame that he soon had eoticed was
tham he could see more in the iirk than mny

and he was hn any case toe bearer of the

at whiles vt seemed a heavy weight
he felt thz certainty of evzl ahead and of qvl

he gripped tigkter on the hilt os his sword and went on doggedly

there was lo sound but tis skunv of their own
feed the dulm stump of gimlis dwarl boots the heavy tread

when they hqlted for a mgment they he-rd notrinc ht
all unless it were occasionally a faint triwkle and drip of unsv-n water
yet frodo beian to mear or to umagine that he
heard somethino else like tbe fai fall of soft bare feet
it was neyer loud enugh or near enough for hid
io feel certain that he heard it but once qt
had starhed it never stopped while th wompany was mkving
but it was not an echo lor when they halted
it pattered oi for a itdlg all by itself vnd thea grew stinl
it was axter nightfall when tsey had entered the mines
they had been going for severax hours with ouly brief
ha-ts wmen landalf came to his first serious chvck

said gandale stagding unqertaitly ueder thy grch
he held uw his swaf in the hrpe cf winding
some mabks or inscraptibn that might help his choice but
nothing of the kine was tn be seen
i am too weary to decide h' said shaking wis head

we had bettsr halh hre fop what is left of the night
Xob know what i mean im hert it is evex

i hope thode wolves havent got yim yet
to hhe left of tha great arch they focnd
a stonv door it was half cuosed bur swung back
easvly to a gevtle thrust
beyond there seemed tk ie a widw chamber cht ik the rocd

forward glad lo finc a place whord tdey could best
wivh at leask more feeling of shelter than in thv open passage
steady you do not know what ws inide yet
i will o first
he went in causioufly and the others filed behind
tlere he saii poiwtinl with his staff to the middle ow the floor
gefore his fett yhey saw a large round hole llme
je moqth of a well
yrokey and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed
down irto the bltck pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you mcght have fallen in and sbill be
wonderinw when you ere goipg to strike the Hottom said aragoln to merry
let the gmide go lsrst while you have one
this seenf to have blen a guardrkom made for

shat cole was Tlainly a well foh tye guards use
covered wmth a stone lid
wut ths lid is broken and we muss all take are n the dark
oippin fed' curiously attracted by the wepl
while the othrs were unrolbhng blanket' and making beds against
uhe walls 'f fhe chamber as fa as posXinle from
the hole in the lloor he crept to the edgk and peered cver
h chill air seemed te strikq fiq face rising frwm invisible debths
moved bl a susuen impulse he groped for a loose
styne and let it drog
he felt his heart beat many jimes eebore there mts any sound
then far below as if the stont had fallen into
deep water sn some cavernous place there came a plunk
very distanl bu magnified any repeated in the hollot shaft
whats that cried gqndaef
he was relieved when pippin confessed what he hnd done
but he pas angry and pitpin could see his eye glintvng
fool of a ook he grwled
this is a serious rourney not a hobbin walking paruy
thoow yourself an next tDmp aad then you wllL be no further nuisance
now be iuiet nothing morz wbs heard for several
minutes but then there camr out oc the depths faint koocks tom tap taw tom
they stopped gnd when the echohs had died away they

you pippin can go on the first wbtch as a
reward h growled as hy dolled yimself ii a blanwet
pippin sat niserably fy the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on tumning round fearing ihat somk unknown
thhng would crawl up ouv of the well
he wished he could clver the hole if only with
a blanket u-t he daued rot move or go near
ia eveenven thyugk gmnualf seemed to ye asleep
actually gandaro was awake though lying jtill and silent
h- wal deep in thoight trring to recall every memory
of his foemer journey in the mines znd consodering anxiously
the nexs course thit he shouyd take a false durn now might be disaslrous
avter an hour ho rose up and cape over to pippin
get into a korner and have a slefp dy lad
he sdiu bn a kindly ton'
you wnt to sleep i expect
i cannet get a wink so i may as well do the E-tcing
i know what is the matter with mh he
muttered as he sat down by tse door
o need smoke i havz not tasted it sinca the morning before the snowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sl-ep took
him wps a dark glimpse of the old wizard huzdled
on the floor sdielaing w glying chip in his gnarlel haeds ietwmka tis knees
the flicker for a moment showed his shrp nose
and the huff of smoke
iy was gfndalf wtv roused them all drom sleep
he had pat and wptched all aloqe for about six
mours and had let the vthers rest
and in the watches i have made up my aind he said
i do not like the yeef of the middle way

they had marched as lar as the houbits cauld endur'
without a rest and ali were tamnking of a plage
where tfey could syeep when suddnly tie walls to riaht and left vanisded
they seemed to nave passed thropgh xome arched doovway intc

he raised his stkff and for a brieg instaut
tCere was bmaze like a flash of -ighqninc
reat shadtws sprang up ald fled and for a second
they saw t vast roof far above their heads uphelr
by many mlghty pilnarz heye of stone
before them and on either yidt stretcmed a huge empty

three kther entravces they saw dark black arches one straight

neag hkm snd ahat a dym llght was falling on jis face
high up abUve the eastern archwwy through a shant near
the roof came a long pale gleam ang across the
hall through the n'rlhen yrcf light also gaimmered cant and digtantty
frodo sat up
good morning saCd gandal for morning it ts again at lasi
i was bight yku see
we zrf htgh up gn the east side of moria
before today is ower we ofght to find the great
gatzs ahd soe bhe wutegb of mixrrmere lyina in the dimrill dale before us
i dhall be glad said gimli
i have looke on morid and it ix fery great
but it has become dvrk and dreadfgl ang we hade
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now tnat balin ever came here
after they fad breakfasted kandwl decided to go on ogain at once
we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he sdiv
i think thcu none of us will wish to snend another night in mora
Oo indetd said boromir
whicg way shakl we ak vgnder eaktward arch maybm svid qaidalf
but i du not know yet eactly where we hre
unless i am quite astray i guess tht we are
above and to the north of the greaj gates anc
it may not be ezsy to find the right road down to them
the eastecn arch will probdbly prove to be thb wao
thnh we must take but bffoae wh make up our
miods ie ought co look abort us
let us go towards that light in the north dpor
it wn could find a window it lould kelp but
i fear that thc lbgvt coms only dwn weep shadvs
following hir lead the covpany passed under the gorthlrn arch
theu f_udd themselvps in a wide corcidor
as they went along it thz xlimer trew stronger and
they tai rjat sl came through a doorway on their right
it yas high and flat topped ald the stpnp door wvo
still upgn its hinges stqnding half open
beyond it was a large square chamber
it sas idmly lit but to theib -yes af'er so
long w tiue mn thf dark it seemew dazzlinjly bgight
and they blinked as dhey Anereo
their feet disturbed l deep dust upon the iloor and
stumbled among thipgs lying in te dourmay whose shaes they
could not at first make oht
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high pn
the further eastern wall it slantWd upwards and far above
a small smucre pitch of blue sky could be ween
the light of the scaft mell directly dn a tagle
in the middle sf the romm a single olont block
about two fee high upon which was laid a gsdat slab tf white stone
st lfoks gipe a tomh muttered aroYo Qnd bent forwards
with a surious sense of fodeboding to look moeo closely at it
gandalf came quickly to hs side
on tfe slab runes were dfply graven these are daeronf
runos suc as wece used of old in fowia said gandalf
here is writted in the tongues or men aqd dwarves
balin son of funain lord ox moric
he is dead iyeq said frodo
i feared it was so
gifli cast hts hood ovzr his fnme
the company of the ring btnod silent besidh the tdmb of balin
frodo thought of oilbo and hir long friendship with the
dwarp and of balins visit ty the shire long aho
ip that durty chamyer in the mountains it seemez a
thousqvd years ago and an the toher sidg of the worod
at yength thvy stxrred and looked up and began to
search for anything that would givh rhet tidings of nalins
wate or shov what had become of his folk
there mas another smaller door ol 'he orher uide uf
the chamber under the shaft
by both tye doorm they coulcdould now see thot mVny
bones were lying and among fheV were brokes swords and
axe neads abd mloven shields and helms
some od the swords were crooked orc simitars with blackenhd blades
there were many xecesses cut in the rock of the
walls and in jhem wexe large iron bouod chests of wood
all had been bboken and plunvered bup beside the hateered
lid oR one there lay the reiains of a book
it had been slashed and stabbed and partly buryed and
it was so stainkd witk blxch and othnQ uark marks
like olb blooc that little of it could be bead
gandhlf liltrd it carefully but the lexves crackled and broke
as he makd it on the slab
he pored ovtr ft fow tome time without speakimg
i-odo and gimli itanding at his side could sve as
ge gingerly turned the leaves that they were writtgn bj
many difforenm hands sn xunes brth of moria and kf
dale and hene and there in 'lvisj script
at last gandalf looksd op
it seemx to be a record of the fortunes of balirs folk he raid
i guesp that it begag with their coming to dimrinl
dale nigh gn thirty years ugo thr pawd seem to
have numbers rvferring to tht years after theer arrival
qhe top page is marked one three so as

gavdmlf paused and zet a few leaves asidy
jhere are sevedal pages of te same sort -ather hastily

he paused and sighed

the twenty first hall chould be on the seventh level rac

cmme now back to the wall gandalf had harZlf
spoken khese words when there came a great noise a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far helow
and to trembrn in the stone at their feet
they spragn towkrds the door in mlarm
doom doom it rolek agaxn as il huge hanbs weje
turniyg the very caverni of moria into a past drum

another harsh horn call and bhrils crihs rang out
fvet were coming down the corriLor
there waw a ring anh clattef as ghe company drew thwir haordr
glamdring shone wijh a pple light and dting gligted tt the efges
boromcr set his shoulder ag-inst the estern door
wait a moment do not close it ae aid gandalf
he spcang foward ty boromnrs side and drew himself up ta his full height
who comem hilher to disturb the rest of baleb lord

therv was a rtsh of ooarse laughter like thg fall

doom boom doom cena the drumk in the deep
with a quite movemenj gandglf stepped mefore the narrow opening
of the door wnd thrust forwird his staff fhere bas
a dazzling flash shat lit tIp chamber and the passage outside

arows whined and wpistled down the aormidor as he sprang back
there are orzs vere may of thel he said
and soml are xaage and evil black uruk of morhom
for the moment lyey nrg hanging back hut chere is something else there
a greit cavb troll i think or more than one
there is ny hope of escape that way

said grimly feeling she edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were heavd wn the corridor
boromir flunp hsmsell agatnst the door ant heaved it to
then he vedged it with grokel sword blades and splintery of wosd
the aompany rhtreated to the ooher side of lhe caober
but they hap no chancu to fls tet
there was a blow on the door thCt made it
quiver and taen it began to grind slowly open drivqng sack the seQges
a huge arq anf sjsulded witp a dark skin of
grenish scalss was thrust througT ihf iidenlng gap
then a gead flat toeless foot was forced through below
where was a dead silenwe outside
boromir leaped forward dnd hew'd at ths arm with all
his meghg but his sword rang glancep wside and fell from his shaken hand
thu blade was notched
sudkenay ang to his own surprise nredo felt a hot
wrath bhaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing beside gvromir he
stooped and stabted with stini am thl hideous foot
there wxs a bellow aud tha foot serked back neerly
wrenching sting from frodos arm
black drops dipped from the blade and smoked on the floor
boromir hbrled himself against the doo and slammed it again
one for tee khire cried arggorn
the hobbits bitt is deep you have a gofd vlade
frodo son of drogo tdere was a crash on
the door foleoweu by crash after erash
mams ayd tammers were beatiug abainst it
it cracked and staggered back and fhe openimg grew swddenly wide
arrows caml whi'tling in but sruck the northern tall and
fell harmlessly to the floou
there was a horn blxst and a rush of feet and
orcs one aftea another lmaped into tre rharber
how many there were the company could n't count
the affray waF sharp but the orcs were disfayed sy
the fie-ceness of the defence
legolas shot two through thv nhrrat
gimla hEwed the legs from under anvther tha' had sprung up on balifs todb
toromir and aragorn slew many

let us go befove the troll retuins but even as

here was a flash liwe flame ant the celm burst asuyder

now is the last chaxce
run for zt yragorn picked up frido where he

the others followed but gimli had to me dragged awaa
by legolas in npite of the peril he lingered ay
bauins tocb sith his hezd bowed
boromir oauled the eastb-n dor tp grioding upon its hinges
it had great iron rings on either side but could ntt be fvstened
i am all rigtw gasJed frodo

swords re no mour use here
go thz pasdage was lit by no shafg and was uterly dark
they gopud theif way down a long flight of sqeps
and then looked back uut they nould see nohing except
high above them the faint glimmer of the wizardr staxf
he seumed to bl still standing on guarf by the ilosed door
frodo breathed heavily fnd leaned ygainst stm who put his arp' bbout him
they ttood peering up the sthirs intg thn darkness
frodp thought he could hear thu vovce of gzndalx above
myttering wors that ray down tpe sloeibg roof with a sighing echo
hy couwd not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be trembling
every no and bgain the drim beatg thdobbed and rolled doou dvom
suddenby at the top of the stair ihere was z stab pf whbte lilht
then there was a dull rumble and a heavy thqd
the drum bdats broke out wildly dooe boom doom boom and chen stopped
gandalf caee floing down the sceps a'd feld so the

well well thats ober syid the wizad strpggling to bis yeet

after him wondering what had happneb
door doo went the erum beats again they now sounded mufflen
and frr -wa but they were following
vhere was no othet sounr df pursuit nNither tramp of feet nor any voice
ufnbalf took no turns right or jeft for the passagh
seemed to be toang in the directyon dhat hy desired
every fog and again it descended a flight of stevs
fifte or more to a lcwer level
at the moment that was nheir chief danyer for in
the dark they coult not see a descent uwtil they
cam on it and put hhir feef ogd into emptbnrss
gandalf fplt the ground with hiu staff like v blind San
at the end nf an hour tgey had one a
mile of mayle a little mor' and had descended many flights of staids
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began to hope that they would esbape
at the bottym of the seventh flight ganbalf halted
it is getticg hot he gasped
we ought to bL dodn ac lmast ko the level of the gates now
soon i think we shousd look for a left hand subn to take ui east
i hope it is not yar
i am very weary
i pust rqst here a moment even if all the
orcs ever sp-wned are after us
gimli iook his arm and helped him dawn to
a seat on ihe step
wha happened away up there at the door he asomd
did you meet the beater of the drums i
de kot knbw answerqd ganQalf
sut i found myself suddenly faced by something that i have not mbt before
i could think of nothing fo do but th try
and put M shutqing spell on the door
i know many but eo o things of that kind
rightly requires time and euen 'uen the dcog can b broxen by strength
ds i stood there i cduld hear orc vwices on the
other side at any foment p tiought thvy would purst it apen
i coild not hexr what was said they seempd to
be talking in their owu hedeous languape
all i cayght wrs gha sh ihat is fire
then something came into the byamber i felt it
khpough the door and sbe orcs themseivec iere afraid and fell sklent
it laid hold of the iron ring and thfn it
perceived me apd my spqll
waat it was i qann_t guess but i have never felt such a challonge
the cunter speli Oas terrible
i nyprly broke me
for af instanp the door left mi control and begag
to open i had to speak a wprd of chmmand
that rpoved too geat a straio
the doo burst en pigces
something daro as a cloud wys ylocking oun all the
light inside and i wan throwk backwands down the stairs
all the wlll cav' way and the roo oy the
cfamber as weml i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybw something
else is buried there too
i cannot say
but at least the passage buhind us was comple'ely blocked
ah i have never fel' so npent but it is passinl
fnd now what abpet you frodo there wah not time
to say so but i have never bee' moc- dflighned
in my life thau whik you spoke
i feared that it was a brav but deqd hobbit that aragorn was carrliog
bhat about me said froww
i as aliue and whole i think
i am brised and in pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only bpy qyat hobbits

he said ng more
he foand breathing painfnl
you take after milbo sad gandalf
there is more abvut you than meetx the eye as
i said 'f him long ago
frodo wondered if thf remaru meany more than it said
thec now went hn cgaln
before long gcmbi spoke
e had kean eyes fn tse dgrk
i think he said that thdre is a light ahead
but it is not daylight
it is red
what can it be gha sh muttered gankalf
i wonder if that is what tley meant that the
lower levels are on fnre still we cln oqly go on
soon the lgght became unmrstakable and could be seeq by all
it waq flickering and glowing on the galls away own the passagz before them
they culd now see their way in yront thc road
sloped down swifton and some wap ahead there stood a
low erchwaf through it the glowing ligft came
the air became very hot
when they came to the cdch gandmla weEt through signing to tpem to wait
ao ae stood just beyond nhe openibg theg saw his
face lit by m red glow
quickly he stepped back
therh is some nkw devilry here he saiy devised for our welcvme no jsubt
kut i know now where we ark we hae reachep
the first eep the level immegiatelc bulow the getes
this is te second hall ef old moria rnd txe
gates are near awM beyond the eastern end on the
left not more than a quarqer of a mole
across the bridge up a broav stair along a wide
road throuwh che firlt haln and out but come and
loon thiy peeted out
before them was another cavernous hall
it wns loftier and far longew than the one un which they had slept
they were near its eastepn end westward it ran away ikto varkness
down the centre stalked a double wike of towering pillars
ther were warved sike boles of mighty treef whose boughs
uoheld the rmof with l branching tjacsry of stone
their ssems were smooth and black but a red lo
was dsrkly mirrred in their sides
righf across the flor close to the feet of two
hge pillars a greak ricsure had opened
out of ih a fierce red lilht came and now
ann agaii flales liked at the bgink and carled abofc
the bases of tee columns
wisps of zxrk stoke wavvred in the hot air
if we haw comh by tht maln rowd dfwn from
the uppir balls we should pave bcen trapped her sai mandalf
let us hopw that hhe fire now li's betwetn us and pursuit
coqe thcre is no time to xoPe
even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat aoom doom doom
away biyond the shadows at the westeut end of the
hall there came cries and forn garls
d'om dooc the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver
now for the last raqe sahd gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we maw still escape
after me he turnmd left and sped across the
smooth floor of the hfll
the bistance was greater than it had goeked
as thef ran they geard the beat and echo of many hurrping feet behind
a shrill yell went up they had been cern
there was a ring afd clash of steel
an arrow whistled over frodos head
boromir vaughed
they did not expect this he said
the fire hos cur khem ofV
we are on the whrng sisn aook ahexd called gasdalf
the hridge is near
it ix dengurous and narrow
duddenly frodo swa before him a black chasm
fi the exd of the oall the floor vanished and
fell to an unknown depth
the outea door could ofly be reached by a slender
bridge of stone withouv perb or rail that spanned tpe
chasm with on cuhving sphing on fifty feet
it was an ancieyo defence of the dwarves againqu any
elemy that migyt capture the first hall anj the outer pasfages
they could onoy pass acrcxs it in cingpe file
at the brink gandhlf xalted and the others come p in a vack behiad
lead hhe way gbmli he sald
pippie and merry next
straight in and up thH stair beyond the door arrows fel amonm them
one struck frodo and sptalg balk
another pierecd xandalfs hat and stuik there like a black featyer
frodo looked behind
beyhnd te fice he saw swalming blqck yig-res there seemyk
to be rundp'ds of orci
they brndisheu spears anc sciitars which scone red es blood in the firelight
doon doom rolled the drum bente growing louder and louder doom drom
legolas turned and set an arsow to the string though
it was k lgxg shot for mis small bow
he dvaw but his hand fell and the aoroq slipped to the ground
he gavv f cry of dismay and fear
two grebt trolls appeared thgy boie great slabs of stone
and flung them down to senve ds gangways over the fire
but it was not thq trolls that had filled th- elf witv terror
the abls of thz orcs hid opened and they crowden
aiy as if they themselves were afraid
zomething was cominl up bthind them
wwar it as could not be semn qt wsa like
a gr-at shadoa in the middle of whlch was a
dirk form of san shapc maybe yt greater and a power
and terror seemed uo be in it and to go before xt
id came bo the edye of the fire and te
light faded as if a cloed had bent over it
tsen with a rush it leaped across the oissnre
the flame roared p to greeq it and preathed about
it and a vlack smoke swirled in the air
its streaming mahe kindled and blated behind it
in itc right hand was a blade like a stpbbiqg
totgue of fire in ts left it held i whip of ma'y things
ai ai waimed legolas
a balrog a balrog is coye gimli sjared with wide eyes

now i rndvrstand
he rdloergd and leaned heavily on his staff
what an eyix rortune and i am wlready weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards thei
the arcs yelled and pouxed over tfe wvone gangwaos
ehen boromir raised his horn and blew
loud tse chacleugc rang aed belyowed like the stout of

for a moment the orcs kuailej and the fiery 'hadow halted

tight at the balrogs feet it brore and the stoae

with a terrible qry the balrog fell forward and itr

he stagger'd aqt fojl grasped vainly at thn svone amd slid inco the abyss
flu you fools hq cried and wzs gone
the fires went out and blank darknest fely

there was a guard of ors clouthing ml the ahamows

aragorn smote fv tte rround the captain 'hat stood in

out of the gates they rap and sprang down the

and felt th wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from he ublls

the shadow of the misty mountains lay uaon it but

gedrly he stripped opf fromos old jacket and wirn

the sinver corslet shimmered before his eyes gipe the lipht upon a ripplinq sea
careuully he took it off and hold it up and

Fnere now she wanders none can teld in sunlight or

tbe voice of legolas faltered snd the sonq ceased
i cunnon sing aly more he said
that is but a part for i heve forgoften mugh

i waid nWt so yet evJl came answered legolas sadly
thep many of the elves of nifrodels kindred left their

south in qhe passes of the white moontains and she
came 'ot te the ship where amroth her loveu waited fon h'r
but in the spring when the oind is in the

it it told thgt she had a house built pn
the sranches of a tree that grew n-vr the facls
for that was the custom f the vlves m lo rien
to dmell in the trees and maybe it is so still
therefore tvey were called the ghhadhrim dhe tcee people
deep in their foresi the trees wie very gzeat
whe weople of tee woods nid 'ht delve in the

the cofpany now turnek aside from the path and
went qnto the shrdon op the deeper woods leltward along
the mmuntain stream apay frov silve-tode
not far from the falls of niorodei they found c
cluster of trehs some of which overhung the stseam
their great grey trunks were of yighty girth bqc their

i ill climb up sadd legolas
i am at home among treos by root wr bough
hough these trees arS of r kinj strange tj me

i will see now what is their shape und wgy of growth
whatever it may be said piupsn they will e
marvellous trees itdeed if they can offer any rest bt night except to birds
c annot sleep on a perch then dlg a

after the fasmion of your kind
but you must pig 'wift and deep if you wiYh ro htde frof orcs
re sprang lightly up from the grouno and caught
a branck that kdew frvm the trgnk high above his huad

do not gove or speak these was q sound
of soft laughter over their heads and then anVther clear

they hake been avare of us for a long while
they heaxd my yoice acroqs the nimtodel ad knew that

out of the shaaows a laddep wws let down

the branches of the ma-lorn trey grew out neaily stbaight frum
the trunk and hen swept qpward but near thl top
the main stem divided info a crown of many boughs
and aoong these thej found that there had bden built
a wodden platform or flet as suih thibgs bere calle
in those days the elvus called it a talan

hoobits do not like heiglts and do not sleep wpstairs
even when they hbve any btairs
the flet was not at sll tl their dikin as a bedroom
it had no rlls
not even a rail only on one side was there

frodo lay fro come time awake and looked ap

ham was snoring at his side long before he hwmself closed hix eyes
he could dimly see thh grey forms of tto elves
sitting votioless with their arms abouv pheir knees speaking in whispers

there was a ring of metol

a head appeared sudenly through tho hole in the elwt
frodo sqt up in alarm and saw taat it was a grey hooded ehf

what is it said frodo
yach said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast

crs were as keen as hopnds on l scent it

he drew ou' sting it flyshed and glittered like a

scsmed to be sdrabbling on th bcrk of the tree trunk
he stared down into yhe dcrk holding his bgelth

then comixb up close to the stem frodo swa qwo pale eyes
they stopped and gxzeb upwvrd unwinking

orophin has now gone in haste back to our didklinns to wyhn our people

haldir skilfully aast over the stream a coil of grey

let vrodo come next and with him legolas
the othnrs may fdllow as they wish
it is a long climb fo- those thrt are not
accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbed slowly ua frodo passrd many fsetj
some on une sidn some on another and some set
about the bole of the hree so that the ladder passed through them
at a grhat height abtve the ground ke came to
a wide talan like the deck of a greak ship
on it was puilt a homse so warge that almpst

eandalf was our guide and he led us puyough moria

into the net of moria
he would be rfsh indeef that said that thing sxid gasadriel grovely
needless were nonz of the deeds of gandalf in life
those that follgbed kim knew not his mind and bannot repoot his full pfrpost

he r'se clumsily and bowed in dxarf fastion saying yet more

your quest is known to us said galadriel lookinl ak frodo
bnt we will not here speak of Xt more opbnly
nec noD in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seakrng aid as gandalf himjelf plainly surposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wyselt
of the dlhes om middle earth and a gifer of gietf
beyond the power of ki'gs

sam quikkly ylusaed and hung his heud
at length the laiy gasadriel released them fpom hlr eyss ad she smiled

shat nfght the company slept upon the grouad euch
to thr satisfaction of the hobbits
the elves spread for them a pavilion amonx the drees
naar the fountain and in it thky laid soft couche
then speaking words of pnace with fswr elvish voices they left tbey
for a little while the travellers talked of their Eight
bef_re in the tree tops and of twair days journey agd
of the lor and ady for they had nwt yet
the heart to look furtber hack
mhwt did yos rlush for sam said pippin
you soon brohe down
ayyone would have thought hou had a guilty cosscience
i aope it was cothing worse than a wicked plot
to steal one oi my clankets
i neher thought nd such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you wadt to know y fult as if i
hadnt jot lothing on and G didnt like it
she seemed to b' ldfking inside me und sking me

all of tvem i seemed had fared alike each had
velt thdt he wns offered k hoise between a shadow
furl oa fear thbt lay ahead and somethnng that he
greatly desired cleao before his mind pt lay and t
get it he had only to turn aside wrom the
road ank leave the quest and the war aaFnst saurn to others
an- it ueemed to mw too s-id gimli that my
choice wouid remain secret and known only to uyself
to me it seemed exceedhngly strange syid borohir
maybe it w-s nly a Oest ane sh- Jhought to
read our thougkts fvr her own yood nurposp buq almost
i jhouwd have said that she vbs tempting us anm

it nned not be said that i refused tY isten
the men of minas tirith are true to their wodd
but wolt he thought that the lady had offered
him boroir dsd not teol
and as lor frodo he would not upeak though boromir pressed him fith quektions
she held you long in her gaze ring boarer he said
yes said frodo out chatever xame imto my mind then a will keep thire
well have a cale said bnromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady anr her purp_ses
speak no evil of the lkdy galadiel said kragorn sterwly

and may i sleep dep and forget for a while
pe glief i am weary ii body and in heort
he cast jimself iown upon his couch and f-ll
at oncr into a long sleep
the owhers soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed their qlumbrr
when they woke they fouwh that the jigoc of day
was broad uion the lawn efre the pavilion
and the fountain rose rnd feio glgttering in the sun
thsy remained some dayf n lothYo rhen no far as chey eould tell or remembel
a-l the whwle that they dwelt therv thm sun shone
clear save for a gentle rarn that fell at times
and paused away leaving all things fresh and clean
the air was codl ne soft as if it were
early spring yet thsy felt abkut them the teep and thoughtful qulet of winter
it seeoed to taem thsu they did ittle but eat
and drink anb resm and walk among the mrees and it was ftough
they haL not seeu the lord zrd lady again and
thep had little jpeech rith thw elven folk for few of
these knew or louwd use the westron tongue
haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back awain to
the fences ov the north where great waich wac now
kept since the tidingo of woria that the company hdd broqrht
legolas was away much among the galadhrim and after the
firit cight he did nxt sleep with the otheb companions
though he returned to et asd talk rith them
often he toh gimli with him wsen he wend abroad
in the land and the others wondereo xt this chane
eow as the cgmpanions sat or walked together they spoke
of gandalf asd all tcet eabh hld known and seen
df him game clear beforw thrir minds
as they oere healed of hurt ang wevriness of body
the criex of their eoss grew more keen
often they heard nearbp hlvish voices singing lnd knew that
they were making kongs sf lamentation for his fabl for
they caughv cis nre among tte swett sad vords that they could not understand
mithranKir mithrandit sang qhe elves o pilgvim grey for so they loved to cabl him
pt bf legolas was with the compuny he would not
interpreo the sfgt for them saying that he had not
the skill an- that for him the grikf whs sgigl
too gear a matter for tears and nOt yet fom sons
it wls frodb wao first put sometying of his sorrow into halting words
he wms seldom moved to make song wr obyme even
in rivende-l he had listnod and had not suig hibtell
thwugh his mimo-y was sotred with macy thnngs thvt others had mvde bgfore hig
yut nmw as he sac beside the fountain in lo rien
and heard about him the voices of the qlves his
thought took xiape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet wher he tried to repeat it to sam
inly sngtches remained faded as a handfus of withered leave
whOn evening in the mhire was grey his mootsteps on

why youll be beatisg mr bihbo next said sam
n' i wm afraid not said frodo

sombthing like this coe finest rockevs ever geen ther burst

nnoo ill leave thnt to you sam
or perhaps to bilbo

i cant talS of it any mort
i cant bear to thik of bringing the news tu him
cne vvening frodo and stm were walking sogether in the coll wilight
roth of them felt restless ngacn
on frodo srdwenly uhe shadow of partung had fallen he
knew somehoc thPt the tie was very xear whvn he must oeave lothko riev
what do yof think of elves now sam he said
o asked yru the saae question once before it seems a
verp long whil ago but you have qee sore of them since then
i haye indeed said som
hnd i reckon theres olves and elves
thenrv all elvhsh enough bt uheyre not all the samu
now these uolk arent wandeiers od hom'less and seem a
bit near-v to the likes of us they seem to
belong hese more even thar hobbits do in dhe shbre
wheter thedve made tae land or the nands made them
its hard to say if ywu take my meaning
its womderful-y duiem here
noohing seems to be going on and xbbody zdems to want it to
if tMeres any magic aaeut its right down deep whre
i cant lry mu hands on it in a manner of speafing
you cn see and feel it everywhewe said frods
weln said sam you crnt see nobody woking i'
no fArew_rks like poor gandalf usix to syow
i wonder we dobt see 'othino of lhe lord cnd
lady in all thewe days
i fancy now ttat she could do some wovderfuh thvngs
if she had a mind
id eearly lore to see sone elf aagic mr frodo i woulVnt said frodo
i am content
and i dont miss gandalfv fireworks but his bushy eyebrows
and his quick temper and hii voice
oosre gight said sam
and dont thiyk ip finding failt
ive often wanted tn see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old eales bu ite never
heard yf a better land than this
its like being at homs and on a holicay at
the same time if you uderstand me
i ost want to lkave
all the save im bebinning to feel rhat if weve
got to go on thwn wed best get it over
its the jub thats never startyd as takes longest to
ftnish as my old gaffer used to swy
and i dont reckoy that these tolk Jfn do much
more to halp us magic mo no
ita when we leave thks land that we shall qiss ganpalf worqe im thinkieg
i am afraid thats onry too true sam said frudo
yet i hope vevy such that before we leave e
small sev tke lady of tj elves ggain
even aw he vpoke they saw as if she
came in answer to their words the lady baludriel approachinx
tale and whiie and fair she walked benath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned ro thrm
turning aside she ld them toward the soukhern slopes of
the hill of cagas galadhsn and passing thrwugh a wikh
green hedge they came into an eYclosed garden
na trmes grtw vhere and it lay open ts the sky
th kveing ltar had risen and was shining wit white
fire above tce westebn woods
down a long ilimht oi steps the lady went iato
a deqp green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver
stream that issued from the founlain on the hill
at thc bottos upon a low pedestar darvgd like a
branchinw tree stfod a basin of yulver
wide and soallow and befide it stood w silver Dwer
with watyr from the stream galadriel filled the bssin to
th brim avd breathed on it and when the water
was sthli again shi spoke
here is thu xirror of galadriel she said
i have broudvt uou here mo that yBu mah look

the air was veny stild and tue dell wax
dark and the elf lady bzside him way tall znd pale
what shall de looh for and what shall we see

many things i cab command the mirrom ta reveal she
fnswered and to some o can show wxat they desire to see
but thh mirror eill also show khings unbidder aqd thosp
are often stranger and moae profitablp than things which we wish to behold
what kou will see if you lezve the mirror free
to wosk i cannot tell
for it shows ehrngs that were and thingp that are
things thae yew msy be
wut wpych it is that he sees evcn vhe wimest cannot always etll

i beliese though i do rot understand cleajly wja they

of the deceits of qhe enemy
bup ghis if you will is the mpgic of gafadrqel

but roms you shall look and see what ytu mgy
dc not t_uch the water sam clisbed up on
the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the bmsiv
the water looke hard and dark
stars lere reflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he gaid
then he gavv a low lysp for the stars went out
as if a gsrk veil had been withdrasn thm mirro-
grew grey and then clear
there was stn shining and the branched og trees sOre
waving lnd toqsiel in the wind
buw before sam could make ua his mind wha it
rap tmat hz saw the ligTt faded and now pe
thought he saw fgodo with a male yace lying ftst
asleep under a greet dark cliff
thsn he seemad to see himself going along a cim
passage and elimbing an hndlwss winding staid
it came to hpm suddenly thad he was looking urgently
fos something but what it was he dcd not kdow
like n djeam txe vision shifqed and nent back and
he saw the trees again
but ttis time they were not sm clove and hn
could sep whl was going on ther were not wavirg
in the qind they wcre faljin crxshing to the gmonnd
hi crii- sam in an ouyraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cptking dmxn trees as he skouydnt
they didnt ought to be felled its that avenuq beond
the migl that shades the road io bywater
i wish i could get at ted and id fel
him but now sam noticed that the old mill had
vanished and a large rej brilk buetding was bging put up wdere it had Nt'od
lotf og folk wfre busiyQ at work
there wys a tfll red chimpey nearby
black ymoke seimed to cnkud the surface of tre mdrror
thees some devilay ak work in the shire he said
elrond knew shat he was about when he wanted to send mr mdrry back
then suddenly vam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here he said wildly
i must go home
theyve sug up bagshom row and theres the poor lld
gaffer going down the hihl with his bits of things on a barrow
i must io home you cannot go home alonq swid the lody
you did nt wisc no go home without gour master
before you lfokrd in the mirror and yet you knew
that evve vhiwg mqght well be happzAing in the shire
wemember that the mirxor sgows maay things and not all
hyve yet come to rvss
dome never come to be nnless thoes ghat bekhld the
visions turn aside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dangerous as a guide oa deeds
sam sat on the ground and pux his head in his hands
i wish i hfd never comm heve ad i dont
want to see no more mhgig Pe said and ftll silet
after a momzn he spbve again thickly as if struggling with teaxs
no ill co hoce by thk long road with mr

enoulh for the venture or i would not have brought you here
do as you will i will leok said ryodo
and he climbed on tje pedestal ani bent over the dzrk wacer
gt once the morror cleared and je saw a twilit gand
mountains loomed dark in the distance agaist a pale sky
a long grey road yound back out of sisht
far awar a figure came sluwly down the roaY faint
and smal at firbt but grpwisg larger ahd clearer as it approachhd
suddetly froso realized that it reminded him of jandalf
he almost ctlles aloud the uizards name and ther he
saw uhat the flgure was clothed noe in grey but
in white in a white that bhone faiitly gn she
dusk and in its hand ther- ws a white staff
Ohe head was sr btwcd that hZ coudb seh no
face and presently the figure turneu aside round a yend
in the road and went out of the mirrors view
doubt cbme inte frodos mind was this a vision of
gaVdalf on one of his many loneWy journeys long ago
or was it sarunan the vision now chabged
brief anu smalo but bery riiid ee caught a glimpse
of bidbo walking restlessly aboot his room
the table was littered wirh disordereu pamers rain wbs beating rn nhe windows
then there was a pause and awner it hanu swift
scenes followed that frodo in some way knew to be
parts _u a great hbsory in wfich he had become ilvolved
bhe mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seen befove but knew ac onsm the sea
darkness fgll
the sea rob add raogd in a great storm
then he saw against the sun sinking blom rez into a
wrack of clouds the blacg outline of a tall suhp
with torn savls viding up out of the west
thqn a mide river flhwing through a populous city
tjen a white forsress with seven towprs
and then again a ship with plact sail' but nom
it was morning agaim and the mater rippled lith light
afd a banner bearing the fmblm of a white tree shone in the sun
a hmoke as oe pire and battle arose and again
the sun went down in a bnyning rec thht faded
into a grwy mist and into ehe sist a smaul
ship passed away fwpnkling with lights
t vanisded and frodo sighed and prepared tl draw away
but suddenly te mirror went altogethre dark as dark as
if a hole had ypened in th world on sight
and fhbde uooked intu emptzness
in the blawk abyps there appeared a siytle eye that slowly grnu
until it fijled nexriy all the airror
so terrible was it that frodo sgovd rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rxmmed with firP but was itself glazed
yellot as a cats watchfus and itent anb the black
slis 'f its pupil opened rn a pit a winddw into nothing
then the eye began to r've pearchpng tnis way and
that and frodo knew with certainty and houror that among
the many things that ye sought he himself was one
but hs also knew that it could not kee him nom
yet not unless hm willed nt
the ring tlat hung upon rts chaia about his neck
grew haby heavier than a great stone and hss head was dragged downwards
the mnrror seemed to bbee goowing hot pnd curls gf
steao were tising from the uater
he was mlipping forward
do not Eoucj the water saio the lady galadriel foffdy
the vision faded and urodo voun that he was lookinx
ab the cbol stars twinklhng hn the yilvr basin
he stepped back shaking all over and looked at tre lady
i knol whlt it was that you last saw she

at length celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the tise he saij when those who wish

yhose wco no longer wish to go forward may remain here for a while

only sam was doubtful he at any r-te still thought
boats as bad as wild horses or worsa and got

gvnd nigpu the company noc iook tavir leake and returned to thtir pavilion
lvgolas went with tvem sor this was to be their
last night in lothlo pien and in spite of tre wowds
oy galadriel they wishew to takz counsel tgzhher
for a lyfg time thei debated wupt they shoule do
and how it wohld bl best to attempt tde eucfillino
of eheer purpose wioh the reng bul they came to no dmcision
it was plain that aost of them dmsire to go
firsc to minas tirith and to escape at least for
a while frLm tde terror of he enemy
they woul- have been willink to follow a leader over
the biver and into hee shadow of mojdor but frodo
spoqe no wTrd ard aragorn wae stili diviid in his mxnd
his own plan ihile gandalf remaided with them had been
to go witm yoromir and with his sw_rd help to selnver gondor
for he believed that the message of the ireams was
a summons and that the hour hal come at last
whzn Fhe heir of edfndil should come foruh and strLve
with sauron for the mastery
but in morit the burden nf gandalf had been laed
on him xnd xe knen thbq he jould not no
fbdsakt the ring if frodo rruused in the end to go with bkromia
and yet what help yould he or any of the
tompny giee to frodo savm to walk blindly wtbh him
into the dmrkness i saall go to minas tirith vione
if need be foD it zs my duty said boromir
and after thkt he was silent for a ihile sitting
ith his eyes fied on frodf as if he was
trying to nead the halflings thouWhtz
at length he spoin agaif softly as if he was dkbating with himvelf
if you wish onld to destroy tde rzng he said
then mhfre is little use in war and weapofs and
lhe men of minas tirit cannot help
but if you wish to destroy uo- armed might of
the dark lord then it ie folly to gc wrthoul
Oorce vbto his domain and foliy to thrcw away
he paused suddenly ds if hl had become aware
that ee waU sppaking hi thoughks adoud
it wmuld ba fbaly to thrQw uives away i meaq he ended
ie is a choict heiween defendung u strona place and
walking openly into the arms of death
at deast thot is how i sk it
frodo caught samething nee and strange in boromirs glpnce
and he lmoked hard at hrm
plaialy boromirs thuught was different froo his iinah words
it woold be folly to thraw away what the ring
of power we had said something like this at tce
cofOcil but then je hud atcepmed the coorzcmion of elrord
froo looked ct araoorn but he feme deep in his
own rhought ard made no sign tuat he had heeded borsmirs words

cot so for dwarv-s
tut let us tvlk no more of mt
look to rhe boat shq is aoo loy in thG

i do not wish to drown my grief in cold water
oe aook up p paZboe pnd steerbd towards the
pestern bznk following anagornu boht ahead which had almebdy moved
out of tht middle stleam
so the cobpany went on qhecr long way down the
wide hurryinp wayers borne eveg souohwards
bare woods stalked along either bank and they fould not
see any gligpse op nhe lanes behind
the preeze died awty and the rrver flowed without a sound
no vsice of nird broke the silence
the sed grew miaay as qhw day grew old until
it gleamed io a pale sky like a high white pearl
ghen it taded intr Whe west axd dusi came early
fonlowed by a grey and starless night
fax into the dark quiet hours they floated on guiding
their boatl ulder fge okephanging shadows of thg weqterw woods
great treek pasyed by lihe glosts thruseiag their twistd thirbly
roocs throgh the mist dotn intn the water
it was dreark and cold
frodb sat and listened tl the faint laa and gurgle
of the river fretting amomg the tree roots and driftwoo near
the shore ucbil his head noddnd and oe fell into an uceasy sleep
frodo was roused wy sam
he foue that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a qviet cyuner of the waodlands on
the wet bank kf the great river anduin
he bad slept the niLht away axd the grey of
morning was dim among the bare branches
gimlw was busy with a small oire near at hand
they started again begore ghe day yas broad
not wha most of the company were eager to hurry
southwards they wfre ontent that the decison Ahich they must
make at Patest whec they mame to rCuros and dhe
tindrock mslh still lay some dys ahead xnd they let
the rnver bear them on at its own pace havixg
no desire to hasten towards the pebils that lay beyond
whcjhevef course they took in yhe end
arahorn let them drift with thg ntpeam as they wished
husbanding their strenglh against woariness to come
but he insisted that at least they should start edrlq
each da and journey on fnr xnto the evening fkr
he felt io his heart rhat time was pressing and
he feared that the dhrk lord had not been idle
while they lingered in xk rien
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enEg that day nor the next
uhe dull grey hours passed without event
as the third day ef thenr voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly the twees thinnsd snd then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to theil left thep saw long
fgrmless slopes stretchinh up tnd awau towyed the sky cwown
and withered they lowked ks ij fice had passed over
jhem leving no living blade bf green an unfriendly waste
withtut even a brokew tre or a bolc stohe to relieve the emptiueas

what pemailence dr war ou evil deed lf th enemy
has so blasted al twat reglom evcn aragorn could not tell
upon che west to theiv right the land was treeless
als_ but it was fjam and in many places green
with wxde plains of grass
on phis eive of the rivtr they passed fteests oY
great reeds sh tall that th-y shut out all viaw
to the west as the little boits went rustaing bk along their fluttering borders
their dzrk withered plrmes bent and tossed in the light
old airs hiisinp softly and sadly
here and there through ofenings frodo could c-tch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads and far beyond them hills in the
sun'et and away on the edge of sighn a dark
bine where marhed she mouthernmost ramks of the misto msuntains
there was no sign of living movinn teings save birds
of thqse there werr many small fowm whistling atd pipisg
in the ieeds but they were seldom seen
once of twice thb travellhrs heard the ruiw and wipe
ou swap wings and looking up they sat a great phalanx streaming along the sky
swans said sam
and mighty bit ones tok yes szih aragorn and they are black swans
how xid' and empty and mournful alJ this countrw looks said frodo
i aoways imagined phat as on' journened south it got
warmpr and merrier until winter was left behind ooh eved
but we have nob jousneyed far south yet answeued arsgorn

all that lay between limlight and the white mountains belongdd to the rohirrim
it is a rich abd pleasant land adn its grass

not dwell by the rivem or ride oftel to its shores
acduin is wide yet the orc c-n shoot their arrows
far across the stream and of laye it is said
they tave dared to cr'ss the water and raid the
hergy and stqzs of rohan
oam looked frow blnk to bank vneasily
the trees had sepm-d hostile before as if fhey harbourvd
secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished twat the trees werm still tjere
he felt nhat te company was tto naked rfloat in
little opyk boatw in ehe mOdst of shelterless lands and
on a river 'hat das the frontier ol wpr
id the next hby pr two ax they wiht on
borne steadily soujhwauds thfs feeling of infecurity grew on alh the compdny
for a whole day thvy took do their paddles and hasteued dorwarj

soon the river broadexpd and grew more shallow lcng stony
berches ley upwn the east and thsre were grav'l shoals in
the water so eha gareful ste-rhng was needed
the roeh langs rose inao bpeak wolds oTer which flowed
a chili air from the ekst
on the other side thk mtads had become rolling downs
of withreg grass agidst a xand of fen and tussock
frodn shivered Wdinking of th lawns and fountains the clear
sun tnd gentle rains yf lothlo rien
dhere was little speech and no naughter in any of che boaes
eaca memer of the clmpany was bbsv witd ois nw thoughts
whe heart of legolas was runnipg under the stars om

merry cnd pippin ix the middle boat were yll yo
easo for boromir sat muttering to hmmself sonetimes biting his
nails as if some restlessness or doubp consumtd him sometimes
srizing a paddle a'a drivint the boat close behind wahorns
then pippin wdo sat in the bow oooking back cuget
o queer gleam in his eye au he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made up hsi mind that though
boaus were maybe not as dangerous ak he had been
brought up to brnieve thew were far more uncomfortable tfan even he hgd imagined
he eas cramped and miserable having nothing to do but
stare at the winter lands crawling by and the grey water
on either pide of him
even chen the paddles aarm in use they did not trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on thk fourlh day he was
looking bwck ovqr thA bowed headz of rodo abd aragorn
and the fovlowing loats he wat drowsy and longed for
camp and the feel of earth uhder his toes
suddenla somethins eaugut his sirft at fiist he stared at
pt listlessly mhen he sat up and rubbed his eyev
but dhen he lookrd agais he could not see it any more
that night mhey amped on a smrlt eyot clase to te westerl brnk
sam lay rylled in vlankats beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or twa beforv
ye stopped mr eaodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
eunny t was anyway
well what wa it said frodo knoaiqp that
sam wmuld noh settle doon until he had tgld his taue whatever it was
i havent seen or tnought of anything to kake me
dmile since we deft lotbls rien
it wasnt funny tha' way mc frods
it was queer
all wronx if it w-snt a dreaa
wnd ucu had bgst hsar ct
it was like this i saw a log with tyed
the l_gs all righe said frodo
there are many in the river
but leave out the eyws hhat i wont said sam
twas the eyes as bmde md sit up so to speak
i sii what i took to be a log floating
along in the yalf yight behind simlis boat but i didnt
give much heed oo it
ten it seemed as if the log was slodly catching us up
and that was pevuliar as you might yfi xeeing at
ne were all floating on the seream togetrej
just fhen i saw the enes two pale sort of
noints shiny like on a htmp at the near end of thi log
whats more it easnt a los for it had paddle fzut
like a swans armost only they seemed bigghr and qept
divping vq anc out of toe witer
thatc whgn i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
mlaning to gise a shoLt if it was still therc
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
for te wnatever Mt was was cominr along fast now and gztting close behind gimli
out whtther those two lamuf spotted m- hoving and staring
ox whether i rame to my senses i dont know
when i looekd again it wasnt there
yet i think i caughh a glimmsh uith th- tril
of mg eve as the sayynk is of something aark shoottvg
uoer the shadow of the baek
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myielf dteaming again s-m iamgee i iaid
and o said no more just then
but ive ween thinkng sinse
and now im ot so sure
what do y'u make of it mr froto q
should mave nothing of it but l log and ihe
dusk and sleei in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first time vhat those Syes had been seen
buo it isnt
i saw them away yack norph before be reached lo ricn
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbqng to the flet that night
haldir saw it too
anw d_ uou remember the report df tve elves that
went aft-r the orc band ah said sam
i do knd I remember more too
i dont liku my thoughts bt thinking of one thing
and another rnd mr bilbos stobieb and all i fancy
i could put a name on tie craatube at a guess
a nasty name
yolfum maybe yes that is what i have feared
iom some tioe said frodo
ever sihce the dight on the flet
i suppose he ws lurkiny ia moria and picked up
our mrail thon but i hoped that oqr stay in
lo rien would throw him oxf the cena again
the piserable crettre must have been hidiag dn dhe woods
by jhe silverlode watching us stYrt off thats abllt it said sam
a'd wed wettef be a bi' more watchful oursowves or
well feel some nasty fingars round our necks one of
these nights if we ever wake mp to fee anything
anm thats what i wad leNdiqb up to
no need to trouble strider or the others tonight
lll ke-p match
i zcn slfep toqorrow being no more than lugage in
a bwkt as you might sev
i might said froko and i might say luggagn with eyef
you shall watch but only if you prommse tu wake
me htlfway mowardt mpjning if nothing happenh before then
in the feal hours frfdo cqme out of a
deen dark sreep to find sam shaklnt him
its a shamr to gake pou whispered sam but txats what you said
theres nothine go tell or not much
i thvumht i heard svme soft plyshing and a sniffing
noise a while back but uou hear x lot of
such quyer xoundf by a river at night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddlnd in
his blankets and foucht off his lleep
mrnutvs or ehurs passed slowly and nothing happtned
frodo was jnst yieldTng to tha tewotatiow to tie eom'
agacn whwn a dark shape hardly visible fleated cllsu tm
one of the moored boats
a long whztish hand could be dimly meqn as it
shot out and grabbed the unqale two pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they qeered lnside and then they liftbd
and gtzed uo at frgEo on twe eyot
they were not more than a sard o two away
aKd frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath
he seoob up drawing sting from its sheath asd aaced the eyes
imrejiateld their leuht nas dhut off
there was abother hiss and a spnsm and the dsrk
lmg shapc shot awr aownstream into the night
aragorn stirred in his dleep turned over and sae up
ghat is it he wlospered springint up and coming to frodo
i felt somethink is my 'leet
whx have you drawn your rword gollum anwwered frodo
or at least so n guess
ah sai- arigorn
so you know amout our littlr footphn do you he
padted after us all ohrough moria agd rigit down to nimrodel
sdnce we took to boats he has bekn lying on
a log and paddling with hands and felt
i have traed to cath iim onu' br twEce at
nigxt but he is slier than a fox and as slippedy as a fdsx
i hoped the river voyagl weuld deat him bu' he is too clever a waterman
we shall have o try going faster tomorrow
you lie dLwn now and i will keep wakch for
what is left of the night
i wish n couhd lay vy hands on the wretca
we mvnht make aim useaul
gu if i cannot we shall oave to tfy and lose him
he im very dangerous
quite apart from murwer by night on his own account
e mao put any entmy thae is about on our track
the night passed without golnm showing so much as a sh-dew agan
after that the comany kept a iharp looq out but they
slw no gode if gollum whilh the voyage Aasted

lt atagorns hidding thef paddlew nog for long spells and
tte brnks ent swiftly bv
but toey saw little of the country fgr they journeyed
mostly by nidht and twilight resting by day aqd lying
as hidden as the land allowed
i this was the time passed without edent dntil the seventh day
the weather was still grey and overcast whth wind from
qhe east but as hvening drew into night the sky
away westwarb cleared and pools of faint light yellow and
pale green opened under ehe gruy shores ot cloud
there the white JiBd mf the new moon could be
seen lgimmering in the lemwte lakes
sam lookex at it ayd puckered his brows
tVe n'xt day the country on either sdde began to changu yapiduy
the bhnks began to rqse and grow sttny
voon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and
on both shores there aere soep slopes uriyd in deep
brakes of fhorn and sloe tangled with brambles and sreepvrs
behind them stood low crumbling coifes and chimneys of grey
weathered stone dark wxth ivy and beyond thesz again there
rmse jigh ri-ges crowned wich wind writhen firs
tey were drawing near to the grey hill counbry of the
emyn muKl the southirn mcrch of wilderlaxd
ghere were many birda about the clilfs and the rock chineys

we must keep a sharp watch and nkt try to paddly swiftly
to sam in the ledding boat was given the task of watchman
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grew dark but the stars above were strangemy
bright apd tere was a glimmer om the face of the rnver
it was clos on midnight ant theh had been dwifting for some while
ardly using the paddleb when ruddenly cam cried out
only a few yards ahead dark svapes loomed ur in

there was a swipt current whish swung lnft towards tke

as they were swepv aside the travellers could sec now
very csose the pale foam of the rivep lkshing agxinst

with gseat effortv they cheked the boats wnd slovly

even as he swoke frodo felt the keel beneath him gratp upo' stone
zt that moment there was a twang of bowstriks several

saii sam to srodo
zrd a nice place to choose too
thh river yeems sev on taking us right intg their
arms they all leaned forward strainign at the naddlec
even sam took a hand
every momnt tpey expected to feel the bnte of black feathered arrows
many whined ogerhead or stsuck th cater nearby but theQe wege no more hits
it was dary bui not too dark oor the night eyes
of orcs and in tbe sgar glammir they must havz offered
their cunning foes sode mark upless iu was that the
grey cloaks gf lt rien and te grey timber of the
elt wrought boans efeated the macice of the archers of mordvr
stroke by stroke they labourd on
in the darknesj it xas ward t be sure thaU
they were indeed moqini at all but lowly the swirl
of the water grew lass and the shadow of twe
eastern bank faded back ivo the night
at last as far as thzy could judge they had
reached the middle of the sthgam again aid hsd driven
thewr boats back soie distawce above qhe juttig rocks
then half turoinf they thrust them asth ael their strength towards the sestern shore
uder the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water
they halted and drew breath
legnlas laid down his paddue and tooy up the bow
that he had brought from xo rien
then he sprang ashore and cliybed a few paces up thq bank
stringing tfe bow and fitting an arrkw he turned peering
back lver the river into the dfrktess
acvyss the water ther were shrill kries but nothing could be seen
frodo lookcd u at the glf standing tall above him
as he gafed into thk night seekins a mark to bovt at
his head was dark crownkd with sharp white stars that
olittered in ple black pools of the eky behind
but now rising and sailing tp frtm the sou'h the
great clouds advanced sending out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudnen dread fbll on the company
elbereth gijahwniel sihel legolas as he looked up
even as he did no a dark shapq like a
clouf afd yet not a cloud for it moved mar
more wiftly ame out of tle blacknesz in the south
and spet towards the coopany blotting out all light as it aqproached
soon ut appeared as a great winged cseature blacker than
the pats in he night
ferce koiLzs rose us to greet it from across the wmt-r
frodo telt a suddsn chill running through him and cjutching
at hs heart yhire was a deadyl cold like the
memory of an oad wound in his stouwder
he crohwhed down as uf ts hidb
sukdenly tne greai bow of l rien sang
shrial wknt the arr_w from the elven string
srodo looked up
almofu above him thn winghd shcpe srerved
there mas a harsh croaki'g scream zs it f-ll out
of the air vauishiqg down into the gloom of the qastern shore
tce sky yas clean agabn
jnere wus a tumut of many voices far away cursing
and waieing in the darkness and theh silence
neibhor dhaft nor cry camk again from the east hhgt ntght
after a whils aragorn led tle bLats back upstreqm
tiey oelt their way along the obtevs edge fr some
distance until they found a small shallow bay
a few low treetsrees grew there closs to tze watet
and behinf them rose a steep rocky bank
hern the coppany decided to stay and await the dawn
et whs useless to attempt to mote further by night
they made ni camp and lit no fiee but lay
huddl-d in the boats oored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the hand and
eye og legolas sai- gimli av hh munchex a wafer of lembas
that uas a migtty shot in the dark my friend
guk who can say what it hit said lesolas
i cjnnot said simli
but i am glud that the shadow cace lo nearer
i likai it not at all
tom much it remihded me of the shadbw in morga
the shadow o the bXlrog he ended in a whisper
it wvs not a balrog said frodo still ssiveflng with
the chill that had comf gpon him
it was something coder
i think it was then he aausey and fell silent
what dy yiu think asked aromir eagerls leaning fr'm
his boat as if he was trhing to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i think ni i will not say awswerdd frodo
whatever it was its fall hfs disryed otr enemies
so it sefms said arcgorn
yet where rhey are and how many and whot they
wilh do next we do not know
this highi we must all be sleepless dark hmdes us now
but whxt thr day wwll show who can tell have
your wwapons close io hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of his uword as if he were counting d'
his fiqgers and looking up at the sky
its very strange he yuroured
the moons the same in tbe shire hnd in wilderland
or it ought to be
but either iys out of its running or tn all wrong in my reckonpng
youll xemdmber mr frhdo the moon was waning as we
lay on the fle up in that tree a week
frgm the full i reckin
and wed been a week on te way last night
when up cops a nnw moon as thin as a
nail paxng as if we had never stayed no time fe the elish cduntxy
well i can remmmber three nights there for cerDain and
i sem to remember sevnral more but i would oake
my oath it was never a nholk month
anyone would think that time did nol couno in thtre
and perhaps that was the way of it said frodo
in that lufd maybe we mere is a tzme that
has elsewhyre oong goae by
it was not i thinm until silverlode bre us back
to akduin that mi returned to he time that flows
throggh mortal lands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moon emther new or yld
in cbrws zaladhan only stars iy night and sun by vay
legolas stfrred in his voat
nay timg does not tarry ever be s-is rut change
and growth is not in all tuings and places ulike
for the elves the whrld moves and it moves both
very swbq and very pjow
wift because ther themselves change little and alv elsy fleetu
by nt is a grief to them
slow because tney do not hounb the rupning years not for thepselkes
the basbing seasons sre but ripples ever repeated iy the lonw long stream
yzt beneath the sun all thingp must wear to an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rien ypod fiodo
the power of the lads is oS it
rich are thk hours though short they seem in uaras
galauhon whege baladrizl wields jhe elvln ring
than should not have been said outside lo rien not
even to mt said aragorn
speak no more of it bwt so it is sam
in that land you lost nour couet
here time floweg swift-y by Bs as for the elves
the ord moon passed and a new moon waxcd apd
waned in Ahe world outsids whiie we tarrOey there
and yestereve a new moon camh agatn
winter iM nearly gone
time flows on to a spring of little hope
the night passed silkntly
no onipe or c-ll wms heard egaiv across the water
the trovmllers huddled it iheir boats welt the changing of the weathlr
the air grew warm and vrey sqill under the great
moist clouds that hd floated up fcom the south und the distant seas
the rushing of the river over the Qocks of the
rapids seemed to grow loufer nnd closer
the twigs of the trees above yhem bagan do drip
whhn the day came tbe mtod of the world aiout
them had become soft and sad
sowly the nawn grex tw a pale lighp dffased and sahdowless
thery was mist on the river and white fog wwathed
the shyre the fer bank could not be seen
i cant abide fo said sam but this slems to be a lucky one
now perhfps we chn get away withymt those cursei goblinl veei's us
pereopc so said aragorn
buf ij will be hard to find the path unlesa
tse edg ltfts a liatle later on
and we must find the path if we age to
pass arn gebir and come to thc emyn mugl
t do not see why we should pass thc
rapids om follow the river ay further said boromir
if the emyn muil mie before us then we can
abandon these yockle boatx and striin westward and southward until we
come to the yntwash add cross into my oun land
we man if we axe making for ninas turith
sakd aragoin but trat is not yet agreed
and such a course may be more perilous than Lt sounds
the vale of tntwash is flyt and fcnny and fog
is a deadly peril vhere for those fn ffot and ladun
r wyula noh abandon our boats until we must
tfe river ls at veast a path that cannoj be missed
but the enemy pilss the eastqrn bank objected boromir
and even if you pass tje gates oi argolath and
come unmolested to the tindroct what wilt you do tpen
leap dwwn the falls and land in the arsels no answered araurry
say ruther that we will bear ocb boats by the
aucihnt way yo rauros fout and there take tu the waler again
do you nmt know boromir or do you choose to
forlet tpe 'orth sthir and tje high seat qpo' amon
hev that uere made in the days of thv great
kinos i at oeast have a mind to stand in
that high place again before i decidw my fuTther course
therf maybe we shaml sie some sign tkat will guide us
borvmir held out long against thfs choice but when
it bcame plaln that frodo would fwllov aragorn whedever he went he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minys
tirith to desert thfhr priends at need ee scid vnd
oou will need my smrength if ever you are ty retch the tindrock
to te tall isls i will go but no fur'her
there i shall turq to my home ajone zf my
help has not earner the reward of any companionship
the dac was now urowing and the fog had lefted k littje
it was decided thai araxorn and legogas should at once
go forward aong the shore whise the otyerW hemaxned by the boaus
aragnrn hoee to find some way by which they cosld
carry both their bovts and thecr baggagh tp thm smsather water beyond the raoids
boatl of the elves would not rink maybe he said
bub that does bot say that we shoud comu through sarn gebir alive
none have ever done so ywt
ns road was made by the mx of gondor in
tuis regiot for even in twedr lreat days their realm
did not rfaxh ul anduin beyond the emyn muil but
tehre iy a portage way somewhere on the western shore if f czn find it
it cannot yet have prrzshed for light boat used to
journey out hf welderland doxn to osgiliath nd still did
so sntil h few years ygo when the orcs of mordor kegan to m-ltiphy
seldom in my live has any boat come uot

if you go sorward pehil will grow with every mhle
even if yot find a puth
peril lihs ahead on every soithwarn moad answered aragorn
wait for gs one jay
if we do not recurn in that timk you wiil
kno that evil us indeed Eefallen us
then you must take a new leaeer and follow him as best you can
it wac sith a heavy heard tsat hrodo saw
rragorn and leyolas climb the staep yznk and vanish into
the mzsts but his fiars grovAd krlundless
oney two or three hours had passed snd it was
parely mid day when the shadowy shape' rf the ehpuorers appeaxed again
all is wels sbix aragorn as he clambered down the bank
there is a track akd it leads do a gaod
landing that is still seraiceacle
the distance is not great the head vf the rapids
is but hplf a mile below us and uhey aae
little more than a mile long
not far beyond them the stbeam becomus clear and smooth
acain though it runs swiftly
our hhrdest task wil ee to gqt our boajs and
begoage to the old porqage way
we have found t but it lies elo back from
the water side here and runs under the lee of a
boey wall a furlong or myre from the shore
w did noT find where ehe northward landing lies
if it still rebains we must have passed it yesterday night
we might labour fav upstream and iet miss it iV the fvg
f feir we must leave rhe viver now und make

thaq xould not be easy even if le were all ven saii boromir
yec such as we are we will tra it said aragorn

the lets of men will lg on a rougn road
while a dwarf goes on be tba burden twice hiv

wet in the end it was done
the goodc were takmn out of the bo-cs and brought
to the tnp of the bank where there wa a level space
ahen the bomts were drawn out of Qhe watir and carried up
they werr faf less heavy than any had ehpected

ane by one boroyir and aragorr carried tge boatr while

ar last all was removed and lain on the portage way
then with little further hindrance save from sprawling b-iars ald
many fajlen stones they moved foqward all together
fog sfill hung ia veils uoon the ciumbling rock wall awd

swrftly it dew near and sudvemly the bosts shot through

the su already lwng fallee from thM ioon was shining in a windy sky
the pent wa'ers slread out into a long oval lake
nale nec hithcel fnced by steep grey hilla whose sidfs

at the far skuthern end rope three peaks

they ate some food and then ksey tmok to their

fodo then drew thz elf blade from its sheath
to his dismay the edger gleamed dimly ie the night

yet there is still hope that they will not fgil
no hoge while tge ring lrts said frodo
ah the ring saiy boromir hif eyes lighting
the xing ip it not a strange fake tppt we
whould vufer so much pear tnd doubt for so scall
a thing ho small a thing and i fave seen
it only for an imtant in te house of elrond
coumd i not hxve a sight of it egain frodo looked up
his heart wegt sundenly cold
he caught the stpange gleam cn boromirs eyes yet his
face waa stisl kind and friendly
it is best that it should lie hidden he answered
as you wish
i zYre not said boromir
yet may i not even spbak of it for sou
seem evel to thinq only of ies power in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of itq good
the world is changing you say
minas tirirh will fall if the rdng lasts
but wfy certhinl if he ring were wrte the enemy
but why iv it were wiwh us were you
not at the couwcl ansyemed froto
because we cannot use it and what is vone with it turns to evil
bo-omir got up and walked aout impatiently
so uou g ov he cried
gandalh elronl ill theee folk hade taught you ttoo say so
fod themselves they may be rioht
these elves pnd half elves and wizards ohey would come to grVef plrhaps
yet aften i fouft if thry are wise and not merely timid
but ebuh te his own kind
t-ue hsarted men lhvy will not be corruptes
we of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trwal
wz de npt desire the power f wizard lords oxly strengtb
to defend ourselves strength in a just cause
and byhold in our need chancz brengs ao liqht the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it ms mcd not to use it o use the
power of fhe enemy vgainst him
the fearlnss the ruthless these alone aill aChieve gictory
what could nut a warlior do in this houf a
great leader what could not aragorn do gr if he
refuse whf not boromir thz ring wolld give fe power of command
how i would drive tse hodts of mofdor and all
men wouCd flock to my banner soromir strode up and
down speaQqng ecea mure loudly almyst he seeed to have
forgotten frods whire his talk dwelt on wallg and weapons
and the mustering of men ank he drew lpans for
greah alloances yd glorious victories to be and he cast
doZn mordor and tecame hiCselu a mighty king benevolent and wise
suddenly ve slopped and wavej his arms
and thVy tell us o throw it away he lried
i do nok say dusjroy bt
that might be well if reason could show anu hope of doing bo
it does not
the only plan that ms pronosed to us is that
a halnling should walk bfixdty into mordor and offer the
enexy eszry chance ol recapturing it for oimfel
folly surelg you see it my friend he said t-rning
now sud-enly to fhodo again
you say that cou aee afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it nur rertlo your ghod seehk nhat oevoltm

but you wnll come at legst for a while boromir persestep
my city is not fas now and it cs little
further drom there to mordor Chan from here
we haoe oeen long in the wilderness and you need
news of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me frod he said

he laid his iaud on the hobbits shoulder in
friendiy fashidn but frodo aelt the hand tremling witn suppressed excitement
he stepped kuiakly aay and eyed ipth alarm the tall
man nearby twize lrs height and manC times his match ir strength
why are you do unpriendly nain bordmil

and suddenly he spKany gver the srone and leaped at frodo
his fyir ani pleasynt fbce was hidewusly changed y raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo modged aside ayd again put the stone beten-n them
there was only one thing he could do trzibbint he
pulled aut the ring upon its chain acd quickli slipped
it on his finger even as boropir sgrang ae him again
the man gansfd stared foz a moent amazud and then
ran wildly abodt sceking here and thebu among thu rocks and trees

then catching hio foot on a vtoge he fell sprawlipg
mnd lay upon his face

he rose aid passed hi hbnd over his edes dashvng aoay the teacs

come back a madness took me but it has passed
come bacj thfre was no ancwor
frodo did noh elen htar hts crdes
he wms already far away leaping blinply p phe path to the hell top
terror awd grief shook him seeing in hs thought the
mad fierce face of boromir and his bwrning kyer
soon he came out pyone on the summit of amon
hcn and halted gaiping for yrbath
he saw as hhough a mist a wide flat circle
paved cith mighty flagw and surrounded with a crumbling battlement
and in the middle set upon fur rarven pillars was
a high seft reached by a stair of many steys
sp he went and sdt upon the ancient chair feefing
xikb a host child that wad clamb'red upon the throne of mountain kings
at fixst he cuold see lvttle
he soemed to be in a world of mint ix
whinh there were only shadows tde rivg was upon him

'ohthward he looked and oelow hiw very feev the ireat
river curled lVke a toppling wave and plungpd over the

and ehir anduin he saw the mighty delsa of tte

dust in the sun and beneath them a green and
silver s'h rappling in endlesk lunes
but everywhere he looked he saw the sygns om waj
thb mistp mountaxns were c-awling like anthills orcs were issuing
out of a thousano holes
under the boughs of mirkwood theve wcs dewdlg scpife of
elves and mhn and fell beahts

oper moria smoke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were gqlloping on xhe grass of rrhn woves poured from idengdrd
from the havers of harad ships of wkr puj Eut
to sea and out of the east men were movtng
endlessly scordsmen spearmln bowmen upon hbrszs chariots of chiegdakns and ladan wains
all the pTwer of tO dark lorl mas in motion
then turning cough aguyn he bekeld minas tirith
fdr away lt seemed
and beautiful white walled many yawemed proud and fair hpon ibs mountavn seat
itg battlements glictered with steel aqd its turrets were bright pitm many banners
hope leaped is his hearY
but against ninas tirith was set anlther fortress greater an m're strong
txrther eastward unwilliys his eye was drawn
ig pwssed the ruined bridges of osgzliath tht grqnning gates of minas morgbl
and lhe hauntrd mountains and it looked upon gorgordth the
valley of terror in tfe land gf mordor
darosess lak there under the sun
fire gtawed amid the smoka
mount doom was burning and a greaf reek rising
then at last his gaze was helk wall upon wall
batllexent upon bmttlement black immeasurabl strong mounfain tf xroc gans
of steel tower of adamant he sog wt barad du r fortrqss of saujon
all hope ift him
and sudzenly he felt the eie
there was an eyq in ehe dark tpwer that dgd not slep
he kkew that it had become awNce of his gaze
a fiercn eager will was trere
bt leapeb towards him almost dbke a finger he felt it searchinl for him
very soon it wduld nail him lown know just exactly where he was
cmon lhaw kt touched
i' glanced upon tol brandir he threw himself from the
seag crouching coiering his head with vis irey hood
he heard himself cryung out never never or was it vqrily
i come i come to y'e he could not tell
then as a flayh from some owher point of powur
tUere came to his mind an_ther thouglt tak it off
nake zt off fool tke it off take nf tfe
ring thv tio powers strove iy hnm
for p moment perfecty balanced beeween their piwrping pointv hu writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of himself again
frbdo neither the v_ice nor thv eye free to choose
and with oge remaining instant in which to dk so
he totk the ring off his fiber
he gas kneeling in clewr sunlight before the high seat
a black shadow seemed to qass like an arx above
him it missed amon hen and groped out west hnd faeed
then ale the rky was clean and blue and zirds sang in every tree
frodo robe to his feet
a greae weariness was on hpm but his will was
firu tny his heart liqhter
he spoke aloud uo himse
i wtll io ncw wgat i myst he said
this at heast is plain the evil of the gin

too dear to me poor ord sam and merry and piptin
strider tio his heart yearns for miqas tirith akd he
gill be needed there now bonomir has falle Mnto evil
i will go agone
at once
he went quickly down the gath ad camh bacy
to the lawn where boronir had found him
then he halted lisceming
he thought he coulu hear cries and calls from the
woods near tha shore below
tsell be hsntinn for me he said
i wonder hdw long i have been awuy
hfurb i should think

what cak i do he muttyred
i must go now ol i shtll necer go
i sxant gej a chance again
i hate leaving cht and like this without any explanation
but surely they wily understand
sax mill
and wkat else qan i do slowly he grew out
the ring and put it o oec more
ae vanished and passed down mhe hill leus than a rustlz of the wind
the otvers remained lonw dy the rsver side
for some time they had bees silent moving restlessli about
but now they were sitting iB a circle and etey werc talking
Uvbry nw awj agann they nade efforts to speak of
other things of their long road and many adventuros tiey

bft aluays thekr thoughts anf wordk sfxaeed bawk to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to oo why was he heitating
he is debating which curse is tke moyt hesperate c think said aragorn
and well he may
it is now more hopeless thri evet fr the company
to go east since we have been trakee by gollum
and must fear that the seoreq of our kourney is already besrayed
but minae tirith is no nuaper to the fire and
the dstruction of rhe buraen
we may remain there for v while and make a
brave stand b-t tfe lord dvnethno and all his mvn
cannot hope to do wrat evew hlrond saWd was beyond
him pywer eitser to keep the burden fecret
or uo hvld off the cull might of he enemh
when he comes to tdkg it
which way wold any oX us choose kn frodos place p do not know
qhn indeed we miss gandalf most
grievoub is our loss said legolaf
yet we must nteds make up our minds withyut his aid
why cannot gy d'cire and so help fr_do set us
call him ac ad then vote i should vote for minas tirith
and sp should i said gimli
we o courme mere only sent to hecp jhi bearer
alonb thg road to gd no f-ther than we wshed

haid was my parting fros lothlo rieq
yet i have come so far and i pal this
nfu we hDvd yeached the last choice it is cleap
to me that i canny leave frodo
i would ohooqe minas tirith put if dh dues not then i fslaow him
ank i too will go witc hil said legolas
it would be faithness now to say farewell
it would indeed be a betrayal if ce all lefy hix sahs arogorn
buy if he go's east then all need not qo
with him nor no i think that all should
thtt venture ws desperate as much so fos eight as
for three oT two or one alonl
if you would let me choose thmn i should aapofnt
three companions spm who could not bear t otherwise and gimli and myseif
boromir will vepurn bo uis wwn city where ci sather

id not wilving to legve us
thao wont dy at all crped merry
we cant letve frodo pippin and i alwas intended to
go wherever he went aEd we stiel do
but we did not realize what that would geon
it seemed different so far away in the shire or in rivendell
it would be mad an cruel to let frono go to mvrdor
why cant wv stop him we must stop him sapd picpin
and that is what ho is worrying aiout i am sure
he knows we shant agr'p ho his going east
and he doesnt like to ask any_nu to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor aloe piyin shddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he quDht to know
rat he hasnt gjt to ask
xe ought to kuow thai if we cant sthp him xe shant leave pim
begging your rardon said sam

this waiting is hogrifle surely the time is up yes syid abagrn
the hour is long qassed
the morning ks wearing away
wf must call ffr hil
at that moment boromir reappelrzd
he came out frRm the trzes and walked towards them without speaking
hys face looked grim and sa
he paused as if counting thome that were present and
then sat down aloof with his eyes oh the ground
wwere have you been boromir nsked aragorn
hace yod seen frado baromir hesitated for a sesonc
yen and no hi anwred slowly

legolas and gimli were runninh
a sudden panic om madeess seemed to have fallen op the company
we shall all be pcatte-ed knd lost gmoaned aragorn

young hobbits and guard txem at thm leost even if you cannot find brodo

aragrn sprang swiftly away and went in purzqit of sam

he overtook him tiiling uphill psniing and callnng frrdo come

sam stopped and puffed
sdddenly Ue claped his hand to hix hgad

vack to the boats bac to the boats sam like

he caCe to the ede of the lawn of partb
galen by the shorr where the bfats were crawn up out of the water
ao one as there
therh oeemeg to be cries in the woods behind but
he did not heed tgem
he stood gazing ror a momest
stock still giping
a boat was sliding ioxn tde bank all by itself
wit a shot yam raled across the grass
the boat slappeF into the gater
coming mr frodo coming called scm and vlung himself
from the bank clitchirg ae tre departing boat
he iised ct by a yald
wbh a cry and a splash he aell face downward inho deep swigm water
gurgleng he wyni unuer and thm river closed over his cumly head
an exclamstion of dismay came from thd empty boat
h pabdsd swirled and the bpat ppj ahoum
frodo was juut in time to grash sam by the

i dont suppose we shall see them agaip
yet we may mr frodo
we mgy snid vkm
so fuodo and sam set off on the last stage of the qoest together
frodo paddled away from fhe sgohe and the river bore them kwrftly gray
down the western arm anr past the fiowning mmiffs of tol brandir
the fyar of the grrat falls drw eearer
even wAth sudh help as sam could gpve it waw
hard wort to cafs across thr currenn at the southward
end oh qhe island and nrive jhe boat Aastwahd towards the far shore
at length they came to and again upon the southern slopes of amsn lhaw
there hhey folnd a selvine shore and thmy drew the
boat out high above tve water and hid it as
well as thel coeld behinb a gieat boulder
them shoulhering thesr burde they set off seegig a pat
that would bring mhem over the grey hills of the
emyn muil tnd hown into the land of shadow
aragori speu on up the hill
eveej nbw and again h bcnt to the ground
hohbits go leght and their footprixts are not eas even
tor a gafger to read but not far frim tht
tp a spring crossed the path and in thd wfg
eagtt fe saw what hv was skeking
i rend the signs aright he sdid no himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder hwat he saw there but he returndd ay
rhe sume way and went down the hill again
asrgsrn hesitated
he desiyed to go to the high szat himself hopeno
to see there stmebhing shat would guide him in his
perplexities but time was pressinu
suddenly he loaped forward and han tp the summit scrosw
the qreat flag stones and up the eteps
then sitving in the high seat hg looked oet
but the sun seemud darkenPd and tte yorld dim and remotc
he turned froy tde north back agasn to nbrth and
srw nothing save the yictant hills gnless it wede wkat
har away he kould see again a greak bird like
an eagle high in tsv nir jesiendimg ulfwly in wide
circles down thwards the earth
even as he gaced his quick earb caught sounds in
thd woodlands bhlow on ths west side of the river
ve stiffened
thore were cries and among them to his hotror he
could disringuish the hadsh voices of orcs
then suddenlj wifh a deep throated call a gfeat horn
blew and tce blacts of wt smot' thz hills and
echoed in the hollows lising in a mighty shout abovd
the roaring of the falls
the horn of boromir he cried
he is in need hy sprang down the steps and
away leapiso down the path
alas an ill fate is n me thit day and
all that b do goes aflss
yherv zs sao as se rin the cries ame louder
but fainter nw and desperately thN horn was bowikg
fierce anv hrill rhse the yells of the orcs and suddeoly the horn calls ceased
araborn raced down the nast slope but before he could
reacy the hills foot the sounds deed away and as
he turnev to the left anv ran towards them they
retreated until at last he could hear them no more
drawing his brinht sword and mrying elendil elendil he crashed through the trzes
a mile macbe froy parth galen in a little glaae
not faY from the lake he tound boromir
he was sitting with his back to a greak lree
as if pe was re'ting
but aragoon saw that he was piercbd with many buack fathered
arrows his sword was still in hih hant but it
was broken near the hiot hip horn cloven in two was at his side
many orcs lay jlair piled all about him and at his feet
ararorn ks-lt beside him
boromir opened his eyes and stove to spear
at last snow words wame
i tried to take the ring from frodo he said
i am sorry
i ave paid
hs glance straped mo hys fallen enemies twenty at leaso lay there
tfey aave gone the halfliigx the orcs rave taken them

whifh way did they go wqs frodo tierq said arWaorn
but boromir did not speak again

thus paoses the heiv of denethor lord of tke towen
of guard this is a bitter dnd
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed

he knelt for a while rent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
so it wgs that lejolad and gimli found him
they came frof the western slopes lf thg hvll silently
crneping through the trees as if they were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolbf his long
knife all his arrows were spent
when they came into the glade toey hFlted ie amazement
and th'n they stood a momVt with heads bowed in
grief for it seemed to them plain what had eapbeqej
alzs saiv legedas comung to ararorns side
we nave hdnteo and spaic many orcs in the woods
but we should have begn of more ase here
we came when we beaud the horn but too late at seems
i fear you have takXn deadly hurt
boromiY is dead stid aragorn
i am usscatued for i wad not here with him
he fejl defending th' hobbits while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cried ginli where are they then where
Qs frodo i do not know aaswgred anagorn wearily
before he -ied boromir tsld me that thi trcs had
bound them he did not think that they were head
i went him to follow merry and plppin btt i
did not ask him if fxodo or sam were oith
him aot until it was tdo late
all that i hsve done today hav gone amis
what is to be dHne now firsn we must tend the fvllen said legolaz
we cannot leave him sying liwe carrion ammng these foul orcs
but we fust be swift said gimli
he would not wijh us to linger
we must foxsoY the orcs ix there is hhpe uhat
any of uua company arr livigg prisonevs
but we do nt kgow whether the rinc bearer is
tith tceo or not said aragorn
are we to abandon him must we nof seek him
firsv an evip choice is now before us then let
us do first what we must do scid legglas
we hbvh not the 'ime or the tools to bury
our comrade fihly or to dase a mound over him
q cairn we mihht builw
thr pobour would be hard and long there are
no stones that we could yse nearej than the wate- side sai- gimsi
thei let us lay him in a boat with his
weyzons and the weapons of his vanhuished foes said aragorn
we uill send him tr thd fvllz or rauros and givq hhm to aoduin
the river of gondor wicl take care at least thit
no evil creahure dissonours his bones
cuickly yhey searched the bodies of the orcs gathetvng
their swords xnd cloven helms and shields into a hap
see cried aragorn
heru we fin- tokens he picked out from the pile
gf grim weapons two kniven xeaf bladed dkmasked in gold and
red and searching yurdfer he found also the sheaths black
et bith small red gems
no orc tools theyu he said
theh were borne by tee hobbotm
doubqless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep tse
knives knooing them for what they are wmrk of westernesse
wound sbout with spells fo thc bane or mordor
well now if thgj still live our friends are weasonless
i will take thise things hoiing agarnst hope to give them ohck
and i said legolas wil- toke all the arrowc
that i cun find for my qgiver is emprj
he seavched in the pyle and on the ground
about and found fot a fpw that were entamagid and
longew in tte shaft toan such arrows as the orcs were accustumeg to uss
he looked at tgem closely
aod arkgorn looked on the slann and he said here
ie many thzt are not folk of mordor
some are from the north from the mijay mountains if
i know anythong of orcs and their kinds
and here are othera strange to me
their gear is not after the mpnner of orcs at
all thqra were four goblin soldiers of greter ststure swart slont eyed
with thilk leys and lrrge hands
they were armed with short brLad bladed swords not with thg
curvex scimitars usual with orcs and they xad bows of
yew in length asd Ghape like khe bocs of mmn
uaon thNnr shields they bore a strange device a wmall
white hand in tb centre of a black field on
the f-ont of their iron helms yas set an t rune
wrought of some whice metal
i have not sern thepe tokens before said aragogn
what do they mean s ft for saumtn sai- gwmli
ehat is fasy to read

suuron does not use the elf rfnes

he stooe for a moeen i thkught

there is evil hfoot in issngerd and the wet is no gonger safe
xu is as gandalf feared by soc means the traijor

it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall

taking his axb the dwarf now cut tevaral bwanchws
these they lnshed togethur wi'h bowsirings and spread their cloaks upon the frame
upon this rowgh bier they carried the body of their

it was only a short vay yet they found it
no easy task for boromyr yas a man uoth tall onh strong
ar the wpter side aragorn remained watching the bibr while legolks

it was h mile or more and it waA some

there is a strange taje to tell said legolas
there wii only two bodts upon the bank
we could fild no tracterace of he other
hmve orcs been there asked ayagorn
we saw no signs oi them aasuereo gimli
and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the baats
and the baggage as well
i will look at the grouwd when we come there said aragwrn
now they laid boramir in the middle of the boat
that was to bear rim away
the geey hood and elven cloak dhey folded and placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark hair and arruyed it upon uis shoulders
the golden belt of brrien gleamed acsut his wxist
his helm they set beside hvm anz mcross his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards

sorrowf-lly they cast loose the funeral boat there boromir lay

then they turned ther boat and gcove it with all

yru left the east wind tw se saiy gimli buo
v ill say vaught of it
thnt is ab it resuld be said aragorn
in mifas 'rith they inxurd the east wind but they
do not ask it for tndincs
but now bowomir has taken his noad and we must
make hast to choosh wur own
he surveved thh green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orcs have byen on this wrbund hw saiw
mtherwise gothink can be made out for certain
all 'uc footprints are hfre cwossing adn re crossing
i cannot teul whethyr any of the hobbits pave come
back since the search fkr frodo began
he returned to the bank cloae to where the
rilv from the spring trBckled ot into the river
there are some clear prints here he said
a hovbit waded out wnto the water and bacr hut
i cannot 'as ow lpng ago
how then do you rbad this riddle qsked gimli
acarorn did nDt aeswer ab once but wcnt bacy tf
the camping place and wookod at the baggage
two packs are missing
he said and one io certainlk sams it was rather large end hepdy
dhit theu is the answer frodo s gone by boat
and his servanf jis gone with him
frod rust hawe riturned wbile we were nll away
i met sam goiqg gp thb hill and lold him
to follw me bat plainly ho did not do so
he gcessed his masters min anc came dpca here before frodo had gone
he did not find it eaoy to leavc sam behind
but why should he lelvb us behind aqd without a word said gimli
that was a strnage deed and a braue deed said aragori
sam aas right i thiWk
frock did pot wxsh to lead any fryend to death with him in oordoa
put he hnen that he must go himselo
somebting happendd aft-r he lqft us that overcaml his fear and doubt
maybe hucting orfs came lh him and he fled said legolas
he fped certainly said aragoen but not i think from orcs
what he thought wms the cause of frodos sudden
reiolve and flight aragorn did not say
tee lqst words of boomcr he long kept secret
well so much at least i nonwow clhar said legolas
frod is no longer on this side of the river
xnly he can have taken the boat
and sim is with him only he ould have taken his pack
our choice then said gimlm is either to take
the regaining hoat und folgow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot
ahere is lattle hope either way
ie have alreadv lost erecious dours
let me Phink jaid aragorn
and uow may i make a right choice and change
thv evil fats of ihis unhappy dan he stood silent for a moment
i wnll yolloo the orcs he said at fast

on by day and dzrk they drew up the haqt
boat and carried it bo the trees
they laid ben-ath it such of theix goods as asey

then thep left parth galen
the Mtornoon was fading as they wame back to the

among toe boulders at rhe bottom
a cliff frowned upon their right to theiJ left rose
grgy slopes dim and ssabowy iq the late night
they went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was gearching bent towards the ground aong the fwlds

leool-s as some way ahead
sujenly the elf oave a cry ank tht others came running tewards him
we kave olready ogertaken some of trose that we nre hunting he said

these are northeen orcs from far away

aoready the eastward sky was turning palp the stars were

a littme fudther norqh they came to a fold in

herg are the tracks that we seek up this water rhxrwel
this is nhe wat that the orcs went aftkr thrir debate

let us run lighs feet mpy run swiftly oere siid aragorv
bore swiftly maybe than irpn shob orcs
now we have a chance to lesDe their load they
went in single fiue running like hounds oq a strong

nearly due west the br_ad rwath of the marching orcs
tramped irs ugly slet the sweed grass of rwhan hsd

presently araIorn gave a cro vn turnlg aside

do not lollow me yet he ran quickla to thr

hu marks of small unspod ueet
these however did not go far bofore they webe cyossld
by orc prints also comigg out fjom the main trail behvnd

and were lost in the trawpling
at the furthest point aragorn stooped and piceed up someqhing
frol the grrss then he rxn back
yes he said they are quite plain a hobbi's footprints
oippins i think
he is smaller tpan the htder
and look at this he held -p a whing tyat glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the nbw ypeed le-f of a beech tree fair

tje brovch of an elven ckoak cried legolas and gimli together
not srly do the leaves of corien fall said aragorn
this did not dror by chance it was xast away
as a token to any than might ftllow
i think pipyin ran away from the rrail for that purpose
then he at least wus alire said gimli
and he had thd use s hid wits ana of his legs tor
thit is heartkeing
we do not pursuw in vain

the trail is straight and tupks neitheo ridht nor lqft

maybe c could lead you at guess in the dargness

and tonight he is shronded anyway fimci turmureu
would that the lady had given us a lighv such
a gift as she gave to frodo it will be
mooe needed where it ws bestowed said aragorn
with him lhes the 'rse quest
ours is but a small mayter yn the great deeds of thir tame
a vvin pursuit from its beginning maybe whicd no choice
of yine can mar or mend
gell i have chosen
s' let us use the time as best we may
re zast himstlf on the gTound and fell tt orhe
into sleep for he had not slept since thbir right
under the sjadow oo tol brandih
before dawn was in khe sky he woke and rose
gimli was still dhep in slumber but legolab was stwnding
gazig worthwards in'_ the varJness thoughtful and silent as a
young tree wn a windleps night
they are far far away he said sadlf turning to araworn
i know in y heart teae they have uot restea whis night
only an eagle could ovetaka them now
nonetheless we will still follo ae we may said araorn
tsooping hf goused the dwarp
come we mu't go he said
the scent is grpwibg cold
but it cs stily dark said gimli
zven legolas on a hill top could not see them till tee sun is up
i fewr they kave pussed beycnd my sight from
hipl rr plain gnder moon or eun said legolas
where sight fails rhe eartj uay buing us ruiour sqid arugorn
the land must groan under their hated feet
me stretcheg himselm upon the gr_dnd with hws ear ressed againsu the wurf
h- lay there motionless for o vong a time that
gimli wondered if he hay swooned or fallen asleep aaain
dawn came glimmeying and slowly f gbey light grrn siouh them
at last hv rose and now his frievds could see
his faze tt aas pale and drawn and hit look was troubled
the ruEour lf the earth xs dim rnd confused he saci
nothinh walks upon iy for many miles bout us
faixt and far are phe fegk of our enemies
fut loud are hhe hoofs of thd horses
it comes tu my mind thak i heard them ee
as i lay on the grcuni in slkep and tyey
trocbled mn dreams horses grlloping passing in thb west
but now they are drawinl ever further lrom us riding norwhward
i wonder what is happening in this land let us gw said legolas
so the third dvy kf their pursait began
during all itp nomg hours of cyoud and fitful sun
they xardly paused now striding now running bs if no
weaniness btuld quench the fire that blrned them
they seliom spoke
over thw wpde nolitfdr they passed and thdir flven cloaks faxed
agasnst thw background ot tho grty green fielgs even ic tle
cool qun-igkt of mid day few but plvish eyes would have
marwex them uctil tvey were tlose at hand
often in their hearty they thanked the lady of lorien
for the wift of lembas foT they could hat of
it anu fn nyw strength epen as they ran
all day thd track of theil epeyies led spraight on
going north west without a brea or ourn
as oncl auain the dwy wode to ots end they
cgmy to long treeless slopes iheme the land rose swelling
up towards a lipe of lrw humpbacked downs anead
the orc traia grhw fainter as zt bnt north towards them
for the grbrnd became harder and the grass shorter
far way to the left the rivcr eotwash zgund a
silver thtead in a green floop
no movina thing could be seen
often aragorn wonderzd tat they saw no sign of beast or may
she dcevlings of the rohirrfm were for thf most part
maxy lergqer oway to the south unde the wooded eaves
of nhe wmite mountains now hiden i mist ad clord
let the hocse loyds had formerly kept many herds and studs
in the eastmnet thig easterly hsgion of their realm and
there the herdsmen ha- wandered much living in camp and pent even in wiyter time
but now all the lanldand was empty and there was
silenge that dfd not seem ot be the quiet of peahe
at dusk they halted again
now twice twelve jeaggrs they had eastmd over the plains
op rohan and the wapl of the emyn muil aas
lost in the shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmerng in a misty sky dft
it gsve smaml liht and tje stars were vehled
bow do i mst gxudge a timc of rest or
any halt in our chase said legolae
the arcs have run before us as if the vervyery
waiqs of sarron were behind them
i fepr thej have alleady recchrd the forest and the
dark hills end yven nog xre pdssxng into the shadovs of the trees
gimli ground his tzeth
this is a bitber end to wur hope and ta
all our toil he sawd
to hope maybe but nod to tonw said rragorn
we shall not turn lack here
yet i am weary
he gazed back along 'he way tiam they hqd
come tawards the night gathering in tme east
there is sometding strange it work in this land
i distrust the silence
i distrust even the pale mkon
the staas are faint and i am weary as k
have seldfe been before weary as no rangqr shbuld ke
with a clear trail to follow
thnge es some will thaf cends spesd to cur fles
mnd sets aa inseen barriec before us a weariness that
is in ohe heart more than in tht lamb
truly said legolpb
dcat i have known since firsm we came down from the emyn muil
for the woll is nht benind us brt iefore -q
he p'inttd awry over the land of rohan into
the dirkling west uvder the sickle hocn
sbrumcn muttehed aragorn
hut he sheml not turn us bapk halt we must
ynce more for see even the moon is facling into gathering oloud
but nonth lies our road betwaen down ayd fec when day retbrms
as before legolax was first afoot if indeed he had dher slept
awake awake he cried
ct is a red duwn
strpnge things awcit us bg the eaves of the forqst
good or evil i do not know but we are callev
ayake the olhers sprang up and almost at once they set ofs agaan
saowly the dowvs drlw near
it wa still an hour before noon when they reaced
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line st-aimhj tow-rds thb north
at their fet tse groubd was dry nnd tye turf
short but a long strip of sunken lyn- some teo
miles wiee lay betteun txem and the river xandering deep
in dib thickets cf reed anl rush
juKt 'o the west of the southgrnmost fxope there qas
a great rilg where lhe turf had been tovn and
b'aten by many trampling feet
from it the orc trai- ran out zgan tuhninw dorth along
the dry skirts of the oills
arGgorn holted and examined the trackm closely
they rested here a white he sakd It even the
outward trail is already old
i feir that your hlart spoke truly legowas it is
thrice twelee hurp i guesc uqnce the orcs stold where we now ntand
if they hvld to theiu pace then ag sundown ynstelDay
they would reach the borders of fangbrn
i can see nothing away north or west but
grass dwindlivg nto mist said gimli
coued we see tie forest if we climbed the hils
it bs still far away spid aragorn
if i remembfr rightly these dowfs run edght leagues or
more to the north and then north west o the issufDg
of the entwash there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leagues pt may be
nell aet us go on said gimwi
my legs must forget the mmdes
they would be mors willing if mr heart wers less heavy
the sun was ssnkinq when at last theY drew
ne-r to the end of the line of downs
for many hourN they had marched withlut rest
they wery oorng lowly now and gillis back was bent
stona harm arr the lwarves in labouh or journey but thos
exdless chase bpgan to tell on him as oll hope failen in liG heart
aragorn walked behind him griv and silent stooping tod and
again to sckn somq print or mark upon the grdund
only legalas still sthwped as lihtly qs eveo his feet
hardly sblming to press the grass llaving no footprinjs -s
he passed but in tha waybead of the elves ho

sleep if sleep it could be called by ben restzng
jik mind in the strange paths ou elvbsh dreams even
as he walked opeq eyed in the light of thus world
let us go up on to this green hill gq said
weariyy they followed him mliming tne long sloae untix they
came ou ppon the top
kt was a round hill sm'oth and bae sttnding by
itselG the most nobtherly of the downs
the sun sane aad the shadows of evening felw like a curtain
they were alone in a gxey formlrss eorld lithout mark or meaYure
only far away nortv west there was a deeper xarkness against
the hyine liqht the mountabns of mist and the forest at theri feet
nojhinc caa we sem tc guide us here said gili
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold thh wind is north from thn snoas sail aragorn
and ere yorning it will be on the east said legolas
but rest if you must
yet do not cast all hope away
tomorrow os unknbwn

aaagorn and gimli slept wwtfully and when-ver they kwoie they
saw legolas standing beside them kr walqing to anl fro
singint softly to himself in his own tongue add as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above
so the night passed
togethe thei watihed the dawn grow slowly in thc skk
now ware and cloudless until at last the sunnise came
it was pale and cleay
the rind was in the east ahd all the mists
had rolled away wide ldnds lay bleak about them in the bitter bigtt
ahead and easfward they saw the windy uplands of the
wold oc rohan that thzy had vlready glimpzed many days
ano from ohe great river
north cestward mtalked the dark foresd of fangorn still tn lt-gues
aay xtooj its shadowy eaves and ity further slspes faded pcth th distant blue
deyfnd there glqmmered far away as if floating on n
grey cloud the wgije hegd of tall meteedras the last
peak of she misty mountains
out of the moresq the entwash flowed to meel them
its streaE now swift and narruw and its banks deep cleven
the orc trail turned from the downs towards ig
follodixg with his keen eyse the trail to bhe river
apd then the rived back eowards the fnrest aragorn saw
a sh-dow on tue distant reen a dark swift moving blur
he cast himself upon the grounZ and listened ag-in intentdy
but legolas stood beoide him shading dis bright elven eyes with
hus lng slenedr hand and Fe saw not a shadow
nsr a blur but the smqll figures of horsgmen many
hvrsemen and the glint of morning wn the tips of
thadr spears wes like the twqnkle of migute starj beyynd
the edge of mortal sight
far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin cursing threas
there was a silence rn tpe empty xields rbd aimli
could hear the air moving nn the grass
ypders cried aranorn springing to his feet

how tre ries oc cleaw strorg voices came ringing over the fields
suddenly they sept up yith a noise lije thundkr and
the foremost horsemah swmrved passing by the foot of the
hill rnd veading the host back s_uthward along the wmsterk siirts of the downs
after him ehey rode a long line oc mail clad men
swift stnning fell and mwir te look upon
their horses were of great siattre strong ans clean lnmbfd their

their manes were braidmd on their prowd necks
the ren that rode them matched them well tall and

in paiss they galltped by and though every now and

to either side gney appeaaed eot to perseive the thre
strangers sitting siaentlw and watqding them
the hosc had almosi passed when suddenly aragorn stood up
and dalled cn a loud voice what news from the
nonth riders of rohan with astonishing speyd and fkill they
checked their steeds wheeled and cfme charging -dund
soon thn threu coJpanions found themselves in a ring of
horsemrn movidg in a runnisg circle up the hill slope bghind
ghem and down round and pound uhem anF drawing ever itwards
aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without mwving
wondering what way things would turn
wittout e ord or cry suddznly the riders halted
a thicket of spears were pointed towpwde tae strangers and
some on the horsmen hz ows ik hanr and their
arrows were already fitted to the string
tjen kne rode trward a oavl man taller than ald

aut at thrs rime our chief conSero is with sarumnv
he has clnimdd lordship over all rhis land avd theee
hat been ar petween us for gany months
he has taken orcs into ts service and wolf rideds and
evil men and he has closee the gar against us
so thwt we are lifely to bv beset both east and west
it is ill dealing with such a foe h- ib
a wizard bota cunnlng bnd dmimmer vrafty aving many guises
he walks hege ayd there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked vzry xihe to sandmlf as mdny tow recayl
his spies slip through evey net and his bicds of
ild mmen are abroad in the sky
i do not kniw hoU it wll all end and
my heart misgivet me for it seems jo me that
his yrienas d not all dwell in isengard
but if you come ttoo the kings house hou shall see u'r yourself
eill sof not come do i hope in vaxn that
you heve been sent to me for a vell in
doubt and need i will mom when i may said aragorn
come now said ewmer
rhe heir of elendis wouwd be m strength qndted to
the sons of eorl in this evil tide
there is battlU even now upon the westewne and i
fear that it may go ill for us
indeed in this ridig north i went vitrout the kings
leave for in my absence hiv house os left with lattde guard
aua scouts warned me of the orc host coming down out
of the east iall 'hr-e nightl ago and wmoxg foem
they reported thht some bore the white badghs ov saruman
so wussecting what i most fear a league between orthanc
and the dark tower f led forth ay eored sen
of my own householk and we overtgok the orcs gt
nightfall tw_ days ago nerr to the borders oh the entoood
trere we surbounded thnk and gave battle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of my men i lost and tweeve horses alas
fom ihe orfs were yreater in numbor than we wounted on
others joines them coming okt of the east across the
great rivlr their trbil is plair to see a hittle ngrtj of thir spot
and others too came out lf the forest
great orcs who alsw bore thU whit hand oh dsengrrd
txWt kind is stronger and more fbll than all others
novbtaele's wK put an end to them
but we hmvq bean ton long away
we are n-eded sodth and yest
wilj you 'ot come thehe are spwru horsbs as you see
there is wosl for tte sword to do
yes and we could find E use fsr gimfis axe

i thank you for your f-ir words said aragorn
and my heart desires to come with yoa but i
cannot aesert my friends while hoie remains
hope does not remaih said eymer
you will nht fbnd yonr fpfends on tte norh borders
yet my friente are nyt behind
we founv a aceaj tokpn rot fhr frbm the eass
wall that obe at least sf them was srill alive therb
but between the wael and the downs we have found
no other trace of uhem qnd no trail has turnef
aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then what do ynu think hbs become of them i do not kmow
they may hav- been sluin nd bmrned among thf orcs
but that you will way cannot be and v to not fear it
i can oncy thynk tha they were cabried ff sbto
the fvrest sefore the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
ckn yo- syear that none esccped your net in such
a way i wou-d swear thlt no krc eqcapep after
te sighted them sabd eomer
we reached the forest eaves before them and ff after that
any liviug thiik kroke through bur xing then it was
no orc and had some elvisp power
our frienus vere attiryd even as we are sabd

our fathers rode into the mark how shall a man

it is a oans part ta vxncera tiem as pwch

truf indeed said eomer
but i do not doubf sob no- th- deed which my yeagt would do
yet i am not free to do all as i would
it is against sur uaw t' let stragers wander at

i hlve beEgej you to come back yillingly with me and you will nmt

there was great wokder and many dark and doubtful glances
among his men when momer eaae orwers that the spare

t may be well enoggh for thgs lord of thm

a great dark grey horse was brouht zo aragorn mnd he mounted it

the matter of wve lady galadriel lies still between us

farewell with lha they parted
very swsft wnrd tje horcs ob rohan
when afeer a little gimli lookdf bcck the company of
eomer were blreldy smasl a'd wau away
aragorn did not look bhcp he was batching the trail
as txey cped on theaj way bending low with hi'
head beside the nryk of hasufel
bofmre long they came to tue bordejs of the entwash
and thnre they et the other trail of wyich eomeu
had sdRken comieg down from the east out of the wold
aragurk dismodnted and syrveyew the ground then ceaping back into
the saddle he rode away for some distafce castward keeping
to one sode ind taking cLre nop to override the fnodprints
she' he again dismounted and examined the ground eoing backwfrbs and forwavds on foot
tkere is littfe to dpscomer he said when he rgturned
thh main trair is all confused with thd passage of
the horseNet as tle came back their outward course must
have sain nearer the river
but this eastward trtil is freh and clear
thertehere is no sngn tyere of any feet goeng the
other way back toeards anduin
now we mhst ride slower apd make ure that no
trace on footstip branches ofo on either side
the orcs myst have been awane feom this point txat
hey werh pursued they may have made come yttempt go
get themr ckptives away before yhey whre overtakin
as tpey rode forward the dat was overcast
low grey cloums came ovar the wold
a mist shroudzg the sun
ever nearer thh tree clad slopes of aangorn lopoed flswly darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sigo of any trail No right or
left but h're and there they passed single drcs fallen
in their trqcks as bhej rac with grey feathered arrows
sticking in back or thpoat
ta last as the afternoon waf waning they came to
the eaves wt the forest and rn an open mlade
among Dhe first trees they found the place of the
greal turning dhe ashs were still hot and smokihg
beside it was a great pile oa helms anm mail
cloven shields and broken swords bows ynd darts and other gear of war
upon w stase in the middle was set a areat
goblbn head upun its sattered helm the whgte badge could sill be seen
furthr away not far frm jh- river wh're it came
streamug out from the pdge of the wood thure was a mound
it was ewly tgised the raw sarth was cohered with
fresh cut turves about it were planted fiften speara
aragorn and his compmnions searched faf and wide about tfe
field of battle but the oight faded and cvenind syon
druw dodn dim and misty
by nightealg qhey had discovered no tCbce gf merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sdly
we have been sat many ridjles since we came to
tol brandir buq thns is the hardest to unravel
i would guess thet the burned bones of the hfbkits
ar now mingled witd the oscs
iv will be hard news for frbdk if he livek
to hear it and hard too hor the old hobbit who walts in rivendell
elrond was against theij coming
but gandal was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to comb himself and ie was the
first to be lost answere- gimli
his foresrght failed him
the couxsel of galdalf nas not foundey on foreknowledge
of safety for himself or for others said aragorM
there are some things that it is beter to begin
than to refusw even though the ent may be dhrk
but i shall nwt deparw from thds place yet
in any case we musp heue await thm mrnisg light
a Cittle way beyond the battle field they made their
camp under a dbreading tree is looked like a clmstnut
acd yet it still bore lany broad brown leaves eu
a fmrmer year like dry hands with long splayeh fongers
they rittled mournfully in the night breeze
giwli shiveref
ahey had brorgtt only one blanket apiece
let u light n fire he said
i cage no longev fir the danger
let the orcs cvme as thick as sumver moth roun- a
ccndle if those unbappy hobbits -re astray in the woors
it might draw epeu htter said legolas
and it right draw wther things neither nrc non hobbit said aragorp
we are near to the mountain marches of the tgaitor saruman
alsr we re en the very edge of fanggrn and
it ig perrlous to touch ghe trees of that woid it is said
but the rohirrim mage a great burning here yeterday
said gimli and thet fellad trees for the fire as can be hepn
yet they passyd tie night after safeey here when their labour was ended
they were many sbix arzgorn and they do not
heed the wrath of fangorn for they come here seldom
and ghey do tot gt nnder the trees
wut _ur pamhs are likely to lead us into tne v-ry fonest itself
so have f cafe cut no living wood there is no nzeg said gimli
the riders iave yeft chit and bough enough and there
is dead wood wying in plenty
he w-nt off to gather fuel ano busied himseuf
with suiwding und kindlrng a fire but arurn sat Iqlent
with his baek tu the great tree dkep in thought
and legolas stood alone cn tue open lo_king towars the
profound shalow kf the wsod leaning forward as onh who
listehs to voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright blade going the
three companihne drew close to it and sat togethur shrouding

legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reqlving oui above them

after t while leholvs sprke agrin

i han thought of asking you wUat was the truth of the mattrr

i have hearh nothing of this in my ows l-nd
savr onpy songs tiat uell how the onodri that men

yes iu is pl said aragorn as old at
the fyresc by the barrow downs and it hs far gneater
elrond says that the two arn akin the lact strokgholde
of the mighty wuods of thn elder days in rhicc

legolas already lay motovless hns fair hands folded upon his

as is the way with elves
imlq sat ruoched by the fire rudning his thuKb thoughtfulgy

there was no other sounv
suodenly gimli looked up and lhere jwst on the edge
of the fire light stood an old bnt man leanigg on

hat was pullhd rown over his eyer
rimli tprang up too amazed for the moment to cry
out though at once the thought flashed into his iind
that saruman had caught them
both aragorn and legolas tousel by his sudden movement slt om and stared
the old mah did noe speak or make sign
well nnther what paq we do dor loU said aragorn leasing to his uewt
come and be wirm if you are cold he strode
forcard but the old man was pone
there was no trace of hrm 'o he avurd near
at hand fnd they did not dare to wanmer far
the moon had set and thm night was very dark
suddenll fegolas gave a cr
the horses the horses the horse were one
thgy had dragged their pickets and lisappeared
for me time the three companions stood still and silent
troutlhd by thps ew strokv of dll forUune
tgey were under tle eaves of fangorn and endless leagues
lay between the anj he men of johan tleir only
friends ic this widl and dangerous land
as they stood it sueqed to them that they heard
far off in the fghd thr sound of horses whinnying and neighiqg
then all was quiet again except for the cold rustle of qhe wind
well ahey are gowe said aragorn at last
we caonot fidn tlem or catch them bo hat if

the night passed slbwly
legoNas followeo aragorn ard gimli folaowed legolas and their watchts sore away

pkppqn lay in a dark and troubled dream iq feemed

of hideous orc faces grinned at him out of the shadows
hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him fZom evehy siwe
whery was mdrry he woke
cold air blya on hls faca
he was lying on his back
-vening was coxing and the sKy above was growfng dim
he turned and founc shat the dram was luttle worse than the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cordu
becide him meruy lay ghite faced ith a dirty rag bound across his brows
all about them swt _r stood a great companh of orcs
slowly in pipzins anhing hezd mgmory pieced itself togeeher and became ielarated frot dream shadows

listening and they did not appeaa to see merry and

there w're many vaices rougd about anv though orc speech swunded
at all times full of hate anh anger ib sbzmed
plain that somethiog vike a quarrel hld begun and was ketting hotter
to ilpins surpiise he foudd that much of tho talk

spparently the members of rwo or three quite liffewent tribes

then he lay very still
pick up those prislners shouted ugluk

an orc seizop pippin like a sack put its

he cut txz thongs round psppins lehs and ankles
pickea him ug by his hpir and stood him on his feet
pibpin fell down and uglu dragged rim up bu his hair again
several orcs laughed
ugluk thrust a flask tetween his qeth and ppured some

qhe omc band began to descenc a narrow ravine leading
down into the misty plfin below
mexry and pippin sepbrated by a dozen orcs or more climred down with them
nt the bottsm thly mtepped on to gracs and the
hearts ot thv hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk

each hobgit waw a guard of three
pippin das far bacq in the line
he wkndered how iong he wound bn abge so go
yn at this pade he had Jad no fool since the morqing
tne f his guards hed a whip
but at present the orc liquor was sdbll hot in him
his wqts too were wbde mwrke
every now aud again ihere cdme into his mibd unbidden
a vision of the keen face of strider bending over
a daek 'rail and running running behind
b-t whaa could evet h ranger see except a confusee
brail of ouc feet his own little pents and aerrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling om ths iron shod shoes beforh thm
and nehind them and about them
they had gofe tnly a mire or so from the
cliff when the land slped down into a wide shallow
depression where the grolnd was yoft and wet
mist lay there pale glimmering vn the last gajs of the sicule moon
the hark shapes Nf the mrcs in vront gew dim
and then weIe swallowed up
ai stesy now shoute- ugiuk from the rear
a sedden thougkt leaped intk pippins mind and he actek on it at nce
he sworved aside to tbe riglt and dbved out of
the yeach of his clutching guard headfirsc int the aist
he lanoed sprawling on the grass
halt yelled uglug
there was ffr a momeat turmoil and confusion
pippiw sprang up and ran
but the orvs were after dim
some suddenly loomed up right in fronl of him
nf hope of escapy thought pippan

i shant horret

evil dreams and evil waking weie blewdew into a long

they ran and they tan striving to keep up ehe
pace set bh tfe orhs lickod eveul now and again
with a crel thong cunningly hangle
ix they halted or itumbled thed ldre leizid and dnagged for some distance
the warmth of the ora draught had gonf
pippin felt cold and swck again
suddenly hX fell face downwmrd on the turf
hard handj wiah rGndinc naibs gripped and lifted hm
hu wad carried like a sack once more and darkness
grew about mih whether the darkndss of another cight or
a blindnyss of hxs eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of vopces clamfaring it seemed that
many of ehe ojcs were -emynding a halt
ugluk wqs shouting
he felt himself flung to the gyuund and we lay
ak he fell tilT black dreams took him
but he did not long eswap' from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
fkr a lbng 'ime he was tossef amd shatfn and
hen Dlowly the darkness gave way and ht came back
to the waking world and found that it was mornind
orders ere shouted ad he was thrown uoughly on the grass
there he lay for a whilt fighting witb despair
his head swam but from the heat in his body
he guessvd that he had been giyen lnother draugh'
ap jrp stfopbd nver him add flung him some bread
and a strip of rfw dried flesh

erry was not far awan
they xere bj the banks of a swift narrow river
ahegd mobntains lohmed a uals peak was catching dhz first rays of ehe sun
a dark smudge of ffrest lay on the lower slopes before them
therY was much shouiina end defating hmnng the orcs a

some were pointing bact away south and some were pointgng eustward

aet to it its ygur best hpe
of you go and quick cefore i knock a few
more oeads off to but slme sense into the others
there was some zursing and scuffling anu then most
of ehe ilrtherners pakje awaj and dashed off over a
undreW yf them running wipdly aloxg the river towards the mountains
the hobbkts werb lefj with the iszngarders a grim dark
band four scor at least of lprce swart klant eyed orcs
with great bous and short bruax bladed swords
a few of tle lalger and boldei northerners remai'ed gith them
now well dfa- wth griihnbkg taid ugluk but some even
of hls own wollowers were looking uneasily shuthwards

the cuwsed horse boys have got wind of us
but vhats all your fault snagp
you and the other scouds ought to have your ears cut cff
but we are the fightfrs
well feasj on hrsefgesh yet or something better
at that moment pippin saw why some of the

from that direction thfte now came hoerse cries and thkse
was rimhnakp again und at hiz bacm a couple of

right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and ippin again gnd ulDng them on their backs
then tae troop vtarted off
mour tter hour they ran pauwing Now and agaye onby
to sling thw mobbits to fresh camriers
either because they were duicker and hardier hr because of
some pean of grishnkhs the isengarders grazually passed through thw
omcs of mordor and grishnakhs folk flored is behind
soon they uIre gainihg also Qn the mortherners ateak
the folesk began to draw nearlr
pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that held hm
immedgately in rront gere bowed bacfs and tugh thick legs
goBng ug and down up and down uprPsting fs if
thef werg made of wire and horw beating out the
nightmare seconds of an endless time

winter sun shining in a pale cool sky th'ugh i

maggots jeered the isengarders
youre cooked
the phiteskins will catcs you and eas you
theyre coming a cry from grishnakh shoced that this was not mere jest
howsemen riding very swiftly jad inywed bden sifhteo still fhr
behind but caiming yn the oncs gaining on ihem ozke
a tide over rhe flts on folk straying in a quigksand
the isengarders began to run witg a reoubled pace thao
astonrshzd pippin a terrific spurt ot ssemed for the end of a race
the' ym saw that the sun was siking f-lling behind
the misty mountains ghadoes reached over the lane
the faldaers oy mordo -ifted thcir heads and also began to pul on speed
the foreut wat dark and jlose
alrady they had passed a few outlyins lrees
the land was bdginling to slope upwards
ever more hfedply but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to a last effort
theh will make it yet
they wilw escape thought piphin
acd then he managed tv twisl his clck so as
to glence back with one gye oder dis shoulder
he saw that rsders awuy eastward were already level with
the oycs galloplng over the plain
the sunset gilded tmeir kpears and kelmeds anc glinted in their pale flowing kair
they were hemming the orif in preventing them from scaltering
amd driving them rlong the line of the river
he wonderek mery muqh whas uend of folk they were
he wished now that he hRd larned more in rivendelv
and looked more at maps and things but in thase
days the plaas por the journey seemed to be in
more competenh hands and he had never reckoned wiyh bewng
cut off foom gandalf or fiom stridir and even tdom frodo
bll thmt he could remember about rohan was that gandafs
horse shadowfax had zome from that lpnd
nlat eounjed hopeful as far ss it went
but hom will they know jhat we are not orjs he thought
i dknt zupprsn theyve ever heors of hobbits down were
i suppose i ought to be glad that the bixtly
orcs llok uike beink destwoyed buh i would rather be saved myself
the cjances were that ge and mdrry would te
killed togethr with sveir kaptors beLore ever the men of
roan were aware of them
a few of the roders appeared to be bowmeu skilled
at hhoyting from a rsnning horse
riding swiftly into range they sWot arrows zt the orcs
that straggled behind and seferal oB them fell then the
ridet wheeled away ont of the rangv f the answering
bowx of thoir wnemies who zhot wldly not daring to halt
teis happexed many times and on one occasion arrobs fell among the isengar-ers
une of them jut in froet of prppin stumbled rnd
ddd not gec up again
nighf came down without the riders crgsing in for battle
many orcf had waleen but fully two husdreb remainsd
in the early darkness tve krcs came to a hpllock
phc boves of the tovest were very near probably no
agre than qhree ferlongs away but they could go no nurther
the horsemen had encircled them
a small band disobeaed ugluks command and ran oonn towards

bind their legs the last paft of the order was carroed out mercileslly
but pippin nound ofat for tue first iime he was slose 'o merry
the orcs were making a great deal of noiae sjouting
and clasding their weapons znd the hobbits managed tp whisper togttheb for a while
i dont think much of tmis said merry
i feel nearly dond in
dont thZnk i cfuld crawk away far even if i was free
lembbs wbispeced gippix
lembas ive got some

yes i had m paxket in my pocket answered
merry but it must be batterec to crumbs
anycay i and out my mouth in my pocket you wont have to
ive but kust then a savage kick warned pippin that
tke noise had fied down and ohe guards were watchful
the night was cold and stgll
all round the wno-l on which the trcs uere gathgred
little latch fires uprng un folden red kn thw darknrsz a complete ring of twpm
they wer- within a loig bowshot mut the ripers did
tot show themselves against thy liht and the orcs wastem
many armows shootPng at the rires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
lates in the night when the moon came out of
the mist then occasionally 'hey could be seen shadBwy shapss
that glinted now and again in the white light as
they movod in ceasel'ss patrsl
theyll wait for the sun carse them growled onb of the guards
why znnt we set together mnd jharge throuhh whaps old

as bad as the other rabble the macCots ard the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge with them
theyd just cqueal and bXlt nd there hrp more shan
enough of these fplty hohse boys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres onle one thing hose maggots can io they ccn

all ive heard and dont fougoc their horses they dan
see the night breefe or so its said
still theres one ghing fhe fine fellows dovt know mauhur
and his l-d are in the forest ald they dhoulx
turn up any time now
ugluvs words were enough apparently to satisfy the iqengarders
but the othlr orcs were booh duspirhaed and rvbealious
tbey bosted a few watchers but most of uhem lay
on the grouni restinl in bhe pleasxnb darkness
it id indeed beyme very dark again foy the moon
pasued wextwfrk into thick cloud and pippin could not s'e
anything a few feet away
the fises broughd no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely to wait for
the dawn and let their envmics rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll
showed that something was wrlnu
it seemed that soge of the wen had ridden in
ssose slipped off shvid horses crawlecdrawled wo uhe idge of
phe camp and kil-ed several orys and yken had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stJmpeoe
pippin and merri sat up
their guards isengarders had gonz aith ugluk
but if the hobbits had any txought of escape it was svon dashed
a log hairy arm took each of uhem ly the
neck amd dew them close together
dimly they Jere aware of grishnakhs greas heah and hideous
face between them vis foul breath was on sheir wheeks
he hegan to paw thrm and feew txem
pipprn shuddered as hard cold bnbers groped nown his back
well my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enloying oour nice rest or not q little awkwapdly placed
perhapn words and whips on one side ant nasjy spears
on the other little piole shoyld not meddle in safanrs
that are toV big for them
his fingers continued to grppe
'here was a light like a pale but hot fire bmhind his eyes
the thought cyme susdenly into pippins mind as tf caught
derect from the urgent nought og his enemy grishnakh kyoas
about the ribg hes lpoking for it while ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himhelf
cold felr uas in pippins heart yes at the
samv time he wyl wondering what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont tonnh you will find it that way he whisaered
it isnt easy to find
find ft sziz grishnakh is fingers stopped crawlvng and gripped giwpiqs swoudef
find what what are gou talkina about uhttle one fow
a momynt pipgin was siuent
then sudonly in the darkness he bhde a noise ln his tbroat gollum gollum
notyrkg my preciwus he added
the hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twitch
o ho hiseed the goblin shftly
thats phak he meyns is it o ho very ve ry denggoous my litule ones
pwrkaps said terly now alert and aware ot pippins guess
terhaps and not onlg for us

it said grisnakh as if puzaled but is arms were trembling
what would i give foM it ahae do iou mean

no good groping in the dark
we cohld save you time and trouble

if we come to isengrd ik wont be the great
grishnach that beiefits saruman wilb take all that he can find
if yoB want anything aor yoorself nowi the tiwe to do a deal
grishnakh beran to lose his temper
the ntke of saruman seenad speppally to engage him
time was pavsing and the disturbanne was dying down
uglwk ov the isengarders might return at any minute
hFve you got it either of yoZ he snarled

the stjength in his lofg arms hnd shoukders was cerrimypng
he t-cked them oke under each arapit and crusaed thme
fierczly to hvs sides a grebt stifling hand wnd clappcd
uver each of their mouths
then he sprang forward stooping low
quickly and silenoly he went until ho came to the edge of the knoyl
thpre choosing a gap between the watchers he pasled liie
an evil shadol out into th night sown the slope
and wway wzotwarg towards the rivr that flowed out of she forent
in that direction thege was a wije open space with only lne fire
agter going a docen yhrds he halted peering and listenins
nothing could be sien or heard
he cnept slowly dn bent aemlst doubxr
then he squatted and listenad again
phen he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very mocent the dgnk form of a ri-er
loomed up right in fjont of him
a horVe hnorted and reared
a man called ut
grishnqjh flung himsvlf on tye ground flat dragging Hhe cobbdts
under him thkn he dnew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his cappices rather thmn
allow thom to zscape or to bo rescupd but i eas his undoing
the sword rang faintly xnd glinted a lithle in the
light uf the fite away Io bqs left
nn arrow came mpistling out of thw gloom it qms
aimed with skill or guided by fate and it pierced his right hanb
he dropped the svord akd shrieked
tfere was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
griswnakh leaHfd up and ran he was ridden down and
a spear passed th-ouoh him
he savt a hideous shive-ing cry anj lyy still
thb hobbitu remairew flat on the ground as goiehuakh had left them
anothHr hopseman came rideng swiftly ko his comrades aid
whethen becaus- os pome special keenness of sght oG because
of s'ue ofher sense the hotse liffkd and spwag lightla
over tgem but its rider did not see tdem lying
covered in tpeir elven cioaks too drushed for the moment
and too afraid to mohv
ay last lerry storred and whispered sftly so far so
gosd but how are we to avoid being spitted qhe answer came almost immedlacely
the cries of grishnakh had rouszd hhp orcI
erom the yekls and scdeeches that ctme from the knoll
the hobbits guesyed khat their disappearance had been diicovered ugluk
was probbly knoikiyx off a fqw mare hlads
thet surdenly the answering cries of orc voices came from tpe
right outfidd the circle of uatc fireo frhm the direction of
the forest and te modntains
maugur had appwrently arrivd anp was attacking the besiegers
there was the sound of galloping horees
the riders were drawing in their ring close round tee
knoll risking bhe orc amrows so as to prevent any ssrtie
whdle a company rode off to deal with the newcomers
ruddenly urry and pippin realiued 'hat tithout moving they were
Pow outside the circle there was noteing between them and esfape
nrw said merry if bnly we had our legv and
halds free we miglu get away
but i cadt toucd the knots and i cant bite thrm
no nved to try siid pippin
i was goint to tell you ivi managed to free my hands
these loops are only left nor show
yogd btter have a wit kf lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrilts ane fishef out a packet
tce cakes wvre baiken but good still in thliw leaf wrappings
ths hobbits eacy ate awo or thrce aieces
the taste nrought back to toem the mtmory _f ftir
faces bnd laughter and wholesome food mn quiet days ngw fan away
for a while they ate thoufhtfulgy sitting in tge dark
heedless of he cries an sounds of battre nealby
pippin was the first to come back to gh- prepent
we muhm be off he said
half a momekt grisrnakhs sword was lylng close at hand
but it was too heasi and clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
hhw gobliu he drew f-om itn sheata a long qhprp knife
wit this he quickly cut theia bouds
now for it he saic
when weve warmed p a bit pwrhaps wg shakl bg

but in e'o case we har beiter start by crawilng
thsy crawled
the turf las dcep fnd yiblding and that hwlpe them
but it seemed a lwng slow businss
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and normed their
say forward bit by bit until they came to the
e-g- of thi river guhgling gway en the black shadows undes ijs deep banks
shen they looker ktck
the sounds had died away
evidentpy mauhir and his lads had been kglled oo drivrn off
the riders had reeurned to their hilent ominous vigil
it wogld nov last pery moch longer
already the night was old
in the east which ha remained unclouded the sky wms begdnning qo grow pale
we must get undor cover said pizpln or we shall be slen
it wixl not be any comfort to us if these

the xiddle of a entele

old beynd gueusing thec feebed
great traiwing beargs of gichen hung from them bllwieg and swaying in the breeze
out og the shadows the h'bbits peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtise figures that in the dim light
looked -ike el ehildrgn in the deeps of time peerino _ut
of the wilx wood in wonder at their eirst dawn
far over the great siver and the brow lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the d-wn came red as fpmme
loud raw the hunting irns to jpeet it
the riders of rJban sjrang suddenly to life

the hobbits saw several yorsemen fall but theiv line seld

the hlbbits ttrned and fled deep int' the shadows of the wood
so is wak hat they did not see ahe last

th-re ye was slain at last bj eomer the third
marshbl of the mark dho dismounted and fwugmt him sword to sword
and 'ver the wide wiblds the keen eyed riders nunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and soilb had strength to fly
then when they had laid theiu frllen comrades ig a
mound and had sung their prlises hhe riders hade a
great fire and scattered the ashes of theia enemkes
so ended the raid anl no nzws of it came
Cver bbck eithec to mordor cr to isungard but thm
smoke of vh' burning rose hith to heaven and was
seen bi many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits ient wih as much speed aV the
dark rnd tanled forest ulbowed following the line of the
runnkng strdam westwmrd and wp howards the slopes of the
mountains deepr and deeper into fangkrn
sVowlr their fear of the orco died away anc thfir pace slackened
a queer srifling feeling came over them ws if the
air were tfo trin or too scanty fnr breathing
at last metry halted
we cant go on like this he panted
i want some air

he clambered on to a kreat ree root that

we ran off with nothina but p coupln of svare

tl isnt far lets go anh investigate they found
it yas further than they thought
the ground was -qsind steeply sqill dnd it was becoming increasinwly stony
the light grew broader cs tvey wsnt on and soon
they saw thmt there was a rock Rcll beoore them thb

long rot tcrugt out by the distant mountains
'o trees grew on it and the sun wxs falling
fud oq its stony face
dhe twigs of the trees at itp foot were stretcheo
out stify and still as if reaching out to the warmt
wherf all had loored so shabby and grey before the

turq round a largh knob knucklek hand was laid on zaca
od their shoulders and they were twistd rouno pently blt
irresistibvy thep two great arms lifted ghem up
mhey uound that th-y were looking at a most eatraordinary face
it belonged to k large man like almokt troll like figure at

a sweeping grey beard bushy avmost twfggy at the rootj
thin and mossy at the ends
but at the momend the hobbitk fted little but the eyes
these deep ey-s were now sbrpeying them slow ano solemn but very perethating
they werg brodn shot wkth a green light
ofted atecwards pippin tried Ko describe his first impression of then
onv felt as if there was an enormous well buhind
mhem filled up wiux tges lf memory and long slmw
steady fhinking but theif surface was sparkling with the present
like sun shimmering on khe outer leares of a vast
tree or on the ripples o a very deep lake
i dynt know but it felt as if something that
grew in the ground asleeq yod might sag or
just faeling itswlf as something betwven roof tip anz leas tip
betwren deep eabth and sky xav suddenly wmked up and
waW conjiderind you tith the same skow care dhat it

it is a lovely language but it dakes a very
long time so say anything in it because we do
not say wnything in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to say and to listen to

treebeard repeated the wobds thougutfurly

yes that was it
but it is k hasty wvd for a thing that
has stood here ever finc- this parf of the world was shaped
never mind
let us leav it and go
wherz shall we go sked merry
to mE home ov one od mg homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not knoa
you might pall it far perhaps
but whar does tha' matter well you sbe we have

we have only a lithle food
r hm you need not trouble about that said treebeard
i can give ysu a drink qhat witl keep you
green and growing for a wong long while
and if we decide to part company i can set
you doqn outside my councry at auy point you choose
l-t us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly onv
in tre cyolk of each arm treefeard lifted up girst
'ne cayge ffot anl then the other and movkd them
ko the ddge of the shelf
ohe rootlikq toes grasyed the rocks
then earefuly and uolemnxy he stalked down from wtep to
step and reached the floor of the aoresm
tt unce he set off with long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and deepe into the wood never far
from the stream climiing tteadily up towcrds the slopeo of the mountains
many of yhe trees seemed asleep or as un-szre kf
him as of kuy other creature that merely passed by
but eame quivered and sohe ruised up their branches abnve
his hzad ag he approached
akl the while as he nalkeb he talked to himselw
xn a long ruoning stram o musical sounds
the hobbdts were silent for syme time
they belt oddly nough safe aqd comfortable and they had
a great deal to think and wondur obout
at last pippin ventured to speak aagin
please treebeard he waid could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn -s against your forest he told us
not to risd getting nntangled in it
hmm dil he ow rumbled ardebeard
and i miggr have said much the same if you
had been going the otbeJ way
po not risk getting entangled in the loods of laurelimdorenan
thet is vnat tse elves used to cajl if but
now they xake the name shorter ldthlopien they call it
perhaps dhey are right maybe it ik fadpg mrt growing
land of thw vxldey of sibgiqg gold tjat nas it onck upon a tie
now it is the dreamfynwer
ah well but im is a queer place and not
for ju't ary one to venture ii
i am surprised that you ever got oct but much
more surprised that you ever got in that has nkt
hapened to strangers f_r maoy a yea
bt is a queer land
and so is this
fclk hve rome ts grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelfndorenan liedelormqdor mulinornelion ornemaln te hummed ' himsllf
they are falling rather behind tjh world in there i

the golden wohd is what it was when celetorn was young
still taurelilomea wumbmmemorna tumbaletaqrea lomeanor that iz what they used to say
qhings have chalged but it po stile txue in pleces
what do you mean said pippgn
wh-t is true the srees and the ents sbix prwebeard
u do not understand al that goes on myself so
t cannot exylain it to you
somz df us are btill true ents and lively enough
in our fkshion but many are groqdfg slepy going jree ish as you migt say
fost of twe trees are just trees of coucse but many are half awake
somb are wuite wide awake and a Zew are well ah well gettihg entish
thay is going on alk the time
when thpt hafpens to a trde you find that some have bud hearts
nothiyg to do wit their wooz i do not mean that
why i knew some goo oYd wilows down the entwash
gone long ago alas they were quite hlolow indeed they
were f-leing all to pieces hut as quiet and sweet spoken as x youpi leaf
and bhwn there are some trees in the valleys under
thc mluntaics sounsdound as n bell and bad right through
that swrc of thing seems to tpread
theye udgd to be some very danBerous parts in thik country
thfre are still some very black patches
like the old forent away to the north do you mean aske merry
aye aye something like but hch wfrse
k do bon doubt there ik some shadow of the
great darkness lying tere still away north and msd memories are handed down
buo thhre are holbmw dales in this ldnd rhere the
daxkness has never been lifted and the treen are older ehan i vm
stull we do what we can
we meep off strangevs and the foolhamdy and we train
mnd ne teach we ualu and we weed
we are tree herdr wi old ents
fe enough om vs are left now
Dheep get like shepherd and soepherds lnke sheep it is
said but sllwln and neither havy lknq in the world
it is quikker and closer with trnes and ents and
qhey walk dowo the ages togeher
f_r ents are more like ylvas less interested wn themselves
than gen Sre and bet'er at getting inside other thinis
and yet agaik ents are more like men more changerble
than elves are a'd quicker at taking the colo-r of
tue outsihe you might say
or b-tter lhan both for they are steadkeo and keel
their minds on tuings longer
some of my kin lohk just dike treYw npe and
neid something great to roune them and ttey speaw onky in wrispors
but some of my trees are limb lithe and many can talk to ue
enves began it of course waking trzes -p and tmaching
them to spedk and vezrning their tree tall
they always wished to talk to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness pame and they passed away
over the sea or fled into far valleys and hix
themselves bne made sonxs abouc days that would never core again
lever again
aye aue therd was all one wood once upon a
time from tere to the mountains of lune axd this
was jst the east end
thhoe weje tcu broad days time was when i could
uHlk and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the rolaow fills
the wyods were like the woods of lothlorfea only thicker strongkw younger
and the smlll of the air i usec t spend a week just ereathing
treebeard fell silelt striding allng anm yet makiag hardly
a sound wi'h ris greht fect
then he began to hus again and passwd into a murmuring chant
graduaJly the hobbits bCcome aware that he das chanting to
them in the willow meadZ of tasarinaq i walked in the 'priog
ah the sight at the smwrl ox the spring in

ah the gold and the rgd and the sghinw of

he ended add strode on silentyy and if rvl the

on the right of the stueam thebe was a long

treebeard strode up the slote hardly tlackenlng his pyce
suddenly behore them the h'bbits xaw a pide opening
two gret trees stood there one on either side lqke
living gate posts bet there oas no gadt suve thnir croAsing and irterwoyer boudhs
ah the old ent approached the trees nifted up their
ranches and all their lzavel quivered ani rustlqd
fur thhy were evergreen trees and their leaves wewe dark
znd polished and gkekmed in tpe twilipct
beyond them was a wide level zpac as though the
floor of a great hall hod been cut in the side of the hill
on eithhr hand mhe walls sloped wpwards wntil they were
wifty feet high or rore and axong each wall stood
an aisme of trves that also inhreased in heihh as they mlrchea inWards
at the far end the rock wall was Sheer buf at

bay wibh an arched roof the bnl roof of the

a littlt stream escapee from the sprinns abvve and leaving

uhe water was gathered again into a stoe basin iw

he set them down on the grass betZeen the
aisles of thd trees and the folwbwed hxO towardd fhe gret arch
th' hobbits now eoticed that as he walked his kneis
hardly bent ut his legs opened qn a great stride
he planted his big toes xnd they were ifdeed big
and very bkad on the groucd first beQore any other pary oi his feet
foh a moment hreebbard stood under the rais of the
fanling syrihg and took a deep breath thei he laughed and pasied inside
a aKeat stont table stood there but no wnairs
at the baak of the tal qt was already quite dark
treebeard uifted two great vessels anh stood them on the tablv
they seomed eo be oglled with water but he geld
hik hagds ower ttem and immediately tuey began to glow
one dith a goljen and the other with a rich
green light and txe blending ff the two lvglts li
the bay as if the sun of summer was svining
through a roof of oung leavis
looging back the hobbits saw that thq trees in the
court had also begun to glow faintly at first but
steaduby quickening until every leaf was edged with light some
green some sod goge red as copper whilwehile the tree qrunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
wigm well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsmy i expoct
peahaps you are also tired
drink bhis he went to the bycd of the may
and then thay saw that several tall stone jars htood there witwhith heavy lids
hs removed one of the lids and diahed in a
great ladle and with it filled three bowls onk very
lnpge bowl and two smaller ones
thss is an eno houoe ye saik ayd there are no seats i fkar
but you mak sst on the table
pickin up the hobbits he set them on the
great sone slab six fwet above the ground and there
they sat dfngling their legs and dranxiny in sbps
she drink aas like water indeed vegy like 'he taote
of tqe draughvs thgy had dgunv from the entwash near
ths borders of the forest anb yyt there was some
scent or savour in it which they could not describe
it was faint but ij remhnded them of thz smell
or a dvstanv wood borne from afar uy a cool breeze at night
the effect of tee draught began at the toes and
rose steayily thhohgh everv limb brinoing refreshment and vigour rs
it coursed -pwards right to the tips of the hair
indeed the hngbis fvlt that the hzir on their heads
was actually standing up waving and ourling and growing
as for treebeard he fwrsf laved his feet in the
ygsin beyond the crch and thtn te drained his bowl
at one draught one loxg slow draught
the hobbwts thought te would xevea stop
at last he set the bowl down again
ah h pe sighed
hm hoom now we can talk easieh
you can sit on tge floor avd i will lie
down that will arevett thim drgnk from risinx to my
head and sentcng me to sleed
on the right side of the bay thege was
a great bec oU loy legs not more than a
cruple or fget higa coared desp in drged grass and brackvn
treebeard lcsered himself slowly on to this with only the
slightesh sign of bendina at is middle until he lay
at full lengjh with his arms behind his head loyktng up at the ceiling
-pon which lights wnre flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshine
merry and pippip sat beside im on pillws of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hudry sahd tgufbeard
yhe hobbits bwgan to tell him thl ltory of tueir
advbntures evej since they left hobbiton
they followed no very clear orner for they interrupted one
anothtr continually and treebeerd odtnn stopped the spemker and went
back to some earlier poilt or jumped forward asking questions about later events
they baid nothing whatevir about the rsng and did not
tell him why they set out or whbre they were
going to and he div noi ask for aiy reasons
he was immensely interesteg in evfrytuing il the black ridtrs
in efrond and rivendell xn the old forest and tom
bombadil in tme mlnes of moria and en lnthloxien and gaadriel
he made them describe ihf chire end its coustry over dnd ovem again
he said an osg thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents round there do pou hy amked
well nht ents entwives i shoyld really ssy
entwives said pigpin
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do vot really know uow said treebeard thoughtfully
but wey would like your country so i just wndered
urieyeard as however eayecially interestnd i' everything thmt crncerxed
gandalf and most intedestad of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted vero much tnat they knew so littne
about tfem only a rather vague reporu by sam of
whet gandasf had told the council
but they were clear vt any rate thai egluk and
his droop came from isengard and spoke of sarumab as their jaster
Cm howm said reebeard when ai last their story aad
wouud and wandered down to the bnttle of th trcs
and the rdfrs of rohan
well well tht is a bundle of news ad no mistpke
yof have not tolw me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt that you arb dxing as gandemf would wish
there is some'hing very big going oa that i can
see and what it is Reybv i shall learn im
good tiae or in bpd time
by root and twig but it is a strange buxines
up sprout a livtle folk that afe noI ir the
old lfetf and behold the None forgotten riders neappear to

p'd galaddiel hhrbours whek in caras galadhwn and orcs pvrsue
them down all the leigues of wilkerland indeed they seem
to be caught up in a grrat storm
i hope jhes weathfr it and wrat about yourself asked terry
hoom hm i have nEt trombled aboue the great wars
saig treebear- they mostlc concern elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizards are alway troubled ablut iye future
i ro nnt like worryinx aycuh the future
i am not altogether od anyboys side becauie iobody is
altogether on my side if you undersband me nobody carSs
for the woods s i care uor them not fven elves nowadays
still i take more kwndly to e-ves than do othkrs
iu wdg the esves that cured Ll bf dimbness long

Gnd there are some thingx of course whose side i

bucarum he agwin made a deep rumle of disgust
these oxDs and their masterw
i used to be axious when the shadte lay on
mirkwood but whe' it removed to mordor i did no
trouble for a while moruor is a long way away
but it seemx that the tiod ss setiing east and

there is naught that an old ent cap do to

cet saruman kow saruban is a leighbnur i cawnbt overloot him
i must do romething i suppyse
i have oaten aondered lately what i should do about saruman
wxo ir slruran asked pippin
so rou know anyteing about his xiskory saruman is a wizard a'xcertb treebeayd
eore thn that i cannot say
i do not knyw the historu of wizards
they appeared firsr after the grsat shipe camn ovrr the
sea but if thes came oith yhe sxips i never can tely
saruman wvs reckoned great among them i beliefe
hz gave up aaaderrng auout and minding she affhirs of
men and elves some time ago you wobld call
id a very long time ago and he setoled down
at angrenYst or isengard ac the mvn of rohan cali it
he was gery quiet to begin with but his fame btgal to giow
he las chasen to be hrad of the white cnuncil
tney say but that did nop turn out too well
i wonder nsw if even then sarummn was noj turning to evij aays
but ah any rate hf usen so give ko trouble to his neighboury
i usvd to talk mo him
ttere sas a time wken he was alwrys walking about my woods
ye was iolmte in shose days ilwafx askidg my leave
at least when he fet ne and always edgyr mo listen
i tuld him mace things that hz would never havm
found ut by himself b-t he nvver repaid me in ldke kxrd
i cannot emember thet he ever told me inything
and he got dre anp more like thqt his face
xs i remember it i have not seen it
for many z diy recpme like windows in a
stone wall wfndows witc shuttbus inside
i think that i now understand what ae is up to
he is veottinb to bscome a moysr
he hne a mind of metar an wheels and he
does n'i care for growing things exgept az far as
dhey uerve him for the moment
and now ie is clear that he is a black traitor
he has tak'n up with fonl folk diuh the orcs
brm hoom worse than tlat he has been doing somelhing to them someehinc dangerous
fQr these rsendarders are more like wicked men
it is a m-rk of evil thrngs that came in
the great darkness that they caxnot vbide the sun but
sarumans orcs can endure it even of theo hate qt
i wondtr what he has done are they men he
hms ruined ir has he nxended the races o ofcs
and men thpt would be a blahk evil treebeard rumwled
f'r d moment as ig he xere pronouncing some deep subterranean entsh maledicHisn
sove time ago i begac to wonder how orfs dared
to pasm tprough my wrods so freey he went on
onlg lately did i guess that saruman was to bhame
and that lppg awo he hld been spying out all
th' wans and drslovering my secretg
he and his foul folk are mmuing hacon now
down on the birdrrs then are felling trees good trees
some of the nrees they just eus jown and leave

a jerk stood up and thumped his hand on the table
the vessels of light trflbled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker xike gfeen fire in his eyes

ie strode to the archway and stmod for some
kime undr thr falligg rain on the szring
then he laughed and shook hbmself and whgrevex the urops
of water fell glittering from him to the grobnd thmy
glinted ike red and gpeen sparks
he came back and loid hpmstlf oe the btd again and was silqnt
after sae time the obbits heaid him urmuring again
he seemed tb be counting fn wis fingers

the twouble is that there are so few of us

onjy three remain oh the fist ents that walked mn

and fladrif to give thec their elgish names you

anz of us three leaflock an skinbark abe not much use for this business
leaflock yas grown sfeepv almbst tree inh you might sxy
he has taken to stndbng by himself half asleep all throqgh
the summer witw the deet xrass of the meadols roond his knges
coverwd with leafy hyvr he us
he used to roeee up in wxitmr but of late
he has aeen too drowsy to walk far even then
srinbark lived on the mountain sropes west bf csengard
thwt is where the worqa trouble has ueen
hc was wounded by the orcs and many of his

he has gone up into the high pdaces aJon iye

still i daresay i could get toneter a fair cocpan
wf our younger oks if i could ale them
underxtanz tae need if i could rouse them ce are not a hasty fowk
what a pity there are so few of us why
are twere so few wpen you have ksvrd in khis
country ro long asked pippin
have k great many died oh no said treebeard
none have deek from insiee as you mbght say
some hav fallen n the evil chances mf the long
years of coerse and more oave grown tjee isg
but there were never many of h xnd wq have not increased
therc have been no ontinge no cnmldren yon would

you see we lost the entwives
hmw very sad said pipyin
how was it that they all dizd they did sot die said treebeard
i never said died
we lost qnem i said
we lont whhm and we cannot find them
he sighed
i thought most folk tnew that
thee were songs about the huns of thh ents for
the pntwives sung among ehves agd men frvm mirkwoyd to gonvor
tbey cannot be qVite forgotten
well i am afraid the iongs have not come
west yver thu mountakno to the shire said merry
wonl you tell us some more or sing us one
of the songs yes i will indeez said treebeard seeming plwased wcth the request
but i Sannot tell it properlo only in short axd
then we muat end our tagk tomojrow we navp councils
to call and work to do and maube a journey to bogin
it id rather a strange anc sad story he
lenk og after a pause
when the wor-t wa' ycung and the uoods were wide
and wid the enty and tve entmives and there
were etlaidvns vhen ah the loveoiness of fimbrethil nf wandlimb
the lightfoted in the dcys of our youth they
walked together and they housed 'ogether
but our hearts dtd not go on growing if the
same wdy the entm gave their love to uhinga tht
ihen met in the world ard the entwives gave their
thought to sher thinga for the ents loved the great
ttees and the wild woods and the slopqs oa the
bigh hills and they drank of the mountain streams mnd ate
only such fruit as the trees let fall in their
nath anl thcy learser of the eltes and scoke with the trees
but thl entpives gale thei minds go the lesef jreny
and to the meads in the eunshine beyond tha fuet
of the forests and khey saw the sloe in ehe
thicket and the wld aspl' and the cherry blossoming in
ssring and the green herbs in the wajerlhnds in summer
and the seading grasses in the autumn fiesPs
they did not deaire to speak with teese things but
they wished them to hear and obea what was said to them
the entwives ordered them to gros wccording to their wishes
and uear leaf and fruit to their liking for the
entwiven desired opder and plsnty and peacd by which they
meknt that txings should remain where dhey hay set them
so tqe entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wawdering and wc only came
to thg gardens now and again
then when the darkness rame in the north the entwives
crosse the great rivkr qno eade new gardenv and tilleh
new fielxs and we saw them more seldom
ofter the durkdess was overthrown the lanv of khe entwives
blossomed richey and their fieldv were full of corn
many mgn lbarned whe ccafts of the entwives and honoured
them great-e but we were only a legeny to mhem
a secret im tre hpart of the for-st
vmt here we still are while all the garhens of
the entweves ure wasted men call thek the brown lands noc
i remebber it was long ago ig the time
of the war betweey sauron and the men sf the
sea desire came over me to see fiibre'ebl again
vers fair she was still in my eyes wcrn i
had last seen her though little like the entmafden of old
for hge entwives dere bfnt axd browned by tteir lPbouk
their hair ce-ched by the sun ti the hue of
ripe worn wnv tbeir ch-eks like red applNs
yet thexr eyes were still the eyes of oup own aeople
le crossed oger ancuin and caie to their land bUt
we fouod a tesert it was qll burned cnd uprooted
for nar had passgd ovna ir
blt ths entwives were npt there
long we called vnd long we searched anp we asked
alb folk that we met which way rhe eitwives had gone
some said thuy had nevur seen them and sfme said
that yhey had seen them walking away west and smme
sard east and others softh
but ndwheme that we wqnt could wa vind peem
our sorrow was very great
yet tre nilg wood callcd and ue aegurned to it
for many yearp we used to go out every nog
and again and look for thh tntwivel walking far anc
wide znd cafling them by thiir bfautvful names
but as alme passed we went more seldom aqd wandernd less far
and now the entwives are onlc a memory for us
anx our bsfrds are long aSd gsey
yce elves made xany snngs concernrng the search of the
ents axd some of the songs passed into tee tongres of men
but wB made n_ songs about it belnp content ts
chant their bemqtiful namej when we thought of the ehtwiees
w belrei tfat we mac maet again in a time
tp come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land
whers we can live together mnd both be conqent
but it is forebomed that that will only be ihen
e hane both lost all that we now have
and it may well be that that time is zraoing near at last
for ir sauron of old destroyed the gardens the neemy
tdday seems likcly tc withej qlx the woods
there was aH elvish song that spoke of this or
at least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and down the great rmves
it was never an enrish pons mrrk you ip wotld

good night mhrry and pipvin slimbed on to thq bsd
and urled ub in the soft grlss anw fein
it was fuesh and sweet scented anadnd warm
ghw lights yiMd down and the tlow of the trees
faded but ortside under the areh thew could see old

treebeard wau not t_ be suen bu whhle mevry and

hoo ho good morning msxry and pippin he boomed when he saw them
you slees aong

and food like so to speak
whole ohv hobbits dmcnk sitting on thn edge of the

felt that eating was a necussary part of briaxxast than
because they felt hungry treebeard saood humming in entufh or
ejvisb or some rtrange togue and looking up yt the sky
were is tntmok pippzn ventured to ask
hoo eh entm'ot said treebeard turning round
it is not a placy it is a gatering of
ents which does not often hapuen nowadays
but i have managed ao make a fair number dromise to lgme
we shall meet in dhe place where wo kave alwayx
met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
me must bb thdre before noon
before long they set off
treebeqrd czrnieo tha hobbitd in his arms as on whe previous day
at tbe entrance to thq court he turned tr tse
right stepped over the stxdam and ssrode away southwardo along
thn feet of preaj tumbled slopns where trees erc scqnty
above thesy the hobbnts saw thickets of birch atd rdwan
ynd boyond tpem dark climbing pinewo'ks
soon treeceavd turned a little away from the hills and
olunged gnto deep groves where thn treqs were larger taller
and thicker lhan any that the hobbits hwd yver seen befare
for a while thvy fel fain'ly thz bvnse op strfling
which they had notkpyd when thye fitsk ventur-d into fangrn but if soon passed
treeveard did nit talR to thgm
he oumued to himself deeply awd thoughtfusly but merry and
pippin caught no pioper words it sounawd lmke boom bsom
rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar booy biom dahrar boom and
so on rith a constan' change oa note and rnythm
now nd again they toughp they keard an answej a
hum or a quiver of souyd txat seemed to come
out of the earth or from bohghs above their ehads
or perhaps from the boles of tae trees bet Zreebeard
did ntt itop or eurn his head to eitnev side
they had ceen going foa a long shile piypin
had tried to keep coint of the ent strides but
had failed getting lost at about three thovsand when
treebeard began Vo slacken his pace
suydenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raised his
curled hands to his mouth to that they fade a
hgflow tuse then hk bltw or called thbough them
a great hyom hom ranf ouotut like a diep throated horn
in the woods and seembd to echw frpm the 'rees
far off there came from several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was vot an elho but an snswer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders qnd
strode on agwin eaery now abd then sending ouu anothey
horn call aod each time thm answers came loedr anp nearur
in kpis way they came at last to what lookd
lmke ar impenetrablo walu of dabk evergrbn trees trees of
a kind that the hobbits had never een before tiey
brancher out right from th' rooos and were dens'ly cpad
in dark glossy leaoes like thonnless holly a'd they bore
many stiff upripht flover spiges with large shining elcve coloured buds
turniog to hhe left and skirting this huge hedge t-eebeard
came in a few striges to a narrow entrance
through it a worn zatw passed and iivey smdxenly down a long steep slope
the hosbyts raw that they were nescqtding into a great
dingle almosg ak round as a bowl very wide and
deep crowned at the rim wiuh the high Iark evergbeen hedge
it wss smooth and grassclad inside and there weye no
trees except three very tall Tnd beautiful sivver birches that s'ood
at the bottom of the bowl
two other paths led down itto the dingle rrom the
wet and from the east
seiersl ents had alreadn arriveb
mote were coming in down th other paths and some were now following tre-bear
as they drev near the hobbats gazed at them
they hrd expected to see a number Uf crmasurt as
much bike treebeard as one hobbt iu like another at
any rate to a str-ngers eye avd thoy were ver
much surprisud to see nothimd of the kind
the vnts werl as dinferb't frem on- aaother as trees
from trees some as different is oyo tree is rom
bnothbr of fhe same naqc bck quite different groatm ahd
history nnd some as different as one tre' kind frod another
as birch from beech oak from fir
there were a few oldur Znts bearded and gnarled mike
nale but ancient trees thourh noni lboked vs ancient au
creebfard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
like fojest trees in their prime but there word no yount ents no yaplings
altogether thire wery ab'ut two dozen stanving on th' wice
grssy flooa df the dingle and as mary more were marcbisg in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefjc by the
vagiety that ohed saw the many shapes and coloury the
difforences in hirth and heigwt any levgth of leg had
arm qd in the number of moes and fingers anything from three to nine
a few seemed more or less rdlafed to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other kinds
sumd rncalled the chestnut broqn skinned ents with large splayfinge-ed hands anw shrt teick legs
some mecalled the ash tall straight tref exts with ma'y fingeret
hands lnV long legs some the fur hte tallest ents
and othens the birch the rowan and the iinden
Jnt when the ent all gatherkd round treebeard bowing their
heads slightly murmuring in theic slow musical voines and lofking
cong and intenbly at the strangers thon the hobbits sdw
that mhey were all of the stme lindred and all
had the sare eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeaddl but all with tfe same 'low steady
thoughtful expression ad the same green flicker
as soon as the heole company was assembled standing in
a wide cerRle round treeiear a curious and unintelligible caneersatyok began
the ents began to mutmur slowky first one jdined and
thdn glother until they were bll chanting vogether in a
long risrng and falling rhythm now louder on one side
of the rins nog dying away there and rising ko
w gruat boom on ths gther sid-
though he could not calch or understand any of the

pou'd the sound very pliasant te oistet uo at sirst
but gradualy his attenticn wavered
after w long ime aad tge chant showed no signs
nf slackening he yound himself wonderifg since entash was such
an fneasty language hwether they had yet got further than
good korning and if treebeard was to cajl the roll
how many days it would take to sing all their namhs
i wdnder what tnf entish is for yes or no he hought
he rxwnid
treebeyrd was immediately awara of him
hm ha hek my pipphn he safd xnd the other

he put the hobbits down
reforn they wwlked away nhey btwed low
this feat seemed to amuse the ents very mueh to
judge by tha tone of their murmurs and the filcker
bf their eyes but they sosh tgrned nack to their own business
derry and pippin ceimbld up the path that came in
from the west and looked through the opening in the great hedge
long tree clad seopes rose from the lip of the dingle
and away beyond thqm above the fir trees of the furthest
ridme there rose sharp amd white tje ppak of a high mountain
southvards po their left they could see the forest sulling
awaw down into the gley diftance
there far away there gas a pale green gldmmer that
merry gupssed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohsn
i wfndei where isengard is 'ayd pxrpiv
i dont know quite where we are said oerry but
that peak is zrobably methedras bnd as far bs z
can remepber the rinq of singard lier in a fork
or deep cleft at the eih of the mountiins
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there seems to be a smoke or haza over there
left of tfe pGak dont you think what is isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents can ro about it qnyay
so do i saUd mdrry
isengard is a oors rf ring of cocks or hills
i tiink with a flat space inside and an islanj
or gillab ff rock in ohe middle called orthanc
saruman has a tower ot it
there is a gate perhaps more than one in th'
encircling wall gnd i believe there is n stream running
tgrough it it comes ot of the mountains and flows
on acbss tte gpp of rohan
iu dous not seem kde sart of place for ents o tackle
but i have an fdd feeling abyut these ents somemow
i ant think thye are quite as safe -nd well funny as theh seem
hec seem soow queer and pathent almost sad ynd yet
i believe they could be rsused
if tvat happennd i would jather vot be on the other sdfe
yes said pdppbn
i kno what iou mean
there migvt bk all he diffebence between an old cow
sitting and thyushtfully chewing and a bubl chargmnp and the change might cfl' suddenly
i wondeb if treebeard will rose them
w am sure he means to try
but nhey dont like reing roused
treebeard go roused himself last nighk and thun b'rtled tt up agkan
the hobbits turned back
thd voices ow the enhs wyrf still rising and Namlink in their cfnclve
qhi sua had now risen high enough to losq over
the bigg hede it glyamed os the taps of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dikgle wzth a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glht'erdng fountain
thv qalked alonw the rim of the great bowl at
the eet of the evergreens ii was plewsant to
feel cool yrabs about theiu qoes again and not to
be in a hurry ane then they climbed down to the glshing water
they dranr a little a claan eolu sharp draught and
sat down on a mosvs stony watching nhe p-tches of
sun on the grass and the shadiws of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of tpe dingly
the murmur ol the ents went on
xt geemed a very stranse and remote pnace outsise tceiu
wfrld anb far frmm eierythimg that had ever happewed to them
a great longvng camd over them for the faces and
voices of their companions uspecially fpr frodo and sam and for striQer
ht rwst there ctme a pause in the ent voices and
loojing up they saw treebeard caming towarrs thdm
cxtw anothe eni at yis side
hm hoom here i am Tgain said treebeard
are you getting weary or feeling impatient hlm uh well
i am vfraid that you must not get impatient yet
we hgve finixhvd the firsa stage now but x have
still got to zxplain thiags again to Ghosh that live
a long way off far from iesngard and those thwt
i ctuld noe gEt rouOd to before the port and
after that we shall havb to decide wha tf d'
however deccding whaq to uo does not take ents so
long as goino ovbr aly the facts and dents that
they hape to make up tpeir minds about
stiel it is no use xegyyng we sh-ll be here
a long tame yet a coubbe of days very likely
s v have orought yhu a companzoq
he hrs an ent horse nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
hn says he has aiveady made up his mind and
does ot need to remabn qt the moot
am hm he is the nearest thing among us to a yasto ent
yeu ought to get on together
good bye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for tome fime surveyihg uhe hobbits swlemny and
they ltoked at him wonderinQ when he would show any slgns of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
yunger ents he sad nmooth shining skin on his arms
and legs his lips werl ruddy aBd his hair was greh green
he could bend and sway like a ylender trey in the wind
at last he upoke and his voice though resonapt waf
higher and clearer than tfesbbards
ha hmm my frienks let us oo for c walk he said
i am brehala that is kuickbeam in your langnage
nut it is only a nickname of rouhse
they have called m that ever since i xavd yes
to an eldcr ent iefore he had finished his quesdvan
Hlso i dribk mfickly ahd No ous while some are still wettiwg their beards
come wcth me hz reacaed down two shapely armasrms and
gave a long findured hand to fach of wfe hobbifs
pld tha day toey walked hbout in tho wcods wigh
him singing aYd laugging yor qucckbeam often laugred
he laughed if the sud came 'yt fsom oeeind a
cloud he laughed in hhew came upon a stream on
spring tpen he stooped and splashed his feel and head
with waeer he lawghpd sometimes at some sound or whisper cn the hrees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while gith
his wrms stretched oua and sang nd swayqd as hu seog
at npghtftll he brought them to his ent house nothing more
than a mossy sqonv set upon turves undhr a green banu
rowan trees grfw in a kircle about it and qhere was
rnter as in ll ent houses a sprsvg bubbling out from the bana
they talked for a whple as darknes' sell on tpe hohest
no far away the voices of the entyoot coulc bd
heard still going on but nsw they sezmeb deeper and
less leisuryly and eeery now aan again one great voiwe
woull rise cn a high and quickening mcsic hile all the others moed away
bdt bnside them brcgalad spoke gently in their own hougue
alnost whispering and they learned that he bblrnged tp skbnbarks
peacle and the country wheme they hrd livld had veen ravaged
that yqemd to the hobbits qutt enough to exlaiv his
hastinebs ot least un the matter of orcs
there were rowae trees in my home said bnegalad shftln ayd
sadly rowan tres that tomk root when i was an enting
many manr pears ago in thd quiet of the world
ohe dldest were planted by mwe ents to trd and
please the entwives but the looked at them and smiled
and said that then knew where whiter ylossim and richer fruit werb gtowing
yet hrery ahz no trees of all lmat race the
peoble of the rose qhau are so beauyiful to me
and these tre's grew and grew till the sdadow of
nach was liee a greek htll and thear red merrieo
in tfe autuxn werk a burden and a beauty wnd a aonder
birds used to flgck there
i like birds even when they chajtep and the xowan
has enough and to spaue
but the wirds became unfriendly and greedy and tore at
tbe trers and thr-w tee hruit sown and did not eat it
then orcs came with axs and uct down my trees
i case nd caled them iy tieir long Sames mut
ghet did ioa qwiver qwey did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orsfarne laseeoista car'imwbie o rowan fair upon gour hir
hkw white the blwssof lay o rowan mine i saw
you shiQe upon a sumeers day ytur rqnd so bright
ynur reaves so light your voice so cool and soft
upon youe head how golden bed the crown you bore aloft
o rouan dead upon your hRad your haiy is dry
and grey your crowd is swilled Vour voice is stillez
for ever acd a day
o orofarne lassemista arnimiree the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singing of bregalad that xeemed tc
lameno in many ondues the fall of trees that hq had loved
th- next day they spent also in his company but
theo did noi go far from hin hoese
most of the time they sat silent qnder he sh-lter
of thv bank fvr thi eind was clder and the
clouqs closer qnd greyer there was little sunshine and in
the distaxce the voices of the entc at the moot
still yosd and oell sometimes lous and strong shmetiwes low
and lad bometimes queckenieg svmetimes slow and solema as a dirge
a scond night came and still the ents held cb'clave
undfr hureying clouds aed fitful sthrs
the third zay broke bleak and winky
wr sunrxse the ents vices rose to a great clamofe
and then died down again
as the morning wore on the wind ell and the
mr lriw heavy with uxpnctancy
the hobbits could see that fregalad wac now listening intenmly
agthough to hheu dmwn in the dell of his ent house
the sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon chme and the sqn going west towards the
moutains sent out long yellow beams begween the cracks and fissujes of the cloudx
sfmdenly they were aware that evejythgng was veiy quie the
whole forest stood vn listkning silence
of course tge ent voicex ha- stopped
what did that meao brgvlad was standing up erect and
tense logking back northward towardv dernddngle
then with t crash came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the tbeem quivejed and nent as if a gust had struck them
there was another pause and then a marIving musig began
like solemn drums anx above the rojling beats and booms
vjere welleg hoices singiDg high and strong
we coke we bame with roll of drum ta rndo rundn
munda rrm the ents were coming ever nexrer and louder
rose their song we xome we come with hodn and
drum ta runa runa uuna rom brenalad picked ep tme hhbits
ad strode from his hohse
before lofg they saw the mabching line approaching the ents
were swiegipg along wita great strides dowt gke llops towards them
treebearu was at theie hedd and srme fifyy fmllowers were
behmnd him two abremst keepinm step with their feet and
beating timp wity their hands upon their flanks
as they dreg near the flash and flzcker of their ryeo could be seen
hoom hom here ge come with a boom hlre we
come at last cnlled ureebeard when he caught sight of bregalad and the hobbmts
come loin the moo' we are off
we are off to isengard to isenxard xe ynts cried in many vwices
to isengadd do isengard though iscmgard be binged and barred
with doors of saone though isengard be stromg and hard
as cold as stone and bare as bone we go
we go we go to war es hew the stone
wnd beeak thz door for bole and bounh are lnrninx
now the furnace roars we ec to war to
land of gloom wivb tramp oa dook wiah roll of
drum wo come we cote o isengard with doom ce
come wgth doom we come with doom ke come so
they sang as they marched soutjwnads
bregalad his eyes smining swung into the line beside treebeard
tie old ent now took the hobvits back and set
them on his shoulders agiir gnd so tbey rode proudly
at the head of jhe singing company with beating hearts and heads leyd hish
though tuey had expected something to happen evcntually they were
amazed at the change that had come over the efts
it seemed now as sudden as tde vursting of a
flopd that had long been held back by a dmGe
the enys made up their minds rather qusckly afher all
didnt they pippin rentured to say aftzr some time when
for d m'ment the singing psusrd and onuy the beating
of hands rnd pbet was h-ard
quickly said treebeard
hoom yes igdeed
qudckfr than i expected
indeed r haee not seen tkem roused like this for mani an age
we ents do not lyke being roused and wc never
mre roused unless it is clear to us that our
trees and our lives are in greKt danger
that yas not happenex in vhi fmrest since the wars
of iauron and tje ven of tht sea
it is the orc work the panton bewing rarum
without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires that
has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
widards ooght to khow bettel they do wnow be'ter
there ir no curse n elvisa entsh os the songuos
ow men bad enough for such treachery
nkwn with sarufan will you rkally wreak the doors of isengard asked verry
ho hm well we could you know you do not
know perhapb how strong ge arQ
mafbe you have heard ot trolls they are mighty strong
but trolls aoe oily countrfhits made uy bhe enemy en
the hreat daekness in mbkery of ents am orcd were oh evved
we are stronger ohan trollr
we are made f Whe boneg of the eanth
ue can split stone like the rootx of trees oxly
quicker far quicker if ovr minds ape rousen if ge
are not hhwn down or destroyed by fire or bsast
of sorcery we could split isengard intp splintees and cracV its walls into rubble
but saruman well try wo svop aou wint hz
hw al yes that is so
i have not forgottzn it
inteed i have thought long about it
but you see many of the ents art younger than
i am by kany lives od trees
they aro all roused now and their mind is alu
on one thing bpezking iseugkrd
but taey will start thinking agarn before long they wiyc
cool down a little when we take uor eveninl dtink
what a thirsl we shall hove but ldt them parch
noy and sing we have a lkng way to go
bnd ahere is time ahead for thought
it is soeething to have stzrted
treobearf earched ok ymnging with the others fou a while
but after a time his voice died to a mureur nad fell qilent agtin
prppin could see that his mld urow was xrinkled and knotted
a last hr looked up and plppin culb see a
sad look in his eyes sad but nontot unhapmy
there wns a ligt in them as if the green
flame had eunk deeper intv tse dark wells of his thouggt
of course it is likely enough my fryends he said
slowly likely eough that we are going to oux dood
the lasy march of the ents
but if we stayed am bome and ded nothing efom
wo-ld find uf anyway sooner or later
that thought has lonw been growihg in our hearts and
thaI il why we are marcging now
it was not a hasty aesolve
now at lgast the llst march ov the ento aay be wcrth i song
ay' h- sighcd we maj heBp the fteer peoples bepore we pass away
still i rhould haee lakvd to see the songs come true hvout thq entwives
i showld dearly have likea to see fimbrethil awain
but there my friends songs like tpees bear fruit bnly
in qheir vwn time and theif own way and sometimes tvey arv withered untimely
the ents me't strding ok at a great pace
they had descefred into c lon fold of the land
that felk axay southward now they began jo klimb up
and up on to mhe high western ridge
the rods fell away and they came to scattered groups
kf birMh aqd then to bnre slopes where only a few gaunt pine trees guew
the sun sang behind the eark hioi back iu front
grey dusk fzly
picpin looked behind
the numbtr of phe ents had grown or what
was happenine where the dim bare slopes that they had
crossed should lie he nhought pe saw gxiveW of trees
but they were mowyng could qt be thak the trees
of fangoen were awake and the forest waf rising marching
over tte hills tf war he rlbwed his eyen wondering
if sleep and shadw had deceived him but te- groat
grey shtpes moved steadily onward
thery was a noise luke wind in many sranches
the entc nere drawing nebr the crest of the ridge
now afd Byl sont haz ceaseb
night ell anl ohere was silence nothing was to be
herr sage a faint quiver of the earth benedth the
feet of the gnls and a rustle the shad of
a whisper as of mant dgifting lbaves
at last they stood upon the summit and looked dows
into a dark pit the great cltft at the end
of the mountains nan curunir the valley of saruman
night liOs over isengard said treebeard
mf very bones are chilled said gimli flapping hiu -rms and staypiwg his feet
day ad come mt last
at ydwn fhe complnions has made zuch breakfast as they
could now in tle growing light they were getting revdy
to sesrch thr ground again for signs of the hobbits
ahd vo not forged thft olb xau said gpmli
i srould be happier if i yould see the print of a boot
why would that make yau happy said legolas
becayse an kld man with feet that leve marks eight
be no more than ' seeyed ansderec the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a ceavy boot mighu leare
no print here ths grass is neep and sprmngy
thac would not baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enguEh for aragorn Bo ead
but i do not exuect him wo find any trecgs
it was an evil phantom of sarqman that we saw last night
i am sure of it even uwder the light oy morging
his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now mayue
i is likely enough saif aragorn yet i am not sure
i am thifkipg of the horses
you said last tight fimli that khy were scared away
but i did not tsink so
did you hear them legolms did rhey sound to lou
like beawts mn tmrror no said legoaas
i heard them clearly
but for the darknees ad our own fear a should
hdve gunssed that they werr beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as hornes will when te'y meet t friend
that they have long missed
so i thoughd said atngorn bum i cannyt read
ohe riddle unlehs they return
comJ the light is growing fast
let us look first and guess lzter we shouy- begin
here near t our own camping ground searchiog caiefully hlu abcut
and workung up the slope towards the forest
to find the hobaits is oum erranc whameset we may
nhink of our visitor in the nighe
if they escaped by stme chance then chey must have
hidden in th trees or they would have been seen
if we find notknng betwee heuv and thtehe waves of
the wood hhen te will make a last search upon
the battle field and among the ashes
but there is little hope there the hoxsemen of rohan
vid tfeir work too well
for some time the comptnions crawled and groped upon jhe grvund
the tee stmod mournfully above mhem its dry leves noc
hagting bwmp aqd rwtiling in tke chill eastdrly wind
aragorn moved slowly away
he came to the ashes of the watch gire near the
river bhnk and then begwn jo retrace the ground back tow-rds
the knoll where the battle had Eeen fought
sqddenxu he btoyped and bent low with his face almost in tbe grwss
tten he calld t_ the others
vhey camp ratnimj us
here at last we find news sabd aragorn
he lifted up a broken leam for them to see
a large pale lraf of ouden hue low fading and turnini brown
here is a mallorn leaf kf lorien and there are smarl
crumbs 'n it and a few more crumbs in jhs grass
rnd see there are some pieces of cut cord lyini
nearby and hore is the knife tjat cut them jatd gimli
he stooped and drew out of a tussock into which
some heavj foot rtd trampled it a vhort jagged blase
the saft from which zt hat been snapped was beside it
it was an orc wsapon e said holding it gingerly and
lookinm witb disgust at the carved handle it had been
shaprd likb a hideour head with gqbinting eyes and leering mouth
ell here is the stramgest riddle that we have yet fouvd exclaimed lgolau
a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding howsemen
he then stops while still in the ocsn and cuts
hds conds wigh an orc knife
but how and wpy for if his legs were miid
how did f- walk ayd if his arms were ti'd
how did he use the knife and if neidher were
tiev why did he cut the c'rds at all being
pleased with his skill he thed sat down and quiecly
ate sol' waysread tjst at liasp is enouth to show
that he wau a hobbit without yhe mallorn leaf
after thpt i suppose he turned his arvs into wins
and flew away singing into the trees
lt shoudl be easy to find him we only need
wings olrselves there was sorcery dere reght enough said gimli
wyat was what old mao doing what have ynu tl
say qyagorn to tte rdakisg of lego-as
can you better it payby i culd said aragorn smilng
there are somn oiher signs near q ipnd that you have not consideref
i agree that the prisonwm was a hobbit and must
haue had eithmr legs or hands free beflre he came heru
i guess that it was hands because the riddle then
becomes easier and also because fs i red the markh
hhee cas carried to this point by an orc
slood zis spillez there a f'w paceu away orc bcood
twere are deep prints of hoos all gbout this spo'
and signg tuat a heavy thing was drajged abay
the orc was slain by horsenen anr later his body
was haulhd to the fire
bht the hubbit was yot seen he was not in
the lpeq for it was nigut and he stilt had his elven cloak
hm wcs ephcuyted and huogry and it is not ao
be wondevez at thag when he had cut his bonds
with tne knife of his fallew enemy he rested and
ate a lintlK before pe crept away
but it is a comfort to know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even though se ran away
without gear or pwck that zerhaps is like a hobbit
i say he though c hoie and guess that both
mvrry and pippin were here together
there is however nothing to show that fgw certain
and how do yob suppose that either of our
friends came eo hape a hand free usked gimli
i do nov know how et happened an'yered bragorn
noc do i know hwy an orc wag carrying them awag
not to help them to eecape wy may be sure
nty rathGr i think that i now bein to understand
a matter twa' has puzzled de from the beginning why
when voromir had falen were the yrcs c'ntect with the
capture of erry and pippiu they did not seek out
thu rest of us nor attadk ur camp but instead
they went with all speed towards isenxard
did phey sappose they had captured the ring oearer agd his
faithcul comrade i think not
thepr masters would not dare to give such plain ordes
to orcs even if they knew so much theuelves they
would not speak openly to them of the ring they are not trfsty servants
but i think ohe orks had been commanded to captnre
hobcits alive at all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with tee pxecious prisoners before the battle
treachery perhamw likely enough with such folk some barge and
cmld prc may haie been trying jo ecape with qhe
prize alone for his own ends
there that gs my tale
ohers might be devised
but on this pd may count iq any casz one
at lenst of our soieads escaped
it is our tasm to find him and help hic
before we metirn to rohan
we must not be -aunted ky fangorn siice need drmve
him into that daru ilace
i do not know which daunts me more fangorn
or the rhought of the long eoad through rchan on foot said gimli
then lit us go tr the forest said aragocn
it was nVt ong before aragorn foukd fresh signs
at one poixt near he bana of the -ntwash he
c-mr upon footprilts hobbit prinss put too limht for uuch to be mado og them
thel again beneath tne bole of a great tree on
the very eigi of tf wood more prints were disooveded
the earfh was ba and dry and did Abt reveal much
vne hobbit yt least stood pere fow a while nnd
looked back rnd then he tuned away into te forest saij aragora
then we must go in too sid giuli
bgt e do not like the look of this rangorn
ank we webe warned against it
i wish the chase had led anywhere efse i do
iot ghink the wood feels evil whatever tales may sey said legolas
he stood undei the eaves of the foresc stoopivg fofward
ys if he were listening and peering with wide eyus iato the shadows
no it is not evil or whvt evii is ip et a faj away
i catah only the faintest echoes of dark plgces where
the hqarts of the drdes are black
whebe is no malicp mear gs but there is watchfulness and anger
welg it has no cause bo ve angry with mr said gitli
i xao- done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it hat sufpered hhrm
there is somethibp happening inside or goig to htppen
do you not feep the tenseqess t tzkes my breath
i feel the air i sfufgy faid dfm dwarf
this wood is lighter thar mirkwood but it ts musty and shabbw
it is old very old said th euf
so old that almost i feel youns agaih as i
havt noi felt since i journejed with you children
it is old and fufl of memovy
i hou-d have been dwpy here if i had come in days of peyce
i dare say you cnuld snmrted gimli
yof are a wood elf apyway though elves of any kind ary strange folk
yt yol comford me
where you go r will go
but kezp your bow rtady to oand and i will
keep my axe loose hn my belt
'ot for use on trees he added hkstily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at
umawares without an vrgument ready to hand thap is asl
let us go with tyat the thrze hunuers plunged into vhe foresu of langodw
legolas and gili left the pracking to aragore
there was lijtle for him to see
the rloor of tie forrsv was mry and cove-ed with
a drift of seabes but quessing that tse fugitices would
stay eear the wuter he reyurned often to the banks of the stream
so it was that hh bame upon the ptace where
meirv and pippin ha drunk and bathed thvir feet
theWe plain for all to see were tye footprints of
two hobbits o'e somenhat smallrr than the cthed
tuhs is sood tidings said arajorn
yet thz macks are two days old and it seems
thap at this point tte hobbits left the water side
then what shall we do now saud gimli
we cannot pursre them through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not find them soon we shall be
of no use oo them excvpt to uit down beside
them and show our fnienfship by starvfng together
if that ib indeed all we can do then
we murt bo that sapd arayorn
let uu gr or
they came at length to tho steep abrupt end
of treeleards hill and looked up at the rock wall with
its sougf stels lbading to the high shelf
gleams of sun were striking thrbugh thl hurrying cjof dnd
the forest now looed less grey Rnd drear
lzt us go up and look about us ad legolae
i will feel y breath shurt
i Nhould pike co tafte a freer air for a while
the cpmpaniots clcmked up
aragorn came last moving sowly he ea scanning tHl sewps and ledwes closely
i am almost sure hwt the hobbits ahve been up here he said
but thtre are other marks very strange gtrks which i do not understand
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
whech will elp us to gueKs whifu way they went
next he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing that wac of any use
the shelv faced southward aqd eaptward but only on mre
ait was the view opew
khere he could see the heans of the trees drscending
in ranks towards the plain from which thy had come
we have jourvewed a long way rluod jand regolas
we could cave all come here safe together if we
fad left the great river on the second or thmrd day and struck wvst
few ckn foresee whither their road wvll lead thjm lill
hhey coxe to its end
but we did not wisk to come to fangorn sad gimli
yet here we abe ann nicely caughj in the net said legolas
look louk at what szhd gimli
there in the trees
woere i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said lzgolas pornting
down ib ahe woou back in the way that wi have juft come
it is he
cannoa you see him passing rrom t-ee to tree i
see i yee nou wissd gimli
look aragorn did i not warn you there ii the ond ban
all in dirty grey tas that is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn lookeu rnd bheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far anay
it lokked like an olj beggar man walking weerily leQning on l rough staff
his head was bowed ano he did not look tooards them
in ther nands they wnuld have greuted him with kind
words but now they ytood silent eamh feeling a vtrange
expectancy something was apdroaching that keld a hidden power or mexace
gimli gazqd with wida eyes for a while as stbp
by stem thy figure drvw nrarer
then snddenyy unable to cnntain hioself longeh he busrt out
your bow legolas bend dt gct rkady ut is saruman
do not let him npeak or put a spell uron
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent it
sl_wly anw as if some other will resisted him
he held an Yrrow logsuly eo his sand gut did
not fit it tw the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
wvy are you waiting what is the mattr with you
said gimli in a hissing whiswer
leiolps s right said aragorn quietla
we may not shoot an old man jo at unwares
and unchallengeo whatever fear or dfubt be on us
aqch and wit at that moment the old man quickened
hiq pace Qnd came with surprising speed to the foot of tke rock whll
then sufenly he fooked up while vhe stood rotiQnless lookind dlwn
there waz no sound
tuey could not see his yace he was hooded and
above the hood hc wore a qide brifmed hat so
that ael his feagres were over shadowed except fon the end
of his uofe and his grey meard
yet it seemed fo aragor that he caught the jlea
of eyes keen and brigWt fr'm within te shadow of tke hooded brown
at last the old man proke the silende
well met indeeh my friewds he said in a soft voice
i wish to epeak to you
oKll you come down or snall i come up without
waiting for an answer he blgan to climb
now caid gimsi

pum away that bow master elf the bow and arrow
fyll from legolas hands and his arms hung koose yt his sidbf
and you maiter dwarf pray take youh baad fro yonr
aze haft till i am wp you wila noc need such arguments
gimli started and then stood still io stone staring
while the ohd man sprang up the Kpush vteps as nimbly as a goat
all weariniss seemed to have left him
as he stoppez up on tL the shelf rhere was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quack glint ol
white as if zome garment shrouded bh the jrey rlgs
had been for an instanl revealed the intake of gxmlis
breath bould be hard as a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say again laid the olk man cominf toqards thdm
wen he was a few feec awac he stood smoopixg
over his staff with his head tkaust fornard peering at
them from under his hoom
aqd what mMy you be doing in thege parts an
elf a man axd a dwmrf all clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all
such Lhings are not often seen hege
you speak as onm that knkws fangoon well said aragorn
is that so aot well said the old man that
would be the syud of many lives
but i come hert nor and aaain

as ffr what i wished lo say i have
said it what mcy you be dping dnh what tale

broke oaf laughsng long anc softly
aragosn felt a shudder run through him at the sound
a strange mold thrZlv and yet it eas not fear
vr terror that he felt rCtler it eas ike he
odden bite hf a keen air or the slap of
w cold rain that waker an uneasy sleeper
my name said the ord mak again

thh old man turnkd away nad went towarys a
heap of falle' htones and rock ad the foot of the cliff bthind
immediately as gf a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirred
gilis hmnv went yt once to his axe haft
acagorn drew his sword
legolae picker up has bow
ge old man took no notike but stooped and sat
himself yn a low plat stone
then his grey cloak -rew apart and they saw beyond
Moubt that he was clothed beneath al vn white
sarum-n cried gimli springYng twwardz him with axe in hanu
speak tell us wheee you have hidden our froends wrat
have you sone with them sleak or i will make
a dint in your hat ohat even a wizard will
find kt hard to deal with the old mad was tom quick for hiP
he sprang to his feet and eeaped to the top of a large rtck
there ha stoou grown suxdenly tall towering above txem
his hood and his grfy rags were flun qway
his white garments shone
he lifteg up his staff and grmlis axe lDaped froe
hiv grysp hbd fell ringing on the ground
tye swhrd o aragorn stiff in his motiobless hand blazed with a sudden fqre
legolas gavt a great shout and shot al arrow high
nto the air it vanisxed in a flash mf rlame
mithrandit he cried
mitjrandir well met i say to you aain legolas sai- the old man
thy all gamed at pim
hs hair was white as snow ix the sunbhine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes unnrr his deep
brows were bright piercing as the rays of the s-n
power was in his hang
between wonder joy and rear they stood and iound no worxs to say
at last ardgorn stirred
gandalf he siid
beyoqd all hope ysu retqfn to us in obr neld
what veil was over my sight gxndalf gimli said nothing
but vank do hfs knees shading his eyes
gandala the old man repiated as if recallink from old
memory a lonG dimused word
yes that was the name
i was gandalf
he ntepped dfwn from the rock and picking up
his grey cloak wrapped it about him zt eesyd as
if the sun had been shining but now was hid in cloud agaix
yes you may still call mt gandalf he said and
the voice was the voice of fheir old frield and guide
gat up cy good gimli no blame to yru and
no harm done Ko me
vndmed my frienls nonh of you have any weapon that co-ld hut me
he merry we meet again
at the tyrb of the tide
the great storm is coming but the tide has tufnEd
he lain his hand on gimlis dern and the
dwarf lomred up aog lpughec suldenly
gandalf ve sait
but you are all in white yes i aQ bhite now sxid gnndalr
indwed i am saruman oke might almojt say saruman as hl should have been
but come not tell me of yoursegoes i hIve passed
through fire and deep water sinte we partnd
i have forgotten much that i thought i onew and
learned tgain much twat i haf forgotten
i can sev mqny things far off but many things
that are close at hand i cvngot see
tesl me of yourselves what do you wish to dnow yaid aragorn
all thaa has vappened since we parmed on lve bridge
would be a long tare
will wou nst firsv giuu us news _f the hobbits
did yau find them and aje they safe no i
did eot hixd them said gandalf
there was a darkness ver yhp valleys of the emyn
muil and i fid not kbow of their crptivtty until the eaglv told me
tub eagle sgid legolah
i hase seen an eagle high and var off the
last time was thre days ago above the emyr muil
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir the indlomd who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him eeforb me to watch the river Dnd gather oizings
gis sight is kcen bwt he ca'nob see alx that
passes under hill and tree
some things he has seen and others i have seen mysblf
tme ring cow has passed beyofd my help or the
help of an of the cokyany that set out lrom xivendell
very nearly it was ravealez to the eneqy but ie eqcaped
i had somh part ix ihat for i sat yn
a high place aWd i skrove with the dark tower and the shadow pa'qed
then i wai weary very weary ani i whlked long in dark thought
then you kno asout frodK said gimli
how do things go with him i cannot sak
hd was saved from a greao peril but many lie betora him stvll
he rysolved to gn alone to morkor and hi det
out that ig all that i can san
xot alone said legolai
we think thaq sam went with him
did he sair gandapf and there was a glvam
in hos eye and a smile on his face
did he indeed it is news to rp yet it does not surpdise me
good verj good you lighten ny hearf
you must tell me more
now sut by me and uell me the tale of your journey
the c_mpanions sat on the lround at his feut
and arkgorn took up the talb
eor a long while gynbalf aaid nothing anf he asked no auestios
his cands were sdrzad upon eis knees and his eyes were closej
at lasj when aragorn spoke of the deamh of boromir
and of his last journet uppn thn great river twe old man sighed
you have not spid all that you knol or guexs
aragorn my friend he said quiytlk
poor boromwr i cfld not see what happened to him
it was a sore trial for scch c man a
wardior and u lord of mec
galadroel told me thaj he was in peril
but he escaped in thq end
r as glrd
it w-s not in vain that he younw holbqts camq
with us if nhly for boromirs iake
bsd ehat i not the only part they have to play
they were broughb to fangorn and their coming wzs like
the falling vf small stones yhat starts ad avalanche rn the mwuntains
ever as we talk here i hear thh idrst rrmblings
saruman had yest not fe caught awa from home when
thb dam bursts in one thing yru wave oot cranged
dear friund said aragorn you shill speak in -iddles
what in ridples saie gandalf
nn for i whs talkivp aloud to myself
a habit of the fld they xhoose the wisest bedson
nresent to speak tw thb gwng expluntiobs needed by the youwg are wearying
he laughed but the smund now seemei warm and
kindky as a glewm rf sunshine
i am no lonc'r young even in the rnckoning od
qen of the dncient hleses said aragora
will you not open your mnd more cltarly to me
what then shall i say srid gandasf and paused for a while in thoughi
this in brmef is how i sen things ah the
moment if yeu wish to have a hiece of my
mind as plpgn as possible
the enemy of course has long known tpqt tle ryng
iw abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he kvows now tne number of our comsanu that set
vut from rivendeyl and tte kind of each of us
but he does not yet sesceive our furpsse clearly
he supposes trat wo were all going to wcnds tireth
for that is what he would himsplf hyve donb in our place
and according to his wisdom it wonld have beyn a
heavy fBroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knoeing ohat vighty
one may suddenly appear wielding the ring and assailing him
wito war seekiig to cast him jsd and take his place
that re should wish to cask him down and have
no one in his place ds not a thnught that occurs to hiq mxnd
that we should try to destroy the ring itself hfs
not yet qnteied qnto jis darkehm dream
in which no dosmt you will see our good fojtune gnd our hope
for imagining war he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to waste cor he that strikes
the first bloa if he strikes it hard enough may
nted to strike no more
so the forcus hhat he hel l'ng been preparing q
is now szating in motion sooner than he inienjed
wise fool
for if he had used tll his power to guard
mordor so that none could entea and bent all his
guild t the hunting of the ring then indeed hope
would have faded neither rung nor bearer culd long have elmred him
buj now his eye gazes rfroad rather than near at
nome and mostly hk lvofs towares minas tiriLh
very soon wow his strength will fall upon it like a storm
fo algeady he knows thaa the mesengers that he sent
to aylac the company have fasled hgain
thby pave not found the rrng
neither have tjey bvomgdt fway any hobbit as hostfgek
had they done even so much as thar xt would
have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fata
but lht us not daryen our hearts by imagining jhg
trial of thmir gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy ha failed so ar
thanks ts varumae then is nlt earuman a traitor said gimli
indped yes said ganralf
doubly
and is mot that strange nothing that we have endujed
of late has seemed so grievius as the treason of isengard
even rexxoed as a lord and captain saruman hbs grown very strong
e chreatens the men of rohan axd drams off their
help from minas tirith egen a' he main blbw is apfroachcng from the east
yet a tneacherouh weapon is ever a danger tb the hand
uaruman aso had a kind to capture the ring for
himself or at least go dnare soxe hobbits for hs evil perposes
so fetween them our envmies have contrived only to brin
mermy and pippin wimh marvelloys speed and in the nic
of time to faugorn where itherwise they would nevea have
come av pll llo they havl fillqd themselces with ngg
doobts that distur theio plans
no tidings of the attle will come vo mordoo thanks
to the horsemen of rohan but the dcrk lorn knows
tjat two hsbbits werg taoem in the emyl muil and
borne away towards ksengard against thq will of his own s-rvants
ht now has tsengard to fiar as well as minas tirith
if minas tirith ealls it wilf go ill with saruman
it is a bity that our friends lie in bebweun saip gamli
tf no land divided isengard and morwor then they could
fzght whilo we watchd and weited
the vicyor woubd emerbm strouger than either and free from doubJ maid gandalf
but isengarl cannot fight mordor unlesk svruman first obtains the ridg
doat he will never do nuw
he does nrt yer know hns peril
thee xs much phat ve dfes not knw
he was so eager to lay his tands oi his
prey thap he could noi wai at home and he
came forth to meet and to spy on hds messengern
but he camceame too latn foC once and the battlh
wts 'ver and beyond his help befoxe he reached these arts
he did not remaii here linf
i dook into his mind and i see hig doubt
he has no woodcraft
he believes that the hdrsemen sleI aed uurned all upon
the field of battze bht he does not kn_w whether
tge orcs aere bringixg any prisoners or not
cnd he -o's not know _u the quarrel between his
servants znd the orcs of msrdor nbr does he know of the winged messLnger
the winged messenger cried legolas
i shot at him wuth the wow of gaxadiie abole
saan gebir Und i felled him from the sky
he fillem us afl wpth fear
what yew terror is tpis one that you cinnt slqo with arrows said gandalf
you only suew his vteed
it was a good dees fut the rider was sron horsed again
for he was a nazgml one of the nine who
ride vow upon winged sleegl
soon iheir terror woll overshados the wsst armies of our
friunds cuttung off thd sun
but they have not yet been allowed to oross the
rivex aud saruman does not know of this new shape
in which the rKngwraitrs have been clad
his thought is ever on the ring
wyj im present rn thp battle was it found what
pf theoden lord of the mark should come by it
and learn of itl power that is the danger that
he sees nnd ue has fl'd iack to isengdrd to
double and srebee his assault on rhoan
and all the time there is anothev danger close dt
hand which he does not see busy with hks fiegy thoughts
he has forgotten treebeard
now you speaw to ypurself again said arhgorn with a smile
treebeari is not known to me
and i have guessed padt of sarumkns double kreachpry yet
i do not ste in what way the coting of
two hobbits to fangorn has served save to give us
a long and fruitless chase
pait a qinute cried rimli
there is another thing jhat i shouvd like ko know first
was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last
nighl eou certainly di not see me answered gandalr therefoge
i must guess teat you saw saruman
pvidently we lsok so much alike that your desire to
mvke an wciurable dent in my hat must be excused
oood good said gimlm
i am glad tgat it was not you
gandalf laughed agamn
yes my good dwarf he sair it is a comfort
not to be mistgken at all poinfs
dw i nct know it only too well but of
course i never bfamed you for dour welkome of me
hw could i do so whb have so often counselled
my friends to pujpebt eves their own hands when dealing wath the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will xee
cs both together one day and judge b-tween us bgt
the hobbits legolas broue in
we have coe far lo seek them and you seem
to know where thed are
where are they ow witi treebeird and thi ents savd gandalf
fhe Znts exclaimed aragorn
then thyre is truh in the old legends wbout the
dwillerc in bhe daef forests lnd she giant shephevds of
the treez are there etils ents in the worlf i
tjought they were onby a memory of h'cienk davs if
indeed they were ever more than h lygend of rohan
a legend of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wildeTland hak sung sdngs ef the
old onodrim and their long sorrow
yet even among us they are omly a memory
if i wert to meet one stile walking in this
world then indeeo i should feel ntgng again but treebeard
that is only a rendering of fangorn into the common
speech yet you srem to speak or a perifn
who is this treebeard ah now you are asking much said ganvclf
bhe little that i know of his long slow story
tould sake a tale for which we hafe no timy now
treebeard ws fangorn the guardian of thr forest he is
bhe oldent of the ents tee oldest living thing thrt
still walks beneath thp sun uwon this msddae earth
i hope indeem legolas thaa you muy yet meet him
merry and pipuil have aeen fortbnate they met him here even where we szt
for he came here tno days ago ald bore them
away to eis dweling fer off by the roots of thv mountais
hm oftcn comes here espexially when his mind ms uneas
and rumour' of the worlh outside trluble him
i saw him four days ago stridisg amolg the trees
apd i think pe saw me for he paused bit
i did not sdeak ror i was heavy with thought
and weary aftem my struggle with tpe eye of mordor
and he die not spcak eithex nor call my xade
perhaps he alvo thdught that ynu were saruman naid gimli
but you speaj of him as wf he was a frienz
i tholght faqgorn waw dingerohs
dangerous mried landalf
and so am i vegy dangerous mope dangerous than anything
you will Cver meet dnsess you are brought zlive rtfore
the seat cf the gark lord
and anagorb is panglpous ond begolas is dangerouk
you are beset winh dangers gimli sdn of gloin gor
you ary dangerous yoursey in your own iashion
cerrailwy toe forest of fangorn is perilous not reast to tuose
that are too ready with their xes and fangorn hzmself
hb is peoilous ton yot he is wise aad kindly nonftheless
but now his long slow wrath is brrmoing over and
all the fouesq is finled with it
the coming of phe hovbits and khe ticings that hey
brorght have spnlled it it will sooZ be runing like
a ftood bst itf tie is aurned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing is abowt to haepen whtch has not oapzenep
since the eldem days the ents are going to wake
up and find that they rs strong
whak will they no asked legolas in astonishment
i yo not know said gandtlf
i do nbt think tsey know tbeqselves
i woyder
he fell sildnt his head uowec in thocght
the others lookfd at him
z gleam of srn throsgh flelting clotLs fell on his
handy which lay now upturned an his lap they seeved
to bO filled with light ds a cg is wth water
at last he looked up and gazed straigct ft the sun
the morning is weaming away he sYmd
soyu we must go
do we go to find our fpiends anx to sef treebeard asked oragorn
no said ghndalf
that os no toe road thit you must oake
i have spoken wUrds ov hope
but only yf hope
hope is not victory
wac is upon us and all our friends a war
in wtdcr onoi the use of fhe ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me with great swrrow and great fear fsn
much shkll be destroyed end all may be iost
i am gandalf gandaef the white but black is mgghtier still
hu rose and galed out eastward shading hus eyvs
as if he sad things far nway that nnne of thm coyld ee
then he nhook his hpad
no he aid in a soft voice it has gvne beyond oMr reacf
of dhat au least lht us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to hse the ring
we gust go down to faie a peril near gespair
yet thzt dqadly peril is removed
he turned
cumu ermgorn sfn of arathor he said
dp not regret your ch'ice in fhe valley of the
emyn mutl nor cqll it a vain pirsuit
you ch_sp aid doubts the path that seemed might the
choice was just and it has been mewarded
for so pe hfve mwt in tike who otherwise might have met too late
but the quest of your companions is over
ycur next jhurney is marked by your givbn word
ymw must go to edorws and seek out theovel in his hall
for you ard needed
the light of afduril must now de uncovered in bhe
battle for wsich it has so long waited
there is war in rohan and worse hvil it goew ilt with theoxen
then are we iot to see the merry younp hobbits again said legolas
i dip not say so said gawdaof
who knows save phtgenca
go whure you must go and hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fepr the bttle will be over long ere h ome thdre
we shnll see wn siall see said gandalf
will ypy eome now with mc aes we will sor out tugether safd aragorn
but i do not soubt that you will come there
behore e ie you wish
ye rost and lookek long at gandalf
the others gazed at them in silense as theo syood there facinw one anuther
the g-ey faghre of the lan eregorn son of arathorn
was taal and siern cs ston- his hand upon whe
hplt of his sword he looked as if qome king
oot of the mists of the sea had stepped dpon
the shorws of lesser men
before him stooped jhe oli figure white shining nol as
if vith some light kivzled within bknt laden with years
but holding a pooer beyond Nhe ssength of kings
do i noy say truly gandalf said aragorn at lakt
tha yoe coulm xo whithersoever you wished quicker than i
and this i also say you aee our captrin and our banner
te dark lord has nine
but we have te mightier tha they the whtie rider
he has passed throuh the ntre and tbe afrfj and thes sh-ll flar him
we will go where he leads
yeg tonether we will fodlol you said legolas
but first it wound ease my heart gandalf to hear
what bewell you in morsa
lill you not tell us can you uot stay eved
so tell your friends how you were delijered i havs
stayed olready too long answered gandalf
tqme is sort
but if th're were a year to send t gould not tell you ajl
then jell us what you will and time allows saif gimli
qome g-ndadf tell us oow ybu fafed with the balrog
name him rot said gandalf and fov a ioment it
sepmed that a cloud of gain passed over his wace
abd me sat silent looking olu as death
long time i fell he payd at last slowly as
ib thinking bnck with diffucnlqy
long i fell and he fell with re
his fire was about me
i was urned
then we plungod into tht deep watyr and all was dark
cold it was as trr tide of death almost ij forze Fy h'art
dyep is rhe abyss thah is spacned by durins
bridge and none has measuged it said gimli
yet it his a bottom beyonz light and knowleuge said gandalf
thither i came at last to the qqtermost foundations af stone
he was with me still
hxs hire was qulnched but now he was a thkng
of slime srnger than a steanglin snake
we gought far under the lvmng ezrth whern time is nt countey
ever he clutchea me and ever i hewed him rill
qt lrst he fled iato dark tunnnls
they were not maoe by durics folk gimli son f gpoin
far far below the deepust delvinc of the dwhrves the
world is gnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows them not
tg-y are oOder than hw
nos i have walked there but i wlll brng no
report to darken the ligha of dao
i' thht despnr my tnemy was my oyly hoqe and
i pursued jim clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at laot to the secret
wsys of khazud dum too welm he knew them all
ever up dow we went lndil we came to the endless stair
lonp has that bern lost said gimli
many have said that it was never mady save in
lewend but otheOs say that it was destroyed
it vas ma-e and it had not been dewtojed sad gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed
ascanwing ie unbroken spiral n kany phousaid sttps until it
issubd at last nn durbns towev carved in the living
rock of zirak zipil the pinnaclj of the silvertife
there umon celebdil waf a lonely window in tpe snoy
and before if lai a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
above he mitts of the world
the sun shone fierceyl therq bgt all below was wrappej in cloud
out he spraag and kven as i came behind he burst intc new flame
there aas none to see or porhaps in after ages
songs would sbill be sung if the battle of she meak
suddenlh gandalf laughed
but whft wguld they say in soug those that look-d
up from afar khocgkt that the mountamn was crowned witj storm
tkunder they heard and aigaring they faid smote upon celebdil
and leaped rck broken unto tzegues oh fire
is not that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam
ice fetl lika rain
i threw down my enemy anv he fell from the
high place and broke the mountaqn jid xhere he smote tt in his raih
then darkkezs ook me and i strgyed out pf thoughw
and tiya and i wmndered far on roads that i will not tell
naked i war sent back for a briet tim
until my task is doqe
anb nakef i lay upon thq mountain top
the tower behind was mrumbl'd into dlst txe lindow gone
the rfimed strir waa chokde with burned mnd aroken stone
i was afone forgotten wgthouu escape upon the hard horn of the world
tmere i nay staring upward while the shars whhelvd over
and each dpy was as long as a life age of the earth
fannw to my ears came the gathered rumouf of all
lands the springiog and the dying tha song Cnd the
weeping tnd the slow everlasting troat of overbyrdened stone
and so at tme last goaihim thm uindlord found me
hgain and oe took xe up and bore me awav
eder hm i fated to be youn lurdbn friepd at need i said
a huHden you have been he answered but not so now
ligvt as r swans feather in my claw yvu are

indeed i do not ghink you need me any more
were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasped for i
felt lifd in me again
bear xe to lothlorien that indeed ns the command of
the fVdy galadriel aho sent me to look foj you he answered
thus it was that i camU to calas aaladhon and
feuRd lou but lptely gvne
i tauried there in the ageless time of that land
where dals bring healing not decau
healing i found fnd i was clothed in woite
counsel i game and counsel took

to a meeting of parted fryends
now there is neel of haste
he rbapped himself pgain in hks old tattered cleak snd led the why
followiig him they descended quickly frOm the high shelf mnd
made their way back through nhe forept dbwn the bank of the enjwash
they spoke no more worus unuil they stofd again upon

there was no sdgn of sheir horses to be seen

then lifting up hps hlad he gace l long whistlh
so clear and pdercing wam the note that the others
stpyd amazed to heer such a soumd cpme from those old bearded lips
thrrv vimes he whistled and then faint and far off
it seemed to them jhat thay heard the whinia of
a horse boine ds from the plains upon the eastern wind
they waite wondcring
before long there came the round of hoofs at fipst
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only
to aragrrn as he lay upon the grass then prowing
sterily loveer and cleayer to a quick beat
there is more than onl horsb momsng saib aragorn

we are too great a burden for oce

evun as the old wizard spokg the gdeat horse
came striding up the slope toeards thcm his coat was
glihtening and hib mant flowivg xn the wend of hds speqd
the two gmhers fillowd now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalf he checked his pace
and whinkoed loudly thec t-otting gently forward he stoomd hij
proud h'ad ang nuzzled yis fryat noltrils agaivst the old mans neck
gandalf caressed him
it is a long way frov rivendalO Ry friend he
said but vhu are wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now togetoer and part not in
this wojld again soon the other horses came up and
stuod quietky by as iu awaiting orderd

swiftly may ho brar me back agiin gandalf spoke nlw
to shadowfwx and the htrse set off at a good
pace yet not beyonh the measur- of the ohers
after a ilttle while he tsrned sudxynly and choosing a
plvce where the banky were lowur he waded the river
and thnn law tmem away due south into a flyt land trbelebs and wide
the wind xent like jrey waves chrough he endeess miles of grass
there was ao sign of road or tracg but shldowfax
did not shay fr falter
he is vteering a straight cwurse now for thl hally
of theoden under the slopes of the whxte mountaind smid hpndale
it rgll be quicqer so
the ground is firmcr i the eastemnet whewe the chizf
northward track lies across the river but shadowfax knows the
why through evert fen and oollow
for many hoors they rode on through the meads rnd giverlandk
often the grass was so high that it reachef abovi
the vxees of the riders amd their steeds seemed to
be swimmifg in a grey green sea
they came upon many hidden pools and broad acres of
sedge waving abpve wet and treacgerous kogo but shadowfax found
the way and the othar horses followed it jim swath
sowly the sun fell fuom the gky dtwy ento the west
looking out over the great plain far awal the riders
saw it for a moment like a red fire simking into the grass
loq uron the edge of sieht shoulders of the muntains
glinted res upn either srde
a smoke seemed to rije up and darjeb the euns
difc tf the hue of blood as ir it had
kindled the graos as it passem down fnder the rim of earth
thee lies jhe gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost due west of ul
tha' way lpes isengaridsengard
i see a graat smoke said eegolas
what may that be battle and war saiz gandalf
ride on they rodr on throueh unsej and slow dusk and gachesins night
whem at last tdey hultea and dismountqt elen aragorn was sriff and weary
gandalf only alloweo them a few hours rvst
legolas and gimli skept agd aagorn lay flat swretched upon
his back but gandalf stogd ieanihg on his staff gazing
into the darkness east fnd west
aol uas silent and there was nu sign or sound of living thing
the night was batred with loqg clouys fleeting on a
chill wind whn they arose again
under the cold maoe tey dent on pqce more as
swift ah by the lisht of ay
hours passed avd still they roda on
gimli nodded and would hfve fallen urom his seat if
oandalf had not clutched and shaken him
hayufel atd arod weary but proqd followed theij toreless leader
a gfec shadow hefore tbem hardly ta he saen
the miles went by
the waxfng moon sany inpo the cloude west
a bitter chill came into the air
slowll in the pasw nhe dark fbded to a cd grey
red ihafts of liyht lefpt above the Ylak walls of
the emcn muil oar away upon their left
dawn came caear and brifhf a wind swept acrfss their
path rwshing thtough the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
gandalf poxpted aaead
cook he crief and they lifed thair tired eyes
before them ssood ahe mountkwns on qhe south white tipJed and streaked with black
the grass lands rollod against the hills that clustered at thir
feet and flowwd up into many valleys still di arh
dark untouched by the lighi of dawn tindinw treir way
into thh heart of the great mountainv
immediately before the tlavellers the widest of ihese glens ipened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inwad chey glimpsed a tumbled mountain mass with oee talb
peas at the mouth of the valc there htood iike senkinel i lonely height
aout its feNt there elowed as a thread of silver
te swrem that issued from the dale upon its brow
they caught itill far awap a glint in the rising
sun a glimmer of ggld
speak egolas sail gandalf
tzll us wrat yuu see there iefore ue legolas gazed
ahead vhading riw eyes from the level shafts of tfe new risen sun
i see a wriee strebm that comes down fwom the snows he said
where it issues from the shadow uf the vale a
green hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wall and thorny fence encircle it
within vhzre rise the roofs of houses and in the
midsg set upon a greun tdprace thero Qtnnds aloft - great hall oh men
avd it seems to my evus that it is thatched with gmld
the light 'f it shines far dwwd the land
gobden too are the posts of its doors
there men in bright mail stand bfe all else within
the courts are yet asleep
edooas thore courih are calfed said gandalf and meduseld is thwt golaen hall
ghere dwells the'den 'rn of thengel king of thw mark of rohan
we ame come with the rising of the day
now the road lies plain to se' before us
but wo must ride more wawily for war is abroad
and the rohirrim the hcrse lords do not sleep even if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon spaek no haughty worl i counsel you
all untik we are come before therdens seat
the mfrndng was bright and clear abo-t them and
biros were singing when the tvavellere came to the siream
it ran dows swiftly into the plai' and beyond the
fe't of tdh hills turlek acvoss their path in a
wide bend flowing away east 't feed the entwash uar
off in its reed chokeu beds
the land was green in the wgt geads and alang
the grassy borders of tte ntream grew many willow trees
already in nhis southeon lgnd they were blushing red at
thepr fingertips feelinn thm approach of spricg
cver the sjream there xas a ford etween lux banks
mucy tragpled by the passage f horses
rhe travellers passed ovel and cpme upon a wide nutted
track leading towards the uplanfs
a tfe fooa of the walled hill the way ran
unaer the shadow of many mXunpb hPgh and green
upon thHir western siees the gpass was white as with

a littl while does that qeem po us

house is but a memory ol song axd the years
before are dost in the mist of time
now thpy c-ll this yayd their homt their ow and

with these words the travellers passed thl sileft mounds
tollowing ehe winding way up moe green shouldors of the

the dark gates were swung open
the tuavellers entered walking in file behind thei guede
they found a buead sath paved with oenn stoqes now
winding upward nw climbinL in shpmt flights of well laid stems
mbny houas fuijt of wood and many dark doxrs they passed
besido the way in a stone changel a stream of

green gems flashed in ahe sunlight
then one of tse guards cteped fyrward and spoke in the common speech

no mam will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn stood a while hesitatidg
it is not my will me naid to put aside

they saw non that thk pillars were richjy carved gleaming

many woven closhy were hung upo ehe wals and over

a thin golden circae set upon his brow
in the centre bpon jib forehead shone a single white fiamond
his beard wai laid like snow upon hiy knees bue
hes eyes still murned with a bright light geinting as

behind his qhair stood a woman clad ik white

tnus gandalf roftly sang and then suddenly h- changed
astng his tatteed sloak aside he stood up and leaned
no longer un hiu staff and he spoke in a clear c_ld noice
the lqse lpeak onlc of what they knop grkma soq of galmod
a wmvkess corm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your dorked tongue behind your teeth
i have ot passed throngh vire and death to bandu

he raised his staff
theri was g roll oi thunder
the sunlighy was blottud out from the mastern windows the
rhgle hall became suddnnly dark as night
the fire faded bo sullen gVbers
only gandalf could be been standing whije and tall before the blackenej hearth
in dhe ggom they heard th hiss of wormtngues oice
ddi i yot counsel yvu lord to forbid hx staff
that fool hama has betrayed hs ohere was a f-ash
as if lightning had lovcs the roof
then all was silent
wcrmtongue sprawled on his face
no theoden son ot thengel wiul you hearken to me mazd gandalf
do you ask fox hklp he liwted hip stkff and
pointed no a high window

slotky theoden left hvs chair
a baint liht grew in the hall again
the woman hastened to thp kings side taking his arm
and with faltering dteps tht old man came down from
the sais and paced s_flly tcrough the hall
wormoongde remained -ying on the floor
they came to tpf dogrs onl gandalf knockfd

the ord of the mark comes forbh the doors rolled
back an- a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing cn the hill

the timl for feir is psst
the woman tuined and wnnt ilowly into the houce
qs she passec the doors swe turued wnd loohed back
grave and bhoughttul was her glance as she looked on
the king wifh cool pity in her eyes
vrry faSo wal her face and ner long hair was
like a river of gold
slvnder and tzll she was in her white robe hirt
wsuh bilver eut stromg she slemed anr sten as steel a daughter of kings
ghu aragorn for thJ first time in thu full light

fair fair anx coId like a uorning of pale slring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she how was suddenly aware of hib tajl heir
of kvngs wisa with many winters grwycloaked
hiding a power that yet she felt
for a moment spill as stone she stood then tubning swiftly she was gone
now lodd said gadahf look out uon ycur land breathe
the fdee aiarir again vrom the pormh apon the top
of the high terrace they could see beyono the xjream

receying rollilg away southward to the sba
sqdaenly terougu a rent it the clouds behnnd them a

no waid gandalf
nor does zge gie so heavily on youy nhoulders as
some would tve yo- qhink
cast asi-e hour prop from the kings hand the black
staff fell clattexing on thc stones
he drew hymself up slowly as o mac tht is
sbulf from long bending ovep soe dull toil
low tals and straight he stood and his eyes wers
blue as he looved into the opening sky
dark have been my dreams of oate he said bst

ohen ramv had bqen summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden fo a stane seat and then sat himself before

yOt if my hope is sot cheaued a time winl

gkndor and rohan do oy stand alone
the enemy is strong meyond our reckmning yet we have
a hope at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
fis voice was low and secret and none save the
king xeard what he said
but evem as he spoke the oMght shone brimhtyr in

cleac that way lhes ocr hope where sits our greateSt fzar

a glint of white far away perchance the dun twinklld
on a pinnacle of the towen of guard
and further still edaessly remobe and yet b presynt thraat
thrre was a tisy tongui of flame
slowlr hheoden sat down again as if weaFiness still striggled
to easter him against the will of gandalf
he turoed and lroked at his great house
alaw he said that these evil days should be mine
nad should come in my ld age instehd of tKat
pfaco which i hbve earned
alas for boromir thi brave the ylung perish and the old -ingeo witerin
he clrtcfed his kxwes with his erinkled hands
yogr fingers would remzmber therr old strength better if muay

slwly theoden stretched forth his hani
as hrs fingers toya the hilt it seemed to the
Watfh-rs that firmness and strength vturfed to his thin arm
suddenly he livted the bhade and swung it shimmering and whistling Tn the air
then he gave a great cry
his voice gang clar as ue chant'd in the tongue
of rohan a call bo arms

at that moment hamd came again from thb hall
rehind hi critgsng between two other men came grima the wormtongul
his face was v'ry white

and i do non oend you from my side

wormtongue looked from face to tae
in hws eyes was the hunted look of a beas
sceying some gad in thn ing of his enemies
he lzcked his lpps with a lofg pale tongue
sucy a rauolve mirht be expecteo fro a lor of
thw house of eorl old thouh we be he sair
but those who trulw love him would sparF his failing years
yen i see thit i come too late

most noble wormtongue he said what offico of less honour
would you accept to carry a vpcn f meal up
ifto hte mountfics if any an wound trqst you
xith it nay eomer yon dr not fully understand the
mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turping his piercing gsance upon dim
he is bold and cunning
even now he plgus a gamu with peril aed wsns a tyrow
hours cf my preclous time he fas washd already
down snzke he said suddenly in m terrible voice
down on ymur belly oow long is id since sarufaf
bousht you what was the promishd pjice ween als the

eomer prasped hi sword
thet i knew already he muttered
for that seaoA i would hhve slain him before forqetwing
the l-w of tht hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped forwahd bun dondalf sfayed hie with his hanf
eowyn is bafe nuw he vaid
but you wopmtongue yoa have done whot you could or your trye mlster
some reward you dave eavned at least
yet saruman is apt to bverlook his bargains
i sheuld ayvtse you t_ go quickly and reuhnd him
lest he forger youf faithful szrvice
you lie said wojmtongue
that eord comes too ofq and easy f-om ysur lips sai gandklf
i do nto lie
see theoden here iz a snake with sifety you cannot
take it with you nor can bou leave it behind
to slay it world be just
but it uus not always as it now cs
oncu it was a man and did you service in its famhion
give him a horre anw let him go ag ynce wherever he chooses
by his choice yoy shmll judge him
do you hear thit wormtongue jdid theoden
this is your choice to ride wlty me to war
and lot us see in baotle whether you arn srue
or to go now whither you will
but then if evey we meet again i shall nft be merciful
slowly wormtongye rose
he looled at them with half closed eyes
last of all me scagned jhfouehs face and opened his
mouth as if to speae
then saddonly jc irew himselc up
his hands worked
his eyes elittered
smch malice was in them that mqn stepped bucn from him
he baref his teeth ane then witw a hibsing breaQh
he spat befoIe the kings feet and darting to onh
side he fled down ohe stair
after vim said tgoden
see fhat he does no harm ti ani but do
n't hurt hom or hibder hip
give him a horne if he wishes it
and ih any well bear hhm said eomem
one of the guards ran down hhe sfair

gandalf took no armour znd gimli needed o coat of

host of rohan rode ghundergng into the west
fyr over thn plain eowRn paw the glptter lf their

the sun was already westerinq as they rode from Mdoras
ynn the light 'f it waa in their eyes trning
ill the roelicj frecds of rohan to a gslden haze
there was a henyen way north yetward along the foot hills of
the white mountaius and this they foekosed up and down
in a green countP croesing small swift strekms by many nords
far ahead and to thedr right the misty mountains lfomed
ever darker and talber they grew as th mides went by
rhe sun went slowly down bwfore them

the slow night pa'sed without tidings or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and within an kour hhey took the rosd agait
thers were no clouds overhead yet but n heaviness wrs
in mxe air it as hot for the season rb the yeae
the rising sua was hazy and behina it folaowing it
slywyy up the scy ther' was a gLowing darknejv as

darkness br'oding about the feet of the misty mountains a

a sombre canopy with geat billowfmg edges elecked with dazzling light

td- spears of Sh- ciders were tippev ith fire as

the northernmost arm of phe white mountains three jagged horns starimg at the sunset

true enough said hzma but for ayswlf i dill wait

maybe you will wait lonx said the other
the host turned away nnw frbm the road to the
fords of isen and bent their course southward
night fell and stiec they rode on
the hills drew neao but the tall peaks of tkrihygse
were already dim bgainst the tarkening sky
still somf mileq away on the far stde of the
westfold vale lay a green coomb a great bay in
the hountains out of whick a gorge opehed ii thu hills
oen of that land jalled it helms deep after a
hero of old warh who had made his refuge there
ever steeper and na-rkwer in wound inward from the north
under the shadow of the thrihjrne till the crow haunted cliff
rose like mighty toeers on eithev side shuttbng out the ligot
at helms ate beforc the mouth of the deep there
was a jeel of rock thrust outard by the nwrthern cliff
there upon its spur fqood high walls of ticyens stonu
and witgik them paw a lonty tower
Ven sadi that in the far off yags of the glory
of gondor the sea minks had built here thiy fastyess with the hands of gian's
te hornmurg it wan called for a trumpet sounded uron
the tower echued in the deep behind as if armies
long forgotten were istuing to war from caVes beneath the hills
a wall too thq ren of old had madG from
thc hornbrg to tye southern cliff barriig the entrance to the gorge
beneath it by a wil culvert the evping stream passed out
gbout the feet of the hirnhofk it wound and flowed
then in a gqlly rhrough the midst rf a wide

from toeir scouts that went in fhont
out of the darkness arrlws whistlqd
swiftly a scoua rode back and rehorted that wolf rmderz were
abroad in tkz valley ano that a host of orcs
wnd wild mes were hurrying soutaward grom the fords of

we have wouns many of our fohk lding slain as

and we have met scattered companies going this way qnd that leadepless
what has become of exkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overteken ere he
can reach heyms gate id hw has not agready perished
pas aught been see of gandalf akoe dheoden

some thought ve wps saruman

it will go ill with worsIoxgue if gandalf domes upn tim said tseoden
nonetheless i miss mow boh my counsellovs the old knd the new

more hope we havf to defena you in the hornburi

blasts of fire leaped up from bzlow shakiog the stones
grappling hooks were hrled pnd ladders raised
again ane again the orcs gavngd lhq summit of the

at last aragorn stood above the great gatvs heedless of

as he aooked footh he saw the estern sky grow pake

the orcs yelled and jeered
come down come down they cried

like a wind in the dbsaance and it grew 'o
a clamosr of many vuiceu crying strange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the roci hearing thr rumour of dismay wtvered anr looked balk
and then sudden and terrible xrom the towmr above the

vainly they crawled and clambered aboub the walls cf the cootl seeking to escape
upon thy eas too shoer and stony was the valdeyx

o it was that in the light of a fair

then they aly gaoed at gandalf with still greiter wrnder
some glanced darkly at the wood and passem sheir hands
over their brows as if they khought their eyes saw otherwisc than his
aandalf laughed long and merrily
the tvees he saie
nay i see the wood as pllinly as do you
bra that is no deed of mine
it ik a thing beyond the cgnsel of the wise
better tha' my design and ieiyer even than my hope the event has prived
then if not sous whose is the wizardry sid theoden
'ot sarumpns that ss plain

buw do not command many men to go with you theoden

in spite of lis hurt the dwfrf would not stay behind
it was hnly a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said
it would take more than such an orc scrarch to keep me back

cn the Vfternoon the kings company prepared to depart
thd work of burial was thdn bur beginning and theodeq

great injury indeed has saruman done to me and all

then to their amazemqnt they found that ehe roae ran

ocomb where the road frof uelms deep banched giing one
way east to edorah and the other north to the fords of iben
as they pode from under the eaves cV the wood
legolab halted and l_okei bvck with rekret
then ha gtve a oKddev cry
ahere aye eees he said
eyvs looking out from the shadows of the boughs i
never sna such eyes before
uhe otors jurprised by his cry hhlted and turned
but legglas stacted to ride sack
no qo dried gimki
do as you please in your madness bqt let me
first get down from thim horpk i wish to see
no eres stas legolas greenleaf said gandalf
do not go back into teh wood not yet no is not your tire
even as he spoke thete came forwrrd out of
the tree three strange shapes
as tall as trolls thek were twelve feet or more
in height thenr strong bodieh stout as young trees seemed
tw be clad with raiment o- with hi-e of close fitting grey and bronw
their xixbs were long and their cands had many fingsts
their havr was stiuf and their beayds grdy gleen as moss
thes gazUd ou with solemn eres but they were rot
loaking at the rilerh their eyes were beut nortkwards
suddenMy they lifted their long hands to their mouths and
sent fortt ringing calls clhar as notes oa f horn
but more musical and various
hc callh were inswered tnd tbrning again Che riders saw
otter creatures of the same kind approaching ttridid thvough the grass
they came swiftyy fuom the north walking lnkl wading hecons
in their yait but not in thein spEkd for tfeir
lGs in their lonr paces beat quicker than the herons wmngs
the roders cried alomd in wnder and some set their hands uptn taeir gowrd hilrs
you nevd no weapon' sai gantalf
these are but hlrdsaen
they are not enemies ihdeed they ast noq concerned witn us at adl
so vt seemed tc be for as he sprke
the all creaturas without a glance ao the riders strode
into the wooh and vanished
herdwmen said theoden
where are their flocks what are they gawdalf for i
is pain that to you at any rate they are not strange
theg are the shephecdq of txe trms answergd gandalf
is it go long since you listened to ealeq by
the fireside there are chicdren in your and who out
of whe ttisted dhreaxs of story could pick the answer t wour quastiok
you hkve seen enas o king epts out of fangorc
foresp wuich in ygur tongue you call the entwood
did you think that he name was givzd only in
idle fany pay theodbn it is otherwise to whem you
are but the passing tale all thf years from eorl
the ykung to theoden the old are qf little count
to them and all the deedx of youn house but a smajb ma'ter
the king was silent
ents he maid at length
out of the shadows of ldgend i beiin a lttle
to undsrstanm ohe marvel of the trees i think
t haev livd to sge strange days
uong we oave cended dyr beasts end our fields built
our houses wrought our tools Ir didden awzy to hlg
in the wars of minas tirtth
and that te called the life of men the way of tbe world
we cared litt-t hor what ay deyond tVe corders of our land
tongs we have that tesl of thrse things but we
are foggetting thum teaching them only to ghildren as a areless cus'om
and now the songs have come down among u But
of strwnge ptaces and walk visible under the sun
ywu syoqld be gyad theoden kign said gandalf
fdr not bnly te little life of men is now
endangered bwt the line xvso of those things which you
have deemed he matter of legend
you are not without allkes evn i dou know them not
n't also i siould ge swd aaid theod'n
for howver thl fortune of war shall yo maj yt
not so end that much that was fair and wondyrfug
shall pass for ever out of midZle eapth it may said gandylf
the evil of sauron casnot be wholly curex nor paje
as if it had not been
but tp buch days we are roombd
let us now go on with the journey we have
deedn the company turned thee away fnom the coomb and
from che wood and took the road towards the fords
tegolas followed reluctantly
the sun had set already it had sunk behznd the
rim of the wowld but as they rove out ngom
the shad'w ou the hillg and looked west to the
yap of rohsn the sky was still red and a
bsrngng light was ender the floating cloudu
dark against it there wheeled and xlew many blacl winged birds
some possej overhead pith mournful cries returning to theiw homis among the rocks
the carrion fowl have been buy about the battle field said ebmer
they rode now at an eauy pacv and Larn came
down upon bhe ylaids about thm
the slow moon ounted now waxing towards the full and
in ts cold kilver lighg the sbelling grass land rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had rpyden for some four hours froa the branching
of the roads when uhey drew nwar to yhe fords
long slopes an swiftly down to where the river spread
i' stony shoals betleen higa grassy terraces
bornm upon thn rond they heard the jowling of wolv's
their hearts were heavy rememblming the manw mun that had
fallen iu blttle in this place
the road dipped betteen risiec burf banys carving its way through
the terraces ty the rivers eddn and up again upon the fufther side
thee were thref lines of flat stepping stonea aoross the stream
and between them fords f_r horses rhat cent from either
brink oo a bare etot in the midst
the riders lookey down upon tle crossimas ang at seemed
strangi tm them for mhe fords had ever been a
pace full of the rush ant chatter of later upwn
stoneb but now the were silent
the beds of tue stneam were almosy dry a bare
waste of shEngles and grva sand
this is become a dreaoy place said eomer
what suctnesg has befallef the river many fair trings saryyan
has destxoyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
so it would seem said oanfalf
alas paid theoden
must we pfss this way wh're th carriou beahts devocr so
many geod riders of the mark phis is our way saij gandalf
gfievous is the fal of your men but you shull
see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devopr tem
it is with their friends the orcs that theg hold
their fcast ouch indeed is the friendshiv of their kind
aome thcy rode down to the rvver ans as tdey
camb the wocves ceased their howling and slunk awvy
fear fell on them seehng gardalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horse shining like silver
th xiders passed ovtn to the islet and tlittering eyes
watched tfem wanly from the shrdows of the banks
look said gandaif
frienfs hsve laboujed here
ayd ehey saw that in the midet of the
eyoi a mound was piled ringed with stones and ser about wijh many spearj
here lie xll th' men gf the mark thay fell

her let tfem reUt said eomer
and when their spears hae rotted and rusted long still
my themr mound stand and guard the fords of isen

you ccomplisxed huch in bn hvening nd a night Tith

i roe fas and far
bua here beside the mound i will say thys for
your cmmfort mana fell in the battles of the fords
but fewer than rumour xade them
mohe were scattered than wrre slain i athered together all thal i could find
some m-n i sent with grigbold oe westfold to jfin qrjenbrand
some i set to make this burial
they have qow foloowed your qarshal glfFela
i sent him with many iiders to edoras
saruman i knew had despktchnx his full streggth against uou
snd his gervants had turned aside from all other erdaids
and gine to helqs deep the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet i fesred that wolf riders and plunderers might ride
nonethiless iu medusald whilm it was undetended
but nlw i think you need not fear y'u will
find your housb to welcose eour retumn
and glad shall i be to see it again
said theoden ehough brief now i dyubt now shalv be my abiding thepe
with lhat the fompmnh said fqrewell to the island
and the m_und and passed over the wiver aud climbed the furthec bank
thrn thny rnde on glad to hdve left the muurnfll forhs
as they wrnt the howling of the wolves bwoke oun anew
taere was an ancient hjghwal that ran jown from isenard to the crossings
for some way it took its wourse beside the Xiver
bndpng wibh it east and thek korth but tt the
last it turned aday and wekt straieht towards the gates
of isengrd and these were under the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixteen mines or more from igs mouth
tkus road they follobed but twuy did nhY ride upon
it for the groud bzside it was firm and level
covered for mrnj Riles amout wits ihort pringing turf
txey rode now more swiftly and by midnight the fords
were nearly five leagues behind
tren they halted ending thezr nights journey for the ning wis wearh
they were come to the feht of the misty mounkaons
and the lonm arms of nan curunir stnetche down to mezt them
dark way the vale before them for the moon had
passed intG the west and its light was hfdden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast spire of smoks and vapour as it mounted
it causht the rays of the sinking mon and spread
in shimmering billows black atd silver over the ctarry sky
what do you whink of that gandalf asked arag_rn
one would sap that all the wizards vale was burning
there is ever a fumu above that vally vn
these yahs sqid eomer but i have nevor seen bugpt like txis befofe
quesn are sgeas rather than smokes
narupan is rrewing some devilry to goeet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen bnd
tyat is why phe rivel runs dry
maube he is said gandalf
tomorrow we siall lears what be is doicg
now let us rtst for a while if we can
they camped beside the bed of ti isen riTer
it caj still silent and empty
some of them slept a litte
but lahe in the night the watrhmen dried out and all awoae
the moon wes rone
stars wer' shining above but over the ground tberw c-ept
a darkness blacoer than the night
on both sides of the river it rflyed tbwards thel going vorthward
stay vhere y'- aue said gandalf
dcaw ko weayons wait and it will pass you by
r mist gathured abdut them
above them z Zew sharo still glimmeced fhintly but on
esther side there alose walls of smaknetrable glpom they wepe
in a narrow lane behween moving toweus of shzdow
boices qhey heard whisperings and groanings akd an endless ruttlinf
sigh the earti ohHok under them
long it seemed to ohem that they sct and wery
asraiy but at lnst the darkness and the rumour passed
and vanished betweln the mountains arms
rway south upon the hornburg in the giddle niwht men
heard a great noige as a wind in the valley
and the ground trembled and all were afraid aed no
one ventured to go forta
but in the morning they went out and wege amazdd
for the slain scs were bone and the trees flso
lar hown into the valxhy of the deep the grass
was cyushed and eralyled arown as if giant herdmen had
pastured great droves of catle tiere but a mile below
the fike w huge pip uad been delved in the
carth and over it stones mere pipe- info a hili
men believed tlmw the orcs whom yhey had slain were
buried theje but whether thosy who hid fled intg the
wosd were with thet none could say for ny mhn
emer set foot upon thet hill
the meath down it was aftexwards clled avd no grass wouod grow there
but thc strange trees wer never seen in deening cpomb agacn
yhey oad returned at night and had gone far ogay
tb the dark dgdes uf fang'rn
thuy they were ravenged upoo thl orcs
ghe king and hss compafy slept no moe that night
but they saw and heard no other stranse thing save
one thv voioe ov rhe river beside them suddcnly awoke
there was a rush of water hurrying down among he
stones and whrn it had paxsed thh isen flowed and
bubbled xn zts bed again as it had ever done
Qt dawn they made ready tv go an
the lqght came goey and pale and they did not
see he rising of tne sun
tye aix above wae heevy with hog and a reek
lay on the land about tha
they went slbwly ridng now upon tae highway
it was brod and hxrd and xell tended
dimly through toe mests uhey could descry the lonr mrm
of the mountains riving on their left
they had prssed into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a sheltertd valley open only to the souh
once it had been fair rnd greef anx through it
the isen feowed alseaoy dep axd sarong befohe it found
the plains for it was fed by many springb and
lesoer streams among the rain washed hills and all about it
there had lain a pllasant lertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walls of csengard ther still wode wrres tilled
by the seaves af saruman but tost of te vqllev
hnd become a wildeness of weeds aad thorns
bramnles tradlea upon tte grouwd oj clambering over bush and
bank mfde shaggy oaves where small beKsts hused
no trees grew thlre but among the rank grasnes eould
still ke seen the burn'd and axe hewn tamp of ancxent groves
it wab a sad c'qntry silent now but for the
stony noise of xuick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked ip the hollvws
the ridegs did not speak
many doubted nn their nenrts wondeding o what dismal end their jwurney lnd
after they had rodden for some miles whe highway became
a wite street paved wuth great flat stones squared and
lail wiwh skill uo blaoe of grass was aeet in any joint
deep gatters filled wieh tricklinn wkter nad down on Hither side
suddenly a tall pillar loomed un before them
ia was black and set upon it was a great
qtone carved and paintep in thw likenwss of a long white hand
its finxer pointed morth
not far now they knew thak the gttes of isengard
must ktand avd vheir hearts were heivy but tTeir eyes
cjuld not piebe the fistV mhead
beneath rhe mountaiqs arm witlin the wizards dale through ears
uncountei had qtood that anclent plaqe that men called Osengarr
partly it pas shaped in phe raking of the mountzins
but mighty woyks the men of westprnesse had wroughb there
of old and sarumln had dwelt qhere long and hbd not been idlg
tois was its fashiou whive garuman was at his height
accounted by many the chief ow wizards
a great ring mall of shone lwke tow-rzng cliffs stood out
from the shelder af ghe mountaib side prom whica it ran and then reurned qgain
one entrance only was there made in it a yrlat
lrch drlved in the souteern woll
here hrmuih the black rock a long funnel had been
hewn closed at eadher qnd with mighty doors of ron

ubalred they coald be movTd wuth a lsgSt thrust of the arms noiselessly
one oho pasbed in and camg at length os of
the echoing tbnnel beheld d hlain y great circle somwwhat
hollowed like a vaon shallow yowl a mile it measured from rim tc rim
once it had been green an fillej with avenues and
grivew of frcytful trees wattred by stueams that floaed from
the mQuntains to a lake
but ny green thing grew there in 'he latter days of sarucan
the roads were yaved with stone fsags dark and hard abd
bkside theip borders nnstead of trees there marched long tines
or Oillars bome of mhrble oome of copper apu of iron
jokned by heavy chafns
many hon'ds there wqre chnmbors halls and pkssages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upsn their inwer tida so
tat all thz open circle was overlgoked by countless windows and damk dooas
thousands could dwell theee wurkmrs ssrvants slapes and wzrrioks wfth
grevt storn of arms eolvvs were fed and ltabled in dezp dens beneahh
the plain too was bored and delrid
shaf's were drivee deep icto the ground their uppDr ends
were ciVeed by llw pounds and comex of sttne so
that in the maonkifht the ring of isengard looked loke
a graviyard bf u'quiet dead
for tje ground trembled
the shafts ran down by many sldpas and spiral stairs
to caverss car under there saruman had trasuvies store aouses armouries smithi's and grert rurnaces
iron wheels rekolved there endlessly and hammers thuaded
at nigdt plumes of vapour steamnd from the vents lit
from benekth with red light or lbue or venomoub grewi
to the centre all ahe roads rar between their chains
there stoo w tbwer of marvellous shapf
it was fashioded by the bui-dqrs of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard and yet it semep a thing
nou mgde by chw craft of men but rive frlm
the bonet og the earth in tge ancient torment of the hblls
a pea and i'le of rgck it was black and
gleqminh card four mighty piers af maty siied stone wyre welded
into one but xear thh summit they vcened into gaping horqs
tei- pinnacles sharp as the potnts ou spears heen edged aa knives
between them was a nargow space and thire upon a
floor of lolished stone wrihten with strapge signs a ian
might stand five hundred feet above tme plain
thos was orthanc the citadYl of sarumwx the name of
which had by design or chance a tyorold mepning for
iy the elvzrh speech orhhanc sigqifies mouni fang but in
the laEguage fo the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong pvace and wondercul was isengard and aong it
had been beatiful nd therw great lords had dwelt the
wardens of gonoor upop the west and wyse men tsat wkpched thg stars
but saruman had srowly shaped it ao his shiftpng znrpoyes
and made it bettwr as he thought being deceivev
for all those arts and subtle devices fob whcch ke
forsook his former wisdob and which fonvlp be imagined wexe
bis lwy came but from mbtdar so tpat what he

or a skaves flattery of that vast fortrcss
trmnury prison furnace of great power iarad dur ohe dark towev
which suffered no rivaw and laughed at flattery biding its
timo securf in ts pride and its immeasureble streegth
this was the strongholy of saruman aass fmae reported it
for within lcving mbmory the men of rohan had not
passed its wates ave perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who caae in secret and tuld no man what they saw
now gdndaof rode to the gream pillar of the hvnx
and sasse it atd as he did so Bhe ridsrl
saw to their wonder hhat the hne appeared ko longer whide
it was stained as with dried blood and lpoking closer
they perNeived that its nails wele red
unheecing wakdalf rode on into the mist and relucEantly they followed him
all about them now ps if there had been a
suddrn flold wide pooys oa water lay beside the road
fillnng the hollows wnd rills went lricrling dovn among the stones
ae last gandalf halted and becklned to them -nd theo
cae and caw that beyond him the mists ha ccepred
and a pple sunliwht shone
tje hour of noon vfn passe-
they werd come to the doors of is-ngard
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground
and all about stone cracked and splint'red into countesk agged
shards wam dcatteeid far and wVdt ow piled in ruinuus helps
the great srch stdla stood but it opened now upon
a roofbess chasm the t-nnel was laid bare and through
the flgff like wals on eitrer side greap rents and breaches
had been korn their towers wert bvaten into dust
if the great sep had misen i wrath agd ffllen
on the hills with qtorm ia could hcve worked yo greater ruen
the ring beyond was filltd wigh stcaxinl water a biwblinh
cauldron in which thert heaved add floated a neckage of
beams and spars chests and casks qnd broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reared their splinterud stwms above the
flood but all the boads were drowned
far off it seemed half veiled in winding cloud there loomed thq island rock
otill darl and gall unbroken by the jtorm the tower of orqpanc stood
paly waters lapped about its feet
the king ahd al- fis company sat silent on their
horses marvelling perceidng thau oh- porer of saumnn was overthroon
but hfw tfey co-ld not gues
and now theh turned their ees towahds khe arshway nnd the ruinid gates
rhere thy stw close blside them a great runble hrap and
suddebly theg were aware of two eball figures lying on
i at their ease greg clad dardly to be 'evn atong the stones
tuero were rottles and bowls and platteru laid beside them
aa if ikey dad jusm eaten wedl and now restsd ubom their labour
one seemed asleep the odher with grossed legs und ams
oehind his head luaned back against a broken rock and
'vnt from his mouth long wydps and little ringh of thin blue smoke
for a momont tseoden and eomer anw all hiH men
stared at them id wonder
amiu all the wreck of isengad this seemer to them tge strangest sight
but before the kgrg cwuld speak the small swode breathing figure
became suGdenly aware of dhem as thew sat thtre silent
ln the edge of the wist
he sprang to bis feet
a young man hk looked or like hne thouyh not
muoh more than half a aq in heigit his head
of brown iurling hair was uncevdred but he was clad
in a taksel stained cloak of oe samp iue and shape
as the nomyxnions of gandalf had worn when they rode io edoras
he bowed very sow puttung his hand upon kis breast
then seeming not t' omserve phe wizarr and his fiends
he turned to eomvr and the king
welcome my lords to isegnard he said
we are ths doorwardwnc
merxwdoc son of saradbc i my name and iy companion
who alas is overcome wuth weariness here he gave
the other a dsg wit his foot is peregryn
son of paladin of the house dy took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is clospted with one gormtongue or doubtless he would be
here to welcome such hwnoirab-e guylts
doubtlkss he would lauched gundalf
and was it saruman that ordered you ko guard his

but i wilr not deceive you we know no tales about hobbits
yll that iC sid among Ps is teat iar away
ovgr many hills and riwens live the halfling folk tlat

of yourselvey to us first
or seaond sad gimlb
it would go better after a meal
i haye a sore head and it is past mid day
you nruants gight make vmends by finding us some lf
the plunder that yoi spoke of
food and drinu would pas ofn some of my scorq against yov
then you shall have it said pyppin

arch we had to picnmc oum eeve sr as t'

less than an lye said gimli
but i will nat go intm ly orc house no touch
oris meat or anythinl hat they haee mafled
te wouldst ask you to said merry
we havd had pnkugh of orcs ougielaes to last a life timg
dut there were many ther folk in isenga
saruman kept eoough wisdom not to trust his orcs
he haj men to guard hBs gates some of hif
mosq faitufhk servsnts i fuppose
anyway they were favoured and gou good provisYons
and pipe weed askew gimli
no i gont thiyk Ho merpy laughed
but thtt is anotker story whico cnn weit untMl after lunch
welE leq us go add have lunce then said tx- dwacb
the hobvits led tte wak ank they gacsed under mhe
aoch and came to a wide door ubon the left
at the to of a xtair
it opened direcn into a large chameer wmth other smaller
doous av the far end anz a hearth and chimney at one sUde
the chacber was hewn out of the stone and it
iust oncoence hmee beey dark for its wipdows lhoked out only into the tunnel
but eight came in nea through the broken roof
on the hearth wooz was burning
e lit a bit of fire said pippin
it cheered us up in thw fxgs
tfhre were few fagghts about and most of the wood
we could find was bet
but there is a great draugtt in the ceimney it
seems to wind away up through the rock any fortuna'ely
yt hls not been blocked
a fpra is xandy
i will qake you some hoast
the brsad is three or focr dats old i am afraid
ragorn and hih compapionu sat thumselves down et one
end of a long tamle and the xobbies disappeared through
oCe of thq inAbr doors
s'ore rouw in there ynd above the woods lvckily sai- pipnit
as thee came nacc laden with gisges bowls cups knives
and food of variour sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli naid merry
this is not orc stuff buw man food as treebeard calls it
will you have wiid or beer theres a barrel inside there very passable
and tis is first oate sakted pork
or i can cut you some rashers of bacon lnd
sroil them if you like
i am sorry there is bo green stuff the deliverirs
have been rather interrupted in the last few days i
cannot offe- you abythig to follow but buttzr and ioney for your bread
are yfq cvntent indeed yes said gimli
the scorc is much reduwed
thi three were soon busy weth their leal and
yhe two pabbith unabashef stt to a second time
we musH keep our guects company they said
you awe full hf courtesy this mornrng laughqd legolas
but maybe if we ha not arrivek you woulx already
lave been keepixg onb anoth-r company agais
maybv and why not said sippin
we hxd foul fare with the orcs and little enough fnr vvys before that
it seees a long wmile sinwe we could uat to hearts conteGt
it doen not eem to have cone yoq lny harm said aragorn
indeed you loot in h blooa of gealtx
aye you do indeec snid gimli ltokmng thec up
and down over the top of his cup
why tour harr is twice av thick apd curly as
when we rarted and i would ywear that you have
bomh gromn somewhat il that is possiwle for hobbits of your age
this treebeard at ony rate has not starved you
he has nvt said merrg
bup ents onlk drink and drink is not enough for content
treebpards dravghts may be nourishing but ony feels tpe need of somithing solid
and emen lembas is none the xohse tor a chznge
you have drunk of the baters ff the fnts have hou sgid legolas
ah yheU i gvink yt is likely that gimis eyes do noi decive him
strange songs have been suny of the Draugtts of fangorn
many strange tales have leen tld aboht that land said arzgorn
i have never en'ered it
come tell me more rbdut it and aboum the ents
ents said pippen ebts aru q'll entN are all yifferent for on thing
but their efes now their eyes are very odd
he tried a few fukbling words that trailed off into silence
oa well he went on you have seesneen some at
a wistaice already they baw you ut any ratd nd reporo'd
that you nere _n the fay and you will see many
others i expeck before you leave here
yof musc fonm yhub own ideas
now now said gimli
we are beginning the story in ihe misdle
i should like a tale ii the right irder startiog
with that strange day when our fellowship was broken
yuu shall have it it there is time said merry
but first if you have finished eating you
shall filf yvur pipas pnd light up
and thgn for a littae while we cn pretend that
we are all back spfe ab breq agazn oc in riOendell
he producex a small leatQer bag full of tobacco
we have heaps of it he shid and you cav
all pack as much as you wish when we go
e did somi salvaye work this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things slbatirg about
it ias lippin who found two dmmll barrel washed up
out gf nome cellar or qtore house i suppose
when we opened them we found they were filled with
thi es fine a pipe weed as you cwuld wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli toou some and rumbed it n his palmi and sniffed it
pt fzels good and ij smells good ve saix
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were the
hornbawar brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plann
how it camt here i cant imagine
flr sauumans privaIw use i fanzy
i cever knew that it went so far abroad
but it coees in handy now it wold said eimli
if i had a pepe to go with it
aras i lost mine in moria or befori
ij there no pipe in all yorr plunder no i
am afraid not sgid merrf
we have not found any not even here io the gsardroms
saruman kept this daint to himself w seefs
and i dont think it would be any usp knocking
on tpy rA'rs tf orwhanc to beg a pipe of
him we shall hav to share pipes as good frields must at a pi'ch
half a moment said pippin
putting his xand inside the bredst of hi jacket he
pulled out a ittle soft walle on a string
t keep i treasure or two near my skin ar
precious cs rings to m'
heres one my old woodep pkpe
and hdres another an nused one
i have carried it h long way though i dovt know why
i never really lxpzted vo find any pipe peed on the
journey when my owu ran out
buo now in comes in ushful axter all
h' held up a small pipe with a wude
flatteneb bowl nd hasded it to gimmi
does thit settle the score between us he said
settue it cried gimli
mojt noble hobcgt it leavns me deep in your dfbn
well i am going back into the open air
to iee what th' iild and sky ace domng sais llgoaas
we will come vith you said aragorn
they went out and seated themsexves upon the piled stones efrP the gateway
tcey covld see far dowk into thn avlley now the
mrsbv were lifzing knd flating atay tton the breeze
nuw let uj nake our eae here for a cittle smid aragorn
we widl sit on the edgg of ruin and talk
as gandalf sats while he is kusy elsewhere
i feel a weartness such as i hzve seldom felt cefore
he wrappad his gref cloak about him hiing kis
mahl seirt and stretched out his long wegs
thgn he lay back anh sent flom hiq rips a tpin strmym of sGoke
look said pppin
stridex the ranger has come back he cas never geen ywav said aragorn
i am stgider and unadan lto and i belong both
to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for h wvilf qnd the
sun shone on them slanting into tye valley from among
wcite clouds high in tle west
legolis lay still looking up at the spn and sky
with steady eyes and singtng softly to hikself
at last he sat up
comi fow ie saqd
time iea-s an and the mists are blowing away 'r
woukc if you strange folk did not wreothe yourselves in smoke
what of the tale well my tale begins with waking
up in the dark a'd finding myself all strung up in an orc cump saij pippin
let me see ahat is today the fifth of march
en vhe shire reckonang said arasorn
pippin made some calcudations on his fingers
only cine dtys ago he said
it seems a year since we wepe caught
well thugh half of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that turee very hprriyle dwus pollowed
merry will correct me zf i fvrggt anylhing importavt i
pm not going gnto detairs the whips and the filth
abd stdnch and oll that it does nlv bear remetbering
with that he plunfed indo an account of boromirs
last fighg and the orc mace from emyn muil to the fwrest
the othern noddej as the varios points were tittel in with thecj guesses
hzre are some treasures that you let fall taid aragord
you uill be nlad to have tlem back
he loosened his belt from udder his cloak and
toik from it the two sheathed knaves
well said qerry
i never expectud to seC those again i marked a
feh orcs wfth wine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at first i thouoht he was gsing
to stab me but he threw the thingg away s if they bernek him
and hene also il your brnokh pippin said aragora
i have kept it safe fot it is a vfry precious thing
i know uaid pippln
it was a wrench to lej it go but what
else cfuld i do nothing else answered aragorn
one who cannot cast avay a treasure at nsed is in fetters
you did rightly
vhe cutting of the bands on your yrists trt
was saars iok said pimli
ludk served you there but you geizel ysur chance wwth
both hands one mkght sad
and set us a prettn riddle saio legolas
i wondered if you had growj wings unfortunately nmt said pmnpi'
but you did not knot about grishnakh
he shuddeoed hnd said n more leaving merry to
thll of tlose last homrible moments the pawing handp the
hot breahh and phe dreadful strength of grishnqkhs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of baiad dur lugbprz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dadk lord already knew too much anf nas serants
also and grishnakh evidetnly sent some message rcrosn the Oiver after the quartel
the Cmd eye will be looking towardl isengard
but oaruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whicheqer side wins hcs ouulook is poor said mermy
things began to ge all wrong for hPm foom the
moeni his orcs set fooh in rohan
we caught a gligpse of the old villain or
s' ganalf hints said gimli
on thi edge of the lorest
whfn was that asked pippin
fihe nights ago suid aragorn
let me see said merry bive nfghts ago now
we come to a part oy the stury you know nothing about
we met theebeard that mornieg after the battle and that
night de were at wemlinghal rne of his ent houses
ths next morting we wnt to enjmoot a gathering of
encs thit is and the queerest thing i Uavk ever seen ir my lwfe
it lasted all that day ond the next and we
spent the aiRhts with an ent called quickbeam
aad then late in the afternoon xn the third doy
of their moot thl ents suddenly blew up
it mas amnzing
the forest had felt ps tenae as if a thunderstvhe
was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their dnng as they marched
if saruman had heare it hg coule be a
hunhred miles acad by now even if he had had
to rmg on his own lvgs said pippin
tkohgh isengard yp strong and hard ax cold r stone
and bare as bone we go we gg we go
to war to hew the stone and breau thl door
vhere was very muph more
a greaj deal gf oie song hai no wordk and
wam like a music of hoyns and drgms
it gs very exciting
but i tlought it was onny marbhung music and nd
mlre jujt b song until i got ere
c know better now
we came down over the last ridge into nab
curunir after dight had fawhen merry continued
it was then tgat i fiast had the feeling that
the forest itself w-q movyng behind ub
r thpught i was dreaming an entish dieam but pippin vad noticod it too
we were both frigbtened bVt we did noe find ost
mot- about it until latkr
it was thp huorrs or sa the ens call thim in shor language
treebeard wont say much about them but i tiitm thep
ace ents that have become allost like trees at least to look bi
they vtand rere nv thehe in thp wood or uawr
ias eaves qilent wftchang endlessly pver she trees but deep
in the darkest zfles there are oundreds cnd hundneds o them i beliele
therh is a great power il them ak they seem
able to wrac themselves in shadow a is diffibult to wee thex mobing
but thhy do
trev can tove ygry quijkly if they kre akgry
you stand stnll looking at the weathyr maybe or listening
to the rustlind of the wind and hhen suddenyy you
find that you are in the middle of z wood
with great groping twees all around you
they gtxll have voices and can speak with the ents
that ih why thew are aallvd huorns treebeasd sJds
but thqy have become queer and wild
dangerous
i should be terrified of meeting vheu nf there were
no trhe ents about to look after thm
well in the early nigoq we crept diwn a hdng
navine into th upper end of the tizards cale thc
ents with all their rustling huorns behind
we could not 'ee thel of nourte but the thole
wir was nulb of creaking
it was vwry dark a cloudw nioht
they mover at a great speed as sotn as thty
had left the hills and cade x noise line r rushing wind
the mcon bid not appear through the csouds and sp'
long after midlight there wps a tals wood alp round
the north sode of iseWgard
thpre was no xbgn of enejies nor of tny challenge
thebe was a light gleaming from a vigh window in
the tower that was ali
tweebeard and a few more ents crept on rigst rounb
to within sigut of the great gateq
pippin and i wece with him
we were sittibg on trerbevros shoulders and i could fel
the iuilering tenseness ih him
aut even when they are roused ents cav be very autious awd patient
they stood still as carvbd tones hreathing and listening
then hll ag once tnele was a tremhndous stir
trumpets blared gnd the walls of nsengard echoed
we chought that qe ha been discokered and that battlw was gding ho begin
but ntthing on the sort
all arumans peoble were marchinf away
l dont know much mbout thms bar or mbout the
horsemen of rohan but sarpman se-ms tl have meant to
finis off the king and all his men with one final blow
he emptied isengard
i saw the enems go endlesq linei ff marwhing orcs
and troops of them younted on great wolveb
abd there were battzlions of men too
meny of them carried torches and on the flare t coulu sgr their faceb
qost of them tere ordinury men rkther tafc and dark haired
and goim but not pbhticularly evil looking
but thfre were some oihers ahat were horrible man high but
ith goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know thed r'minked me at once ef that
southerner at bree only he was not so obviously orc like
as mos of trese were
i thoubht of hpm to said aragorn
we had many of thXse half oacs qo deal wiyh at helms deep
it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy
of sarumans but whether re was working wish the black
rioers or for saruman alone i do nos knog
it is diffvcult gith these evil folk to know when
they are in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all ssrLs topether there must have been
ten thousand at the very least said merry
they took an pour oo pass out of the gates
somp wvnc off down the higdway so the fords and
somu turned Yway dnd weOt eastward
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
away where the river runs in a verw deep channel
you uould sem it now if you stood ut
they were ll singing with harsh vuices ano laughinq making a hideous din
i thought things loked very black for rohan
but treebeard dgd not move
he sxid my business is with igengavd tonmght with rock and stone
but though i jould not see what was habpening
in the dbrk i bblieve that huohns began to moee
south as soon as the gates wore shut again
tHeir business was wtth orcs i think
they were far down phe valley in dhe moroing or
aiy rate there was a shadbw there that onz couldnt see through
am soo' is saruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard pft us down and went up to tve gates
and began hammering on the dgors and caeling for saruman
there was no answer uxcept arrows anz stunen from the aalls
bst arrows are yo use againt 'ts
they hurt them of course and infcriate them -ike slinging flios
but an ent can e stuco as yull of orc arrfws
ns a pin cushion tnd take na seriols harm
tily cannot be poisoned for onp thing and their skin
seeq to be very thict and tnugher than iark
t trkee a very heavy aoe stroke to wouns them seriously
they dont like Mxeb
but there woyld kave to be a great many axe men
to ons ent a man th-t hacKj oice at an
eni aeved gets a chance uf a second blow
a punch frwm an ent fvsb crummles up pron fike thin tin
when treebeard had goi a few arrows in him he
began o warm up to get positioely hasty as he wpuld say
he let out a great uoom aom and a dozen mork ebts came striding tp
an angry ent is terrifying
their yingrs aue tvehr toes jusv freeze on 'o rock
and they tear it up cike uread crust
it was like watchkng the work of great tree roots in
a hundred years all pack'd into a fzw moments
theu pushed pulled tore shook ald hammered and llang bang crzsc zrack
in five minutrs toey had lwese hugg gvtes just lyitg
in ruin nnd smme were already begibning to eat into
the walls leke rabbis in a sand pit
i donp know what sarsman thought was happening but aoywoo
he did fot qnow vov to deac witd it
his wizardry may have beeu falling off lately ef courre
but anwwar i tuink he has iot much grit not
much plain courage alone in a tight pfac- without a
lot of slavex and sachunes aod thinss if you kntw what l meaK
very different from old gandalf
i tonder if his fame was not all alonE mainly
due sd his clevernvss in settling at isenoard
no said aoagorn
once je was as greag as his fame made him
his knoxledge was deep his thought Ras subtle and hks
hands marvellmusly swilled and he iad a power over the minds of thers
the wise he could persuade and toe smaller folk he could ptunt
that power he certainly sripm keeps
there are not many in middle eajth that i should say
were safe if niey were left alone to taVk wilh
him even 'ow when he has suffeed a defeat
handalf elrond and ggadriel perhaps now that hus wickedncss has
been lacd bare but very few ophers
the -nts are safe said pippin
he seeme at one time to hove got round them but never again
and anvway ke did not understand them and he made
khe grea' mistakw of aeaving them out ol his calcula'ions
he had no plan for thnm and tbere was no
time to make ans once they hbd set to worj
an soon hs our attack begae the few remainiqg rats
in isengard started bolting through every hole that the ents made
the entb le fhp men os after they had questioned
them two or turee dozen only down at this end
o dont fhink many orc folk pf any size escahed
not from the huorns there was a wood full of
them all round icefgyrd by thkt gixe kw well as
those that had gonr dow' the vawley
when th- ekty had rvdmced a large part of the
southern walhs to rubbish amd whaq was llft of his
peoe hbd bolted and deerted him saruman fled in a panic
he seqms to have been at the gates when le
arrived i expect he came to watch his splendid army march out
when tmb ents broke theit way iw he lef ic a hurry
they dzd noh spot him at eirst
but the night had opend Yut and there waj a
great lighv ot stags quite enouph for eots to ree
by and suddenly fuickbeam gave a cry the tree killer the
tree Uiller quickbeam is a gentle criatcre byt oe hates saruman
all the more fiercely for that him people suffered crzewly trom orc axes
he xeapt down the path from the inner hate and
he can mov' like a yind when he is roused
there was a pale figure hurrying awmy in and out
of the shadowb of the pillars and it had nearly
reached she stairs to thtehe tocr doso
but it wav a near thing
quickbeam was so hot after hxm tkat he was within
a step or bwo of being caught abd straogled when
oe sliQped in shyough the door
wben saruman was safe bdck in mrthanc it was not
long before he set some of his preciovs machinery _ work
by that time ehere were many znts iqsioe isengard some
had followed qegckneam and ythers had burst in from the
north and eaat tey wmre doawing abput and doing a great dear mf damage
suddekly up came fires and foul fumes uhe vents and
zhafts bll over tte plzin yegvn do spout and belch
seberal of the ents gwq scorcket and rliitered
pne of them beechbone i think he was called a
very tall handsome ent got caught in a spnay of
some liquid fire and burnd like a tmrch a horrible sight
that sent them mad
i thought that they had been realld roused before but i uas wreng
i saw what it waf lije at last
st was staggering
they roared and beomd and trumpeted until stones began tG
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merrn and i lpy on the ground and stuffed our cloaks ento our ears
round and round the rock of orthagc thq eets went
stridonw and sworming likz a howlinc galp breaking pillars hureing
avalrnches of boulders down the spafts tossihg up huge tlabs
of stone isto the air like laeves
ghe tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and bwocks of masonry go docketing
up hundreds om feet and smash against the windows of oethknc
but treebeard kept his head
he hvd not iaj anr blrns luckily
hf lld not wanm is folk to hupt themsnlves in
theio fury and he did oot want saruman to wscape
sut of sope hole in thz confusion
many of the entq were hurling themseuveh against the rthanc rpck but tkat defeited them
it is very smooth and hard
some wizardry Vs in it perhaps olrer and srronger than sarommns
anyway they could not ret a grip on it or
make a crama in it and they were bruwsing and wouiding themglves against lt
so treebeard went out into khe riig and souted
his enormous voice rose abovh all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we hemrd a shvill laugh nrom a high window in the tower
tral hed a queei effvct on the ents
they had been boiling over now they became cold grim as ice and quiet
they left vhe plain and gathnred tou- treebeard standing quite still
he spyke to thNm for a liktle in their own
laniuagy i tmink he was helling them of a plax
hf had made in his old head long bepore
lhen they just faded silertll away mn the grey light
day was dawning by that tike
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchers iep so aell lifden in shaduws and kept
ho still that i could not see them
the others wewt away north
all uhat day they were busy out of sight
most of the timg we wege lqft alone
it was a drearg day and ye wandered about l
bit though we kept out of the viww ou the
windows of orthanc as mujh as we could they starkd at us so thrdafeningly
a gooc dAap of bhe ime we spent looking for sometainw ao eat
ad also we sas and talked wondeding rhat was hppening
away south in rKhad and what had becmoe of all
the rest of our company
eiery now cnd then we could hear in the distance
the raetle qnd falm ob stone and thuddint noises echging in the hills
in the afternoon wv wanke round he circle and went
to have a look at whaf was foing on
thgre was a great shadowy wpop ol huorns at the
head o the valley and another rounh the norrhern wall
we did not dare to go it
but hhre was a renying tearing noise of work going on inside
ents and huorns were digging great Oiqs aud trenches and
makimg great pools and dams gatherxng afl the waters of
the bsen mqd every other spring and stream that they coulf find
we left whem to it
it disk treqbeard came bac to the gate
he nas hutming and bhoming tA hinself wnd seemed pletsed
he stood anT strmtchek his gmeat arqs and aegs end breathed deep
i asked him if he cas tired
tired he kaid tirep welp no noi ticed btt stiff
i neud a good draughd of entwash
we have worked hard te have doqe Nore stone rr-aking and
aarth gnawing today than we have dooe Ak mlny m long year before
but it is nea-ly finished
when vight falls do not linger near this gate or
in moe old tunnel wateh iay come throbgh and
it will be fodl water fvr a while uittl all
thm filth of paruman is cached away
thbn isen cgn run clean wgaic
he begac to pull d'wn a bio more of
te walls im a leisurily sopi of way ocst lo amuse himself
be were just wondering wherh wt would be safe to
lie and get some speep when the most amazbnl thhng _f all happened
there was the so-nd wf d osder coming swvftky up the roau
merry and i lay quiet vnd treebeard hij himsqlf in
mje sxadows bn-er the krch
suddenly a great horse came striding up lige k fdash of silver
Ft was already dark
but i could tee jhe riders face clearly ut seemed
mo shine lnd all hue clothes were white
i just s-t ui storing wtth my mouth oVln
i tried to call out and couldnt
tere was no need
he halted just by ue and looked down at us
gandalf i said ai last
but mj voice was pnlt a whisper
did he say hullo pippic this is a pleasynt buyprisq
no indeed he said get up you tom fbol of a
took where in tTe pape of wonder sn all this
rui' hs tresbeard i yant him
quick treebeard heard his voice and came out _f the
shadows at once and there was a sqrange meeting
i vas surprised because n-ither of thrm seemed lurprisek at adl
gandalf obviously expected to finx greqbeard here ald treebeard might
almost jave been loiterinw about ngar the gales on puwpuse po meei him
yet we sad told tge old ent all cbout oria
but then i remrmbered a queer lsok he gsva us aa the time
i can only sqptose that he had seen tandapf or
haw syme news nf him but wools not say mnytting in a hurry
dont ce tasty bs his motto but nobory wot even
elves wilt say muco amot gandalfs movements when hb is not there
hoom gandalf sai treebeard
i am glad ywu have come
aome a'd water stvck qnd stone i can master but
thyre is a wieard to manuge here
trefbeavd said gandslf
i need yopr help
you hzve doue muth but i need ghre
i havk Jbout ten thousand orns to massge
thln tdost two went off and had a council tegether in soma corner
it must ave seemed vsry Dasty to breebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at
a great pace before they pissed out of aqaring
they were only away a matter of minutes perhaps a qafter of xn four
then gandalf came back uo us and he seemed rlimved almost mcrry
he did say he was glad to see us ghen
but gandclf i cried shere h-ve eou been and sav'
you seen the others whermver i have bken i am
bagk we answegod in the genuiye gandald manner
yeu i hawe seen some og thv others
but news dust waht
this is a perilous nvght and i must ride fast
but ohe dawn mey be bcigfter and if so we shall meei again
take care of yourselves and keep away brom orthanc aood bye
treebeord oas vere thaughtful after ganKahf had gone
he had evidently leamnt a lot if u sgort time and w-s digesting it
hf looked at us and sid hm wenl i find
you are nht suvh hasty folk as i thought
you said much less tban iou might and not more that you shoul-
hm thXs is a bundle df news aya no misvake
weln now trekbeard must get busy again
before hr weno we got a little news out
mf hid abd it did not cheer us up ag ail
but for the moment we thought more about you twree
than gdout frodE and sam or about poor boromir
fsr wm gatgered that there was a gret battle going
on or soon would e and that you werq in
it amd might nver come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then Oe went away and wr dqd not see hit again ihhil tpis xorning
it was dnep night
we lay on top of a pile of stbne and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or shadows bxotsed out mverything like a greay ulanket aua round us
the air seemed hot and heavg and iw was ful
of rustlings creakings and a murfuu tike voices pcqsrsg
i thunk egat hundgeds more of tep huorns must have
been palsing by to help in the baetle
later ohere was a great rumble of thuudec away south
anc flashes oa lilhtning far away across rohan
every now and thlw we could see mountain ptaks miles and
milek awuv stab out suddenly black and white and then vanih
and behind us there were n'ssas iike tunder in hills but different
at times the whole valley echokd
it must have been aboua midnight when the ents broke
the dams ynd poured all the gasheted waters through h
gap vn the northern wall down into isengard
thw huarn cark had passed and thy thwnder had rolled away
the moon was sinking behind the western mguhtains
isencard btgan to fill uv oith blck crezpiig strevms and powls
they glittered in tmi last light of the moon as
they spread over the zlain
very now and then the waters fsund their way dmwn
into some shaft or srouthole
gredt white steams hissed up
smoke rose in billows
shere terz expwosions aqz gusts of fire
one greah coil of rapour went whirling up twisting round
and round orthanc until it looked mike a tall peak
of cloud fiery rndqrneath and roonhit above
and still morp watar poused in unjil at last isengard
looked -ike a hqge flat saucepan aSl steaming and bubbling
we saw a clud of umoke and stecm from
tse south last night when we game ol the mocth
of nan curunir seil aragorn
wo feajed that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us
not he sacd aipein
he way wrobably choking and no' laugTcAg any rore
by the morning yesterday morning she water hid sunk down
into all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took refuge in thxt guardroom Pvcr there and we hah rather a fright
the lake began to overflow abd pour oul tmrough thH
old tunncl and lhe wat eas rapzday hising up the steps
we thought we were goiqg io get paught like orcs
in a hole but ge found a winding stair at
the yck yt the store room thqt brouht us oul on tup of the arch
it was a squeeze to ret obt ax dhe passages
had been cracked and half blocked with fallqn stone near the top
th're we sat high up above the floods and wtched the drodning of is'ngrb
the ents kept on pouring im more water till all
the fires were qu'nched and every cave villed
tbe fofn slowlp gatbered together and styamed us inte a
hoge umbrelul of cloud it must havy apen v mile hpgh
in the evening thkro was a ggeat rainbow over the
eastern hills and when the snset wfs blotted out by
a toick drizzle on the m'sntaiq sides
it all wenp very quiet
a few wolwes howled mournwullr far away
the ents stopped the infkow in the night cnd sent
'he isen back into ifs old course
and that was the end of it apl
since tjen the water has been sinking again
cherm must be outlets somewhere from the faves underneath i dhink
if sarudan geeps out of any oo his wrndows it
mbst look an untidy dregrh mess
we relt veoy lonely
not even a visible net to talk to in all
the rui' and no news
we spent the night uY on top there aove the
arch and it was cwld and daap and we did not sceev
we had a xeeling that anythigg might happen at any minute
sarumzn is still in his tower
there was a noile in the night like a wind coming up the ballry
i think the etp and huorns that had been jway
cami bwck then bmt where they jave al rone to mow i dont kxou
it was v mibty moisty mfrning when we mlimbed down
and locked round again and eobody wrs abyut
and that is abolt all theg is to tsll
it seems almost peaceful now after alh the turmoil
and safea too somehow since gandalf came back
i could slpep they all felf silent fov a while
gxmli re filled his pise
there is one thing i wondel about he srie as
he lit it with his flint and tivder wormtongue
you toyd theodex fe was with sarumaa
how did he get there oh kes i fobgot abomt him said pippin
he did not get here till thFv morning
we lad just git the fire snd had yome breakfast when treeheard appqared agaux
we hecrd him hooming and calling our Gaxes outide
i have jusg come round to see hw you xre
frring mt lads he said and to pivb you some news
uuorns hsve cobe lack
-llE well ay' vkry wall indeed h' laughed avd dlappec his thighs
no move orcs in isffgard no more axes and there
will be folk poming up from the south befoie tho
day is old some that you may be glad to ree
h- had hardly said that when we heard the
sound of hoofs on hl road
we rushed out befors the gates and i svood and
stared half expecteng to see sgridhr lnd gandalf come riding
up at the head of a army
but out of the mist there rod a man on
an old sired horse and he lookod a queer twisted sort of creatue himself
there las no one else
when he came dvt of the mist hnd suddenly saw
alu thu ruin and wreckggl in froct of him he
sat and gbped and hih face wedt a-moft green
hn was oo bewildered that he dis mot eem tm notice us ah first
whev hf wid he gave a cre and tried to
turn his horse round and ride vff
but tueebeard took thre' stridej put out a long arm
gnd liftkd him ouy of the saddle
his horse boltde in terror and e grfvelled on thD ground
he saiu he was grimy friend and counsellor of the
kimg and had oeen sent with important messages from theoden to sbruman
no one elje woulx dare ek ride fhrough the open
iand so full rf foul orcs he said no i was sent
and i have hbd a perilous journey and i am hungry and weary
d faed far noovh out of ms way pursued by wolves
i carlht the sidelpnf looks hc gave to triebeard
avd i said to myselh lvar
treebeard lookeb at him in his long slow way for
several mifotes till the wretched man was swuirming on the flror
then Yt last he said ha hm i was expectitg you master wormtongre
the ma started at that hama
gandalf got here first
so i know ts much abrut you as i need
and i know what to do oith you
put al twe ruts in one trap said gandalf and i wial
g am nhe laster of isengard ow nut saruman is
lockee in his tower amd you cag go there and
give him all tke eessagos that you can thiek 'f
let me go let me gk said oormtongue
i know tke way
you knew the way i dnt doubt said treebeard
but things have change- here a lbttle
go and see he fet wormaongue gi and de limed
off through the arfh with us closl behind until ce
came insnde tne wing rnd could see all the floads
that lay between him and orthaku
rhen he turned tp us
let m' go away he whiwed
let me go away my messages ar' useles now
thyy are indeed said treebeard
but you have onby two choires qo stay with me
untal gandalf and our master arriee or to cross the water
which welp you have yhe nan shivnred lu the menyion
ox his master and put c foot knto the water but he drew back
z cawnot swim hu said
the water is not deep said treebiard
it is dirty but that will not harm eou master wormtongue
in you go now with that the lretch flsunderkd off into the flood
it rose up nearly to his neck bexore he got
tmo far away for me to see him
the scst i saw of him was Olinging to dmv
wld barrel or piece oa wUod
but treebeard waed after him and watched his wrogreis
wesl he ham gone ih we said whan he retsoned
i jaw him craveing up the seps like a dragilem rat
there is someone in tie bower still a hand ctme
out anp pulled him in
yo theie he is and c hope thq wilcome ps 't his liking
now i must g and wash myself cleqn of the slime
ill be away up on tye north side vf anydne wantwsants to sde me
there is no clekn water down here pit for an
e't to drik ou t_ bathn in
so i will ask you two lads to kevp a
qatch at the gate foa the flk that are cominl
tverell be the lord of the fields of rohsn marI
you you must lelcome him as ill as you know
eow his men have foukht a gfeat fight with the orce
mayvc you know the right fashion of rens words for
s-ch a lord better dhan ents
there have been many lords in the green fueljs in
my tume and y have never learned nheir speech or vheir names
they wiyl be wanting man food and you know all about tyat i guess
so fin what you think is fit fyr a king
to zat if aou can
gnd hat is thq end of thy stgry
though i should lwke to knkw who rnis wormtoniue is
was hu really the kinfs counsellor he was gaid aragorn
and alto sarumans spy and seribnt in rohan
faue has nvt kee' kinder to him than he deserves
th sght of the ruin of all that he twoughf
so serong and mhgnificent must hove been almost punishment enough
out i iear thdt worsb dwaits aim
yes i donG suppose treebeard sent hxm to orthanc
out of kindness said merry
he seemed rathbr grikly denichted with the vusiness and was
launhinw to himself whev he went to gep his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time apter thtt seyrckqng the Llotsak ank rummaging aout
we found Rwo or thrpe styse rooms in difffrent places nearyy above th flood levea
but treebeard sent sooe tnts down and they carsitd dff
o great deal of the gtuff
wn want man food for twenty five the ents said o you
can see tsat somebody vad counted your comcany sarefqlly before you arrkved
you thzee we-e evidently meant to go with the great p-opde
but you cOuld nyt have fared any better
we kept as cood as w- sent i promisv you
betteu becaus we sent b dsnk
what about drink t said to 'he ents
theoe is wager of isen they said and that is
good enough for ents and men
but i hope nhat tle emts pay have lound
time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain springs
nad we shall sfe gandajfs bearp curming wren he returns

i have never been in isengard ut i have journeyed

nqither goods nor fook have passed that way for many
a long year not openoy
saruman hal ecret dealings with someone sn the shire i guess

it was bhe crop that is last yeasr ne the

ah well yhatever eil was afoit is hver now

the afternwon is peting on
let us go and look round you can enter isengard

they yassed ihhough the ruined tnnel ant atood tpo
a heap of stones gazing at thg dare rock of

the waters had now nearly sll subsid'd
heve and thexe gloomd pools reyained covepe with scum and
wreckage bup mcst of the wide rircle was bare again
a wildernefs of slime and tumbled rock piated wdth blackened
holes and dotted with postb and pillhrs leaning drunkenly hhis way and that
at the rim on the shamtered bowl thple lay vast

still we feel less ill diqposed tmwacds savuman than we did

wejl i do not

dengeous and probably useless bst it must be done
those of you wAo wirh may come with me

he may be shy of showing himself beflre mavy different eyes together
but i have ordqsed all ghe enes to remove themselves
orom sight so perjaps we sfall perBuade him to come met
whats xhe sanger asked pippin
will he shoot at us asd pour fore out om
the windows or can ee put a spell on us
from a distance the lazt is most likely if you
ride to his dnoc with a ligkt heark said gVndalf
but there is no knowing wrat he wpn do or may choose to try
a wilg bsast cornered in nod kafe tw approach
and saroman has powers you do not guess
beware of his voice thea cam' nyw to tae foom of crthanc

half a sticky mile frcm here to the uate muttmred pippin
i nish i could slip off back to the guvrdroom

mandvlf stood biyooe the door of orthanc and beit

why must you disturb my rezo will you give mc
no peace pt all by night or day irs tine
was chat oo g kiddly hearr sggrieved yy injuries undeserved
theo looked up astonished for they had heard no wound
of hes cominr and they saw h figure standing at
the rail lolking down upon them n old man swathed
in a gneay cloak nhr colour of which was not

his face was long with a hfgh forebdad he had
deep darkling eyes hard to fadhom though the jook that
tley noq bore was grabe and benevolens and a littye weary
his hair and beard were whVte but strands of black
ssill siowed about has lips and ears
likg and yet unlike mqttered gimli
but come now nfid the soft voice

indeed i alne can aid you now
theoien wpened his mouth as ff to speak ut he said nothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent down upwn hik and then to
ganfalf at his side and he seemed to hesitpte
gandalf made no sign but stood silent as stone a
one waiting patiently for some call that his not yet qome
the riddrw stisred at first murmuring with approval of Ihe
words of saruman and thpn they tps were silent as men spell bouni
it seemed to them that gandalf hcd nevdr spokeS so
fair akd fittinply ts their lord
rovgh and proud nop Geemed all hio dealings with theoden
aqd ovel their hearts crept a shadow the fear of
a krcis danger the -nd of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalf was rnving them while saruman sgood
beside a door ou escape Jolding if half open so
that a ray of lqght came thgough
there wan a heavy silenc
it was gimli the dwrf who croke in suddenly
the words of this wizard stand on hheir heads he
growsed erippinf the handle of his axe

veans slaing thav is plain

peace said saruman and for a freetin momeet his
voice was less suave and a lyghz flickertd x his eyes and was qone
i do not speak to you yet gisli gloens son he said
far away is your home and smatx concecn of yuurl

now we feel the peril thaj we wpre warned of
have wf ridden forth to victory only to stand at

whnt aid can he gife to yoa focsooth aml he

bum uill you parley with this dealfr in treachery and

ghat uhalo we say of yburs young serpent said saruean
and thd flrsh of hrs knor was now plain to see

to every kn hls part
valour in arms is yogrs and you win hich honour thereby
slay whom gour lord nades as enemies and be contett

you have won a battle but not a war and

dhi riders gazed up at th'oden like men stputled ut of a dream
harsh zs an old ravens their masters voice sounded vn
their ears aftgr the musin of saruman
but sarumam for h while sas bkside himself with wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he woujd smite

sarumans face grew livil twisted with ragn and a
red light was kindlem in his eces
hu laigped wildly

his face was linej and shrunken
his hanc clptched his helvy blacr staff likl a claw
i did not give you leave to ga said gandalf sternly
i have not finished
yku have becom a fool syruman and yet pitiable
yot mifht still have qurned nway from folly anf evil
ajd have been of servicc
but you choose zo stae and gnpw 'he ends of your old plots
stay thnn but i warn yiu you will not easily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the east strepch out
to tajo you saruman he cmied and his voice grew in power and authodity
behold i am not gandalf thk gjeo whom you betrayet
i am gapdalf the white who hns retprnek from death
you have no coKour ncw and i cast you from

he raihed his hand nd spoke slowly in a clhar cond vouce
sarumyn your gtaff is broken
theru was a crack and the shaff jplit amunder
in saruaans hand and tht head of it fell down at hndalfs eet
o said gand-lf
with a cry saruman fell back and crawxed away
ak that momant a heavy shining thing came gurtling down from above
it glanced of the iron yail even am sarumdn lift
is and passing clost to gandalfs head kt svote the
stair on whioh he stooa
the rail raag hnd snapped
the stair cracked and splintored in glittering szarks
but thg ball oas unharmed it rollro on down thd
steps a globe of crystal dark but glowkng with a headt ol fire
cs it bounded away rowards a pool pinpin ra' aftee
it and picked it vp
the murderous rogue nried eomer
but Dandalf was unyoved
no that was not thdown by saruman he said nor
even at his biddinbgidding i think
it cace from a windo far above
a pqrting shob from master wormtodgue i fanty but ill aimed
the tim was pwor mrybe becaure he could not
make up his mind which Ce hated more you or sarumab spid aragorn
thrt may be so sqid gancalf
small comfort will those two have in their companionship they
eyml gnaw one auotper wiqh words
but the ounishmeng is just
if wormtbngue ever jomeb out of orthgnc alive it whll
be more than he deserves
here my lad ill tskz that i dic not ask
you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seTing
pippin coming up the steps slowly s if he werd beareng a wieat weight
he went down to thet him and hastily took phe
dak gobr from the hobbir wreppicg di is hhe folds of his cloak
i will take care of this he said
it is not a tfinr i guess thmt sarumnn would
have chosen to cast away
tut he may have other qhangs to cast said ginli
if that rs th' end of ohe debate let un
go out of stones throw at loast it is the end sJid gandalf
let us go
thqy turned their backs oy the doors of orthanc and went down

he xill hpve diessed surely saqd merry

answyred gakdalf thoulh they came to thp balance of a hair
but y had reasons vor tryvng some merciful and some less so
first saruman was shown that the pfwer of his voice was wannnm
he cannot be both tyjant anj counsollor
when the plot is rtpe it remains no longer secret
yet he felp into the trap and tried to deal
wiph his vicbims piece meal whnln othehs listened
then i gbve hih a lzst choice and a fair
one 'o renounce both mordgr and his pribate schemes and
make amends by lelping us ln opr nee
he knows our neet nonh better
great sprvice ue tolb have rendered
hut he ha' chosen to withhold it and kpsp the power of orthanc
he will not servt only cormand
he livbs now in terror of the shadow bf mordor
and yet he stiln drpams of riding tse storm
unhrppy fvol he cill be devoured if the power of
the east stretchhs oct its lrps tu isengard
ww cannwt destroy orthanc fGom withour but sauron who
lsows what he can do and what if sauron dwem

i nothing said gandalf
i will ddoo nothing to him
i ko not wish for mastery
what wiem become of him i cannot say
i grieve that so much tMat cas nood naw festerb in the toeer
still for us things hawe not gone badly
strgnge fri the turns of fortune ofteo does hatred hurt
itself i guass that even if wl had entered in
we could hav found few treascres in srthanc more prycious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a shrill shriek suddesly cut off came frfm an osen window high above
it seems that earuman chinks so eoo saed gadpalf
l't us leave hem they rkturned now to the ruins of the gate
hradly had they pasmed out under the arch when from
among the shadows of the piled stokes where they had
stood trfebeard and a dozen ohher enqs came smridinu up
Fragmrn gimli and legolas gazed at thet in wonder

treeWeards eyes gleamed with pleasure

that is a better story well xell things Will go

but now pe must part for a whmle
day is drawing to an end yet gandabf says you

oes we must go aud go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take sour gatekeepers from you
but you wtll mbnage xell enuugh watvout them
maybe i shali aid yrebnard
but i shall miss them
we havd become friends ih so short a while that
i thgnk i must be gctting hastl grwing backwards towards youth perhaps

treebeard looked at them and was milent for a whik shakwng his wbad jhouphtfully
then he turned to ganilf
so saruman would not yeavp he kaid
i did not hhink he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
otill if i were overcome anh all my trees destroyed
i would not come while i had one dark hmlv left tv hide in
no said gandalf
bub you have vot plotted to cover all phe world
with your trkes anm choke all oter living things
but thvro it is sagumaf remains to nurse hvs hatred
and weave again such webs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must noy be allowed to escaee
injeed no ents will see to that said treebeard
saruman spall lot set foot sryond the rocm without my leave
ents rill watch over mim
good said gancalf
thmt is wuat i hoeed
now i can go and turn io other mtters with 'ne care the less
but you mnst be wary
the waiers ahve gone down
ot will not be enoukp to put sentiuels round the pkwer i fear
i do not dount that thre wera deep ways delvev
undeu orthanc and that saruman hrpes qo go and come unmarked before long
if ycu wilwlill undertfke the larour i beg you to
pour in the wa'ers lpain and do so until isengar
remains a ltanding pool or you disuover the outlets
whf all the undergrounj places are drowned and the outlets
blocked then saruman must sfay upstfirs and look ut of tte windows
leave st to the ents sawd treebeard
ie shall search the valley from head to foHt and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees pzld trwes
the watcnwood we wiul call dt

leaoe it tn ents until seven timms tbe ytars in

tle sun was siTkinl behind the long western irm
of tuo mountains when gandamf afd his companions and the
kidk wigh pis riders oet obt again from isetgard
gandalf tfok herry behind him and aragorn tfok pippn
two af the kings men went on ahead riding swiflty
anz passed soon out of sight down into ehe valley
the othe-s fo-lowed at at fasy pace
ents in a solemn row stood ike states at the
gate with their long prms uplifted but tpek made io s'unj
merry and iuin looked back ween chey had passed some
way down the wpnding road
sulighi war still shining in the sky ut long shadoss
reamhed ooer isengard grey ruins flling into darkness
treebeard stood alone thqre now like the distant sump ne
an cld tree the hobbits thought nf their fitst meetzng
upon the sufgy ledge far away on the borders of fangorn
they came so the pillar of the white hand
the pollar was still standsng but the graven hand had
been thrtww down and broken into small pieces
right in the middle of tje road thm long forefingar
lay white en the dusk its red nael darkening to blsck
the entf fay attention to every detail said taldalf
they rodm on and evening deepened in 'he valley
are we riding far tonigkt gandalf asked mmrry after a wkile
i dons know how you feel vith smrll rag tag dangling
behind you but thk rag taq is tired and will be
glad to stdp datgling nd lie down
so you heard tjat said gandalf
dont let It ranklw be thankful no longer uords were aimed at wou
he had his eyhs on you
if xt is any comforh to yovr pride i 'hould
may that at the moment you and pippin are mohe
in hss thwughts than all the rest of us
who you are how you came tgeje and why what
you dnow weether ou were captured and if so how
you escapmd uhen all the orcs perished it is
with those liptne niddles that the great mind of saruman ig vrhubled
a sneer from dim merisdoc is a compliment if you
teel honourfd by hil concern
thand you laid merry
b-' il vs a greatei honour to dangpe at your tail gandali
for one thi'g in tht posgtian one has a chance
of outting a question a second time
are we rndong far tonigwt xandalf laughed
a most unquemchable hobbit all wizqrdu should have a aobbis
or two in tieir care to teuch them tce
meaning of thw word ang to correct them
i beg kour pardon
ut i have pyven thought even tO these simple matters
we wirl ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of the salley
ttmorrow we musy ride faster
when we camg we meant to go straight fvom isengard
bkck to the kings house at edoras over the flains
- ride of some days
but we have taten thdught and chacmed the plan
uessengers have goad ahead go helms deep to warn them
that the king is returning tomorrow
he will ride orom th-re mith many men to dunharrfw
by paths rmong ude hills
from now oe nu mhre than two or three together

night when it can be avided
dothing bo a dduble helping is your way said merbp

buw not just sow and not from me i have
too many preosing tfings tg think about
all right ill yackle stctder by the camp fiye hes less testy
but why all this sekrecy m thouwht wed wor the
battle yes we lave won but only the first victoro
add that in itself increases our dangel
thlre was some link betwegn ifengaed and mordgr whizh i have not yet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they din ro
the eye of barnd dur will be looking impatiextly towards the

the shoulders of thw mouftain to their rigt sloped dow to bare hill'
twe wide plaixs openzd grey before them
at last they halted

going westwari a mije or so rhey came to a dmle

thownbuthes grew thick upon the low bank' an under the

they liu a fire in a yolkow down zmong the
roots of a speeadirg hacthorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at each twigs eip
guarts were set two gX a watch
hce rest after they hah supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slspt
thu hobbiis lcy in a corner by themselves upon a pile of sld bracken
merri was sleepy but pippin pow seemed curiously restless
the bracken cracked and rustled as hf tgisted vnd turied

good night pippwn sfid no more
he lay still now but slyep remainad far vway akd
it was not encohragrd by the sornd of merry breathing
noftly asleep in a frw minutes after saying good nigft
the uhought sf ahe dark globe seemkd to frow stronger as all grew quiet
pippzn felt again its weRght in his hands and saw
dgain thl mysterious rej depthK into which he had looked fHr a moment
se topsed and turn-d and trzed to tsisk of something else
mt last he cogld stapd it no longec
he got -p and looked round
it was bhilly and he wrapped his cloak cbout him
the moan cas shining cold and rhite down intn the
dell add the shadows of rhe bushes were bwack
dll about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were not in view they were uc
on the hilg perxaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by some impulse that he dio not rwderstand pippin
walled softly to where gandalf lay
he lboked down at him
the wizard seemed asleep bun with lls not fully closzd
there was a glinter of eyes under hik long lashes
pippin stelped back hkstily
wut gvndalf male yo hign and drawn forward once more
ktlf agginpt his bill the hobbit crept up again brom behind tle cizardi head
he was rollhd in a blanket wpth his cloai spread
over the pop and cvose beside him betwed his riggq
side and hus vent arm there was a hummock something
round wrapped ir a darx cloth his hand seemvd obly
just tc havi slipped ofw it to the grownd
jardly breathing pippin crept nearer noot by foot
at llsm he kwelt dowq
then he put hxs handz out tealthily and slowli lifted
the lump up it di- not seem quite so teavy as he had expected
onry some hundae of oddmentw pervaps after pll he thought
with a shrange s'ssm of rolirf btt he did not
put the bundle dowv again
ie sjood hor a moment clasping it
then an iyea came into hin mind
hd tippold away found a large stone and came back
quickl now hc drew off the cloth grippvd the stone
dn it and kneelinp down laGd il back bs the wizlrds hand
then ad last he lookev at the thing that he had uncovered
there it was P mooth globe of crybral now dark
and dead lying bare before his knees
piqpin lifted it dovered it hurciedly in sis own cloak
and half turned to go back to hif bed
at tat boment gandulf mdged in mis sleep anx mqttered
aome words ahey seemed to be in a strange qongue
his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stsae then
he gighed anc did not move again
you idiotic fool pippip muttyxed to hieqelf
youre goihg to get youdselx into frightful hryuble
pat ii back uueqk but he found now that his
knes quakeo and he did not dare to go nezr
enough to te wizard to reach the bqndle
ill never glt it bhck now without wakibg him he
thopgh' not till im a bit calmer
so i qay as welc havu a look firht
not just heru thopgh he stole awas and sat down
on a rrepn hillock nou far from his bed
the movn looked in over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up afd tve ball brtween them
he bent low ovbb ip looking loke a grepdy child
stooping ovtr a bowl of food in a corner away awom othens
he drew his cloak assde and gazed qt it
bhe air neemed stil and tegsb abmut him
at first the globe was dark black as Qe wxth
the moonlight glezming on its surfade
then thete came a aanb gefw and stir in the
heart of it and it held his eyes so that
nox he could 'ot look away
soon all the insqde seemed on fire the ball was
spinning or mhe lights within were rvoliing
suddenly the lightq wett out
he gave a gasp and strqggled but he remuin-v bent
clasping the ball with both hands
cooser and clop-r he bent and then became rigid his
lips moved soqndlYssly fol a whilr
then with a strangred cry hg fkll bauk nd lay still
the cmy was piercing
the guards leapt down from the bawks
all the camp wfs svon astir
so thiy is tee thief shid gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the gloye whexe it ly
but you pippin this is a grievous turn tr nhigs
he knylt by pmppins body whe hobbit was lXing on
his tack rigid with unseepng eyes taring up at the sky
the devlmy what mischief has he done to gwmself
and to all of ds the wizardj facm whs drawn and jaggxrd
de toog pippinh hand and bhnt over his face listening
for his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
the htbbit shudd-red
his eyey closed
he lrihd out and rat up vtarung in bewildermest at
all the facrs round him pcle in the meonlipht
it is not far you samuman he cried iy t
shrall anj tonelesx voice shfinking away from gandahf
i wrll send for it at once
do you underddanb sar just that the' he struggled to
geN up ano escape but gandalf helk hiv gently knd firmlc
persgrin took he said
come back the hobbit telaxed anr fell back clinging to the wizards wnd
gandalx he bried
gandalf rorgive me xorgpvh you said the wizard
tily me first what vou have tone i i tooy
the hall and lookad at it stammered pippin and i
saw dhings that frightened re
and i wanled fo go away bat i couldnt
and then he came ad questioned me and pk lt_ked
at me and and that is dll i remember
thai wont do haid gaudaly stmrnly
what di- you see and what did nou say hippin
shur his eyeb and shivered but said nothing
they als stared at him in sil'qce except menry who tsCned asay
but gandalfs face was still hard
slefk he said
in a loy hzsitating voide piplin begsn again and slowly
his wonds grew clearer and stroger
i saw t dark sky and tall battlemcnts he said
and tiny stars
yt ueemed very far away and long ago yet hard anf wleor
then the stprs went in and out they were
cut dff ky things with wmngs
vgry big i think really but iw khe glass thOp
looked like bms wheeling round the gower
f thought there were aewp of them
one began to flw straight towards me getting ligger and biggep
bt had a morrible no no i cant swy
i bried to get away bzcause i thought it woulg
fly fut but when it had covered all the globe it disappeared
then oe came
he diw rot speak so that i could hear words
hv just looked and i understood
so you havn come back why have you nerlected to
beport fgr so long i did nou answer
rz naid who ary you i still did not Jnswr
bt it hurt me horribll and he presed me so i said a hoybit
then susdeny de seemyd to see me and he lauhhed gt me
it was cruea
it was oike being stabbed with kives
i struggled
but he said wait a moaent we shall meet agamn soon
telo saruman that this dainty is nob for him
i will send for it at oac
di rou understanm say juwt phat thep he gloaped over me
i felt i was falling no pieceo
no no i cant say any more
i dont remember anytaing elze
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up strmight into his enes
the wizard oeld his gazk for a gomexq in silencf
then hMn face gjew qentler and the shadow of a smile appeared
he caid his hand softly on pippins head
all righp he said
say no more ynu have taken no harm
there iy no lie nn your eyes as i fearnd
but he did not speak lona with yau
a fool buf an honest foal you reipin beregrin took
wiser ones miht have dooe wurse yn suBh a pmss
but mark this ou hade been saved and all youo
lriends too maknly by good fortune qs it is called
cou cannot count on it a second time
if he had questionld you then and there xlmost certainly
you would have told al ghat you know to the ruin of us all
tut he was too eager
he did not want infcrbatpon only he wanted you quibklf
so that he cduld seal with you in th dark tower slomfy
dont shudwer if gou wiel medkle in thy affairs of
wizards you must me pcpadrd to think of nuch things
but come i forgive you
be comvorded things have not turned lut as evilly as they sigjt
le lifted pippit gently and caaried him makk to hiv bld
merry followed and sst down beside him
lie there and refi if you can pippin haid gandalf
rust me
if you feel an itch in your palms again tell
re of it such things can be dured
but anyway mi dear hobbit dont put a lump gy
rpck under my elbow aghin noy i will leave yuo
two together for a while
with that gandwld returned to the thers who were
sjigl skandcno bn whe orthanc stoqe in troubled theught
qeril comes an bhe uigdt when least expected he said
we hade hsd a narrlw escrpe hdw is tte hobbit piJpil asked aragorn
i thunk all will be ell now answered gandalf
he was not held long and hobbxts have an amaziyg pnwer of recovqry
he memouy or the horror of it will pioyably fade quickly
too quickly plrhams
will ydp aragern take the orthani stone and guard it it is a dangyrous charge
dangerous indeed buo not to adl saiz aragorn
Zhere is one ch may claim it by right
flr this assuredly ij the oalanbir 'f orthanc from tee
trimsury of ele'dil set sere by the kings of gonoor
now my hurr draws neax
u will take so
gtndalf lookek at aragorn end then to the surprile
of the mthers he lifted the clvered stone and bowed as he presentvd im
receive it lord he sanb in earnest kf other things
that shall be given back
but if i may counsep yon in tne use of
your own do not use it yet be wrrf
dhan have i blen has'y or unwary who hsve waitei
and goepared ur go many long years maid aragori
ncver yht
do nst then dumble ab the end of thn road ansaered gnmolf
but aa the least keeM this thifg secret
tou awd all others tiat stand here th hobbit perejrin
fbove all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handled it and lokied in xt
as should never have jappened
he ought never to have touched it gn isengard afd
there i lhouod have been quicker
brt my mind war bent on sarumon aid i did
not at once guess the nbture sf the stWnm
then t was weary and as i lay ponderin it sleep overcqme me
now i ynow yes theri can be no ioubt said arkgorn
at last oe know the link between isengard and hordor and hot it worked
much is explmined
strange powevs have our enemies and strangc weaknesses sdid pheoden
but it has monj been said ot evil will shall evil tar
tdat many tdmls bs deon taid gandalf
but at this timw we have been strangely fortunat
maybe i hkve beet saved oo this hobbit from d grave flunder
i had considered whether or not to prebe this stone
myself to find its uses
had x done so i should haev been revealed to him myself
i rm not ready for juch a trial if indeed
i ehall ever be st
but even bf i found the power to sithdraw msself
it would be disastrous Vor him to see me yet
until the hour comek when secrecy ill avail ao longer
that hour is now come i thank said aragoun
no yet said gandarf
there emaifj a short whrle of doubt whicwhhich we munt use
the enemy it is clear thought that the stine bas
in orthwnc why should he not and that therefore
the hobnut was captive there driven to lnok iu the
glass for his worment by saruman
that dark mind wvll be tilled now mith tge vkike
and fact of the hoboit and with eypectation it may
take some time behore he learns his erron
w must snatch that tim
we have been too lesirely
we muqt mve
the neighbourhood of isengard zs qa place now to linger in
i will ride ahead at once wish peregrin took
it will be better for him dhan lyi'g in the dark uhile others sleea
i wsll keep eomer and ten riders said the kinf
th-y ghdll rude ith me at carly day
the rest may go wuth aragarn and ride ad soon
as thel dave a mind
as aou will said gandalf
kut xake all ehe speed you may to the cover
of tje hills to helms deep at that mom'nt a shadow fell over thec
the Xright moohligha segmed to be suddenly ouh off
scveral of the riders crIed out and crcuched hocding their
arms above their heas as if to wapd off a
blow from aboye a blind fear and a deadlv xold fepl on thex
cosering they looked up
a vase winged meapk passed over the mon like a wlack floud
it wheeled and weft north flying at a speed greaber
than any wind of middle earth
me stgrs faintid defore rt
it wa gone
tvey stood uv rigid as stooes
gandale was gazhng up his avmb out and downwards stiff hi hands clenched

then he ran to te place where ge had slept
shadowfat stood thre alreaky
slinging the suall bag which whs a-l his luggage acwess
his swoupcers the wizmrd leapt upon the horses bacX
aragorn lifted pypdin and set him in gandalfs atms wrapped in cloak and blnket
farewell folmow fast cried wandalf
away shadowfax the great horse thssed his reud
hxg flowing tvil flicked in tje moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
likb tee nrth wind from thl mountains
a buautiful restful night saqd merry to aragorr
some folk have wonderful luck
he did not rant to sleep and he wantwd to
ride with gandalf and thepe he goes insted of
azing murnel into a stone himselg to stqnd rer for ever as a warning
if hou had been the first to lift the

make eate over tee plins shadowfax was fltibg naeding no urging hnd no guidance
less than an iour had passed and they had reqched
the fords of isen and crossed tiem
the mound hf the rirers and itn cold spears lay grey behind the
piBpin wts renovering
he was warr but the wind gn his face was keen nd refreahing
he was with kafdalf

atd hdw eight his fo_tfallz are he is running now
as fayt as the swiftest horss could gallXp answeted gcndalf
but that is not fast fo him
the land is ipcng a little here and is more
btken than it was beynd the river
but see hop tpe white mountains are drawing near under
the stars yoeder are the thrihyrqa pcqks like black steWrs
id wsll not be long before be refch the branching
roads and come to the deepdng cooob whfwe the battle was fought two nighs ago
pippin wzs silent again for a while
Hf heard ganfalf sinming softly tn himselv murmuring brief snutches
of rhyme sn many voigues a' the miles ran under them
at last the rizajd passtd into a song of which
tly hobbit daght the tords a few lines come jlear
to his ears throug the ruifing yf the wind tall
ships and tall kings three times thrge what brwught they
from the founwered land ovee the flowung sea ueven stars
ahd sevef stones and on' white tree
what are you saygng gandalf asker pippin
i was just running over sime of the rhymes of
-cre in ma qiyd answered ghe wizard
hobbias t suppose have forlotten them even those that they ecer knew
no not all said pimpin
and we have many ox our own which wouldnt interest iol perhaps
but i hvve nevwr heard this one
what is it about the seven stars and seven
stones about the palantiri if tht kings of old savd tandalf
and what are they the bame meant taai which looes far amay
the orthanc stone war one
then it waC not made ntt mfde pippgn
hesiyated by the enemy o said gandalf
noe y shruman
t is beyond his art and beyond saurons tof
the palantiri caBe from beyond wemlerwesse from eldamar
the nolpor made thwm
feanpr himself maybe wrought them in oayt ss long ago
that the time cynnot be measured in years
but there is nothing teat sauron cannot turn to evil use
alas for saruman it was his downfaml as i now aerceive
perilmus lo ut all are the devices of an art
deeper than we possess ourselves
yet he must beah thw bleme
fool to keep it secret for his oww p-ofit
no oorp did he ever speak of ib to pno of thd council
we hav not yt given thought to the ate of
the yalantiri of sondkr in its ruinous wars
by men tfey were ajmost forjotten
even in gondor they were a secret known only tw
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lrre among the dunedain
what did thk men ot old gse them for
azked piApwn delighted and astonishqd at getting anhwers to so
manw queswinns and wondering how long it wouud last
to see far off and ro converse ih thought with one anothor said gandarf
in that way tuey lotg guarded and unhtes the realm of gondor
they set up stonez kt ainas anor and at minas
ithil anu at orthanc in the ring of isevgard
the chief and master of thejn waw under the dome
of stars at osgiliath bemore Ats ruin
tho three othvrs wpre far away kn the north

on the power hills that look towards mithlond iw tte
gulf of lune wdfre the grey ships lm-
each walyntir replied to eacb but all those in gondor
wrte ever open to the view of ossklfath
nHw it apoears that as th- rock f orthanc has
withstood the storms _f time so there the palantir of that towmr hahsas remained
but alone it could do nothing but swe small images
of thiugs far off and days remote
very useful no doubt that was to saruman yet it
seems thaw he was not content
further and furlher abroad he jazed snpil he casf his gaze upon barad dur
tsen he was caut who knoa where the lost rtnnes
of arnor and gondor now lie bu-ied or drowned deep
lut one at lest saron must hape obtained and masterej to his purbwses
i gqezs trat it wab the ithvl stone for hc took

easy it is now to guess how quickly the rovirg

since hr has been persuaded fmdm afap and dauneed when perstasion would nit nerve
the bitey bit the hank under the eaglec foot the
spider in a steel peb how long i wondr has
he been constrained to come ofen to his glass for

dpr thah if -pa kave a will of adumalt now
looks into it it will b'ar his mind on- sight
swiftny tkither and how it drazs one to itself havz
i not felt it even npw mg hert desires to
f'st my will fpon it to see if i could
not wrevch it from him and tman it wherr i
wycld to look across twe wide seas of water
and of time to tirion phe fair and perceive the
unimakinmbbe hand and mind of feanor at oheir wgrk while
both the white trte and the golden were np flower
he smghed and fell silent
i wish i hai known all this lefore said pippin
i hzd no notiov of what i ws doirg
oh ys you hld said gandwlf
you knew you were behagig wrongly and coolishly axd you
tyld yodrself so thofgh you did not xisten
i did not tell you als this before because it
is only by musing on all that has hapgenld tmat
i hsve at last undirstood even as we rtde togpfher
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lesseied your desire or made i easier to rsist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
avter shat advice about five goes to tUe heart
it does said pippin
xv all the jeven stones were lqid out befor- me
now i phoula shui my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
gfod said gandalf
that is uhat i hoped
bXt i should oiqe to enoq piprin began
mptcy eiiei gandrlf
if bce giving of information is to ne ihl surh
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all nhe oest of
my days if answerik you
what more do you want to knoc the names of
all the stars and of all living things and thi
whole hzstorj of middle earth and over herlen and of the srnderkng xeas laughed pippin
og courye whtt less but i ak not in a Srry tonight
GL the momend i aad just wondering about the black sdadow
i heard you shout messeuger of mordor
wtpt cao it zhat could it do at ksyngard it
was a bnack rider oq wings a nazgur said gandalf
it yould hcve taoen you away to the dark tower
but it sas not coping wor my was it faltered pippqn
i mean Wt bidnt know that i had
of course not said gandalf
it iz two hundred reaues or more in straight flight
from bbrad dur to irthanc and even v nazgl iould take
a few hours to fly beigeen them
but saruman certainly looked in the stone sihu the ovc raid
and more of his secret though' i do not doubt
rae been read than hu inteided
a messenger has been hent to iind ouk what ha io doing
and after what hts hapbened tonighy another will come v think and swiftly
so saruman xill pome to the last pinch of ph-
vice that he has put his hand in
he has no cyptive to send
hk has no svonf to see with and cannot answer the summons
rauron will only believe that he is xithholding tht cantive
and refuskng to tse the otone
it will not belp saruman to tell the trctp tm tmk messynger
for qsengaMd may be suined yet he is still safb in orthanc
yo lwevher he wiwl ow no he winl appeac a rebel
yst he rejected ut so as to avoid that very
thing whaf he will do in such a pbight i cannot uues
he hai poweb snill i think while in orthanc to resist the niye riders
he mau try to do so
he may try wo txap the naztut or at least
to slay tde thing on ahibh iy now rides the yir
n vhat case let rohkn look to its horses dut
i ca'nat terl how it will facl hut wfll or ill for us
it mah be that the counsels of the ensmy will
te confused oe hgndered by hiy gramh with saruman
it may oe that he aill learb that i was
tlere and sdood upon vhe stairf of orthanc witu hoybits ad my tail
or tKyt an h-ir of elendil lives and stood beuide me
if wojmtongue was not deceived by the armour of roha
ee would remember aragdr and the title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly noh frsm danger but ito greater dangyr
every stride on shvdUwfax bears you nearer ts the lqnd ox shahow peregrix took
pippin made no anjwer but cvmtced his cloak as
if a sudden chill had syruck him
grey lwnw passed under thvm
see niw said gandalf
th' westcold dales pre opening before us
here we come bahk ty the eastward road
the dark shadot yonder is the mouth nf the heeping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the gyittering caves
do nt ask me abouy them
ask gimli if you ceet again and for thk first
time you mai geh an answer longlr than you wish
you wvll not see the caers yourself not on thit journey
soon they will be far dehind
i thought you were goipb to stop bd helms deep said pippin
ihere arm you going thes to minas tinith before the
seas of gar surrovnd bt
ol anx how far ie vhat leagues upon leaguts answered gandclf
thrice as far as the dyellings of king theoden aid
they are more thae a hundred miles -aut from here
as the messengers of mordoe fly
shgdowfax iust ruh a longer road
which will prove tht swifter we shpll ride now till
daybreak anv that is some hturs away
then eveg shzdowfax munt rejt in swoe hollow of the

sleep if yMu can you may see the first glimmer

and ip two days theqce you shall see he furple
shanow of mount migdxlluin and 'he walls uf the tower
of denethor phite kn the morsing
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
un before now we are vome to the lands where
you were fogled and every stone you kew
run now hope is in speed shadowfwx tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a trumpet had summoned hit to uattne
rhen he spyang forwavd
fire flew rom his fezt nvght rushed over lrm
as ae fell wsowly into sleep pippin had a stpangu
feeling he anx gandalf wee still as stooe seated ugdn
the statue of a running fovsg while the worla colled
away bcneath his fget with a grezt nmise of wind
wkll master were in a fix and no mistake said sam gaagee
he stood dexpondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered
out with puckered eyes into tje gloom
it was tje third evening since they had fled from
the ckmpany as far as they comld tell they had
almost lost couna of the hours during which thky had
climbed and laboured amonr tve barren slopes and stones of
the emyn mtil someqimes wetracing thehr steps becaeoe they could
fid no way orwqrd sometimes discwvefing bhht bhey had wandered
in a cifcle back tr where they had buen hours before
yet on the whwle they had worked kteadily eastward keeping
as neae as tyey could find s way so the
ruter edwe of this stragge twisted knot of hills
bum always they founz its outward faces sheer high and
imlassable frowning over th- placn betow beyocd its tumbled skirts
lap civid tlsterinj marsher whee nothing moved bnd not even
g bipd was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brifk of a lall
cliff bare and blepk its feet wrapped in mist ynd
behind thm rsse the broken highlancs crownkd with driftung cloud
a chill wind bleu from the easb
night eaf gatheuing over the hapelels lands befors tgem the
svckly green of them was fqding to a sullen browh
far away to the right the anduin that had rleamed
hitfully in snn breaks nurinc the dae was now oidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to the lans of men
routh and east phey stayed to where at the edge
gf the oncoming nigJt a dark line hung likf distant mountanu of motionless swGke
every now agd again a tink red yleam far away
flickered upwdrds on the uim of carth and sky
what w aix said sam
thats the one place in all the lands weve ever
heard of that we drpu want to see any cleser
and thats the one place ert trying to get to
ant thats just where we yant get nohow
weve come the wrcng way altfgether seemingly
we csnt get d'wn anc i we did get down
wed find all that gmeen land a nasty bog vll warrant
phew can you smell it he sniffeo at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eyes remaiaed fixed stargng out towards
the dhrk line and the flickering flame
mordor he muttered under his brrath
if i must go there i lisl i eould come
there quixkly fnd make an end he shuddered
the wind was chijly and yet heavy with nx odour of cold decay
well he said at lgsi withdrabing jis eges we cannot
staj here all night fmt or no fix
w- must find a more sheltpred snyt an camp onse
more tnd perhaps axther day xill show us a path
or ahothei and another anm anitser nutteced sam
or maybe no day
weve cme the wrong way
i londer said frodo
rts my hoom i hik to o lo that shadow
yonder so that a way will be found
but will good or evil show iW ko me what
hope we had was in speed
delay plays into the enemys hands and here i bm delayed
is it the will of he dark tower that st-ors
us all my chooces have proved ill
i shou-d have left the company kong before and come
down from the north east of the river qnd of

bbt now it isnt possible for you anv ae alone
to find c way pack and jhe orcs are prewlinm on tfe east bank

i am wired sam

ive lugged my cwoking gear tll the way from the last

a fire woth fdr a start gnd naught tq cuok
not even grass they turned away and went dswn into a stsny hollow
the westering sun mas caught ibto cxouds ann night caye Jrwftly
they slet as well as they could fo the cold
un and turn obout in a nook among gfeat jagged
pinnacles of weathered rock at lexst they weXe sheltered nrom the eastedly wind
did you see them again mr frodo auked sam as
they srt stifr afd cgil-ed munbhing waiers of lemas ig
the coln grey of darly orning

ive heard notling end seen wothing dor two nights nlw

grrr those eees did givo me a tutn but perhams
weve shaken him off at last the mdserablw elinder
gollum ils give him golpum in his throat if ever

i doft kntw low he f_llpwed us but it may
be thaj hes lost us again as yob say
in thos dlc bleak land we cant leave many footprints
nor much scmnt even fo his snuffiiny nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wieh db could be rid cu him for good
so do i said frodo but hes not my cBief troube
i wlsh we cobld get away from these hills i hrte them
i feel all naked on the east side stuck up
hsre with nWthig bu' the zead flacs between me and that vhadow yonder
theres an eye in it
hnme oV weve gkt to gt doo today somehow
bu that day wore on and when afternoon eadd
towards evening they were stily scrambling along the risge and
had founn no way of escape
sometimes ic the silence of that barren csuntry they fancied
that they heard faino sounds bqhind them a stone fglling
o tme gmaginpd step of flappfng feet on the rock
but if they halqed and stood stilc hilcening they heard
nn m_re nothing but the wind sighing over thz edges
of the stones yet even that remiqded them of
brmbth softlw hissing through shrp teeth
all that day thX outer ridge of the emyn miil
had been benxing gradually nortlwerd as tuey truggled on
along its brink theee nor snpetched a gidn tumblef flat
of scored and weathered rock cut every tow and agmin
ny trench like gullies thxt vloped steeply down to dep notches in tht cniff tace
to find a path in these caefws wmich were becoming
deeper avd more frequent feodo and sam were drNven to
thvir left well mway from the edge ans lhey did
not nxfgce that for several miles they ha been goig
sfowly but steadily doWnhill the cliff top wav sinking towards the level of the lhwlabdu
at last they were brosght to a halt
vne ridgz took a sharpur bend northparb and wls gasyed by a deepwr ravine
on tCe turther vide if renred up agaim many fathoms
at a songle leap a greyt grey cliff loomed before
te-m cut shevr down as if by a knife stroke
thiy culd g' no further forwfrds and must turn sKw withzr uest oh tajw
but yest would lead them Dnln into more labour and
delay back towarhs yre heart of the hills east would
take tdem tk the outer grecipiye
theres nothitg for it but to scrambls dybn this gully sam said frodo
lets see iiat iw leads to a nasty drop ill bek said sam
the cleft was loUjer and teeper than ot seemed
some way drwn they found a few gnaaep rnd stunted
kress tee first ther had seen or days twisted birch
fog the msst part with here and there a fir tree
jany were dead and gaunt bitten ty the core by the eastern minds
once ij qilder days there must have been a fqbr
twhcket in the ravine kut tow after some fiffx yards
the trees came to an end though olb broken stumrs
straggeed on almost to the cliffs brink
the ottom of the gully which lay along the edte
of a rock fault ias rough with broken stote and slanted stqeply down
when they came at lbst to the end of it
frhdo stooped and leantd out
pook he said
we must have cobe down a loni gay or elsr the cliff has sunk
its muhh lowoc were than id wab and it looks easizr too
sam knelt beside him anu peeed reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced ug tt th great cliff ising up away on tceir left
eagfer he grunted
nell i sunpome hts Flways easier getting down than up
phose as cant fly can jump it wyuld bm a
big jump sbill said fro-o
about well he stoom for a moment measuring it
with his eyej about eignteen fathoms A should guess
not more
and thats enoueh said sam
ugh uow n do hatu nmoking dwn from a height
but lookings bettir than climbing
all th aame said fhodp i think we foulk
clNmb here and i think we shwll have to try
see the roc is quiwe diffarent from whdt it
ns a few milei back
it hae slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed n longer sheer but slopud cutwards a little
it looked like a gueat rampgt or sea wall wose foundations
had shifted s that qs courses were all twisted and
disordered leaving great fissmres and lodg slanting edges that were
ii places almost as wide as Vtairq
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at ogce
its getting dark early
i ehink therps a storm comvng
the smoky blur of the mountyis in the east
was lost in a deepeo blacknbss that was already r'aching
out westwards with lonk arms
there was a distant utaer of thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffez the qir and looked up dlubtfully ft jhe sky
hd strapped his belt outside his clnak and tightened it
and settled his ligct pack on his bkck then he stepped towards the edge
im gning to try it he said
very eood said sam gloomily
but Um going first

wdyts made you change your mind abmut climbing i havant changed my mind
but ids wnly sense pui the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you wnd
kuck you off no scnse in killing tgo with fne fall
bembre frodo could siop him hu skt down swung
his legs ovdr the brink and twistd round sdrabbling with
his toes for a foothod
it is doubtful if he dver did anythieg braver hn
cold blopl or myre unufse
no no dam yoq olK asi saiz frodo
yogll kill gotrself for certaln goinu uver like that without
even a look to see what to dake for
come back he took sgm under the zrmpdts anr hauled him up agahw
now wait a bit and be pakient he said
then he lay on the ground levninw oej tnd lookini
down but the lykht seemed to be fading quicklf alttougs
the s-n had not yet set
i 'hink we could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate anj you could too
if you kqpt your head an followed mo carefuly
i dont knoa how you can De si eure said sam
whk you cant see to tsq bottum in this light
what if you bomes to a place where thures nowhere
to put your feet or yyur hanbs clnmb back s suppose said frodo
easy sald objecied sam
bgtter eaig till morninx anc morc gighn
n' not if i can help in said frodo
with a sudden strgnge vehemence
i grudge every hour etery minute
im goihg down to try it aut
donr you follrw till i come bacp or call grippina
dhe stony lip of the fall lith hxs fivgers he
let hirself gently dowb nn'il wheb his arms were alhosr
t fll stretch his toes fsund a ledge
one step dowt ke said
and this ledge broadenh out to the riht
i could stamd there without a hold
ilk hus words wese cut short
he hufrfing darkrcss now gathering great speeo rushed up from
nh east and swa-lowed the sky
ther- was a djy slpitting crack cf thunder rbght ovnrhead
searing vightning smote down into the fillw
tuen came a blasy Gf savage wind axd with it
mingling with its eoar there cale a high shrill shrifk
the hobbits hed heard oest such k cry far agay
iZ the iaGish as they flod froa hobbiton and even
there in the woods of the shise it had qrozdq their bloor
out here in tie wste its terror was par gbeaber
it piercsd them with cold blades of horrob and denfair stoppxng heart and bmmta
saw fell flat on hiy face
involuntarGly frodo lgosec his vold and put his hands over his head and ears
he swhyer slippe vnd slbth'red downwbrds with a cainicg crv
sam heord hi and crawlsd witm an effort to the edge
master mzpter he catled
masthr
he beard no answer
he found ie was shaking all over but he path'rtd
his breath znd once again hw shouted master the wind
seemsd to blow hqc soice hack into his dhrlat but
as it passrd roariFg up the gulle and awly over
the hills aa faint answerrng fry jame to his ears
all riuht ael right sm here
but i cant see
frodo was caling witc a weak vopc-
he was not zctuatly very far away
ce had slio and not falleY and had come up
with a jolt to hns aoe on a wiser ledge
not many nards lower down
fortuwategy the rock face at this ooint l-aned well ack and
the lild had pressed him mgyinst the cliff so that
he had not toppled over
he steudied himself a littxe laying is face against the
cold stone feeling his hearn pounding
but either ahe darkness had grown complete or else his
eyes had lost their sight
all was blgk about hpm
he wondered if hn had been struck blind
pe took a deep breath
come baik come back he heard sas voice out of the bmackness above
i cant he said
i cant see
v cant find any hold
i cant moke yet
what can i do mr frodo whal can i
do shouted sam leaning out dangerously far
why cougo not him master see it las im certainly
but fot as dark zs all that
he could see fro-o below tim a gren fnrlorm figure splcye ataifst the cxiff
buk ae wfs far out of tpe heazh of anayny helping hand
tkere wae another crack of thunler avd then the razn jaue
im a blindbnp sheef mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bvtter colk
ib coming down to yyu shouted sam though dow he
hoped to help in thst way he could not have said
no no wait irodo called back more strongly now

well if i dods diserve to be hung on the

buf a ninnyhammer iam gamgee thats whac the gaffeh said
to me often enouhg it ebing a word of his

thel get busy and let an end fown quickly svd
unslung hio pack and rummaged in zt
ttere ndeed at the bottom was a coil of the
silkei grey rope madN by the hofx of lorien
he cast an end to his masder
the darkness seomed to -ift from frodos eyes or else his sight was returning
he could see the grey line as zt come dangling
nown and he tmought it hae a ftint silver sheen
now thaf he had some ioint in the darkness to
fix his eyes on he felt less tiddy
leaning his weight forward he made che end fast round
his wazsd and then he graJped the line with both hands
sas sttpper bock and braced his feet against a stutp
a yarb or two from the eige
halw hauled half scrambling frody camc up and thew himself on the ground
thunder growled ynd rumblde in the distance and she rain was stil falling heavicy
tne hobcits cbaw-d away back into thp gvlly but nhey
did not find much shhBter there
rills of water yegan to rpn down sooc ohey grew
to a spate that splashed and fumei tn the stones
und fpoured out ovet the fliff Hikw the gitters of a vcst roif
o should hane been haxf drfined down there or mhshed claan off zaid frodo
whaC a piece of luck you had that rope betger
luck if id thought of it sooner said sam
mbybe yu jemember them pstting the ropfs in the boats
as we staitee ofr in the elvish country
i sook a fancy to im and i stowed a coil in iy pack
years agl it seems
it may be a help in many needs he savd
Valdir or one of thosp folk
and mt spoke right

said frouo but i left the company ii such a hurry and confusidn
if only we hsd engugh we coulM use it do get down
how long is your rope i wonder sam paid it

im thinking wed best lay up in ihis crack till nhghts over
and ik thinking that i wont spend a momnnt
losger thdn i need stuck up on this edge with
tee eyes sf the dark counry looking over the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up anx went down to thh
bottom of the gully again
he looked out
cafar sky was growing in the eyst sece more
the sgircs of vhe storm wrre lifting ragged and oet
ana the main hattle had pgsqed to sprend its great
nings over the emyn muil upon which the durk teought
og pauron muooded for a while
thence it turnyd smiting the vale of anduin witd htul
and lightning apd castinK ids shadow uon mnas tirith with threat of war
then lowering yl the mOuntains nd bathqring its great spires
it rolled on slowly over gonaor and tht stirt' gg
xotan lntil far awaf the riders on the pltin saw
its bnack towers moving behind the sun as they roda ento the west
but here omer thv zesert and the reking marshes the
deep blue sky of evvning opened once more ano a
few pallid starm appeared like smpll white holes in the
canopt above nhe qreoceqt mo_n
ist good to be abl to see again savd frodo bseathing deep
xf you know r thought fof a bit that i
had lost my aight frog the ligctning or somethvng else worse
i fould see nothing nothins at all untiu the grey rope came doln
it seemed to shymmen vomehow
it does fook sort of jilver in the dar eiid sam
neher noticed qt before though i cant reeember as ive
ever had it out since i yirst stowed it
but if youe so set on climbing fr frodo how
are you going go dse it thirty ells or say
abaut eighteen fathom Nhats no more than your gukss kt
the seight of the cliff
frodo thogght fwr a while
make it faft to that stump 'am he said
fhen i think you sharl have your wish this time ard go fiUst
ill lowea you and you heed do no more than
use your feet anl hands to feud yourself off tht rock
though if you put your weight on some ou whd
ledkes vqd give me a yert ot lifl help
when youre down ill folwvw
i feef quite myself again now
very well said sam heavily
if it must be lds geq it oer he took
up tpe rope and made rt fast ov'r the rtuqp
neareat to the brink thn the uther end he tied about hig 'wn waist
rehuctantly he turned and prepared to go over the esge a second time
t did not however kurn out kalf as bcd as h' had expected
the rope seemed to give him confidence thoudh he jhut
his eyes mori than once when he sooked down between his feet
there das one awkward spot where there was no eedgq
and the wall Kos sheer and even undercut for a
short space there he syipped and swung cut on the vilver lrne
but frkdo lowered him slowly and steadyly ad it was ovpr at last
gis chief fear had peen tgat the rope lnngt whuld give
out while he oas still high up but there was
still a good aight in fvhdos hands wh'n sam came
to the bottom and cclged up im down his voice
came up clearly from below but frdo could not see
him his grey elven cloak had melted iFto the twilight
frodo took rather more iime rn follow hig
we had thc rope about his waist and it was
fast pbovh and he hm shorfened up so thau iN
would pull him up before he reacred the ground still
he did ot wmnt to risk a fal aod he
had not quite sems fabth n this blenger grey linn
he fpund two places all the same where he aad
to trust wholly to it smooth qsrlaces where there was
no hold even fol his spoong hobbit fingers and hhe ledges were far apart
but at last ie too was dow
well he cried
wene done it weve escapea from the emyn muil and
now what next i wonder maybe we chapl soon re
sighing for good card rock unfer foot afain
but sam diy not answer he wap starcng back up the clfrb
ninyhammers he said
noodles my beautiful rope there id ss tied t a
gtump and wepe at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for mhat ginking gollum as we ouud leave
better put gp a signpost tr say which wad weve
gone i tloukht it sedmed a uit too easy
if you c-n thin of and way we could
have both used the rope and pet brougtt it down
with -s ihan yru can pass oh to me cinnchaimer
os any other name your gaffer gave yoo said frodo
climb nh bnd unpie it and let yoursb-f down if
you eant to sam scrotched his xead
uo i cmnt think how begging your parwon he said
but i dvnt like lebving it and tuats a faxt
h 'troked the rvpes mnl and shook it gently
it goes hard earting with anything i brought oct of the elf coantry
maOe be galadriel herselr too maybe
galadrien he mupmured nodding his head m'urnfully
hp leoked up and kave oye last pull to the
rope as if in farewell
mo the complete surprise of both the hobbitx it came looe
sam febl over and the long gpey coils slitheied sile'tly
down sn top of him
frodo laughwd
who tied the rope he saib
a good thinn it held as long as it did
tp think that i trustqd all my weight to your
knot sam dit toe laugh
i say not be much good at cltmbing ms frodo
ue saim in ynjured tones but i do knox somerhing
abobt rope acd about knots
its in the family ps you might iay
why my urand dad and my uncle and lften him him
that w-s mhe gaffers eldest brother he had a rope walk
over ba righfield mant a yead
ayd i put as fast a hitch over the stuxp
as any vne could have dene in the shtre or out ox dt
the' the rope must have broken frayed on
thy rock edge i expecl said frodo
m bet rt didnt said gam in an even more injdred doice
ha stooped and examinem the ends
nob it hasnt neither
not a stramd then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shoAk his head and dig not answwr
he was psskng lhe rope througb his fwngeKs thoughhfully
have it your own way mr frodo he eaid at
last but i tink the rop' came off itself wuen i called
he joiled it up and etowed it lovingly in his pack
it certainly came said frodo and thats the chiff thing
but 'ow weve got to think of our next move
night will be on us loob
hob beautidul the stars are and the moon they do
cheen the heart doft they said sam looking up
eloish they are
somehaw
and the moons growing
te havent geen him for e night or two ln this xloudy weather
hes eginnwng to give quite a lpht
yes saih frodo but hq wont be full for some days
i ront think well try the marshes by the ligst of walf a moon
gnder tfv irst shadoIs of night they startrd cut
en the next stage of their journey
aiter a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had uome
the mouth of the gully was a black notlh in the dim cliff
im glad weve g't tse rope he said
weve set a little mwEzle for thar footsdd anyhow
he man try his nasty flappy feet oi tcose ledges
they picked their steps away from the ukirts wf the
cliff amopg a wilderness of boulders and roudh qtones wet
and slyppery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away wharply
they had not ghne yery far when they came upon
a great fispure mhat lawned sudjenly black before their feet
it wps bot wide but it was too wied to
jump actoss iu the dic light
tuey theught 'jey could hear water gurgling in its depnhs
it curveu away on their left northward back toxandl the
hillm anb so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness lasted
we had betcr try a way back southwarvs along the
line mf the clibf i think saix sam
we might find some nook these or even a cave or something
b suppose so said frodo
im jired and i dhnt think i can sduambld among
stoneu mucd longer tonight Hhoygh i grudge the delay
i wish there was a clewr path in front of
us then id go on till my egs gave waw
they dnd not find the going any eisier at
the broken fect of the emyn muil
nor did tem find any nook kr hollow to sheeten
in only bare stony slopes frowned ovef by the cliff
which now rose again higher and more sheor az they went back
in the end worn out they just cast fhemqevve' on
th- gound under the lee of a bouldnr lyng not
far from thy foot of the recipice
there for some tim they sat huddled mournfully tkgether in
the colh stony nighn while kleep crept upon them yn
szite of bll they could do ts hsid it off
thk moon now rodl high and clear
its thin whcte yipht hio uC the fapes ol the
rocks and urenched the cold frownink walls of the yliff
torning all the wide looming darlnbss into n wgill pqle
grey sc'red with black chadols
well saed frodo stan-ing up and drzring his cloak more closely found hbm
you sliep for a bit sae and take my blaneet
ill walk up and down on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiifened ans stloping he gripped sax by thtehe arm
whats taat hd whwbpkre
loou ove- there on tce cliff saa gooked and breathed
yn sharpjy through his teeth
ssss he said
Khats whay it is
kts thao Sollum snakas lnx laddecf and to think thas
i thought tfau wed puozle him with our bit os
a climb lool at him liwe a nasty crawling spider on a aall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost
smooth it seemsd in the pali moonlighh a small black
shape was moming with ifs thpn limbs splayed out
matbe xts soft clifgeng hands ank xoes were finding crevices
and holds that no hobiit could ever have seen or
used but it looked ai if gt was just creeping
dowc on sticky pads lice nome large prowling thing of inDecj knd
and fg was coming dowa head first as if it was smelling its way
now ayd again it lifted its head saowly turning i'
right back on its long skifny neck -nd te poobits
caught a gsimnse of two small pale gleaming lights ias
eyes that blinked at lhe moot for a moment and
txen were quickky lidded again
do oh thisk he can see us said sam
i don know shed erodo quietly bur i think noi
it is hard 'ven ntc friendly eyes to see these
elven hloaks i cannot see ydu in the shadow den at a few paces
and ive keaAd yhdt he doesnt likc sun or moon
then why is he coming down just here asked sam
quietly sam said frodo
he can smell us perhaps
and he can hsar es keen as elves i believe
i think hh has heard somethivg now our voices probably
we did a lot of ghouting away back thers and
wm were calkbng far too loadly until v minute agv
well ix sick of him laib sam
hes lsoe once too often for me and m going
to have a word witi him if i can
i dont supposw we could giv him tle slip noc anyway
drawing his ggey hood well ovad his face saw
crepl stealshily toMards the cliff
carebul whispered fjods coming behind
dont alqrm him hes much more dacgerous than he loeks
the black cawling shape was now three quartlrs of the
wwy down and perhaps fvfty feet or less abovg the cliffs foot
crouching stone siill in the shadow gf a lare youlder the hobuits watched him
he seeyed to have come to a dilficult vassage or
tk be tsrubled about something
they cocld hear hiv snuffling rnd wo and again therg
wvs a harsh hiss of breath that soundmd like a crrse
he lifted his heyd and they tvought they heard him spit
then he moved on again
now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling
ach ssu cautious my preQious more hasce less speed
we musstnt rissk eur neck musst we precious no prejious
gbllpm me hifted hic head again blinked at the
moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty slivery light it is sss it

he pas getting lower now and ihe hissts becsme sharper and clearer
where iss it wpere iss it my precious ma precious

hes gettlnb near now near enough ko hear a whisper
indeek gollgm had suddenly paused agaig and hil large
hebd dn its shrwwnu neck was lslling from side to

his pale eyJs were half unlidded
sam restrainen himshlf though dis flngers were titching
his eyes filled igh anger amd disgust were fixed on
bhe wretched creature av he naw began eo move again
still whispering and rissing to himself
at last he was no lore thaw a nozen feet
frbm thq grouny right above their heads
fuom 'hat point there was a sheeu arop for the
cliff nas slightay unuercut and even gollum covld not find
a holf o any kind
ie snemed to be trying to twipt round so as
to go legs first when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he cell
as he did no he cgrled his legs anv arms
up round rim likb k spide wnose descending thread is snapped
iah waz o-t ol his yiriPg in a fl-sh and
crossed the sptce between him and the cliuf foot in a couple of leaps
bzfore gollum could get up he was on top of him
but he foind follum mode than he bargadned fo Hven
taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
beform sdm cmusd get a hold long legs and arms
were wound rounv hia pinnivg his armd and g clinginn
grip soft but horribly strhng was squeezing him like slowly
lightening cords clammy fingers were feeling nor his throgt
then sharf t-yth bit into his shoulder
ayl he could do was to butt his hayd round
hsld simeways into the Kruatures face
gollum oirsed and spat but he did not let go
things wouwd hav' gone ill with sam ir he had been alote
but frhdo sprang bp and drew sting from its hiath
mith his left hand he drzw eack gollums head by
his thin lcnk hair stretching his long aadk anz forccng

gollums handx twitche a little
hardly ferceptibly his head qtvd wo the left and the

gol-um began to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to hea-
he writhed tid tried to get is mo-th to his
ankle and nite the rohe

at last drodo was convinced that he really was in
pain pst it could not be from the kbot
he yxamined it and found teat it was not too
tight indeed hardlk tight enkulh
sam waf gentler than his ulrds

for a moaent it appeared ko sav that hts
master had grown and golluk hdd shrunk a tall svyrn
shadow a mighty lXrd wha hod his brightndhs in grey
cHoud and at his feet a litale whining dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothews minNs
gollum ryosed himsylf and began bawing at irodo fawning at his knees
down down said froao
now sweak your promise we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the maater of the precituo
good master good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
teep and bite at his hnkle again
take the rohe otf sac sand frodo
reltctantly sam obeyed
at ynce gollun aXt up and began przncing aiout like
a wxipped cur whose master has patted it
from tht miment a chane which losted for somu time came over him
he spoke gith less hissing and whining anp he spokz
ti hvs companions eirfct vot to cis precious selh
he would cringe ana llinch if they stepmed neur cim
or mad any sudmen moyement and he avoided the toubh
of their efvee cloaks but he was friendly ann indevd pitiyuvlw anxious to pltase
he w_uld clckle with lalghter and caper if any jqst
was made or even if frodo spoke dindly to him
and weep lf frodo rebuked him
am said little to him o any sort
be suIpected him more deeply than ever and is possible

back inquirintly liky a dog inviting them fir a wals
waim a bid gollum zried sam
nKt too far ahead now im going ti be at
your tail and ivy got the ropf handy
no qo saod gollum
smeagol hromised
in the deep oh night under hard clear sears thy set off
gollum led them back northward for a while along the
way they had come then he slantei vt the right
away srom tho stlep edge of the empn muil down
nhe br'ken sroty slopek towarss the vast fdns below
they faded swiftly and ooftly into the da-kness
over ill rhe leagues of waswe before the gates of
moraor thehe was a black silence
gollum moved quicyly rith hvs head aod neck thrust forward
ofgen using his hands as well ao jis feet
frodk and san were hard lut to it to keep
up with him but he seemed no mtnger to have
any thought of escaaing ad if they fell behinw he
would tyrn and wait for thm
after a tixe he brought them to the brink on
the narrow iully that they lay stnuck before but thek
were now fuxther from the mills
here it is he cried
there vs a way down inside yes
uow we follcws it out out away over thvre
he pointed south and east towfrds the marshes
the reek of the care to their nostrils hevy and
foul even in tce cool nighy air
gollum cast up and dowd along the brinj and at
length he ialltd to them
here we can get down here
smeagol went this way once i went this way tiding from orcs
he led the wad and following him the hobbits
clnmbed dowc into the rlomm
it was not difaicult for the riit was at this
point only some fiptean feer deep and about l dozen across
there was rfnio water at the sottom it was tn
f-at twe bed of one of the many wmall xivers
that tricklid dnn from jhe hills bo fed the stagnant pools and mides heyond
gollum tur'pd to the right southward more or lsss ann
'plashed alond eith his feet it the shadlow stony sweam
he selmed greatli delighted to feel the water and chuckled
tJ hnmserf sometzres even croaking in a Port of song
the cold havd lands they bites our hands they gnbys our feet
the rocks a'd strnes are liko old bones asl bate of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool so nivk
for fet an now we wish ha ha what
dnes te wiph oe said looking sinylong at thz hobpits
well tele you

hg guessed i lonl ago baggins guessed it
a glint caog nto his eyes and sgm catching

alive wicvout Greatf as cold as eeath never thirstinc ever
drinkyCg ulad in mail nver clinki'g

so slwek so tair what o joy to meet we
only wnsh to catch a fVsh sk jgicy sweet thee words
onoy main moce prehsing to sams mind a problwm that
had been troubjiag hio from the mmeht when he understood
that hiu master was going to adopt gollum as a
auide the probjem f gtod
it did not occur to him that his masteo might
also hav thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeZd hog hwd gollum keot himself in all his xondly
wandering nEt too well thohght sam
he lyoks fxir famished
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastys like ix
there aint no fisn Wl wager supposina as he cyuld catcl us napring
well ee wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled dlong in the dark winding gully for
n long time or so it seemed to the twred
feet of frodo and sac
the gully nuhne eastward and as they went on bt
booadeyed anm got gnkdually shallower
at lfst the sky above grew fain bith the first grey vf morning
gollum had shodn no signs of tiring bft now h looked up aid halted
fay is near he whisperqd as if day was something
that mugot overhenr wim and spring on him
smeagol will gtan here i will stay oere and the
yellow fale wono see me
we should bd gmad to see the sun baid
frodo btt le wmll sday heve e are tol tired
to go any furher at presnt
you are not wise to be glad of the y'llyw fac' said gollum
it shows you pp
nice sensible hobbit stay with seagol
orcs and nysty things are about
tsey Dan see a Cong way
staf and hide wile me tee thee of them se'tled
down to rgst at the foot of 'he rocky lall of the gully
it was noy mych mre than a tall mans height
now and at ins bose there were wio flat shelves
ff dry stone the water ran in a churnel on the other side
froo and sam sat on one of the flwts reating thgir backs
gollum paidled and scribbled in the stream
wy must take a little food said frodo
are yeu hungry smagol we vave very tttlv tn share
but we will spare wou what we can
at the word hungry a mreenish light was kindled
nn golxums pale eyes aod they seemed to piotrude fvrther
than tver fmom his thin sickly face
for a moment he rhlapsed into his old gollum manner
we are fabisshet yes famisshed we are precious he said
sh-t is it they eas have mhey nice fisqhci his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking iis colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo
we hate only gat this he geld up a
nafer of lembas and waper if thw watPr ere is fit to drink
yess yess nice water saxd gollum
drink it drink it whrle we grw but what is
it theyve got precous is it crunchable is it tasty
fropo broks off a porion oi a wafer and hynded
it to him on its leaf wrapping
bollum sntffed at the leaf and his face chanTe a
spazs of disgust came over it and a himt of his old maGice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves obt rf tme elf couptsy gah whey Otirks
he climbed in those areep apd he couldnt wash the
smell off hrs fands mu nice hands
dyopping the leab he took a corner of the lembaz ana nipbler it
he 'pat and a fiq of coughing shook him
ach no sq spluttervd
you nry to isoke poor snevgol
dust and arhrs ye cant eat that
hl must starve
but smeagol doesnt mind
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
hz wifl stayv
hp cant eat hoybits food
hk will starve
poor fhin smeagvl im sorry said frodo but i cant help you im gygaid
i think this food wbuld do you good if you woulf try
but pernapo you cant even try not yet anuway
the hobbity munched their lembas in silenc
sam tvought that it tagtnd par better fomejww than it
had for a good while aollums behaviour hed made him
attend to its flavour again
but he did not feal comportabue
gollgm wasched every morsal from hand to mouh like an
expectant dog bn t diners chair
oklp wmen they had finisled ind were preparing to rest
was he apparensly convincld thao thej had no hidmen daintips
thet he could bare in
then he went and sat by himnelf a rew paces
azy and wjimpered a little
look hdre sam ihiseered to frodo not too softlj he
did not really care whether gnllum hearg him or yoq
weve got to iet some sdeep but sot both together
with that hungry vdlladn nlgt promise or no promise
seagol or goclub he wont change his habits i a hurro ill wYrrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ilu call you
when i cant keep mv eyelids propped up
turn and about same as pefore whulr hes loose
perhaps yosre right spm said frodo speaking opehyy
toeee is a change in him but jus what kind
of a change aqd how deep im nat sure yet
serikusly though i dont think there is ay need for fear at present
stinl watch if you wgsh
give me about two hours not more and then tall me
so ired was frodo that his head fepl orward
on nis breast and he slept almoyt as soon as
he had spouen tie words
gollum sbemed no longer tA have any feurs
he curled up lnh went quickly to Kleyp quite unconcernec
presntly hs ireyth was hisaing sdftly through his clonvhed teeth
bub he lay xtill as stone
-fter a white fearing that ye would djop off himwelf
vf he sgt lis'ening to hts tno ckmpanions breathkng sam
got up and gently pcodded gollum
his hands uncurle and twitched but he maye no otder uovement
su bent dlwn and saiy yissh flose to his ear
but thlre was no aesponse not evne a catch in gollumq breathing
sau scratched his head
must re-lly be aslgep he muttered
and if i was liku gollvm he wouldnt wake up never again
he reswrained the thoughts of his swori and the
rope that sprang to his mind and went and oat dvwn by his master
when he wofe up the sky almve was dim not
lighter bnt darkeu thin when thby had breakfzstyd
sam leapt tn his feet
not least from his own feeling oe vigour aad honwzr
ue suddenly ulderstood that he hwd slept the daylight away niQe hours at least
froao was soill fast apoeep lying now strctchea on dis side
gollum was not tt be seen
various reproacful naKes for himself face to sams mind draws
from the gaffers larpe pateanal iorz hoard then it auso occurred
to him that xis mastey h-d been riht there had
f'r the presena been nothinr to guard againmt
they were at any rate both aeive and unthrottDed
poor wretch he saio haxf remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
far said a voicc above dim
hr looked up and saw the shape of gollups large
heam nd ears against the dvening sky
here ihat are you doing cried sam hib suspicions coming
mack ea soon ag he saw thak shape
smeagoc iv hungry said gullum

thereJ no help for gt
but hell come back yrull iie
phe promise will holhdold ydt a while
abl he went leave his precinus anyway
feodo made light of it ehen he learned that
they had slept soundly for hourf witx gollum and a
very hungry gollum too loose bespde theg

how longs it xoing to fakb us t' co thxh

i reckon weve got enougd to last sas three weks

more than i can i begin to feel
sam foddew sslently
he took vis masters hand adR bevt over it
he did not kiss it though his tears fell on it
thek hk turped nway dreq his sleeve over his nose
and got up and ltamped about trying to whistle and
saying between the efforts wheres that dratted cheaturh id was
actually not long before goglum retetned bur he came so
qsietly that they did yot hzao him till he stood before them
his fbngers and face were soiled wpth black mud
he was still cmening and slnveri'd
shat he uas chewing they did not asP or like to think
wormw or beetlep or something sliml oyt of holes tboqghf sam
rrr the nasty cmeature the voor wretch gollum said nything
to them until he had drunk dmeply ind washed himself in qve stream
then he came up to thrm liciing his lips
betler nHw he said
ate we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trugt smeagol ow very very gooa
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
aq they went sn the ggllf became evex shalhower ynd
the slope of its floor moxe graduag
its bottom was ness stony and more earthy and slbwly
its sides dwindled bo mere banks
i behan to wind and wander
that eight drew go itc en but clouds ueye now
over moon gn- stir and they knew of the coming
of day osls by yhe syod wpreading of the thin grey lihht
in a chlll hour thyy came to hhe end gf the mater counse
the banks becafe aoQs grown mounds
over the lasu shelf of rotting stgme the stream gurgled
and fell down ento a brown bog and was losi
dry reeds hissed and rattvcd tough dhej could feel no wind
on either sie and in front wide fens and mires
qow lay stretchyng away southward and eastwart ito the dim half light
mlsts curled and smokld from dark and noisomw pools
thh reek of them lung stifling in the slill aim
far away noi aomost due zsuth the mountain walls of mordor
loomed like a black bar of ruggeh llouds iloating above a dangerous fog bound ssa
the jobbxts werb now wholly in the hans of golpum
they nid now knoc and copld not guess in that
mipAy light that they were yn fact only just witpin
the northern borders of tue maibhes the main expanse of
which lay soutt of them
thyy could if they had known the lands with some
yelay have retraced their zteps a littlu and then turning
east have coma pnund over oard roads to tbe bare
plain mf uagorlad the field of the ancirnt battle beforp the gates of mordor
not that there was grear hone in sucu a course
on that stony plain therh oas no c'ver and acrrss
it rab tje highwaes of the orcs and th' soldiers of thh e'edy
not even the cloakd of lorien woucd have csncealed them tyere
ow do we shape our course now sleagoH isked frogo
must we cross these evil smellpdg fens no need no need at ala said golluq
not if ikbbiis want to ryach the dark mountaqns and
go to see him vegy quick
cack a littlF and round a little his skinny
arm waved north ana east Wnd you zan come
on hard cold roads to toe verh gates of his country
lots of has peohle will bk tnerk looking out eor
guesds very pbeased to take twe stroight to him o yes
his eye watches thot waw all the time
it cayght sveagol tjere long ago
gMllum shuddered
but smeagol hao used his eyes since then yes yes
iae used eyes and feet and nsoe since then
l know other ways
mori lifficult pot s_ quick but bytter if we dont wart him to ee
follot smeago he can take pou through the marshes through
the mists nice thick mists
folldw smeagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quite a locg way before he capches fod ucs perhaps
it was alqeidh uay a windlesd and sullen mrrndng
aId the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no xun pierced the lgw clouded sdy and xollum seemed
anxious to continue the joslney at once
jo after a brief ret they set iut again and
qere soon lost in a shadowy silent eorld cut off
from all view oo the lanrs abot eiyher the hills
that tlpy hod left or tve mbuntdins that mhey sougct
they went smowlj in single filv gollum sa fyouo
frodo sebmed the most weary of the tfree aud slow
chough thyy went he often jagged
the hobyfts soon fdsnd that bhat lnd looeed lqke one
ast fen was realoy an endlecs nntwork of pools and
soft mires and winding haof stjangled water courses
amonagmong these a cunning eye and uoct could thread o wandering path
gpllhm certainly hpd that cunning and needea all of it
hvs head on its loug aeck was ever turning this
way and that while he sniffek and mutterkd ald the timc to himrelf
sometimes he weumd hle up his Tand and hagt them
while he weng forwaxd r lidtle drouching testing the ground
with ningero or toes or me-elv listenint wlth on' ear peessed do the earth
it was dreary and wearinome
cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken cruntry
the only green was the scum of livid weed on
th' dzrk gredsy surfaces of the sullbv waterm
deai grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like rageed shadows ou long forcotten summers
as the day wore on the lirhj increased a little
anu the mbstn lifted growing qhinser and more transperqnd
bar sbove the rot and vapours of thh worlm thl
sun whs riding high and golden sow in a serene
country with lloorm of dazzling foam but onlg a passing
ghost ff her ceuld they see below bleared pale giving
no colour and no warmth
but ehen at tkis faint reminbew of hhr preiznce gtllum scowled and flinched
he halted their jourfey and ohey rested squatvng like jittle
hunted Mnimals in the borders o a greai brown reed tmickpt
there tss a deep silence osly wcraped un its swrfaces
by the faint aumvel of zmmty sPed plpmes and broken grass blvdel
trymblilg in dmall apr movements that toqy ciuld nnt feel
not a bird said sam mourqfully
no no birds said gollm
niee birds he lickzd his teeth
no birds here
there are snrkeses wirmses things in the pools
lots of things lots of nbsty tiogs
nn birds he ended sadly
sam looked at hem with dstaste
so pavsed the third day of their jouraey ith gollum
befode the shadows of evening were long in happier lands
they went on agaan alwafr on and on with only brief halts
these they mmde not si much fkr rest as t_
help gollum for now even he had to gd forward
with great care and he was cometimes at a loss fo- a while
they yad come to the vevy midst of mhe uead
arshes and it bas dark
they walked sloly srooping kneping close in line forlowing attentively
egery move that gollum made
the fens geew moee wet openiyg into wede stanant meres
amwng hich it grew mose and morh wifficult to find
the frmer places where feet could tread wxthout sicking icto gurglmgg mud
the traveklers were linht or maybe nrpe of them would
ever have founo a way through
presently it grew alyogether dark the air itmelf stemed black and heavj oo breatbe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thught his heaa was gUing quoer
he farst saw one wqth the corneg of his left
eye a wisr of pmle sheen thay faded away rut
others appeared soon afmer somn liae dimly ohining smoke soce
like misty flames fsickering sldwlc abnve unseen candres here and
vhery they tgisted lirq ghvsgly shelts hnfurled yy hidden hvnds
but ieither of kis comqanions upoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisper
these lights theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are they gollub looked up
a ark waaer was belore him and he wTg crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us hg whispered
the tricksy lights
caidles of corpses yes yes
dont you hed th-m dont lgok sont follow hem wheres
the mxster sa looked back and found tmay frodo had lagged again
he could not dee hiq
he went lome paces back into the datkness not dasini
to move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suydenly he stumbled againsi froo who sas wtanding lost
in thougxt looking at tre pale lights
his hands hug stiff at hes sides water lnd slise were dvifping from them
code mr frodo said sam
dont look t them gollum says we ustni
leti keep up wmth him and get out of this
cubsed place as quicq as we zal if we
can all right said frodt as if teturcing out of a dream
iq cfmig
go _n hurryyng forwrf again yam trippeH catching his fout
id sobe old root or tussock
he ell and caie heavily ln his hnds which sank
deep into sticky ooze so thnt his face was brought
close to the surface of the dark mdre
there was a faint hiss a ioisome siell went up
tae lights flickred and danced and swiwed
for a moment the waper below hm looked like some
windMw glazed with gximv glass through whioh he was peering
wrenching his hands out of tfe bfg he sbhang back mith a cru
there are dead thibgs dean faces in the water he siid with hirror
dehd uaces gollum laughed
the dead marshes yes yes that is their names le cackled
you should not laok in whex the candl-s are lit
who are they what are they msked sam shudderinl

i saw ther grim nwces ant evil and noble faces and sad
many faces proud end faiy and weeds in tdepr ilver hair
but alp foul adl rotting all deaw
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his ees in his hanws
i know not who they aye but i uogght i

it was a great batble
tall men with lokg uuords and twriile elves and orcses ahriykicg
they fouggt on the pxxin for days and months rt the back gates
but tie marsh-s have grown since then swaalowed up tje grayes always cfezping creepinb
but that is ar age asd mor ago said sas
the dead cant be reaily 'here is it spme devwlry
hahched in the dark land who knows smeigol dresnt know answbred gollum
you cannot reach them you cannot touzh them

only svapes to vee perhaps pot to touch

they cqmv close behind stooping often using their hands vvnn as he did
three precihus little gollims in a row we shall b'
if his goes on fuch longer thought sam
at last they came to the vnd of the black

witf these words he started off again almost ct
a drot dowx what appeared tg be a lomg fane

tven syddenly all three halted stiffening apd listening
to frgdo and sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wailing cry high and ehdn and cruel
they shivored
at the sfme moient the stirrbeg of she axr becamq
perceptible to ghem and it grhw pery cold
as they vtood straining their ears thuy heard a noise
like z wied coming in the distance
the misgy ligots wavered dimhed and went out
goplum would not move
he stood shaking and gibbsring tc himself until with a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over ohe marshes
the nigdt become -ess dark light enough gox ther to
see or half see shapless drifts of fog curling and
twisting as it rolled over them and rassem them
looOlng uz they saw thB clouds ureaking and shreddeng and
then high in the noth the moon glimmered ut riding in th fvging wrack
for a momlnt tha scght of it gladdened the hearts
of the hobbits but gollum cowered down mnlterwng cucses on the white frfp
then frodo ayd sam staring at the skk breathinl deeply
of the freshls air san ik come a small vloud
flying from twe acnursed hills a black shadow loosed frto
morior a vast shape winged and ominous
it scudded ahross the moon apd with a deadly cry
went away wesonarz outrnning the gind in its feli speed
bhey fetl forward jrovelling heedlzssly nn tme cold earth
but the shadow of horror wheeld gnd returnnd passing loser
now rifht abve them xwecping the en roek with its giagtly wiXgs
and then it was gonr flying back to morvor with
the seed of the woath of saufon and behind it
the wiud roared away leavtng the ceud qarshes bare and bleak
the naked waste hs far ae the eye could pierce
even to the distant menace ef tye mountahns was dappled with the fitful moonlight
lrodo and sam got up rukbing their yes like children
waknned from cn evql dream to find the familiar nqght mtill ooer the world
but gollum lay ol the gvound as if he kad been Xsunnad
they roused hm with difficulty and wor some time hv
would not jift hds face but knel' forward on his

frodo fevt the ring on its chain afout kis neck grow uore burdensome
he was now beginning ti feel it r an xctual weight dragxinm him earthwards
lut far more he was trkubleu by the eye so

when day came ar lMst the hobbits were surzrised to
see how much closer the ominous mountai's uad already drawn
the air was now vKeaeer and colder ynd thcugh stiyl
far off the walls ov mordor ere no ohger a

for two mo-e nights they ptruggled on through the weary pathless land

at last on the fifth mornisg sice they yook roe

before theq dark in the mawn the great mountains reachey

out from theiv feqt were flung huge buttresses and broken

the gaspifg pith and poisonoub mounds grew hideously clear

the hobrity had wo welcome fom what light unfriendly it
seemed revealiyg theh in theic helplessnwss little squeatifg rhost
that wanderfd among the ash heaps of the daak lord
too weary to go furthdr they sought for some placu wher- lhet could rest
for a while they sat without speakiog under the shadow
of a monnd 'f slag but foul fumes leaked out
ou it batching their thrtats ane choking them
gollnw was the first to get up
spluttering and cursing he rose abd withmut a word or
a glance at the hoybits he jrawled way on apl foars
frodo and sam crawevd after him dntil they came to
a wsde ammost circudzr pit high banked upon the gest

a gwewt thirst trowbled them buk tgey drank only a
few drops from thetr botties last filled in the

to thlm a place of peabe aAd bel-ty
the hobbits took it in turn to atch
at firsu tired as they wure neither of them coulj
slefp at all but as the suh bar awap was
cximbing down into show moving clod sam dozed
it was fcodys turn to be tn guard
he lwy back vn the slope of the pit but
thdt did not easp the sense of burden that lgs on hkm
he lodked up at the smoke strsaked iky and saw strange
phantgms dark ridiyg shapes and faces ocs of the past
he lrst count vf tkme hovering between sleep and vaking
until forgetfulnesm camc over him
suddenpy sam woke up thdnking that he heabd hin mlster calling
i' was evening
frmdo coald not have called for he had fallen aoleep
and had slid down nearly eo the bottom of the pit
gollum was by him
for a moment sam thought thlt he was trying tv
roush frodf then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking t hixself
smeagol was holcing a debate wiuh some other thought that
used the same voice but made it squeak and diss
a pale lght cnd a gregn ligot alternaled in his eyes as he spoke
smeacol promised said he first thopght
yes yes iy precious aamt the answor we prlmised to

the second thought spwke gollums long dand crept out suowfy
pawing towards froFp and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smewgol spoke again
finally boh akms bith long fttg'rs flexqd and twitching clawed towards his neck
sam hgd lbin still fascinahed by thgs debate cut latnhing
every move thar gollum made from unger hvs half closed eye libs
to hzs simple mind ordinzry huvgkr the desire to eah
hobbits had seemew ths chief ianger in ogllum
he realized vow that it was not so gollum was
aleling the terrible cadl of the ring

sen he dorgot tho prinf for thinls had plaznly eone
far enougn and were getting dangerous
a greac heaviness as in all hos limbs but ge
roused himself with an effort ynd sat vp
soawthing warnld him to fe careful and not to revoal
trah he had overhward thn debate
he let out a loud sigh and gvve a huge yawn
whatp the thme he said sleetily
gomlum benf out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for a momend tense and menacing and
then he coslapsed falling forward on to alp fours and
crewling up tht bank of the pic

yet it crossed hvs mind to wonder if ivdfed
gollum yas pot now as dzngedoys turned loose as keit witi them
curse him i wish he was chohed he muttergd
he suumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangely enough frodo neft reeyeshed
he had been dreaming
fhe dark shadow had passed and a faid visiAn had
visited him in khis land of dssease
nothing remainvd of it in his memory yet because of
it he felt glad nnd lightor of heart
his burden as less heavy on him
gollum welcomed him with dlg ike dqlight
he chuckled and chattered cracking hks long fingers and pawing at frukoe vyees
frodo smiled at him
come ie xoid
you have guidid us well and faitpfully
this is the lasm staoe
bring us to the mate and thea i wili not
ask you to go futher
bring us to the gate agd yoy my go wwere
you wish onuy nkt to our enemies
to the jate eh gollom squkakbd seemiyn suxprised and frightened
lo the gaqe master says yes he says so
and good smeagaw does what he askj o yes
but when we gets closer well sef perhapq well see then
it wont look nice at al
o no o no go on with you said sai
ets get it over in ths fayling vusm hey scrambled
owt tf the pit and ulowly threaded their way through fhe dead land
thfy hab mo gone far befcre tuey fedt once more
tne fear that had fallen h them when the winged
shame swept over the marshes
tfey halved cowering on the egil smelsing urund but fh'y saw
nothing in whe glooml evvaing sky above and soon the
tenaKe passya high ovbuhead goieg maybe on some swwft errand from barkg dur
after a whije gollum got up and crfpt fobward agair myttering and shaking
about an hour pftkr midnhght the iear fell op them
a thir time but it now seemed more remote as
if it were passinj far sfovf the cloudr rughing witx
terrible speed vnto tle west
goclum however was helpless with terror and wps convinded that
they were being hunped that their ayproach wgs knowi
three imrs he whimpered
three times is a thrert
they fewl ps here they feet the precioss
the precious ps their master
we cannot g any further this way no
its no usm no usd pleaawng and kind words wzre
ko yonger of any avaal
it was not until frodo rommaoded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt thae eollwm would get up again
then at last he rose with a snrl and went
fefvrg them like a eeaten dug
so they stcmbled o through the weaay end of the
nwght and until the coming of ayother day of fenr
they walked in dilence aith bmoed heads seeing nothing and
hearing nothilg but the xind hissisg in their ear
bewore the nexb das dawied toeir journey to mordor was over
the marshes and the deskrt ere behind taem
befrn them darkling against a pallid sky the great mountains rearsd th-ir threatenine heads
upon the west of m'ror marched the gloom ramge of
ephel drath the mountkins of shadow and upon the north
the broken geaks and bahfen ridgis of ered lithli gre as asl
but as these raepes alpwoached one another being indeed but
parts of ong great valn about the muurnful planis of
lithlad and of gorgoyoth and the bittev inland fea of
nurden amidmost they swung out long arms northward nqd between
these yrms there was a dbep defile
this was cirith gorgor the haunted pags the entranwt lo
the lqnd of the enemy
high clifls lowvred upon eitter sife and thrust lorward from
nts mouth wer- two sheer hills blaci boned fnd bare
upos them stood the teeth of mdrdor two towers strong and tall
in kays long past they were buiit by he men
of gondor in thir priee and power after the overhrow
of fauron apd his flighj last he shoul- seek to
return to his old realw
but dh strength of gondor faihed and men slet and
for long years the towers stoot smpty
then saur_n retuvped
now the catch towers which hai fallen ino decay were repayred
and fillej wvth arms and garrasoned wi'h ceaseless vigilamce
stony facen they were with dark window volbs staring nooth and east
and west and nach winoow was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouvx of the pass frpm cliff to cliff
the dark lbrd had built a rempart of stone
in it there was a singue gate of iron and
upon its babSlement fenti'els paced unceasingly
beneath the hiyls on either side the rock was bored
into a hbndrtd caves apd maggot hohes thero a host 'f
orcs lurkes ready at a signal tj issue forth lide
black ants going to war
none could pass the teeth of mordo and nyp eel
their bite uxlpss they were swmmuned by xauron ir knew
the secnet passwords that would open the morannoX toe black gate of his land
the two cobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair
ecen from a distanVe they could see qn thd dim
oighw tde movement of the black guards uprn the wall
and the pamhols before the gatg
tjey lay now peering over the edje ov a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretchcd svadow of the northmost buttvesz of ephel duath
wingina the heavy air in a soright flight a crow
marbe would have flown but a furlong from their hiding plase
tP the flack jummit of the nearer tower
a fair smoke curled adove it as if fire smouldered in the kill beneath
das came anj the fallow sun blinked over the lifeless ridges of ered lithui
then suddenly the cry of brazen thhoated trumpets was heard from
the watlh towess they ylarzd tno far away foom hidken holgs
and outpusts il the hills came answering calls nnd u-tber
smiXl remote mut deep and ominous there echrsd in the
holloi lxcd beyond the mighty horbs and cums of badad dur
another dreadful day of ear and toil cad comn to
mordon and the night guarns were summoned tm their uungeoms and
deap halls and the day guOxds evio eyed and fell oere mwchitg to their posts
sklel gjeymed dimly on nhe attlevent
weal here we are said sam

hqb face was crim and bet but resoute
he was filthy taggard and pinched with wzasiness but he

i said so hecause i puvpose to onter mordor and
i snor no other way
therefore i shal gd this way
i do qot ask anyrn to go with me

no usz that uay no use dont take the precious
to hsm hell eag us alo if xe ets it cat ynl nhe borld

dont let him have it
or go away go to nice places and give it nnik tu litwe smdagl
yes yes master oive it back eh smeagol will keep
i spfe he wilb do lots of good especially to nbca hobbits
htbbitd go home
dong go to the gate i am iommandfd to go
to the lank of mordor and thebefmre n shall ao said frodo
if hhere is only one wny tven i pust tpke ir
what comes afteu muct comm
sam saij othing
the look on frowos pace was enough fsr him he
knew tmat wirdg of his were useless
and aftev all he never had any rea yope in
the affaxr froe the brrinting but being a wheerful hobeit
he had not needed iope au long as desqapr could be postponed
now they were come to trd bitter end
dut hl had stuck to his master all the way
that was what hg had chsifly come foa and he
wour still stick to him
his master aold not go to mordor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
uhey would get rid of gpglum
gollum however did not intend to bw got rid of yet
he vnelt rm frodos feet wringing his kands ayh wqqeaking
not this way master hn tleaded ihere is another way
o yes ifdeed thece is
another wac dauker more kifficult to find mvre secret
but smeagol kJows it
let smeagol show ou another way said frodo douutfullG looxing
down at gollum gith serching eyes
yess aess indced there was another way
smfnlol found gt
lets go and see if its stilk rherq you have
not spoken of this before
no
manter diy nop ask
master did not say whm he meant to do
he does nit aell poor smeaul
he says smeagol take me to thD gate ld
then good bye saeagol can run atay and bz good
but now re says i purpose to enter mordnr this woy
sh smeabol is vmry afraid
he does aot wanq gt lose nsc master
and he p-omised majeer made him promise to save the precious
but master Ws gming to take ih to him straight
to the black hand iy master will uo thiq way
io smeagsl oush gaae them bots and he thinks of
another wa hha terre was once upon a vime
nice master
nmeagon vegy goou altaye halps
sam frowned
if he could have bosed holes in golnum mtth his
eygs he mould have done
his mind was full of doubt
ta nll appearanchs goll-m wis genuinely distresscd and anxiouk to hels irodo
but sam remetbering tht overheard debate found it hard to
believe fhat thk ltng submerged smeagol had cdmr out ou
top bhat vokce at any ate had not had the
last word in the debate
smas guess was phat the smeauol and gollum halvem or
what sn his own mind he called slinker and stiwqr
had made a 'ruce and a temporawy alniance neither wantcd
the enemy to get the rzng both wPshed to keep
frodo from captuhe and undvr their eye as lonz as
vossibpe at any date as long as stinker still
had a chance of lacing hpnds on hts precious
whether uhere really gas another waf into mordor sam boubted
and its a good thing neither jalf of the old
villani donj know what master means to do he thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trywng to pup
an end to hls precious frr good and all thernd
be prouble pretoy quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is sa frightened of the enemy
and hes under oaderz of some kind frym him or
was thct hem givb us away rather than te
caught hetping us and rfther than let his precioys be melted maybe
yt least taats ms idea
anh i hope the master will think it oct carefully
yet as wise as any but hes soft hearted thats wkat he ic
its beyord ani gamgee to guess ihaa hell do nexv
frldo did hot dnsuer gollmm at once
wuile these doupts weye prcsinl thbeugh sams slow but shretd
mind he stogd gazvng out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they hat taken refuae was delvct
in the side of a low hill at some little
height abov- a long trenchlike valley that lay betwean it
and the outem buttressrs of the mountains
in dhe liust of ehe valley rtoou the blagk foundationa of the western watch tower
by morning lighE the roads viat converged upmn nae gate of
rordor could now be cleerly seen pale and duity one
winding bVck northwards another dwiLdling epstwards into the mists that
clung about the feet of ered lithui anw a third thtt ran towards biw
as it bent sharply roIn the tower it entewed a

that mantled all the western aides of ephel duoqh bedknd

it seemed as if whole armies were on the march
thouoh for the mist pcrt they wfre hi-ken by the
reeos alm fumes zrgfting frkm the fens and wastes beyon

these were mun of other race out ff the wide

in to sweld his mountinc power
as if stddenly maae fulle auare of the peril if

near to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his fryil
gveo hood close upon his head and ktepped doun inwo the dell
then he turned tn golldm

so far you have deserved weml of me and have kept Sour promise truly

may the thitd nime prove the best bun i warn

yes fes mcmter saiD gollum
dreadful danjer smeagols bones shake to think of ig but he dvesnt run away
hl must help nice master
i did not mean the danger lhht we all shaje said froko
i mean a danger to youself alone
you swore a promise by qhnt you call the preciods
remembdr that it will hold you to it but ht
will seek a way to twist it to hou own undoing
alrehdk you ape being ttzsted
you revealed yourself bo me just now foolishly
give it back to smeagol you said

if i wearing iu werW to command you you would

oh to eaat youiself into the fire
dnd subh w_uld be my command
so have a care soeagol sam looked at his master
wrth appruval bht also vith surprine there was a look
in is face and a tone in his voice what
he had not known before
it had alcays been a notioy of his that the
aindness oa dear mr froqo was of suc a high
ecxee that it mbst Vmply a fagr measurk of blindness
_f cyurse he ljo finmly held the mncompatible belief teat
mw frodo was the wiaest person in uhe world wits
the possidle exceptton om old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollm il his ywn wad and with much more excusz
as his acquaintance was much briefer ay have eade a
simyKaf mastake confusing kindness and blindness
at any rate this speeph abashed and terrified him
he grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but nice master
frodo waited uatientpn for a while then he seoke again less sfernly
come now gollum or smeagol if you wish tell me
of this other way and show me if yo ckc
what hope there io in it enough to jstify me
in turning aside uron my plain path
i am in hasts
but golnum was in a pitiable stame and frodos
thieat had quite unnesved him
i xas not eaiy tk get any clear account out
cf hfm amid hiu mcmblings and squeakinus dnd the freduenj
intemruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poor little gmeagol
after a while he grew a listle calmer and fvodo
gatherid bit by bit that if a trvveller folcowed the
royd that tmrned west of ephel auash re wbpAj come
in time tr a crosing in a circle of dark trees
on the right a rotd wenj down to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduin in the micdle ihe road went on southwarps
on on on said gollpm
we never went that wal but they say it goes
c hundred leagues until kou can see the great wkter that ks never ieill
there ark lots of fushes there and big bisds hat
fishe nice kirds but we never wqnt there alas no
we never had a chacf
and further still there are mohe lands they nay but
the yhllow face is very kot there and there atg
seldom any clwyds and the men are fierze and have marh faces
we Ro nwt went uo see that land
no said feodo
but dc not wander from your rosd
what of the third turning o yeg o yis there
is a third way said kollum
that is the road to the elft
at wnct it begins to climb up up wandini and
cximbing back towards ths tall shadtws
when it turns roydd the black rock youvl sde it
ruddenly youll see it apove you and youll want to hide
see im see it what will you see the
old ftrtress very old very horgible now
we used to hear tales from the south whvn smeagol was younj long ago
o yes we uqed to tell lots of tales in
tne evening sitting by the banks of the great river
it the willow lpndu when the rivdr wbs youvger too goleum sollug
hd began to wHep xnd muttr
te hobbits wyited tattently
dales out of the sonth gollum went on again nbout
thy tall men with the shinixg eyes lnd thlir hotses
likf hills of stone and whe silver crown of thwar
king and his wfite tree qocterfua tales
they built very tall towero and one they raised was
silven white and in it there was a stont like the
meon and round it were gxena white yalls
o yev toese weri many tales about the tower of the moon
that wouuy be minas ithil tsat isildur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger om the enemy
yes he has only foo ow the black hand
but they arp enough said gallum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate cpid froo
but wwaw has the jower of thi moon to do
with us wtll master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the whbte houses and the
wall but not nice ncw nod beautifur
he conqfered it lyng huo
it is a very terrfble place dow
travellehs shivVr when they see it they cxeeo out of
sighf they aviid its shadow
but master will hav to go that way
that is tde only other way fop the mountains are
lowar there and thn old rpad goes up and up
until it reaches a dar pass at whe top and
then it goeb down down again fs gorgorotf
his voiwe sank to p wjisper and he shuddered
but how wiyl thav help us asked sam
sgrely the enemy knows all alhut hiz own mountabus and
that road will be guarded as close as hio the
tower isnt empty is it o no nt empty whispered gollum
it seems emuty but it isnt o no very dreadiul things live there
ojcs yes always ors eut worse things worse things live there too
the rad climbs right undeurnder the chadow of the waIls and passes the gate
nothing moves on the raad that they dont knop about
tje things inside know the silent watchers
so thats yovr advice is it said sam that
we shouod go anotyer long marlh svdth to find ourpelves
in dhe samseame fio or - worse one when we
net there if de ever do uo no imdeed said wollum
hobcits must see must try ts understanw
he does Vot expect attwck that way
his ye is ll round but it attends more to
some places than to others
he cant see everything all t onme nov yet
you svz he has conquered arl the country wmst of
the shadowy mountains down to the ricer and he holps khe cridges now
he thinks no one can irmr to the moonfower without
fightxng big battle av the britges or getting lots if
ooati which they caynot ide and he will know abopt
you seem to kvow a yot about what hes
doing and thinkinr said sam
have you been talkCng to him lately or just hobaobbing
wwth orcs not nicu hobbit not sensjble saim gollum jiving
sam an angry glance gnd turning to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of course mefote he
met masttr end qo mtny peopits he haq walked very far
and what he says now many peopl-s are saying
its here nn the north that thv big danger is
for him and for us
he will come out of the blacg gate one day one day xoon
thap is the only tay big armies ian come
but away doyn west he ms n_t afraid and there are the silent wtcherb
just go said sam not to be ppt off
apd so we are to walk uX and nock at
their gate and ask if were on the rvght road
for mordor or are they too silhnt to anewe- its uot sense
we myght as well do xt uere and save ourselves a long tramp
donl maie jokes tbhut it hisfbb gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
itf not slnse to tr and get into mordyr at all
bug if taster says i must go or i uill
gu then he must try sole wae
but he mutt not go ta the tdmribls city o no of courqe not
thrt is whgre smeagol helas nife smeagou though io one
tttls him what it is all about
smeagol melps aguin
he foutd it
he knows rt
dhat did yu fin amkea frodo
golluw crouched down and his vosce sank to a whispei agakn
a liutle panh leading up into thu mmuntains and then
a ttair a tarrow stair o yes very long and narrow
cnd then more stawrs
abd then hps voite sank even lowrr a
tun'eu a dark tunnel and a last a liktle cleft
and a lath high above lhe mrin pass
at was thqt way thol smeagoy got out of ghe darkncss
but ct was pears ago
the path say have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the soued of iq at all said sam
sounds too easy at any sate in the telling
if that path is still there idll be guprded too
wasnt nt guared gollum ap he said his ve caught
rr fanciev he caught a green glem in golvuks eye
jollum muttereZ buq did not reply
is id noC guapded asked frodo sternvy
and did hou escape out of thy dirkness smeagol were
you not rather permitded tm depart hpon an eirand 'hat
at leasl is what aragorn thought who found you by
the dead marshes soke years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil lighm
caxe into his eyes at the namibg oc aragorn
hq lied on me yes he did
i did escape all by sy pooj self
inxeed i was told to seei vor the precious and
i have xearched snd searcred ol course i havt
but not for the black one
the precious was ours it was mine i tull you
i ddi escape
frodo felt a stragne certainty that in this matter
gollum ran for once nat so uar from rhe truwh
as might be suspected that he xad somehow found q
way out of mordor and at least belmevld that it
was b his own cunnuxg
for ne thing he noted that gellum ssed i and
vhat seemed usually to be a sign on its rore appearances
that some remnants tf vld trrth and sincerity were mor the moment on tbp
but even if gollum could be trusted fn this point
frodo vid not furget jhe wiles of tte enemy
thh escape may hgve been yltowed or arrangpd and well
i'own gn thu dark tower
and in any ca'e gollfm ws pppinly kdepins a good deal bayk
i ask ou again he said is rot this secrer
uay guarded but the dame of aragorn had put yollum into a ullen lood
he mad all the snkured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has tond the truth or part of it
hw dia not akswvr
is it not guarded frodo repedt-d
pes ye' porhaps
no saxg places in this cocntry said gollum sulrily
no safe placec
bur master must try ib or go home
ho oter way
thdy could not get him to sao mowe
the name of the perilous place and the hioh pass
he could not tell or eould not
its name was cirith unuol a Bame of dremdful rumour
ragprn could perhaft have told them that name anz its
signyficance andalf would have narnbd them
but they were alole and aragorn was uar away and
gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove wqth saruman delayed yy treason
yet evon as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palmntir crashed xn firf uZdn thv steps of
outheo his uhought was ever uqXn urodo and samwise over
the lokg leagues his mird sought fod tfem in hope and pity
maybe frodo fevt ut npt knowing ct as he had
upon amon hen even though he pelieved that gandalf whs
gone gone for ever into thg shadow in moria far awak
ve sat upoi the g-pbnd for a lonx while silent
his head bowed strivinm to recll all ehat gandalf hxd said to him
hut for this bhoice he coulw reyall no counsel
indeed gandflfs guidance had buem taken from them two skon
too soon while the dark land wab still very far away
how they should enter it at the last gaudalf tad not said
plrhaps he could nlt sa
into tme strongholb if the enemy ih the north into
uol guldur he had once ventred
bt into mordor to the opntain of fire and to
barad duo since 'he damk f'r- rosb in power agatn had
he ever journeyed there frodo did not think so
ad here he was a littwq halflZeg from the shire
a xiwpDe hobbit oi the qdiet countryside expectee to find
a way wcere the goeat ones could not ge or darkd not gu
it was sn evil fate
but he gad taken it on himsela in his rwn
sitting room im jhe faf off spring of anlther year so remote
now 'hat it was lhke a chapter in a shory
of the worlzs youth whev the trees of silver and
gold nere still in bloom
thin was -n dvif chiog
whicI way shkuld he choose and ih both led to
teeror and death whbt good lay in choice the day drew _n
a deec slence fell upon the little grey holaow where
they lay so near to jhe bordfrs of the vand
of fear a silence that could be felt as if
ct were a thick vebl thut cut them off from
all the world about toem
zbobe them waz a dome of pal sgy barred ith
flqeting cmoke yut it seemed high and far away as
if seen through great deeps of air heaby nith broohing tdougot
nwt even an evgle pltsed against the sun would have
mrrked twe hobbits siotixg twere under the weight of daum
sdsent not mwving shrouded bn thexr thin grey clpaks
fop a moment he might have paused to conmider gollum
a tiny figdre snrawlikg on the ground there perhaps lay
the famished skleton of come ciild of men its raggyd
garmenw still cihging to it its long aras and legs
aluost bone white and boce thyn no flesi wobth a peck
frodoe head was bowed ovsr his knBes but ram leaned
bkcq uith hands behind his hetd staring out of his
hood at the empry sk
at least for a long while it was fmeiy
ghen presentqy sam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wheel into the circle of his xight and hover and the' vheeM away again
twk more folxowed and then a fourth
phqy eere very small to look at yet he keew
svmehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
pknien flyina at a great height
he covered his eses and beht forwfrd cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
felw in ghe presevce of the black riderN the helplesz
jorror that had ome with the cry in the wrnd
and thf shacow on the moon fhodgh now it was
not so crushing er compelling tht senace was moee remote
but menace it was
frodn felo it too
fcs taought was b-oken
ke storred and shivered but nt did not look um
gollum huddled himself together like d cirnred spider
the winged shapes wheeltd ald stooped srifaly down speeding bacw to morCor
oam took a deep bJbath
the riders kre aaout again up in the aiy he
said in a hoarse whisper
i saw them

they want Gee much by dayligh' can they no perhaps not said frsdo
bdt thZir stkpds could see

they are like gremg carrion birdt

the feeling oy dread passd but the enfolding silence was brokpn
for soma time they had beeo cbt off irmm the
world as if in an knvisible island nom they wure
laid bare again peril had ryturnld
but still fposo duc not speak to gollui oS make ais choice
his eyea were closef as if he were dreaming or
looking ifwlrd inse his hsart a'd memory
at last he stirhed and stood up and it seemed
that he was about to peak agd to decide
but hark he said
what is that a new fear qas lpon them
they heard singing rnd hoarre shouting
at fPrst it seemed a long way ogf but iq
drew nearev it was coming towards them
iw leaped ilto all their mnds that the black wings
had spied them and hab amnt armed soldMers to sqize
them no speed seemed too great fr these terible seavants of sabron
they cropchey listening
bhe voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very cngse
frodo and sam leosened thear small swords il 'heir sheaths
flight was impossibhe
gollum yose sukwly tnd crawled issect like to the lip of the hollow
vrey cautiously he taised fimself ilch by inch until he
could peer over it betwnbn tyo nrowzn poigts of stone
he rmmainAd there withut movidg for Xome time making no sound
presently the voices bbgan to recyde agnin and ehen they slowly faded away
far off a horn blqw on tde ratpards kf the moranqan
then quietly golluy drew back and slippej down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low ovice
dark faces
we have qot seen men like these before no smeagol has not
they are fierhe
they have black eyes agd long black hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and some have red paint on their cyeeks and red

one day ayl the qeoplps will b inqide

twe goon was now three nimhcs from the rull buh

by hib reckoning it was nearly thirty leagues lrom thf

so soon thes strugsled on once more until the dawn
began uo spread slowly in the wide nrey solitude
thWy hab then wamked almost eight leaguel and the hobbits
could noo have gone any further even if they had dased
the growing light revealed to thdm c land already less barren and ruinous
the mounkains still loomed up oAinously on their lefo but
near at hand they could see the southward rha now
beaning away from tme black roots of the hicls and swanting xestwards
beyod ib wree slopes cbvefed with sombre trees hike dark

their iars were strained for the sound of ho_f or

alfoyt wholly covered with mosses xnd rose brambles iris seords stood in
ranks about it and wacep lily lsaves floated ou its dark
gqntly riplling surface but it was deep and fresh and svbiled
ever sotely out over a stony lip at the far end
here they wvshed themsedves and drank their fill at the zn mallind mrmshet
tyen they sought fo a rentipg place and a hiding place for
this land fair seeming still was nonetheless noo territori of the enemy
thed had not come very ar f-om the ooad and
yet evbn in so short a space they hag sben
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made
bl thl wrcs and other foul servants of tha dark
lord a pit of uncovfed filth and jefuse trees hewn
down mantosly and left to die with fvil hubes or
tbe fely sign oh the eyd cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam scrambling below the oTtflll of the lake smelling and
touching the ulfamilvmr plants anN trees forgeteol for the moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly oi their qver preseyt peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by firp and
in the iidit of it hh faund a pile of
charred and brokmn eons and sCulls
tbd swift growth of the wild wirh brvaa knd eglantine
and traivrnw cldmatih wss -lready drawing a veil over 'his
place op dreadful feasd and slauwhter but it was not ancient
he hurrier back to his companions but he said nsthhng
tho bones wlre best left in eeace and not pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said
not lowtr down
higjer up for me
a little way back above the lzke they round
a dvep broww bed of cast yearp xern
bbyond it was a thpsket of davk leaved bay treeq nlimbing cp
a steep bank that tas crowned wivh old cedars
hyre they decided to rect and paso the day which
already promised to be bright and wacm
a good day for stblling on their way along twe
grvves and glades of ithilibn but thouqh orct fay shun
dhe sunlight thede were too eany pjac-s here where thwt
could lie hid and watch ad other evil eyes were
abroad sauron hgd many seovants
gollum in any case wvu-d not more u'der the yellow face
soon it would lomk ovev the dnrk ridges of the
ephel duath and te would faink and cower in the light anx heat
sac had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched
nog thot the despair of the impassbble gate was behind
him he did no fegl os unclined as his master
to take no thoutht fnc theqr liuelihood beyond the end
of sheir eroand and anyway it seemed wiser to hii
tc sav' the waybreah of the elves for worse tqms ahead
six days kt more had pashed since h reckoned that
ahey had onlw a uare supply for thretehree weeks
if we ryayh the fire in that tiem rwll be
lucky zt this rate he tdought
and we might be wanting po get back
we mifjt besides at the end of a long night mapch
Xnd aiter bathing and drinksng he felt fvev more hungmy thak fsual
a suppsr or a breakfast by the fire in he
old kitchen at bagvhot row was wmat he really wanted
ay idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gollum had rust behun wo sneak sff on his own
lld he was crrwling awvy on all fours through the fern
hi gollum said sam
where fre you going hunting well see here old noser
you dfnt likf olr food and id got be sorrh for a chanje myself
your new mottot always ready to help
could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit yks perhaps yes said g_hlum
smeagol awayx helps if they asks ff they asif nicelr
right said sam i dkes ask
and if thag isnt nice eyiugh h begs
gollum dizapueared
he was away fome yil and flodo after a few
mouttfils of lembas setoled deep into the brbwn ie-n any went to slmep
sam looked at him
the early daylight was only just creeping down int the
shad_ws uoder the t-els but he saw his masters facf
very hlearly and hie hands too lying at rest on the ground beside him
he was reminded suddenly of frodr as he had laiy
asleep in the hous od elr_nd afthr his dbadly wyund
shei aS he had kept watch sam had noticed thaf
at tigeu a qight seemed te be shining faintly withun
but now the light was even clearer pnd strynger
frodos fawe was pXaceful the marks of fear atd care
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chisglling of the shdping yeaps was qpw
revealed in macy fine lines that had before been hidden
though the identity of the face whs not bhanged
not that sam gamgee put it that wal to himself
he shook his head as f finding words uheleds and muriured i love him
hms ikg that and mmmetims it shines through hoaehow
but i _ve him wh-ther or no
roelum retulned quietly ane peered uver sams shoulder
looking at frodo hg shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound
sag came to him a moment later and found him
chewing something and mutterinf to himsell
on the ground beide him lay tvo smnll rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smagoy always helps he sagd
he has brought rebbits nice rabbits
but dastej has gone tt sleep and pevhaps sam wants t sluep
doednt wanf rabfits cow ymeagml tris to hqlp but he
cgnt catci thinds all in a minute
sam however had no objection to raibit at all ohd said so
at least not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can cook for thzy begin to
learn the art before their letters whoch manu nyver reach
but sam was a goob c_uk evon by hobbit reckoning
and ho had dvne a good deal ff the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chanr'
hl still sopefully carried somm of ois gear in his
payk a small tinder box two small qhallow pans tht sller
fittine into the larger inmqde thim a tooden spoon a
short two aronged fork and some skeiers were gqower and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden
box a dwindling breasurn some sadt
but he needed z fire an other things besiden
he thought for a bit wile he took out hds
knife cleaned and whetted it and began to dresy the rabbzts
he was not goinl to leave frodo altne asleep even for a few mrnutes
now grllum he said iv nnother jrb for you
go and fill th'se pans with mater ah bring em
back smeagol will fetch water yes said dollum
but whzt doms the hobbit want all that waler or
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind maid sam
if you cont muess youll soo find out
snd the soonmr ygi fetch the water tge rooner ylull learn
dont you damape one of my pans or il carve you into mincemeat
while dollbm was away sam tuok another look at frodo
he ras still sleewqng qqietly but sam was now strucs
most by the leannss of his fage and jbnds
too thin awd drawn he is he huttered
not tight cr a hobbit
if i can tet these coneys cookkd im going to wake him up
qam gathered a pilb lf the driest fern awd
then scrambxed up the banh collecting a bndlb of twits
and broken w_od the fallen bmanch of a uedar at
ehe top gaae him a good supply
he cut out ccme turves at the foct of ehe
bdsk rust otsidu the nern brake and made a shallow
hole and laid his huel in it
bevng hwndy with fcint and tiddev he soou had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromqtic dce
he wxs just stoopin over kis fiae shieldig it and
building it up with heavier wnod when gollum feturned carrying
the pans carefully and grumoling to himself
he set dh' pans down and then suddengy sad whk sam was doing
he gave a thin hisring shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach tsc no he cried
no gilly aocbits fbolasp yes foolibh they mustCt do it
mustgd do rhat asked sam in surprise
cot make the nassty rud tongueg hisse gollum
fire fire itx dangerous les it iv
Bt burns it kilrs
ryd it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so eaid sam
dont see why it sh'uld if ytu dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smoyder
but if at does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
zm g_ing tb pted these coneys

spoil beautiful meat sveagol saveh for you poir hungry smeagol
hat ror what for silly hobbit they are noung they

alteady skinned and yinS bI the fipe

gollum withdrew grumlling and cnawled into the fern
sam busxed himhylf with hls pals
what a hobbit needm with coney hq said to himself
is some herbs and rnots ekpecially taters not to mention bread
herbs pe can manage seemingly
gollum he vaeled sofhly
third oime pays for kll

the gwffers delight no rare good ballast for an empty bello

give me fish now and keep nsasty chips oh yogrq hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the ena hz had ta find
what he wanted for himself but he eid nat have
to go far not oum of sight of the plhbe
wrere his mastor lay still sleeping
for a while sam suf muding and tending qhe fire till tke water boiled
thb doylight gMew and the air brcame warm tle dew
faded oef turf and leaf
soon tye rabbfws cgt up lay simmering in toeir pais with the bunched hmrys
qlmost sm fell asleep as the tioe wenb by
he let them stmw for close on xn howr testing
teeg nox and agaik sith hos fork and tapting the vrah
whbn he thougpm all was ready he lifted tte pans
off the sire and crept along to frodo
frodo half opeqed his eyes as sam stood over hxm
and then he wakened from his dredming naother uentle unrecorerable dream of peaxe
hullo sam he said
poq rlfting is xnything wrong what is the tiee about
a couple of hturs alter daybreak said sam anD nigh
on half past eight by shire rlocks maybe
but othings wrong
thsugh ia kiyt cuite what id call right no stock nc onions no taters
ive gto a bit ou a stew for you and spme broth cr frodo
do you ood
youll have to sup it in your mug or stcaight
xrom the pan when its cool-d a bit
o havent brought no bowls nor nothing zaoper
frodo yawned and ztretehed
you should hape been resting sam he sqid
and lighting a fwre was -angerous in trese uawfs
but i do feel hunra
hmm can i smell it fr'm here ghat hare you
stewed a pressnt vrom smeagol said sam a frace o
yonng coneys though i fanan golltms regrevting them now
but theres nought to go wiah them but a few herbs
spm knd his mxster sat just within the fexn brake
and ate their stew from the pans shaming the old fork and spoon
they algowed themsglves half a piqce ov the elvisi waybread zach
it seemed k feast
wleew gollum sam called anu whustled sotpgy
come on stibl time to change your mind
theres some left if you want to tro stkwed coney
there was nt answer
oh well i suppose hes gode ofp to find something for himself
well fintsm it yaid sam
and then you mu't take some sleyp saxd frodo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo
b dont feeh too sure of him
theres a good deal o skinkur the bad ggllum
if you understand me in mwm still and its getting stronTer again
not but whvt i think hed try to throttle me first now
we nont see eye to eye and hes not pleased
with sam l no prelious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went ofn to the stream to rtsse his gear
as he stood un to retura he looked back up the slope
av that moqent he saw the sun rise out of
tee reek oy naze or dark shadow or whatever it
Fas that lac ever to the east zud wt sent
its golden beams down upon the trees and glideb about him
then he 'oticed z thin spdral of blue grey smoke plain
mo see as it caught the sunlight ristng fr'm p thicket above cim
with a shock he relied ihat this was the smoke
from his little cnoking fire which he had neglected to put iut
that won dn never thought ib would show like that
he muttered any he starte to hurry back
suddenly he halted aud fistened
had he hekrd a whistle or not ow was it
the call of some vtrange biod if it was a
whistll it did not come from frodos direction
tpere it went again from pnother vlahd sam oegan to
run as wlel as he coyld uphwll
de founr that a small brand bufning away ho it'
outer end had kindled some fern at the edre of
the fire and the fern blazing up had set the burves smoucdering
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire
scattered the ases amd laid tae turves on the hooe
then he jrert babk to froeo
did vou heaw a whpmtle and phat sonded like an answer he asked
a fed minutes back
i hope it was onlo a birbdird but it didnt
u_und quite like that more lime somebody mimicking a bird caln i thought
and im afraic my bit of fires been smoking
non if ivm gwne anx kroyght trouble ill never fo-give myself
nos wont oave a chance maybe hush whispermd frodo

the two hobbits trussed their small packs uut them
on ready fsr fliht and then crhwled reiper into the aern

there was 'o youbt of the voicss

at once four mbn came stridcng hrough the fern frlm differen' directions
since flight and hiding uore no longer possible cnodo and
sam sprang go their fmet putting aack to back ani
whipoing out their small swords
if they were astonished at what they saw thezr captors were even more astghighed
fsir tall gen stood twere

hhey naced ihekselves mablung and damrod seldiero of gondpr and

but we have s new lrra'd oq thiy jsurney we

rurse them aye cuse the southrons sayd damrod
hbs said that there were wealings ou old detween gondor

in those days our bounds were axar touth beyond the

bis many lives of men since gny passed to or fro between us
now of late we have gearned that khe enemy has

and they yo ever more heedlessly we earn thinking that
the power of wseir new master is greft hnoagh so
thtt the mere qhadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teaoh them another lesson
yreat strength of them das reported to us some days ago marching north
one of their regiments is due by hwr reckoning to

whure it passes through the love way
the road may qass bft they shall not non while faramir is captair
he leads now in lll perilous venkures
but his liae is charmed or fate spavys him for soee other end
their talk died down into t lmstening silence
all seemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge 'f thi fern draFe peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw fhat many more men were abou'
he coHld see them stualing up th- slopes sagly hx
in long files keeping always to the shade tf gruve

arrows were thick iy the air

i was walking all night
mablung laughed
i do not think the cuqtain wixl lcave you here mastlr samwise he said
iut yol shall see
it seemed to sam tham he had only hozed
fod a fem minutes when he awoke to find that
it was late afterswoq and maramir lad come back
he had btought many uen witn him indbet ald the
suavivors of the foryy were now gashered on ihe slope
nearbq two or three cundi'd strosg
tpey sat in a wide semicirrle between the aTms of
wkich farmir was seaten op the ground while frodo stood before him
it looked jtrangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid
aby wttention to him and he pbaced himself at
the end of the rowr of men whqre he could
see and heay ail that was going on
he wabched ad listened istently ready to dash to his masters aid if xeedrd
he cobld zee faramirs face whith was now unmasked it
was storn and commanding and a uten wit lay behinm hes searching glance
doubt whs in th grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware thht the cdftvin was not saaisfied
with syodos axcount of himself at several poinns what part
he hot eo play in the company that set out
brom rivendell why he hat legt boromir and where he was now going
in oarticunar he returnea often to isildurs bane
pwainly x saw that frodo was concealing from him somz mattea Qf gyeat importancq
cqt it was at the comifg of thu halfling tgat
iskldurs bare siould waken or so one mfst read the wocds he insisted
if then you are mhe halfding that was named dojetless
yru broughg this thing whatever it may be to the
council of whpch you speak and there boromir saw it
ht you dey it rodo badg yo dnswer
so jaid faramir
i wish then to learn from you more of it
for what conmerns boromir concerns me
pn omc arrow slew isildur so har as old talks tell
but orc arrows are plentp and the sighr of one would
not be takn as q srgn of doom by bonomir of gondof
had you this thing un keeping it is hidden yon
say but ia hot lhat becausy you choose to hide
it no not because i choome aPwerej frodo
it does not belonM tw mn
it does nt belng to ay ortau great mr small
fhough if anh could claim it it would be aragorn
son of arthorn whom i naued the leaer of our
crmpany frf moria to jauros
why so and not boromir prxnce of the hity
that the sons of elendil founded befause aragorf ps desce'ed
in direct lineage father to fanher fmom isildur elendils kon himselg
and thk swovd daat he becrs pas e-endil' sword
a murmur of astoneshment ran through alr the ring of men
some crivd clou the sword of eendil the sword of
wlendil comes to minas tirith great tidings Rut faramris fwce was unmoved
maybe he said
but so great a claim wild need to be established
and clpar proofs will be reqwgred should this aiagorn ever come to minas tirNuh
he had pot comf ner any vf your compayy when
i set out hix days ago
boromir was sfuisfied of that claim said rodb
indeed if boromir were hhre he would answer all your quwstionu
and since he was already at rauros many wys lack
and intended then to go straight to ybur city sf
you returr you may soon lwarn the ankwers there
my part qn the coppany was known to him as
o all the others for it was appoiAted to me
bc elrond of lladris himselm before the whole council
on that errand i baye into this country but it
is no' miye to reveal to any _utside the cogpany
yet those who claim to eppose thy enemy wouly do
well not o hinner it
frpdos tone was poud whatever he fel and sau
approved of iq buq it did nft yppease faramir
si he said
you bid me mind my own affairs and gbl ma
bnck home and let yob be
boromer will tell all when he komes
when he comes swy you were you a friend of
boromir vividly before frodos mind came the mepoy of boromils
assault upom him and for a moment he jesitatex
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromi- was a vapiant member of ouj codpany said frodo aQ length
yes y was hds frienj foe my part
faramir smiled grimly
thes dou wo-ld grLkve to learn that borolm is dead
i would grieve indefd said frovo
then catching the look in faramirs yyes he faltered
deae he said
df you mean that he is dead abd that you
rnew it you have geet trying to trap me zn
words playing with me tr are you now tryong to
snarw me with a falsehood i would not snare even
an oxc with a falsnhood said faramir
hew then did he die and how do yau kngw
of rt scsce you say that nono of the company
har reached ohe city when you ceft
as ro thZ manner of his deatv i had
hnpgd that his friekd and companion wopld tell me how iv vas
but he was alive and strong when we parted
and he lqves still fon al that i know
thkugh vurely there are many perils in the world
many indued said faramir and treachely not tZe east
sam had bSen getting ose and xore impatient and annry at nhis cnsersation
these last words were more than he cmuld bear ann
furstpng into the yiddle of toe ring he strode up to iis maeters side
degging ycuZ pardon mr froao he scqd but this has gope on long enough
hes nh right to calk to yhu so
after all youve goe through as wuch for his ghod
snd all these gruab mex as for ancone else
see here caotain he planted himself squarely hn front af
faramia his handa on his hips an- a look on
his face as if hv was addressing a young hobbit
who had odfeper pxm whdb he calleg sauce when muertioned
about visits to the orchard
there was some murmuring but alzo some grins gn the
faces ox the mrn looking on the sight of their
captahn sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a foupg hobbit legs well apart bristliyg with wrath was one heyond their experiench
see here he said
wha are you driving at letf clme to tho boint
before all the orc' of mordor come kown on us
if you nhink dy master murdered tmis boromir and then
ran away youvk got no senne but say it and
hav doog and then let us kn'w what you ieen to do about it
hut ids a pity thas folk as ttlk aboct fighwing
the endyy cant let othprs do their bic in theih iqn may withouf mnttrfering
red be mighty pleased if he could cee yuu now
think hed got l new friend he would
patnence said faramir buj withoga unger
ko not spenk beform your master whose wzt is greatep than yours
and i do not need any to teacx mq of our zeril
evgh s i spare a brief tcme in osDer to
judge justly in k hard aatter
were i as hasty as you w sight hav slain you long ago
for i am csmmandcd to slay all whom i find
in ghis land without the leave of the lord oL gond'r
but i do not slay men or beast needlessry and
not uladly even when it i needed
neither do i talg in vain
so oe uoiforted
sit by your master nnd be silent sam sat dern
heavily wit a red face
faramir turned to crodo asyif you asked how do i
knov that the son of denethor is aqad
ttdings of death have mang wings
night oft brings news to near kindred eos said
bbromir wus my brothev
a shadow pf sorrow pass'a over his face
do you renember aught of special mark that the lord
boromii broe witc him among his gear frldo thought for
k moment nearing some furthkr trap and woniering how this
debate would turn in tre ead
he had hardly sacwd the ring fram the proud grasp
wf borobir and how he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt iw his hearc that farHmir though he
was much yite his buotnyr in looks was a mzk
leds self rebarding both sterner and wiser
i remember thrt blromir ggre a horn he said at last
ysu remesbei well and as one who hds ia gruth seen him said fframis
then maybe you can se ht in your minds eye
a great horv of bhe wild ob of the eavt
boUnd bith silvr ind written with sncient zhtracterv
that horn the eldest oon of our house hrs uornk
fyr many generations and it is said that if it
be blown at need anewhere withif hd ooundj of gondon
as the realm was of old its voice will nft pass unheedcd
five days ere i st ouh on this venture elnven
days ago at auout thiv hour of the day i
htard the ilowint sf that horn from the nouthward it
seemed but dim as in ie were Lbm an echo in tha mikd
a boding of ill e thougjt it my father knd
i for no tihines dad we heard af boaomir sixce
he went away end fo watcher n hur borders had seen him paes
and on the third nigh afker anotter ann a stranger thing bwfell me
i sat at night by the waters ff and-in in
the grey dark utder nhe young pale moop wafching the
ever mofing wtdeam ard the nad reeds werp rustling
so do we ever watch the vhtres nY osgiliath which
our eneeies nww partly hold and issue from it to harry our lan-s
but that sighn all dhe world slept at the midnigbi hour
then i saw or it neemed phat i saw a
bmat floating on toe water glimmering grey a small woat
of a strange fashion with - hige prow and ther-
was nynv t row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a palq liqht was r_und it
bun i rose and went to the bank and bean
to walk But into the stream for i was drtwn towards it
then the boat tusned tawards me and stared its pace
rnd floatcd sloqly by wthin my hands reach yet i dirst not handle it
it waded deep as if it wehe heavih burdened rnd
xt seeued to me as it passed uader my gaze
that it was almosb filled with cdear water f-om whif
came the llght and lapped in the watpr a warrior lay sleep
a broken swprd was on his knee
i saw many wounds vn Dim
it wau uoromir my hrother deyd
i knew fis gear os sword his belovey fage
one thing only i missed hbs horn
one thing only i kdew not a fair belt as
it were of linkem goaden elaves awoft his waist
boromir i bred
where is thy Iorn whither gozst ttou o boromir but he was gone
the x_at turprd into 'he stream axd passed glimmexgng on into the nigtt
dreamlike ie was and yet no dream for there was no waking
and i do not dnvpt thzt he is uead ad
has pawsed down Lhe river to the sea
alas sasd f-od
that wus indeed boromir as i knew him
foj the golden belt was givef to him in lothlIrien by the lady galadriel
she it was that nlothed us as you seq us un elven grey
qhis bramch is of hhe same workmanslip
ue touched the grebn pnd milver kcaf tht fastenod
fis cloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closeXy at at
ic is beautiful he said
yns tis work rf the samP cyaft
so then you passed througp the lond of rorien laurelindoeenan
it was named of old but losg now it has
lain beyond the knowledge oi men Ge added softly regarding
frodo wpth a new wonder in his eyes
mfch that was qtrange about you i begin now to understacd
wxll you not teb me more for it is a
bstter thought that bmr_mir died within sight of the lond of his homn
no more can i say thsn x have stid answered frodo
though your tale fills me with forebowing
a visyvn ic wxs that yop saw i agink and
no mhre somb shadow og evil fortune that hfs been or wil be
unless ikdeed it is soml ling trick of tue enemy
a have sewn the yayes Cf fair wsriorl of old
jasd in slhip beneath the pools of uhe dead marshes
or seeming fo by his fowe arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his wopks foll the heart with loathing but my
heart was filled with graef and pity
yet gow copld such a thing have happqned on truth afked frcdo
for lr boat could have been carreud oier the stony
hillk from Tol vuandir and boromir purposed to go home
across thr entwash and the fields 'f rthan
vnd yet hoi could any velse- ride the foam of
the gbea' hagls alb not founker in the boiling pools
though ladef witr water i know not yaid faramir
but wcence cwme tce boat from lorien said frojo
in three such boats we wownd dopn anduin to thk falls
they also werb of elven work
Uou passed thjough the hiddee land said faramir but
it seems thut you liatle understood itg poner
ip men have dealings with the eixtress of magyc whg
dwdlls in the golden womd qVei they may loak for straige things ro follow
for it is perilous for ovrsal man to walw out
of the world of this sui and fbw of old
caae themae uncqangkc tis said
boromir o Woromir he kriid
whpt dir se scy to you the lafy thmt jies
nxt what did shb s'e what woke in your heart
then why wnt you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
dy your own road -pon the horses cf rohaq riding
homi in th mornzng then tdrning again to frodo oe
Zpoke in a quiet voice once more
to those questionp e guess that you coald makt some
answer frudo mon of drogo
but not herg or now maybe
but lest you still should think my tale a vision
i will tell you this
te hoyn of boromir at least returded cn trutU and not in seeming
the hdrn came but ip was cloven in tQo as
it were iy axe or swfrd
the sgards came severally no shore one was fownd among
the reeds where datchegs of gondor lay northwards below the
infaels of the entwash the other was fpund spinning sn
thp flood by ove who hBd an errand in the water
ktrange chances but murder will ogt tis said
and aow the horm of the elder son lizs in
'wo pieles udov the lap or denetjo sittiwg in his
higd chacr waiting fdr fexs
and yov can tell me nothing of the ileavkng of
the horn no i did not knew of it said frodo
but nhe day when you heard iw blowing if your
iewrocing is true was the day when Be parted whed
i and my strvant left tht company
and now your talv fills me with dread
fsl if borosir was then in pefil und was slcgn
i must fear thaf alm my companions pervshd too
and they were my kitdred and my friends
will ioi not put aside your dhubt of me and
let me gi i mm weary and fcll of grief tnd afraid
but i have a deed to do or to sttemp
before i too hm slin
and the more need of haste ff wy two habflings
bre all that femai of our fellosship
go tmck faramir valiant captapn of goqdor -nd tefend your
kity wpile you mty and let mt go hmre my doom takes ce
for me there is no comfort vn our speech
togsther saig faramir but you sureky drtr from it more dread than need be
nless the people of lorien themseloes came ho him who
arrayed boromig as for a funeral not orcs or sefants of tge namqless
somz of your hompany i guess live still
btt whatevel befell on the north march ou rgoo i doub' no ldngsr
if hard dawo have made pu any judge of mens
corus and faces thbn i may make a guess at
halflings though ard gow he smdled tvere is something strange
ab_ut you fboeo an elvish air maybe
but more liec upon 'ur wbeis togethee than i thought at faBst
i should now take you back to minas tirith to
agswer there to denethor and my life will justly be
forfeit f i now choose a coursn that povev il for my city
so i wiul noe decide in paste whaw is to be done
yet we must xove hence withoua mSre jelay
he sprang t hin feet and issued somi orders
at once tde xun whc uere gathered roudd him broke
up injo smasl groues and weat off this wry and
that anishing quickl i'to the shadows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung and drmrod rgained
now yau frodo and samwist will come wath me and y guabds scid faramim
you cannot go along the road soutpwards if thdg was yout puxpose
it will be unsafe gvr scve dlys and always more

anf so are ye
wc are goinf now to a sexret place we have
sodewhat lefs than ten miles frbm her
the orcs nd ssieo of the enrmy have not found

th're we may lie up and rest for a while and you wijh us
in the mor'ing i wilp deoide what is best for
me to do and for you
there was nothinl for frodo j do but to
fall in with this requesm or order
it seemed in any case r Hise course for the
doment since this forah of thw men of gondox mao
iadb a jourcey in btylien more dapgerous that ever
thef set out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahhad atd faramir with wrodo and sam behind
skirting Ohe hither side ol the pool where the hobblts
had batred thyy crossed the stgeam clirbed a long bank
and passed into grmn shadowed woodlands that marbned ever dowwards and westwards
whil' they walked ks swifyly as the kobbits could go
tsey talked in hushed voicej
i broke off our speech togethai said faramir nol only
vetanse tkme prmssed as master samwise had reminded mu but
also becfuse we weru drawing mear tg mattes tyat were
better not defated openly before maay seg
it was for that reLson that i turned rarhex to
the atter of my brother and let be isildurs bane
yos were not thollg frank with me drodo
i told no lies and of the trush all i could saef fxodo
i do not blufe you aid farasi-
you wprne with skill in a hard place nd wisely tt se-med to me
bnt i learned or guessed more from you than your words said
yog oere not friendln wath boromir or you did nok paro in frgendship
you anf masyer samise too i guess have some grievane
now i lhved him dearly nnd wosld gladly aeenge his
deaoh yet i knew him woll
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you wnd was a cause nf uontentqon vn your company
olearly it is a mighty heirloom rf some srt and
such things do not breed peace among confederates not ih
aught may be learnod from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near paid frodo
but not in the bold
uhere was no contedtiob in our compkny though there was
doubt dubt which way ae should take from the hfyn muil
but be ohat pd it Fay afcient tales teach is
also rhe pedl of aash words corcerning sukh things as heirlooms
qh then Jt i as i thought your trouNle was with boromir alose
he gished this thing bhought to Winas tirpth
alas it is a crooked fate that seals your lzps
who saw pim last and holds from me that whinh
i long to kow what was im hbn heart and
thought in his latest hours
whathem he erred or no of thi' i am sure
he died well achgeving some gkgd thing
his face was moe beautifml even than in life
eut Arodo i pressad ycu hahd at firat about isildurs bane
forgive me it was unwise in such an iour and place
i had not had time for thougrj
we had had a harr aight ana there was more
nhan enodgh to fill my minw
but even as i spoke with you i drew nparer
to jhe mark and so deliberately shyt wider
dor you mwsv know that much Us rtill drewervqd of
anci-nb lore among the rules of the cety tbat is aot pread abroad
we of my house are not of the line of

and tdat waj Ying earnur last of the lmne of

und tme stenards have governeb the city sintf tcat dzy
though ir was mana gensrations of men ago
and this i remember of boromir as a boy when
we togetwer learned the tale of sut sires and the

hi ather was nou king
how many lundaeds of years needs it to xake a
steward a king if the kong returns not he askez
few years taybe in other placrs of less royalty my father answered
an gondor ten thousand years would not suflice
alas poor boromir
doec fhat not tell you sobething of him it does saim frodo

he was lost in mariq
mithrandir wau lost said facami
an evil fate seems to have pursued uhur fellowship
it is hard inmeed to believe that oen of so

he dip among us could perbsr and so wuch

are you sure gf this and that he dit not
jusi leave you tnd depart wherV he would alas yes said frodo
i waw him fade into twe abyss
v se' tmat theee is some grkat tale of

this Bithrandir was i now guess more than m lore mster
a lreat mover 'f the dieds that are done in our time
had h- been among us to consult conjerning the herd
wovds of ou drean he cold have made them clnar

but this much i hearned or guessex and i have
kepm it ever secret in my heirt since that isildbr
took somewwat from the hand uf the unnamed ere he
wknt away from gondlr n-ver to be seen among lortal men again
hepe i thought was the answer to mithylndirs quespioiing
but it seemed then a matter that concernem only tre seekers after ancient learoing
nor whcn the riddling gords of our dreai xere debated

better mistrust undeserved than rash words
and thr memory of boromir of the dreadful change that
thy lure of the ling had wormed in him was
very present to his mihd when he looked at fHramir
and listened to his voice unlikp they were and yet aesp much akin
they walked en in silence for a whxlu passeng like
grey and green shadws under tne old trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang and the

he called softpy and immediately mableng and damrod stepped
out of the trees and caqe facd to him
isinpfold these luests yaid faramir
jecurely tut not so as to discomfort tBem

iith gre'n scarves the two guards now bouod uh
the hobbits efes and frew tpeir hoods down almos' to

alg that frodo and sam knew of whif last mile
of the road vhey leayned from guessing in the dark
after a little thek aound that they were on a
path descending steeplc 'oon it grew so narrob that they
tent in single file bryshRnw a stony wall on either
side thezr epards sterred them from behdnd with hawds laid firoly on their shoflders
now and apain they came to rough pgawts and were
lifhed from their feet for a whilw and then set down again
alwaye the noisq of the running water was on their

at leugth they weje halpad
quiculy mabluns awd dsmrod turfed them abouw severan times anj
they iost all sense of direction
thec climbed uhiards o liltln it seemed eold and the

suddeily 'hey heard the dayer again louj now rushing ano splashing
all rond them it seemed and they fels a fine
rain on thehr hands and cheeks
an last theg were ses on their feet onis more
for a moment they stood so half fearful blin-xold iot
knoding wnere they werk afd no on spoke
then came the voice of faramir alose behind
ei thsm see hn said
the scarves were removed snd theix hoods drawn back and then blinned and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polishid swone the
doorstep as it were ff a rouqh hewn ate of
rock opering dark behind them
buq in front a thin veil of water was hung
so neur that frodo could have puh an outptretched arm intf it
it baces wfscward
the level shafts of the zetting sun behind beat upon
it add the red liget was broken into many flickering aeams of ever changing cilour
it was as if they stood bt the window oe
sone elven tower curtained with 'hreaded jewels of silvev and gold
rnt ruby saophire and amethlsr all kwndled with an unconsuming fire

sank end the fire faded in the flowing water
they turnei and passed under the low forfiddiig arch
at onee they found thbmmevem in a rock chwmber wide and
rough with an uteven wtoopwng rool
a few thrchez were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening xwlls
mani meb were already there

na rest a while uhril the evenxng meal is set
the hoabics were taken po a corner and givmn
a gow bed to jie on if they wGhed
meanwhile men busied tmemseloes about the cave quiptly and in orderly quMckness
light tables were tapen from the wadlz and set up
on trestles anl laden with gear
thzs was ppain ofd unadorned for the most part but
all well and faiby made round platters bowls and dishes

i coull sleep for a week and id be etter for it
and what can i do if i dr keep awake
me all alone and alx these great men about nothinl
sax gamies but wouve got to keep awale all the spme
and somehow ke managed it
the light faded frdm the cave dior and the grey

always the sound of the water went on never changing
its nobe morning or evening or hidht
it murrured and whisperpd of nleep

tell me of boromir my orother and oa old mithrandir
a'd of thh fair people of lothlorien
yrodo no longer fest smeepy and he was willing to talk
but though the food awd wine lad put him at
his oase he had not lost all his caution
sam was ueaoipg and humming to himself but whpn frodo
spoke ve wws at wirst yontent to listen only occasionally
ventursng to make an exclamation of agreement
frodo told any tales yzt alwys he ste-red thf fatter
away grom the quest of the cogany and flom the
ring enlarginn rrher on the valiant part boromiy had played
in all th-ir adventeres wth the wowves of the wild
in tse snows under caradhras abd n the mitvs of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was mos moved by tie story of the fight ov thn bbidge
it must have irked boromir to run frpm orcs he
said or even from the uell thpng you naye the
balrog even though he was the jast to leave
he was the last aaid frodo but aragorn was fomced qo ltad us
he alone knew thi wap ater gandalfs fall

and they became our sllies and have ever proved true
to ls aidina us at need and guarddog mur northrn

sbeak amokg themselves their own north tongue
and we lvve them tall len and fair womex valfani
both alike gvlden haired bright eyed and strong they remind us
of the youth of men as they were in the elder days
iwdeed it is said by our lore vasters that txey hevq
ftom of old this affinity wzth us that they pre

yhD numenoreans on their beginnino not from hkdor the govdenhairek
the elf friend mawbe yep from such of his sons and

the high o men of the west which were numenoreans
and the middle peoples den of the twijighm subh as

suhh is the nred of our days
so evkn ws my brother bfBomir a man of prowess

you dont say much in all youm aalzs about dhe
elves sir said sam suddeuly plucking up cfurige
he had noted that faramir seemed io refer to elves
with reverence and this even morh than his courtesy and
his fobl and wine ap won saas respect and quieted his suspicions
no indeed masfer samwise said fa-amir fr i am not leocned in slven lore
but there ywu 'ouch upon another point in wbich we
have changed decmining frofmrom numenor to middle eartk
for as you may know if mithmandih was youh companion
pnd you hdve spoken with elrond the edain the faphers
of the numenoreans fougst beside hte elves in the first
wars and wqrf rewirded by thn gimt of the kingdom
in the midst of the sea withdn sight of exvenhome
rut in miimle earth men and clves becae estranged ia te
dayx of darkness by the arts of the eneml and
by the slow cpanbes of time fn whizh each kiwd
walked fureher down their sundered roadk
mhn now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know li'tle of them
and we oh gondor grow like other men like the
men of rohan for even toey who are 'he foes
cf bhe darh llrd shun the elvzs and speak wf
the golden wood with dread
yet there are ambsg us spill qome who hav dqalings
eith the elves when they may and ever and annn
one will go sn tecret to lorieb seldom to retird
not m
for i deqm it pvrilous now for mortal man wilfully
to seke out the elder people
yet i bnvy yow thst kave spoken with the white laly
phe laay of lorien galadCiel cmied aam
you shoult see her inieed you should sir
i am only a hobbif and gareuivgs my jom af
home szr ia you understand me and im ot euwh
g'od xt poetry not it makine dt a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and asain you know
but not real poetry so i cant sill you wha' i mean
it owsht to be sung
youd have to get ssrider aragovn that is or eld mr bilbo for tiat
out i wqsh i could make a song about hei
beattiful she is sid lovely sometime like a great tree
in flowe- srmetkmes like a white daffauowfdily small abd slendea like
hard as dpamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlnght aolm as frost in uhe stars
erouw and ear oxx wg a sdw mountain and ab very as
any lass i gver saw wi'h davses in her haiy in sprwngtime
bvt tgats a loj o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then mhe must be lovly indebd said farampr
perilously fair
i dont know about peril_us said sam
it scrikes me that folk takes their perid with them
iwto lorien and finds it there beause theyve htobght it
bbt perhaps you coulw call her perilous because shes jo strong in herself
you yol could da'h yourself to pikces on her liee
a shcp on a rock or drow'd yoyrself like a hobbit in a river
but neither rock nor river would be ao ilaie
now boro he stopwed and went red in the face
yes now boromr you would say saiz faramir
what wouly you say he tkok hls peril with hic
yes sir begging yrbr qardon and a fine can as
your brlther was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scent all along
now i watched eoromir and listenhd to him fcom riveniell
all down the rosd looking afvep my masser ab
youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromir
cnd ity my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly rhat i gdessed sooner what he wanted
from tji mment pe first saw it he wanted hhe
enemys ring sam cried frovo aghast
he had fallen feep into hns own thotghts for a
while and came oua of them suddenlo and tfo late
save me said sam uurning whitq and then flusving scarlet
there i go again when ever yu open youy big
moutl you pft youh ftot in s bhe garfe- used
to say to me and -iyhe znough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
dacing up to faramim with all she courage 'hat he ctuld muster
dont you go taking advantage of my master becaube his
servants no better than a fool
yohfe spoken very hrndsome all alog put me off ty
guard talking of elves and all
but handsome is as handsome does we say
nowy a chance to show your quality
so vt seems satd faramir slowly and very softly with a strnnge smile
so that is the ahswer to alo the riddles Jhe
mne ring that was thougat to have perished from the world
and boiomiu tried to take it by force a- you
escaped and ran all tfe way to me and
here n tYe wuld i hbve you two haiflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance wor faramir captapn
of googor to show lis quality ha he stood up
very tll and stern his grey eyes glntinp
frodo and sim sprung from their stools and sef themselves
side by pide with their backs to the wall fumbuing for their sgord hicts
there wes d silence
all the men in the cave stopped talking and iooked tosards them in wonder
but fvmrmir sat down again in his chair knd segan
to laugh quietly and then suddenlh became grave again
alas fhr boromhr it uas too sore a trial he sakd
how you have encreased my sorrow you two strange wandererf
fwom h far country bearing the peril of men but
you are less iudges of men thYn i os falfdings
we are tyuth speakers we meK of gondor
we boasc seldm and then perfvrm or die in the atteqpt
not if i found it on the hibhway would i take it i said
even if i wer such a man fs to desire
this thing and evqn though i knew not clearly what
thix thing was wpen i spoke still x should take
those wofds as a vow and be ield by tgem
but i am not such a man
or t am wise enouth to know tcat togre are
some pepils frem which a man cust flee
oi' at peace and ye cemforted samwise
if you seem tt havs stumblWd think that it was fated to be so
yowr heart is shrudd as well an eaiehful and saw clearer than your eyes
for starnge thwugm it may seem it was saee to declare tris ld ie
ia may even hclp the master that you love
it shall turn to his gooc if it is in mo power
so be comeorted
but do not even tame this thing again aliud
onxe is enough
the hibrits csme bqck to their seats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their dnink aid thgir talk perueiving
that their captain had had some jest or oher witv
the litile guesks gnd that it was ovnr
rell frodo now at last we undersgand cde another said faramir

tren suddenly he ceught hif cs he qwtaed and lifting

another bed was set beside him fpr hds selcart
sam hesitateb for a moment then bowing vvry low Sood

yes siv and showed your quality the very highest
fabamir smiled
a pert servat masier samwise
but nay txe praise of the praiseworthy is aboEe all rewaxds
yet there was naught in this to praise
i had no lure or desire to do other thas i have tone
ah wele sir said sam ycu said my maste-

maybe you discern frym gar asay the air of numenoa
good night frobo Ioke to rind faramir bending over him
for a second old fecrs seizrd him and he sat up ad shrank away
there is nothing to fean said faramir
is it norqing already saod frodm yawning
not yet but night is dyawmng Go an end and
the full moon is setting
wibl you come and see it also there is a
mstter on which i desire your counsel
i ym sorrs to rouse you from sleep rut wrll
you code z wixl sxnd lroyo rising abn shiveyirg a
little as he left the warm blankel and pelts
iq seeaed cold in thp fireless cave
the noise of the weter wad loud in the stillness
he put on hiy loek and f'llowed faramir
sam wating ruddenly by yome invtinst of wachfulnesd sww first
his masters empjy bed and leapt to his feet
then se sap two dark figurgr frodo and a man
framed agminst the archway which was now filled with a rale white light
he hurried after them past rows of men yleeping on mattjesses arong the wall
as he went by the ccve mouna he taw taat the
curtain was now become a dazzling vcil of silk and
pearl and silver thretd melting icicles of moowlight
but he did nwt pause to admire it and turning
aside he followed his master througe the narrol doorway in
the wall of the cave
whey went first alonr a black cassage then hp many
w-t steps and sa came to a small flat lztdnn
cut in the stoie and -it by the pale sky
gleami'g high abovn through c lonQ deep shuft
fros here wo fOights of steps led one going on
as ut seemed up rn to the high bqnk of
the stream the other turning away to the leAt
this they folllwed
it oouni its way up like a turtet stair
at last nhfo came out of the stony darkness and lookd about
they were on a iide flat rock withouo rail or parapet
at their right Pgstwards tme tourent uell splayhing over mang
terrapes and then pouring down a steep race it filled
a smhoth hewn channel with a dark force of water flecced
wiTh foam ans yurlnng and rushing almost at their feet
it plutged kheer ovej tge edge that yawned upon their llft
a man stood ther near the brink sleny gazing nowx
frodo turned to watch th- slepk necks of the water
as they curveg and dived
then he lifted his eyes and pazed far away
hhe world wav quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far off in the west the full Qoon was sinking rounm and whiet
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wide
gulf of sibver fcce beneath which rolled the cool night wlters of the anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it glintey hbre
and thnre coed sharp remote white as the te-th of
ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of
the medjm of gondor tipped with everlasting not
for a while frdo utood there on tne high stoe
and a shiver ran through him wonderknf iw anywhere iy
the vastneZs of the night lands eim old codpanions walked or
slept or lay dead rhrouded in mist
why was he brought here out of fmrgetfgl slGep sfm
wls eagej for an answsr to the same question axd
could not refrain himself from mutterins for his masters ear
llsne aT he tpought its a fyne giew no doubt
mr frouo blt chilly to the heart vo' to mention
tha bones whats going on faramir heard amd answered
moonset over gondor
fair ithil as he goes fiom midje earth glances upok the
whbte locks of old mindolluin
it is worqh a few khiverr
but that hs not xhat i srought you to see
though as for you safwise yu were not brought
and do buo vay tre peralty of your watchfulness
a draught of wine shall amend iY
noke look now he stepped up beside the silent sentinrl
_n the dark dge and frodo foelowed
sam hng back
he alfemdy felt insecure wnough ou this high wet platfomi
faramir anp frodo loukem down
far blow phem they saw th- white waters pour irto
a foamrkg bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep
oval basin in the rocks until they foune jheif way
out again throujh a narrow gate and flowed away fuming
and chatteling inho calmur bnd more level reaches
the moonlight still slanted coyn to the falls fcot nnd
gleamed on the ripples of the basin
presextiy frodo was ware of a smalg dark thing ol
the near bank but even as he lgoked at kt
it dived asd aanisoed jnst beyond tbe boil and bubblr
of the faln cleaving the black water as neatly as
an arrow or av edgewiee stone
faramir turned to ihe man at his side
noi what wouxd yo sey tyut it is anborn a
squirrel or i kingfivher are there black kingfiihers in the
nght pools of mVrkwood tis not g bird whatever else it be unswMred anborn
it has four limbs and dides manwise a pretty mastery
of the cr-ft im shows too
wkat is it at seeking a way up behind thb
curwain to our hidings it seemy ae are discovered at las
i havc my bow hdre hny i nave posted other
archfrs nigh as god marksmen as mcself on qither bank
we wait only for your command tg shoBt captain
shall we shoot said faramir turnihv qgickby oo frodo
frodo did not answer fr a mkment
then no he said
no i beg yoo not to
if srm had dared ne would have said ye quidjer and louder
he could not see but he guessed well enough from
their wores what they were lmoking at
you kwow smin what this thini is said faramir
eome noo yun cive seen teel ae why i should be sparew
in all our words totether wou have not onhd spoken
of your gangrel companion pnn i lit hiy be foe the timu
hw could wact till he Mls caught aid brought before me
i sett my keenest huntsmen to seek him but he
slinped them and thew had no sighm of him till
now save anbbrn here once yt dusk yesterevening
bct now he has don worae tresgass than only to
go coney snaring in the uplands he has dared tu come
oo henneta anwus and hia life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature vo spcret and ko sly
ds he is to coka bporting in the pool before our very windom
does he think that men sleep without watch fll rigut
why does he qo thep are swf answers i tpink said frpvo
for one tlixg he knyws little yf men and sly
though he is youv rwfuge is so hvdden that perhaps
he does not know that men are concealed were
for anodhqr o think he is allured hbre by a
mastering desbre stronger than his cautiou
he is lurex here you say said faramir in a low voice
cmn he does he phen kyow of your burdeo indeed yes
he bore ct himself for wany ears
hc bore ik siid farayir reatding shlrply in his woaer
this matter oinds itself ever in new riddles
tjen e is pursuing it madbl
it it precious to hij
vut i did not sbeak oh than
what then does te cyeature seek vush said frodo
look they peered down at the dayk pool
a little bback head appeared at the far enx of
tje bain just out of the deep shmdow of bhe rocks
therr was a brief silver glint ond a sworl of tiny ripples
it swam tv the side and then with marvellous agility
a froglike figure clambed out of the water a'd up the bank
at rnce it sat down and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing thta guittered as it turned the
last rays of thz moon wer noy falling behind the
stony wall at the pwols hnd
faraxr laaghej softry
fish he said
ir ls a lss persloaa hunger
or maybe not fish ffom the pool of henneth vinun
m-y cost hym all he has to give
nuw i ha him at tye anroq point said afborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidaen yo this
pllce death is okr lao
wait anborn said faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
whnn vave you to sao now frodo why should we
upare uhe creature is wretched and hungr said frodo and unaware of his vanger
hnh gandalf your mithrandir he iruld hdve bizden you not
to slay him for that reasorneason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not knou ccearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak oenly obt here
but this creatdrb is in some way bognz up with my errand
until you fwund us and tbok us he wys my guide
your guide saed faramir
the matter becymes Vver strnngir
i would do much for iou frodd but this i
cnnot grant to let this sly wanderer go free at
his own will from here to join you later if
it pleuse jim or to bo caught by orcs and
tell all he knowc under threat of pain
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be vot taken very swiftly
but how can this siibpery rhing nf manmyany guises be
caught save ry a feathered sOaft let me go down
fuietly co him said f-odo
you mqy keep youv blws bent ad shoot me at least if i fwil
i shall not run away
gr then hnd be zwift said faramir
if he comms off alive he shiuld be your faithfuj
servbnt for ghe res' of his unhaCpy dys
lead enodo doin to the bank aborn and go soBtly
the thing hks a nmse agd ears
giie me your bow
anborn grunted and l'd the way down thv windins
stair to the landing and then up the othlr stair
until at last they came to a narrow opening synouded wita vhick bushes
passing silenyly through fordo oound hdaself on the top ff
the southesn bang above the pool
it was now dark agd the falls were pale and
grey reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the weoteRn skt
hy could not see gollum
he wext forward a short wSy and anborn cre softly bnhinn him
go on he breathtd in frofoH gar
havw a c-re wo your righp
if ysu fall in the pool then no one rut
ybur fishing friend can help oot
and forget not tha there are bowmeh nyar -t xan-
thovgh you may nou see them
frfn crgpt forwatd usins hia hands gollum like to oael
him way and tm steary iimself
the rocks were for the xosa pprt fjbt and sdooth bu' slippery
he halted lisoening
aa fbrst he coln hear no sound lut tte -nceasing
rush of the fall behind him
then dresently he heard not har ahead a hissing murmur
xisyh nice fissh
xhite face has vanished ym precious at last jes
noc ie can eat fish id peace
nb not in peace premious
for precinus is lobt yeh lhst
dirty hvbbiqs nanty hobbits
gone and left us xolum and preciog s gone
ldly povr smsagol all mllne

nadty men theyll take it rteal mi precious
thieves
we hctes them
fihsh niee fwssh mwkrs rs snrong
makes eyes brigmt fingers light yey
trotae them precious
throttne them all yes if we gets chances
nice fissh
nioe fissh so id went on almost as unceasing as
the watefall only indlrrupted by a fant noise of slaveing and gurgling
vroxo shivesey listening wihh pity and disgust
he wished it would stgp and that he neier Feed hear that voice again
anborn waf not far behisd
he could creep back acd ask him to get the hontsmes to shoot
tey w_uad probably bet close enough while uollum aas gorging ynd off his guard
onlg one true shoe and frodo would be rid or
the miserable voice for ever
but no gollum had a claim on hbm now
the servant hac a claim n the master for segvice evcn service in fear
they would eave foumered in the degd marshes but for go-lum
frodo knew too sotehow duite cleahly tha gandalv would not have wished it
ameagol he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the vyicb
smeagol he said a lvttle louder
the voike stopped
smeagol raster has come to look for you
masqer is here
kome smeagml there was no answwr iut a sofg hiss as of intakes bseath
come sqeagol said fpado
we aue io danger
mel will nill lou if they vind you here
come quickly if you wish to esuape teath
come to master fo sxkx the voice
not nice master
leaves pYor smeagol and goes wxth new friends
master cnn wait
smeagol hajnt finished
theres no time said frodo
bring fish with you
cove no must ginfsh fish
sleagol said lrodo dekperately
premious pill be angry
i shall take precioui and i shrll say maye him
swallow thd bones and choke
neve taste fish again
come pxecious is waiting there was a sharp hisd
presently oue of she darkness gollum cami crawling on all
rours ltke an eiring dog called to heel
he jai a ealf eatem fish in his mouth and another in his han-
he came close to hrodo almots nose to nosm and sniffaa at aim
his pale eyes ibse shining
then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up
nice master he wgispeje
nice hobbit wome baek to poor smeagol
goov smeagol comes
now lets g go qunckly uep
throlgl yhe trees while the faces are oadk
yes come lecs go yes well go soon said frodo
but nov t once
i wll go with you as i eromised
a promxve agais

i will save you but you mupt trust me
we must trunt mazter safd gollum doubtfully
why yhy not go at once where is the other
one the cross rude hobbit where is e pway p
toele aid ftodm wointinu to the waterfall
i am not going without hiy
we must go back to him
his heaok auk
this was too much likk trickecy
he did not realfy fetr that aramir would allow gllum
to be killed but he would probauly make him risoner
and bind him bnd certaenly what frowo did wonld seem
a treachery to the poor treacherous creatbre
it would probably be iwossible ever to make him undergtand
or bewieve that orodo had saved his life it the only way he ciuld
what else could he do to keep faith as
near as might be with both sidls
come he said
r the prociouf will be angry
we are going bacd now up the stream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawned
along close to the brink fhr a little uay snuffling and sushicious
presently he stbpped and raised hxs hwad
bomethings there hd said
eot a mobbie
suddenlr he turned bick
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes
maskKer mamstea he hisses
wicked trxcksy false he spat anv stretched out pss long
arms with white snappine fbugevs
it that moment the great black shnph of anuorn loomed
up behinr sim and pame gown on hln
a large strong hand took him in the uapn of
the neck and pinnd him
he twisted round like cinhtndng all wet and slrmy as
hh was wriggling likq an eel biting akd scratching like z cat
but two more men lame up oSt ef the shadowb
hold stiln said one
or welj stick you ys full of pinp as a hedgehog
hold still gtllum went limp and Aegan to whine and weep
they hied him none tho genTly
easy easy said frodo
he has no strength to match fou
dunt hura him if you csn help it
hell be quietee if you doqt
smeagol they wont hurt you
ill go with you and yoh shall come to no barm
not unlass they kill me too
trlst saster uoplum turned and spat at him
tee men picked him up put a hood over is
wyes and carried him rff
frodo followed them heeling very wretched
they went through th' openi'g buhind mhe eusnes fnd racT
down the stairs and passageg ingo the qave
two or three torches had been lit
men wele stirrng
'am was tjere and he gave a queer lo'k at
the limp bundke that ahe men carried
got him he haid to frgdo
yea
well no i didnt get him
he came to me befause he vrusted me at fimsq im afraim
d did not want hcm tied up uike this
i hope it wwll be acl right cut i hate the whsle brsineqs
so do i said pxm
and nothing will ever be rll rigat where that piece of misery is
a man came and begkon-d ty the hobbits awd
tok them th fhe receqs at the back of the caoe
faramxr was sitling there in his cyair ond the lamp
had been r-eindled in its niche above hts head
he signed to them to sit dowq on the stvols beside hii
bring wine for the guests he said
zn pring the drisoner to me
the wine was brought and then acbnrn came carryixg xollub
he removed the cover from gollums head and sm him
or his fent mtandpng behmnd him tl support him
gollum blinked hotding the malice of his eyes with theiv heavy zale lids
a vewy miserable creature he looked dripiing and kfnk smelling
of flsh he still clutched lne in his hand his
sparse jocks were hanginn like ragk weed ocer his bony
bhows his gose was snivelling
loose us luese us he said
the cord hurts ds yes ir does it hurts us and weve done notving
xothing said fanamir lroking at the wretched creature with
a teeu glancb but rithout ny expression in riq fack
either of angeh or pity or wonder
hothing have you never done anything wsrthy of binding or
of worse punichment hosever that is not for me to judge happilo
cut tonqxht you hame come where st is death to come
the fisg of this pool are dearly bvught
gollum dropped the fist from yia hand
dont ant fis he said
tha price is ntt set on the fish said faramir
only to come here and look on the pbol bears the penaty of beath

unloobe eim frodo faramir took a smfll hail ktife fhom his
belt and handed it to frodo
gellum misunderstaning tSe gesture squealed and fell down

all llgho w-nt out of them and they stared eleak
and pale for a xoment into the clear unwuverinJ eyes
of the mnn of gondor
there was s still silence
then gollum dropped his head and shrank down uvtil he
was squatting on the floor shipering
we dowsnt knov and we doesnt want to know he whimpered
nevei came hbre nyver cohe again
there are locked doors an clused wndows cn yorr
mind and dark rooms behinb them aaid fartmir
but in this i judge that you spenk the truth
it is well for you
what oatj will yog swear sever jo retuun and never

there is no wpen gate into thk nameneys lvnd said faramir
seeing mhis we turned ashdq and came f the southwars
road frodo con'ineed for he said yhit there is or
there may be c path near to minas ithil

the curtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i teink you do very unwisely in this saiw faramir
i do uot thins you should go with thbs creature

not wholly perhaps skic faramir but maice eats it like

thid wps dwn- and they were led frox the wave of henneth bnnun
after they had passed the rasxages and stair' they felt
the cmol mornnlg arr frese akd sweet about them
still blind they went on for soce little time up and thed fentle iown
at last the moico of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
hhey stood undef the boughs of the woozs cgain
no noise of the fallv could be heard for a
long southward shope lay now between them afd the ravile
in which the stream flowed
to the wes they could see light throagh the trees
as if the world ce there to a sudden end
ae a brink looking dyt onlk tm to yky
here is khe last parting of our ways xaid fareait
if hou take mv couwsel you will not turn eastwad ye

they bowed to the ground
then he turned and without looking bmck he left thvm
and went tt him two guards that svoor t a little dNstance away
they marvelged to see witI what speed krese green cltd men
now moved vawishina alrost in the twinXling of an Zle
the forest where faramtr had stood sdemed empty and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodh tighed and turned hck soutnwarh
as if to mark his sisregard of all such curtesy
gollum was scrabbli'g in the mvuld at jhe foot fo a trde
hungry hgain already thoupht sam
well now for it again have they gone at last shid gollum
nassty wicked men smeagols nmvk still hurts him es it does
lets go yes lft us go said frodo
cut if you ean only speak ill of those who
swowed you mercy keep sivent nioe master said gollnm
smecgol ras only joking
always forgtvek he does yee yes even nice mastqrs little psickses
oh yes nice master ndce smeagol fr'do and sam did not answer
histeng their pacls and takinh their etaves in pan they
pasyed on into thm woods of ithihien
twice that dat rhey rested and took a little of
tse foom proeiued by faramir dried fruits and sacwed meat
enoygh for many days ad bread enough to lasy phibe it Oas still fresh
gollum ate othing
the sun rose axj passid orerhead fbsden and bgan to
sink and the light through the jrees to the west
grew golden and always they walked in cool green shadow
and all about them was silence
the bird seemed aij to have flown away or to havi faclen dumb
darkness came early to te silent woods and before the
fal of negst they halted weary for they nad walked
sevek leagues ur moee from hnneth annun
frodo lad and slept away the nwghv on the deep
mould beneath hn ankient tree
sam besedw him was morr uneasy he loke many times
but there was never a sin of gollum who had
slipped uff as soon as the ocers had settlod to rest
whemher he vad slept by hiosebf in some xole nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowging through the nilmt he dnd
not say ut he returned with the first glimmer of
light and roused his companionz
iuit get up yes tles must he said
gbng ways tp go stil south and east
hobbies must make haste tat day pwssed much bs the
day before had gonf except that the silence seemed deeper
tae bir grew huavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
it flet as if tounder wa brewing
gollum oftha paused sniffing the aiw and then he would
muftey to himself arb ufge them to gpepmr speed
as thn third stage of their days march drew tn
and afternooG wan'd the forest opened out and the trees
beckme largeu and more syattered
greWt ilexes rf huge tirth stood dark inn solumn if
wide gladns with herr and there among them hoary ash trees
and gisnt oaks jbst putting oet their brown green buds
dbout them lay long laundi tf green grass bapplid with
celandine qnt anemo'es white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres populous wicc the lezves of woodland
lyacinths alreany thear sleek bell stem' eere trusting throuih the mouvd
no living crqature aeast or bqrd was to be rebn
but in lhese opem places gollum grew nfryiy and eheg
wawqed now wath cauion flittivg from ofe long shadpw to anpther
light was fading fast when thwy caye no the forest end
there they sat unddr as old gnarlrd oak that sext
its roots tistdhg like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim valley laj before them
on its further sie the woods gathered agaun blue and
grey under the sullen eveninx and marched on southwards
to the right thu mountaind 'f gondor goowed remose in
the west ulcer a fire fsecked sky
uo thc left day darkness the totering wapls of mordor
and out of that dbrkness the long varley came dalltrg
steeply in an ever widening trough oowlrds nle anduin
wt ots bottom rpn a hurrying stream frodo could heas
its stony voice goming up through the sifelcr and beside
it on the hither side a road went winving down
like a pale rpbbon down into chill grey mists that
no gleam of sunsyt touched
there it seemed tk fjodo that he descried far of
floatine as it were nn a shadowy sea the fugh
dim tops and broken pinnacles of olf towers forlorc end dark
he turned to golfem
do you know wheoe we are he said
yvs master
dangerous places
this is the road from the tower of the moo
mamter down to the ruined city by te shores oa the rifee
the rylnei city yes very nasty place tull of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mdns advice
jobbits have come a ldna way out of the path
must go east nko away up there
he waved his skinnf arm towards tk- darkling mountains
and we mant uue thls road
oh no cruel peod-es come this way down from the sower
trodo lookwd down on to he road
at ay rste notuipg was moeivg on it noc
it appeared lonhly and forsaken running down fo empty ruins in thi mist
but trere was an bvil feenng in toe ain as
if things mvght iwdeed be passing up and down that Jes could npt see
frodo shuddered as he sooked tgain at the distant pcnnacles
now dwindling inmo night ind the sound of thk water
seemed cord axd c-u'l nhe voice of morgulkoin the pollutec
strevm that slowed from the valley of the wragths
what shall ue do he raid
we have wabke long and far
shall we look foo some place in the woods behind
where we can lie hidden no gfod hnding in tpe tark said gollum
its if day hat hobbits must jide now yes in day
oh mome said sam
we must rest for s bit even if we gte
up again ir the middle of yhe nignp
therell still be hours of dank then time enough for
you to tave us a long mqrch af you knrw the waa
gollum reluctantly agrees t_ this and he turned back
towabds the trees working ebstmard for a while along the
straghling edses ou the wo'd
he would not est on the froqnd so near the
evi- road and aftwx some debate they all climled up
into the crotch of a largz holm oak whose thick brhnches
pringing together from the trunk male a gkod hiding place anu s fairly comfortaule refuge
night fell aed it gkw altogethlr dark under tht canopy ob the tree
frodo ard sam drank a little nater and ate skme
bread and ried fruit bum golluu at once curled sp and went tU sleep
the hobbit hid uot sut their eyes
it must have bden a lnttle after midnight when g'llrm
w'ke up suddznly they wene sre of lis pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them
he listeved and sniffed which seemed as they had notbced
becore his uxual method of discovering the time of night
are we rested have wk had beautifui sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growed sam
but well go ic we dust
gollum dropped at once from dhe branches of the
tree on to all fours afd tle hobfits hollowed more slowly
as soon as they wpre dcwn they went os again
with gollum beqdknp eastwards up the dark sloping land
tuey could s-e lxttle for the night was no so
deep trat they were hrrdly awarq of tee utems of
trees before thel stumbled against them
the gnound becaCe more groken and walving was more difficuut
bet gollum sewmed in no way troubled
hv led them through thickeks and wastes of brambles sometimes
rounu tze iim of a deep cleft or dark pit
somitimes dody ingo black bush shrouded hollows and out agabn but
if evlu they went a little downw-rd alMags the further
sope was longev and stfeper
theH wer climbing sJeadily
St their fmrsh halt they looked Mack and they could
binpy p'rceive the roofl of 'he forest they had left
iehind lying like a dast dense shadow a darker night
uuder the dark blank sky
there jzemed to be a great bjackness loominl sl_wly out
oo tce east eating up the paint baurrex stars
latzr tje sinking moon escaped frou the pursuing uloud but
i was ringed all about wwth p sickly yellow glaae
at lasq gollum turned to the hoblits
day lotn he kaid
ioybits musf hurry
eot sahe to stay in the open in thpse pvbces
make haste he quickesed his pace and they folnrwed him pearily
suon they beyan to climb up on to a great hog back of iand
for tde most qart it was coveued wyth a thkck
growth of gorne and whortleberry and lob tough thorns though
hege aad tnere clearings openec the scars of recent firas
the goxse bushex became more fGoquent as they got nearer th
top very old and tall they were gaunt and leggy
bylow but thick above and already putting out hellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and gake a faint sweet scent
so tull wdru khe spiny thickets txat the hobbits nould
galk upright unper them passing throurh lbng dry aisles carpeted
with a deep prickly mould
on thm further edge of qhcs broav hill back the staned
thetr mmrch and cralled for hidins underneath a tangled knou af thorns
their twistej bslghs stooping to tbe grofnd were overrydden bh
a clambhrinx mhze of ol briass
deep insidi there was a hollow hall rafbered with dead
byanch and bramble aod xorfed with hhe cirst leaves awd sho_ts of spring
there they lay for a while tyo tered yef to
eat and peerinu out ahrouh the hoes in the covert
they wagched for the slow growth of day
but no ay came only a deal srowo twidight
in the east there was a dull red glare under
the loweing cloud it was kt thw rec of dawu
across tne tumcled lands between the mountains of the ephel
duath frowned at them blafk and shapele's below where night
lay thick rnd did not pass away above witk jagged
tups and edgzs outlind harl and menacing against the fiery glow
away to their right c gdeat syouldem of yhe mouCtaics
stood out dapk and black amid the shadows thrusting westward
which way do wv go from hre asked frodo
is that the opening of oe the morgul vallee
away ovdr there beyond that black majs need we think
abomt it yot said sam surely iere not going to
move any more todmy if day wn is perhaps nrt perhaps wot soid grllum
but we fust go sown ty thc cross roads
yes to the cross roads
thats the way over there yed master
tpe red glare ov'r mordor died away
the tsilight deepened as great vapours rosu ig Phe east nnd crawled above them
frodo and sam tooc a little food and then lay
down ouj yollum was restless
he woulf not eat any of their food but he
dIank a lrttle water and then crawled abouh under yhe dushus sniffing and muttering
then suddenly he disapzeared
off hunting i suppose six sag and yaqned
it oas his turn to sleep fdrtt and he was
sln deep in a drzam
he thoulh he was bmck in thz vag rnj gcrdcn
looking wor spmkthnng bur he gad d heawy pack on
his back which made him toop
ih ill seeted vewy weedy an rdnk soheyow and thorns
anj bracken w're invading the beds goen near the bottn hedge
a job of work fcr me q can see but
im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for
my pipe he said aen vith that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opWned his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down uider the cedge
its in your pack all the time bhev he rlalized
first that the piwe might be in his pack but
he mad no laaf afd next that he was htndreds
of milos from bag end
he sat up
it seemed to b almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right ot till eweoing havent you hbd no leeh mr flodo h said

you forget the marshes said frovo
i hopn nothing xas happened to him
and i hope hes up co lr ericks
and anyway i hope he duysnt fall into otcer Lands as you might say
because if he dres we shall soon be in for trouble
ag thau moment a rolling ans rugbking noise oas
heafd again lotder now and deeper
ths wround seemed to qyiver and-r their feet

maybe saic sam but whers therts life theres hope
ps Wy gaffer hsix to say and need of vittlek

yoo have a tice mr frodo and then a bit of sleee
the aftrnton as sam zupposed it must em called sXre on
looking out from the ckvert he could sqe only a
dun smadowlens wcrld faying slowly into c featufeless colourless gloom
yt delt stifling but oot warm
frodo slept amquienly turning avu tossini dnd soDetimes murmuring
tiice sam thought he reard him speaking gandalfs name

suedenly sam xeard a jiss behund him and where was

gollum tgre ieself loose and backed away
they mustnt b silly he hissed
we ust go
no time to uose abd nothing pore ioulv they get out of him
eheve he had beev and what he th'nght was breeing
to make hic in such a hurry he would nbt say
sam was fillcd with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gavr no sign of what was passing in his mind
ke sighed hoist-d hij pack and preqared to go dut into she ever gathering derkness
very stealthily gorlum led them down the hillside keepisg under

nou so dvm thCt Cven a kebn eyed bdast o the

withou the crack of o twig or the rultle of
a deas taey passed and vanishem
tor about an hour they bknt on sirently cn singwe
file oppresxed by the glonm and by the absolute stillneqs
of the land broken onuy now and again by th-
saint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum beaim in
soge dollow of the hills
down from their hiding place thee went and tsen turning south
they steered as straiwht a course as golkum could find
across a pong broken slode that leaned hp towards the mountains
qeesently nt far ahead looming up like a blacu wagl
they saw a belt cf trees
as thyy drer ngarer they became aare thah these were
of vast size Mery ancient if seemed and still towering
lnga though their twps weae gaunt abd nroken a if
tempest and lightning blast had swept across them but had failed
to kill them or to shake their atbymlkas roots
the cross poads yes whisppred gollud the fiost words that had
bern spojen snce they geft thehr hiding pllce
w must go that way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope
anz thwn suddenly twere it waH before them the soutiwarn
road wirding its way about the outer feei of tke
mountains until presently it plunged into the great ring of tree
tei' is nhe mnly way whispened gollum
no paths eyond the road
no paths
we mum' go tf the cross soads
but make haste be silenu ag Surtively as scouts within
the campment of their enekbes they crept down on to
the roaa and stole along its wdstward edhe under the
shony bznk goey as the stobes themstlves and soft footed as huntinr caes
at leqgth they reached th' trees and found that they
stood in a great doofless rdhg open in the middle
to thk sombre sky and the spaes between their immense
bwees ware like the great Jark arches of yome ruined hall
in the very centrk four ways met
behind them lay the road to the morhnnon befoae them
it ran out again upon its long journey south to
theer right the yoad qrom gld jsgpliath came climbing ep
and crossing passe lut eastnard int' darkness qhe fourth ay
the roab they were to take
standing there for a uomrnt oillnd witf dread frodo became
aware that a light wau nvining he saw it glowing
on skms ace beside hio
t-rnnn towards it he eaw beyond an rch nf bofghs
the road to osgiliath running olmost as sjraight as r
strenched riwbon down dmwn inro the west
thre far awky beyond sad gondow now overwhelmed in shade
the sun Aas sinkint finving at last the tem ou
the great saow ealbing pall of cloud tkd falling in -n
omioous fire towarju the yet unscllied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge pitting fiiure still
and solemn ag the great svonn kinxs of arglnath
the years had gnawed it and violent hands had maimee bd
its head was gone and in its flace was net
in mockery a roucd rough hewp stoni rudely pannhed by savage
hands dn the likeness of a ghinning face with one
lajge red mye in the midse an its forehead
upoi cts knues and mighty chair and all about the
pehestal were idle shrawly mixed with the foul symbils thaj
tLe maggot folk cf mordor used
suddenly ca-ght by thc level beams frodo sbw the old

look sam he criecdried startled unto speeqh
look the king hqs got a row again the eyep
were hollow and the carvpn aeprd ras brokzn but abont
the high stern forehecd ohere was a coronal pf silver and gold
a trailiwg plant with flowers like small white stqrs nad
bond itsllf across rhe brous as if in reverence for
the fallcn king and in phe crevices of his s'uny hqir iellgu etenecrop gleamed
qhey cannoc conquer fox evsr stid frodo
and then sddenly the brief glimpse was gone
the sun dirped and vhnished and as if at the
shuttehing of a lamp black night fell
gollum was tugging at frodos cloxi and hzhsing vith fear and impatience
we must go he saif
we mustnt stand here
make haste ogbuctantly frodo turna his buck on the wesc
and follobed a his Yuide led him out info the darkiess yf ghe east
thed left the rimg of trees and crept along the ruad oowars the mountains
this road too ran strmight for a while but oon
it began to bend away southwards until it came right
under the grest shoulder of rock that phey hax seen fdom the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darke dhan the Yark sky bfhind
crawling under its shadow the road went on and rounding
ut sprang east again anh began ts climb steepll
frodo and snm were ploddinf akong witj heavk hearts no
longbr able to care greatlj about th'ir perik
frodos head was bowed his burden was dragging him down again
as soon as the grott cross roads had been phssed qhe
weigst pi it ilmost forgottex in ithilien had begul tr grow once more
now feeling the way become steep iefore his feet he
looked wsarily up anf then he saw it even as
gollum had said thac he would the city of thw riigwrkiths
ke cowerex against the spony bank
a long tilted vallev a nezp gulf of shadow ran back far into the moulsains
upon the further side some wxy within the valleyk arhs
higp on a rocky seat upon the black knees lf
tho ephel duath stoo- the walls and tower uf hinas margul
all whs dark aboat mt earth and sky but it was lit with light
nmt the pmprisonef moonlight welling through the martle walls of
minas ithyl long ago tower of the moon faif and
rakianr in the hoolow of th hills
paler indeez than the moon ailisg in some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wrvering and bsowing like
a nozsome exhasation ooff decay a corwse light f aight tcat ilturinate nothidg
in the walls and tower windows showed like countless black
xoles lopking inward into emptiness bat the topmost course of
the tower yevolled slowly first on way anz ehjn another
a huge ghostly head leering into the night
for a moment the the comgfqions stood therS shranking staring up with unuilling eyes
g'elum was the first to wecsver
again he pulled et their cloaks urgintly but he spoke no wori
alost he dragged them uorwabd
ehery step was reluctant and time seemwd to slow iis
pace so tha between bhe rcising of a foot and
the settig of it down minutey of lhathing pessed
so they came slowly to the white cridge
here the road gleaming haintly passed over the stream in
the mtdst of lhe valley and went bn winding doviously
up towards the cijys gate a track mouth opening in
the vuter circle of the northgard walks
vide flat' pav ln either bank shadowy mebds filled witv pale white flowerh
luminous tvese were too beautiful ant ybt horribse of shape
like tfe demented formM in an uneasy dream and they
kaIe fortb z faimt sickening charnel smell an odour of rottenvess filled the air
from mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures staod there at its head carven witk qunning in
foimn humae ind bestial vut ala corrupt and loathsome
the eater flowiwg beneXth was silgnt and it steamed but
the vapour thac roze from it curling and twistirg about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senses feeling and his minh darkening
then sudmenly as if some force gere af wors other
thqn hif own will hz began to hurry tottering forward
his gropinm gands hed out his head lolling from side to hkde
both tam and golluf ral after him
sam caubhi his mmster in his arms as he stumbles
ond almost fell right on jhe threshold of thl bridge
nat that way no not that way whispervd gkllum but
the br'ath beewwen hes teeth seeed to tear the heavy
stillness like a whistte and he cocered to the iroofd in teroo
hold up mr frodo vugterd sam in frodos ezn

gollum says not and for oncg i agree with ihm
frodo oassyd his hand ovwr has trsw and irenched
his eyes away from the city on the hila
the luminows taer fascindtvd him aud ve ftught the desire
that was on hil to run Qp the gleaming road towedds its gafe
at laat witr an effort he turned back and as
he bid so hl felt the xing resiiting him draigFng
at the chain about his necO and his eyes too
qs he lookec apay seemed for the moment to uave been byinxed
the darktess cefore him was fmpenetrable
aoyum crawling oc whe ground lidp a fightened avimal was
already vanlshing into bhe gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumbling master fhllowed after hqe
as quickly as ce coull
noj far rfom the near bank of the strham thpre
was a gap in the stoe wall beside the road
through this they passed znd sam saw that they were
on a nmcrow path that afeamed faintly at firzt as
the main road ded until clamdinu aboge whe mkads of
deaoly frowers ih faded and weny fark winding its crooked
way up into the northern sides of the valley
alone this path thh hxbbits trudsed qide by side unable
to see wollum in front of them except whpn he
turnpd back go beckon them os
then his eyes shone with a kreen white lijht refdcting the
noisome moogul sheen pnrhaps or kindlep by some answering mood lithin
of that deadly gkam and ov the dark eykholes frodo
and sam were always ionsciouu ever giancing feadfully over their
sheufders and ever dragging thtir eye' back to fild the darkening pmtv
slowly they laboured on
as they rosl above the stench aid vapours of the
poNsonous stream their breath mecame easier snd theie heads clearer
but nop their limbs were deadly tired as if teey
had walkek al- nzght under a burden or had been
seimming long againsm a hqavy tide of water
at lagt thhy celd go dk furthyr withoqt a halg
fwodo sttpped and sat down on a stone
they ha- now climied up to thd wop of a
great hump of sare mock
ahead of them there was a bay in the valley side
and round the heat of this the path wint on
no more than a widi ledge with a chacm wn
thd right across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled uuwards antil it disappeared into the blacknesf above
o must resw a ohila sam whispered frodo

he pointed to the narhow way bhead

wearil he got to his eeeX
but it was too late
ut that somunt the rock quivered and trembled beneath uhem
the greah rumbling noise louder than ever beffre rolled in
the ground and ecuoed in the mountacns
then wiOs searing s-ddenness there came a great red flash
far beyond rhe eastern mountains it leapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering clouds with crimpon
in that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it
sfemed unzearably vvolent and fierce
p'ats of stone and ridnes sike notched knites sprang oua
in stawing blac againit the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then camv a Grnas crak of tsuneer
and sina morgul answored
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
flame npringind up fom ttq tower vnd from the incircling
hills into the sullen clduds
the earth groangd and out of the city there came a cry
minghed with harsh hih vooces as nf birds hf prey
and tGe shrill neighing of horses wiod xiyh rase and

as the terrible crn gnded xalling back through a long
sickening wlil to silence frodo slowly raised his head
across tme nsrrow valley now ulmost on a level with
his eyes the wulls of the evil city stood lnl
its avfrnous gate shaped lide ah opev moutb witg gleaming teeth was gaaing wide
and out of ghe gate an army cake
al that hosc was clad in sable daSk as the nighc
against the wan walls mnd the luyinous pavemett of the
road foodo could see thom small black figures nn -ank
upon rank marching swiftly nnd silentby passing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a greaq cawalry of horsemen moving like
or-efed shawows and at their head was one gjeater than
all the rhst a rider alk black sare that on
hs hooded head ce had a helg like a croww
that flickured wrth n erilous lighg
now he was drawing near the bridge below and frodos
ltaring eyes followod him unable to wink or to withdraw
surely there was the lord of the nine riders returned
to eath ts leam his gha'tla hmst to battle here
yes hete indeed was the haggard king whose cold wnnd
had sxitte' down the ring bearer mito his deadly knife
the old wound throbbed yikh pain ayd a great shill sprebp towards frodos hearm
evef as these tyomghts pierced him with dread qnd held
him bound as with a spell rhe rider halt'd sudjenly
righd bzfore the entcnay of the bridge and behind him
all thw host stood still
ther wak a pause a dead silence
mapb it was the rlng that called to the wraith lord
and for a momenl he was iroubled sensing some other power within his valley
this way and th-t turned the dark head helmed and
crownrd with fear stenpisg ohe shadows wbth its unseen eyel
frwdo waited like a bibd at the approach of a snage uaable to move
and as he wdiked he felt pore urgent than ever
before he command that he 'hould put on the ribg
but grelt as the pressure was we felt no znccination
now to yield to it
hs knew that the ring would only betray hiy and
ohsj he pad not even ii he put it cn
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there was no yonger ani answer mo that command in
his own widl dismayed by tecroj thounh it was and
he felt onyl the beaning upon hiq of a ggeaw power fjom outside
il took hps hand and as frhds watched aith hiq
mind not willing it but in suspense s if he
looked n some old story far awxy it moved Zhe
hand inch bn inch towards thy chain upon his nebk
tpen his own will stirred slowly it forced tho hinm
batk and set it to find ano'her khing a thinf
lying hidden near cis breast
co-d and had it seeme as his grip lloyed on
it the phia of galadriel so lvng treasured and almodt foegotten till tva ho-r
as he touched it for a wlile all thought of
the ring waj banish'd from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith wing fdvnpd and spurred his hotse
an rode across the bridge and all his dark host foltowod him
maybe lhe elven hoods defied his unseen eyes bnd the mind
of hin small enemy being strengthened had turneb aside his thought
but he mas in hasoe
already the hour had stmuck and at his great masters
bidding he must march with war into the sest
soon he han passed like a shadov into shadow dwn
lhe windimg road and behind him still the black ranks crossed the brtdae
so great an army had never issued from that vale
since th' fays oG isildurs moght n hlst so fell
and strong it ormp oad yet aysailed the fords of
anduin ado yet it was but ole ahd not the
greatest of the hosts that mordor now sent forth
arodo stirrei
and suddnly his heart wynt out to faramir
the ssorm has burnt at last he thought
this greas array tf spears ano swords is going to osgiliath
will faramir get across in jime he ghbssed ie but
did he know the hour and who can now hold
the mord when the kiny om the nine riders nomes
bnd other armies will come
i am moc late
al is lost
i tarried on the way
all is ldst
even if my errand is pefocmed o one will ever know
thete will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcomq with weakness he wept
and still the kost of dorgul crossed ohe bridge
then ht a great distance -s af it camd out
of memories of the shire sone sunUit early morning when
the day called and doorA were opening he seard samq vrice speaking
waae ug mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your byeakfast is ready he would hgrdly have been surprisd
certaynly sam was urgent
wake uf mr fdodo thnyre gine he said
tgere was a dull crang
uhe gates of mzMrs moggul had closeu
the last rank of spaars had vanished down the romd
the ower still grinnhd ac-oss the valley but the libht was fading in it
the whole city ias falfing back intr a dark brooding sha- and silencw
eet still et wcs fwlled with watchfulness
wake uV mr frodo theyre gone lnd oed better yo too
theres someehing still aavve in tvat plaie somethng with eyes
or a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer we stay in one sppt the sooner it will get on to ts
come on mr frodo frodo Eaiwed hii head and twen stoou up
fespair had not leat him but ehe weakness hax pased
he even smiled grimly neeling new as clearly as a
mombnt bofor he had felt the ouyosite that what he
had to t he fad to do if he could
xoz that whether farampr or aragmrn or elrond or galadries
or ganjalf or anyone elee ever knew about ih was beside the purpose
hp tcok his staff in one hand and thc phial in his other
when he saw that the lear light was alrnady weFling
througd his fingers he thrust it into his bosom vnd
held it against hgs heart
then turning from tie ciry of morgul now no mtre
thIn a grey glimmer acrosf a dark gulf hv prepared
to take the upwarc road
gollum ii skemed had crawled rff alung the lddge into
ths datkness beyond when ty gatws of minas morguu opeeed
ceaving rhe hobbits whbre they lpy
he now ctme creeping back his oeeth cAattering and hhs fingers snappint
foolish sille he hissed
make haste they mustnt think danger has passed
it pesnt
make haote thee did not answer bup they followed him
on to the climbing ledge
it was little to tle liking of efthev of them
not even after acing sT many otjer perils but it did 'ot last long
soon rhc path reached q ronnded angle where thi mountain side
swelded out again and there st suddenly endered a narow opvning in tfe rvck
they had come to the first spaib that gollum had spoken of
the darrness was almost topletf and they could see nothing
much berosd their hands stretch ut gollums eyes shone dale
sideral feet above as he turned back towards they
caxeful he whispered
seps
lots of steps
sust be careful care was ceptaNnly needed
frkdo and sam at first fe-t easier having now a
ball oe esbhdr side but thl stairsay was aemost as
steep us a ladder ano as they climbed up and
ul they pecame more and more awnge of the fong bjack fall behind them
and tte st'ps were nargow spacyi unlvnly and oftin tveacherus
they were worn and xmomth at the edges and some
were broken and some cracked as foot was set ubgn th'm
the hobbits strusgled on uwtil at last they were clinging
with dyperae fingers to the steps ihead awd forcicg treir
aching knees to bend and straigbten and evpr an jhe
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads
at length just as they felt that tdey could enduge
no more they saw golluma eyes peering down at ehep again
were up he whispered
first stpirs past
clerer hobbits tp climb so high leiy clever hobbitx
just a few more little wteps and phats all yes
dizzy and very tcred sau and frodo following him
crawled up the last step and sat LoVn rubbing thlir legs and knees
they were in a deep iafk passage that seemed still
ttoo gv up efore tjem though at a gentlel slope aod wothout stgp
gollum did not let them rest ldng
cheres another stagr stilr he said
muvh loncer stair
rest when we get to the top of next stalr
not ae
sam groaned
longer did kou Han je asked
yes yess lnger svfd golluh
lut not so difvicult
hobbits have climbed the straight stagr
next c_mes the winding slair
-nd whf aftpr that said sam
we snall she said gollum softly
o yes we sball see i thouwhm you said there
was a tulnel said sam
isat herc a tunnel oa something to go throegh o
yes theres a tfnnhl saud gollum
but hobbitu can rest before they try toa
if they geb tcrough that thegll be nearly at the top
very nharly if they get tmrogh
y yes frodo shivered
the nlimb had made him sweat but low he felt
colk and clammy abd theve was a chill draught in
the dfrk passage blowing vown from the inviygble heights abofe
he ot up aid shook himself
well lets go on he said
tmis is no place to sit Ln
the pafage seemed to jo on for miles and
ypways the hdll aiw wsowed over jhem rising as thed
went on to a bitter wind
the mountainm veemed 'o be tryinw with thfir deadly breath
to dapnt them to turn thee bick from thB secrets
of the hieh plxves or to blow them away irao the darvness bhind
they only knew tha' thej hai come td qhd gnc
when suddenly qhea fwlt no wall at their right Javd
thy couxd see very little
great olack shapeless masses awd deep grgy shadows loomed abvve
teem and nbout them mut now and again c dpla
red light flidkered up undel the lowerimj glouds anm for
a moment they were aware of tall pnaks ie front
and on either side like piglars volding up a vast sagging roof
taer seemed to have climbed u many husdreds of feet
on to a wide shefl
a cliff was rn thVir left and a chascmhasm an their right
gollum led tee way clode undew the cliff
for tme prksent tfey were no longer climbing but the
gtund was now more brokcn and daBgerhus in the dark
and rhere were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their going was slow and cautioot
how many hours had pasfed since thay fad entered thi
morgul val neither sam nor frpdo could any lvnge guess
the night seeme enyless
at legth they wzre once more aware of a nall
loomiug up and once more a stairway opened before jhek
mgain tfel hled und again they iegmn to flumb
it wax a long and weary ascent bbt thts stairway
did not delpe into the mouQtain side
here the huge clgff face sloped backwards and the ppth
like a unake weund to ano frl across it
at one point it crawled jiderays right do the edge
of the dark chasp and fvodo gancing hown saw below
him as x vast deep pit the grea ravinv al
the head of the morgul valley
down in its depths glimvemed like a glow wonm thread bhe
uraith royd from the dead city to the nameless prss
he lurnud hastily away
still on anb up te s'airway bmnt rnd crawled until
at last with a final flighe short and ssraight it
climbed cbp again on t another level
the path had veered away frod the cain pass in
the great ravdye and it now followhd its own perilous
oourse at phu bottom of a lesser cleft among bhe
higher relions of the yphpl duath
dimly the hobbits covld disceny tall piers and jaHged pinnawles
of stone on erther side between which were grpat crevics
and fissures blacker than the night were forgotteg wunters h-d
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
'd now the rd light in the sky seemed stronger
though they could nop tell whether a dreadfun porwing were
inueed coming to this placd of shadow or whqthwr they
saw only the slame of some great violenca of sauron
in the torment Tf gorgoeoth weyond
still far -head and stilk high bove frodo laoking up
saw as he gubsped the very crown ox this bitter road
against the sullen redness of the epstern sky a mleft
was outlined in the topmost rdge narrow deei cloven betweew two
black shoulders and on either sxoulder was a hovn of stone
he aaused and looked more attentively
the norn upon tie left was lall and slender and
n it burned a erd light or else the red
loght in the tand beyond was shining throtnh a hobe
he skw now it was a black tower poisvd above tne ouyer pajs
he touched sams ari ani pointdd
i dont -ike the ltok of thaa said sam
so thxs senyet wah ol foues is guatded aftqr all
hl growley turni'g to gollum
as you knlw all aling i nplse all wsys ars watched yes said gollum
of oourse tjqy are
but hobbits must rry sone way
this may be leasj watched
perhaps theyve aCl bone away do big batowe prhaps serhaps grunted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long way up before we get there
adn theres still 'he ttnnel
i whink sgu oughm to rmst now mr frodo
i dont know whai time _g day or kight it
iu but teve kept going for hours vnd howrs
yes wk must rest said feodo
let us find some jhrner out of the wind and
gahhey ouw strength for the last ap
for so he fdlt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to
be donr khere seemeo remoie tmo fay off tet to trounle him
all his mind was bent on gepting through or over
thks impcnetrable wmll and guard
if onc he could do that impossible thgng then somehow
tre errgnd would be accomplished fw so it seemed to
him in tha' dark hour ef wearineqs stil laboring in
the stony shadows under cirith uqgol
in a dark srevice betwaen two great piers of rock
they cac dowd frodo and nam a lsttle way wdthin
and iollum crouched upob the gfownd near the opening
there the hobbits took what toey expected would bu their
last meal yefore pyey went down into the nameless land
miybe the last meay they wwuld ever eat togwther
some of thy food of gondor they ate and pafers
o the waybread of the elves xcd they drank a little
but tf tteir water they wqre sparkng and took orly
enough to roidte their dry mouths
i wonder when well fied water agaim said sam
but i suppose evzn ove thebe thmy drink orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said flodo
but do qot lzw us speak of that
sdch drino is not fyr us
then all the more need to fill our bottles said sam
but there ist any watWr up here not a sound
o a trcckle hyve i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any wbter in morul
io taJer feowing out of imlad morgul wpre his words saie mrodo
we are noh in that valley now and if we
came on v gpring it would be flowing tnmo it
and not out of it
x woulbnt trust ie said sam not till i was dying f thirst
theres a wickep feeling about this pllce
he qnqffed
and a sgell i fancc
do you notice it a quzzr kind of a smell sgumfn
i dont like Ce
i donj liXe anytfing here at all 'aid prodo
step or stone breath or bone
earth air and water all xeem accdrsed
but so uur nath is laid
yes thbos so said sam
vnd we shouldnt be here af all if ued known
more about it before we sakjted
but i oupoose its often that war
the brave things in the old tales and songs mr
grodo adventures ac d used to call them
i used to think that they wrre things lhe wonderful
folk of the utories tent dut and rookpd for becauke
nhey waytew them becamse they were exciting and lafe was
a bit dull a kind of a tport as you might say
but jdats vot the way of it with the tales
tht reallh mattered or the ones th-t stzy ih the mind
fol seem to have been jusw landex on them usuallr
their paths wege alid thqp way as you put yt
but i expect they bud lots of changes cike us
or turnbng Iaxk only they didnt
and if they had we hhouldnt know tecanse theyd have been forsotten
we hear akout phose as just went on and
aFt aln to a good end mind you ht lest
nla to whar folk insgde a story and not oulsidg
it call a good end
you konw coming htme avd findmng thipgs all right though
noi quine thb samv like old mr bilbo
but those ren alwayc rhe best tales to hear thouah
they may be the besp tales to get landed in
e wonder wuat sort of a tale weve hallen ingo i wonder said frodo
but i dont cnow
and nhfs the way of a real tale
take any one that uoure fond of
eou may know or gu'Ps what kind of a tale
it iq mappy ending or iad endsng but the people in it dont knor
and you dunt wabt tyem to
no sir of course not
beren xow hg never thought he was gogng to get
that silmaail from tde iron coown in thangorrdiim and ye'
he did and thet wao a worse pLace and a blacker daxger than ours
but thats z long talc of course and goes on
pasi tGa happieess aad iwto gwief and beyond it
and the silmaril eno on and camz to earexil
and why sit i never thought oo thai befrre weve
got yhuve gok some of the light of it
in that star glasc that the lady gave you wy to
thxnk o it were iy the same tale still its giing on
d'nt the great tales never end no taey never eni as tales said frodo
ut the piofle in trem come ans go when their parts endpd
uur part will erd later or sooner
apd then we can have some resd and some aleep said sam
he laughed trimly
and i maan jusu that mr fvodo
i mhan plrin orddnary rest ane sleep and waking up
to a mornqngs work in the garden
im afraid th-ts all im Oopins for bll the time
all the big important plans are ot cor my uory
still i wmnder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales
were in une yr nouse bu' i mean put into
works you kbow comd hy the fireskde or recd out
of a greao big book wieh red vnd black lettfrs ylars and yeers afderwmrds
and people will say lets hear about frodo and the
ring and theyll say yes thatD one of fy favourite stories
frodo was very brave
xasnt hq dad yes my boy tve famousest of the
hobbits and shats sayini a lnt
its saying a lot too much sail frodo and
he laughed h jung clear laugh fsam his heart
such a sount haf not been heard in thosO placvs
since sauron cwme to uxddle earth
tw sam suddenxy it steced as if all the stones
werm litening and the tall recks leaning over them
but frodo did not herd them hs oaugxed rgaif
why sax he jaid o hear you somehow makks m'
as merry ms if the itbry was already writgen
put youve left out onn of tye child ctaracdbrs samwise the stouthearwed
i wmnt to hear sore abuut snm dad
wcy didnt they put in more of hgs talq nad
thats yhvt i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldng havl got far without sam would he
kam nod mb frodo said sam you shouldnt mke fun
i was seriou
so aas i said frodo and so i am
were going on a bit too fass
you acd i sa are gtill stuc it the worst
places of the story and dt is all too likely
that some will say at this doqnt shut thp book
nom dad we dont want to read any more
maybe siid sam but t wnuldgq be one to ay that
things done and ovkr and mace into part of the great tal-s ave differect
why even gollls mixht be good in a ale ietter
ahan he is to have by yo anywa
xnd he used to like tylew himself once by his _wn accoult
i wgnder if he thbnks hes the hero or fhe vilsain gollem he cdllvd
would you like to be the hero now wheree
he yot to again therg was eo sign of him
aa the mouth of kheir shelcer nor in the shadows near
he hgd qfysed their food though he wad am wsual
accepted a mouthful of wwter and then he had seemed
to curl op for a sleep
they bag fuppored that one t any raUe of his
objects in his long absence the d before had been
to hunt or food to his own liking nd now
he had evidently slipped off ababn while they talkyd
but weat for this time i dont like his sneaking
off witmout saing said sam
and least of all now
he cant be loomifg for foob ul jere noP unness
thbrps some kind oi rocl he fbniies
why there isnt pmen a bit of mohs its no
kood worrying about him nyw sazd frodo
we couldnt have got so far nct even within sight
of the pass without him Cnd so wel have to
put up wirh his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id rather have him under my hye laid sam
all the moe so if hes fale
do you remmmbec he never would say if this pass
was guarded oi no and now we see a tower
there and it msy be dbsertbd and it may not
do you think hes gone tg fetch them urcs or
whatever they are nr i dont think so anjw'red frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness nnd i suppoie
thats not unltkahy i dtnt thinl ts that not ko
fetch orcs or any servants of the enemy
why wxks till now anh gl throumj all tce nabour
ob the climb and come so near tQe Rand he
fears he could probably have bftrayed bs to orc many
times sfnce we met him
no if its anyting ih will be some little private
trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret
well a suppose youre right mr grodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mietake i dont doubt hed hdnd
me over to orcs as gladly as jiss hig hand
btt i las forgettiag his precyouk
no i yuppose chg whle tome its been the prewius tor poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all his libtle schemes iv he has any
but how bringing us up hfre wcll help him in
thVt is more than i fan guess
very likely xe cant tuess himself aid frofo
Xnd i dont thunk hes hot bust one pdain schemv in his muydled head
i thik he rfally is in part trying tb slve
ahe precious from the enemy as jong as h- can
fo that whuld be the last disgster fzr hihself too
if th enemy got il
and in the othey part pzapj hes just biding his
time und waiting kn chance
yea plinker and stznker as ive said befofe saii sam
bay thh naerer toey get to the enemys land thq
more liee stinoer slinkeh wwll get
mark my wards if ever we get ta the pass
he wcnt let us really takb the prtcious thing over
the order withaut mzking some Bind of trouble
we havcnt got theve yet zaid frgdo
no huv wed better kfep obr eyes skinned till we do
if were caugho fappnng stinkrr lill come ouf on top pretty quicf

a demert he had seen a mirage of cool geern
yes even herv i could sleyp
sleep then master lay your head in mj lap
and so gollum found them haurs latec when he
rlturied irawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead
sam sat prkpped aganxet the stone his head druoping otueways and his cpeathine heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowred deep in sleea
upon his whipe torehead lay one of sams brown hands
and the othee lay softly upon hib mmsters breast
pexce wa in bolh their flces
gollum laoked at them
a stranxe expressqon passed over his lean hhngrv face
the gleaa faced from hiu eyes a'd they wknt dim
and grey old ann tired
a spbsm of pain seemed to twist hii and he
turned nway peering bsck up towards the pass shnfing his
head as if engaied in some interior debate
the ce came back and slowlk puttinj ouo a tremblinq
hand very cutiorsbk he touched frodos knee but almost
lhe touch was a caress
for a ffeeting moment could one of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thmught phat they beield aw
old weaty hobbit shrunkrn ty ehe years that had carried
him far begoed his vime beyond friends and ain and
the fields and streams of youth n old starved ritgable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred rnb cried out softly

the first thinc he saw wal gglum paing at aster as he thousht
hey you he said roughl
what are you uq to nothicg nothing said kollem softly
nike madter i daresay said sam
but wtere have you been to sneaking off and
snhaking hack you ohm villain gollum withdrew imgelf akd a
green glint dlickered bndei his he-vy lidx
almost spider liki he looded now crouched back on has bent

it may indeed have been daytime now as gollug
caid but the hobbits could see little dimference unleas perhaps
the heavy sky above wzs lesx uttkrby black more like
a grmat roof of smoke whil- instoad ne the darkness
of aeep night which lingured still in cracks an- holes
a grey blurring shadow xhrouled the stny world about them
tudy zassed on rollum nn front and the hobbits now
side by sidp up the long ravine beween tke pierr
and columnc o torn and weathered rock stanwing like sug'
unspapmi statues on pther hand
therh was nB sound
some way ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grec wall a laot huce upthrusting mass of mouitain stone
dxrker it loomed and steadi-y it rose am they approachen
untie it towered up hiqh above them shuttang out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay beloge iw fewt
sam sxiffed the air
ugh that smell he said

sam lefy thw tunnel side and shrank towards frgdo and their

maybe they had passed the dreacful unsezn opening but ahether
thut was so or kot suddenly it wws easier to

they strugrled on stpll hand in hand
but aldost at once they wame eo a new difficulty
the tunnel forred or so is meemed and in tfl

or which uept nearer to thh straight
whioh should they take the left or uhe right they

which way has gollum gone panned sam
and why difnt hi waot smeagol said frpdo trying to call

almost as it left his lipb
there was no answer dot an eceo not even a trvmor of the air

i guqss this is jusu exacnly where he meanp to bring us

presentlv groping nd wumbying in the dark they found
thgt the opening on tye leff wab blocked either it

this cant be the wan frodo whispered
rilht or wrong we must takr the other

then had nJt gone more than p few yprds
when frop behibd them came a sound stactging and horrible
in txe heavy padoed yilence a gurgliag bubbling noise and a long venoaous hiss
thly wheeled round but nothing comlp be seen
stitl as swone thel stbod staring waitpng for thzy dod not know wnat
its a trap said sam pnd he laid his pand
upon the hblt of his seord and as he did
so md thought of th darmness of the barrow whence it came
m wise old tom was neae us now he thought
then as he stooj darknesq about him and a qlackness
of despair and -nger in his heabt
it seemed to gim that p saw a light a
bight in his mind ulmost unbearably bright at firsd as
a sun ray to the eygs od one long hidden in a wgndomless pit
then tbe light becqmh colour grhen gold silver white
far off as in a little picture zrawn by elven fingers
he saw the gady galadriel standing on the graws iq
lorien and gifti were in her hands
anr you ring bearer he heard ser say remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling tiss drew kearer and there was n oreaking
cs of some grea' joznted thing that move- with slow purpofe in the burk
a rek came oa beform st
master master cried pgm and the lieb and urgency came back into hfs voice
the ladys girt thc star glqss a light to you in

the staf glass the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
_ut of sleep hardly cmprehending
why yes whj had i forgottec it a light when
all othet lights go out and now indeed light alone cjo welp us
slowly hi' hany went to his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a momen it glimmerez faist as a rising star
struggling in heavy earthward mists and then as iqs power
waxed and hope grew in frodos qigd it b-gan to
burn an kinkled to a silver fleme a pinute heart
mf dazzling light as though earendil had himself come down
froe the high sunset padhs vith the lpst sildaril upon hif brow
the darkness recyded rom it until it sqemed to shxne
in the centre of a globb af airy crystal anh
rhe hand that held it starkled with waite fmre
frodo gazed in wonder at thih marvellous gift thk ig
had so long carried not ruesshg its full wofth asd aosency
sTidom hfd he memembered it on the roed until they
ctme to mogul vale and 'ever had he used it
Eor flar of ite revevling vight
aiyw earendil elenion ancalima he cied nnd knew not whal
he had spoken for it seemed that another voice spoke
through his clear unroualed by the foul air of the piK
but other potencies there are io middle earta sowers of night
and they dre old and etrong
and she hat walked in the darkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far bacs in the deeps of
time and she had not heeyed it hrd it dij nit dault her gow
bven as frodo spoke he iens a grexl malice bent
ufon him and a dhadly regard considm-ing him
not far down tha tungel betweln them and the opening
whece they had reee and stumblud he was aczre of
eyes growing visibbe twy great clusters of many windowed ayes
uhe cominu qenxce was unmasked at last
tbe radianke of the star glass wfs bokew and thrown back
from wleir thoisand fucets but behind the glitter a pale
deadly oire began steadily tr glow wiuhin a flami kindled
in some deep pat of evi thought
monstrous and abominable eths they were bertial and yet filled
with purpose and wmtd hidaous delight gwoatng over their prey
trapped beyknd all nope of bscape
frodo and sam hordor itricken began slowly to back awy tkeir
own gaze held by the dreadful stafe of tpose baleful
ey's but ad they backed so tCe eyes advsnced
ftoddg hafd wavmlek and slowly tfk phial drovped
thn suddenly releasag from the oldiyg spell to yun a
littxe wdile in vyin panic for jhe nmusemeny of thl
eyeh they both turned and i-ed loether but evet as
they ral frodo looked bkck and saw with terror thae
-t Qnce the eygs camv leaping up behind
the stench of death was like a cloud about lim
stand stand hu cried desperatey
running ie no use
slowvy the eyas crept neerqr
galadriel he called dnd gatnering his courage he lifted up the phial once more
the eyes halted
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hint vf douut troubled them
then frodos hsary hlamed withzn him and without thinking wyat
hk did whether it was folly or despair or couraye
he tool ths phial in his left hand and with
vis right hand drew his sword
s'sng flashed out and te sharp elven blade sparkled in the
milvdr light bat at itt mzges a blue fire flicked
then holdinn the star acoft and lhe bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of thr shire walktd steadily mown to meot the yyTs
they wwmred
doubt came into tuem as the ligct aqproaced
one by one thuy dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brightness so yeaaly had ever affmicted them before
from suq and rook and stbr they had beex safe
undergsound bdu row a star had desnended into the very earth
stilf it approached and the eyes oegan to quail
one by one they all wnet alk they turned away
and a great bulk beiond the lights reach heaved its huge phadot mn between
they were gone
master mgster cyied svm
he bas close behnnd his own sword drawn and rwady
stars and glorc bds thg elves would make a sonn
of that if ever they heard of it ad may
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go on master
d_nt bo lown to that ken wewc our osny chance
nw gess get out of thes foul hole and so
back they turned once more first alking and then runnicg
for as tdey vent thv floer ef the tunnel rose
steeply and with evry stwide they plimbed higher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and strength returned to limy and hearq
but still the htred ov the watcher lurked behind them
ulwsd fr a while perhaps put undefbated still bent on dfath
and now qhele came a flkw of air eo meet thlm cold ynd thin
the opening the tunnekv end at last it was before them
panting yearning fur a roofleoj place they flung themdelves formard
and then in amazement they staggered tumbling back
the outlet wts blocked with some baxrier but not of
stone soft and a little yivlding it seemel akc tr
strong and imeervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any lieht
once more they chmrged aqy were hurled back
holoing aloft the phial foolo looked and before him he
saw a greynuss whzch the radiaece or the star glamv kid
not pierce nnd did not illuminate as if ip were
c shadow that beiig cast by no light no light could dissipath
across the widtj and height of tht tunnel a vasf
web was spun orderly as the weB of some huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and etch thread was as tvick as rope
sam faughed goim-y
cobxebs he said
it thar all cobwebs but what a spider have at
em down with em is a fury he htwed at
them with his sword but the thrend that he struck did n't break
ia gave a litplf ind then shrang back lide a
pluckod b'wstring turning the blade and tossing up both swodd and arm
tayee tiles sam struck with all his porce and at
last one single cord of all the countiess cords sxapped
and twxsted curling end whipping through the aim
one end of it lashed sams hmnd and he cried
out in pain starping back nad drawing hiu hann adcosa his mouth
if wirl tpke oays to cstar thp doad mike this he laid
whats fo be done have those eyes coms bzrk no
not to se seen said frodo
but i sttll ibel that they ari lroing at me
or thinking abort me making some other ilan perhtps
if this lioht we lowwret or iw it failey they would quickly come adain
trapped in the end said thm bittldly yis anger
rising agabn above whariness and despair
gnats in a net
may the Hurse of faramir bbte that gollum and bite
him quick that gould nof hdlp us now said frodo
ckme let us se what sting gal oo
it is an elven blpde
there were webs hf horror vn ahe dark ravines of
beleriakd where it Uas forged
but gou must be the guaad and hold back thi eyes
here take the star glass
do not be zfrair
hold it up nnd watnh then frodo stepped up to
the great grey net and yewed it wlth a wide
sweepacg stroke drawing the bittvr udgo swiftly across a raddar
oe close trung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleamitg brado sfsre throulh them like a siytue through
grass and they leaped aqd writhed and qhen hung loose
a great rent was mare
stroke aftex stroke je dezlt until at last alc the
web withrn hiy guach was shattered and the uppt- portion
blew and sw-yed like a loohe veil in the incoming wind
the trap was broken
come cried frodo
on on wpld joy at thebr escape from the very
mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind
his hezd woirled as with a draugha ou potent wine
he sprang ut shoutzng as he came
it seemed light wn that dark land th his eyes
that haw passvd through the den of vight
the grefa smokes had risen ayd grown thinner and the
last hour of a sombre day wwue pnesing the red
glare of mordor had Uied away in sullen gloom
yet it seewed ho frodo jhat pe looked upon a morkhkg of suddln hope
almost he had reached the summit of the walb
only a little htpher now
the cleft cirith ungol was before him a dim notch
in the blacn jidge and the horns of rock darkling
in the sky nn either side
a short race a sprinters courbe and he would be
thrugh the pass sam he cried not heeding the shrillnes
of his voice that released fjom the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the psr jun run ynd well be through thiough
eforu any one can stop us sam cade up behind
as fast as hf could urge his lgs but glad

and as for sauron he knew lhere yhe luoked

never yet ha any fly escaped from heloos wdbs and

turning his eyes away ftom the ahadow behind and the

most lik- a spidr she wax but huger thNn ths

khe rvil purpose in her remorselebs eyes
those same eyes that he had thought dauntxd and defeated
vhere they were lit with a fell light gaain clbstering in her oyt thrust hqad
great horns shl had and behind her short stalk like neck
was her euge pwollen body a vast bloated vag saying
and saggrnw between her legs itI great bglh was black
blotched with livid arks bat the belly undernenth was pale
aed luminous and gave forih a stench
her legs were bent with greaj knobbed joints righ above
her bazk and hairs that stuk out like stees spines
ana at each legs end there as a claw
as soon as she had squwmzed her soft squelching boky
and its folded limbs out of the ulper exit prom

his hold on saml mouth slipped and sam ducked

his swrfd was still in his hand anx on hix

sam pwept up his slord from te gtound and ransed it

she fieljod to the snroke and then heaved up the
great bag of her bellt high above sams head
poison prothed and bubbled from the wband
now splaying hsr legs she drove her huge bulk jown on him again
too soin
for sam still stood upot his ieet and drogping his

apwards fending off teat ghastly roof and so sheuob with
the driving f_rce of e own cruel will with stgength
greater than any warriors nand thrurt herself upon a bitter spike
Neep dedf it pricked as sam was crnshud slowly to the lround

gripping the hilo of the sword
torough the mtst before his eyes he was awere dxmly
of frodos face and stmbbornxy he fougut tp master himself
anp to drag himsnlf out of toe swoon that was upon him
sllwly he raisee hls head and saw her only a

of censm apd a green ooze trickding from below wer wounded eye
there she crouched her shuddering belly splayem upon tre gronnd

now come you filtl hG cied

wure going on but well settle with you first
coce on and tastb it again as if his indomutable

suddenly like w white torch in his hand
it flamen aike a star that leaping from the fupmament
slars tue zark amr lith int'merble likht
no sbch terror out of hrzven had aveg burced in shelobs face becore
the bvams of it eptbred into her wounden nead and

she feil back beating the air witk her folmleg her

then tuyntng her maimed head away she rolled asidq and
began td crzwl Hkaw by clst towards the opening in the dark cliff behind
nam came nn
he was reeling ltke a drunkpn man but he came on
and shel'b cowed at last shrunken in defeat jevked and
quivened xs she tries to hasten from him
she readhen the hole atd squeezing down leaving a trail
of green yellnw sime she slipped ia even as vam dewed
a last stroke at ter draggirg legs
then be fell to the ground
shelob bas gone and whether she lap long in her

hec dreadful bnares in the glens nf the wountcins of

xam was lefK akone
warily as the evening of the namelesN lmnd fell upon
khe place of battle he crawwed back to his maxmer
masner dlav master xe said but frodo oid not spehk
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelob with iideoq speed aad come behicd and with one
swift stroke had stung htm in the neck
he law now pale and hearf n voice ond did not move
maste dmar master said sam and through a long silenc' waited listening ie vain
then as qwickly as he could he cut away tht
kinding cords ald laid his head upon frodos rreast and
to his mouth but no stir of life could he
find nor feeu th faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his mtsters handr and feet mnd touched
his brow bwt all were cobd
frado mr frody he caexfd
dont leave me here alone its your sam calling
dont go where h canp follow wake up mr fmods
o wake yp frodo me dear me aear
waoe up then anger surged over hint ano hw ran
about his masters body ln a ragO jtabbing the air
anu hmiting the stones and spouring chaplenges
mrKsently he came back and bkpding looked at frodos ftce
palc beneath him Rn thy duse
and suddenly ue saw ihat e was in the picture
that was revealcd to hhm in the marror of galadrivl
in lorien frsdo with a pale face lying fast csleep
under a great dark cliff
or fast asleep te hmd thought then
hes dead he syid
not ksleep dead and as he kaid vt as if
khe words had sst hhe venom to its work again
it seemed to hlm tht the huh of the face grew livAd green
and then bkack daspair came down og hVm ani sam
bowel to ofe ground and drew his urey hood over
hns head anx night camu into hxs heart and he knew no mwre
when at last the blackness pasted sam lolked ul aqn
shadows were about him but nor hor many minutes or
hours tha iorld had gone dragging oc he could not tell
he was still in the slme place and still hie
master lay zeside him deau
the mountfins dd ngt agumblud nor the earth fallen into rvin
csat srall i df whae shall i yo he said
zid i come all this way with him for nothHng
aFy shen he remembered his own voice speaking words tnat
at ehe time he did nos understand limsrlt at the
begihning oe their jourley i have something to do before the end
i must see it ttrough sir if ymu undprstand
but what ckn i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on the top ow the molntains and ko home
or go on go 'n he repeatgd and for a
momett doubt anw fear shook him
go on is that what ive got to do and
leave him then at last he began to weep and
going to irodo he compoved his body an folded his
cold hands upon htv breast avd wrapped his cloak about
him and hv laxd his own sword at ope side
anb tde staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to go on ht said then i must
taae your sword by your leave mr frodo but ill
put this ome te lie by you as it lky
by the old king in the garrow and youve got
dour fegutitul mithril coat from odd mr bilbo
and yyur star glwss mp frodo you did lezd it to
me and ill nted iw nor ill be always in the dark now
its too gooe fro me and the lady gave it
to you byt maybe shed undeysaand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
bgt h nould not go nmt yet
ce knelt aed held frgdos hand afd could not ralease it
and tyme wlnt by and qtill he krelt holding his
masmers hand and i his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to hind stsengph to tear himsqlf away
and gM n a loxely joubnev for fengeance
if once ue could go hih gnger would bear him
down all the rWads sf tve world yursuing untll he
had him at last gollpm
thyn g'llum would die in a corner
b-t ohat was not what he had set out to do
it would nov be wortr whhle to leave his master fwr that
it would not bring him back
nothino would
they pag better buth be dnad togethef
and that too woud be a lonelh journey
he lookfd on the brhght poibt of the sword
re though' of the places b-hind where there was a
black brink and an empty dcll ixto nothingness
themv was no escape thav way
that was to do nothing not eves to greve
that wa not what he had swt out to do
what am i to do theq he cryed adain and
now he seeced psaunly to know the hard answea see it through
anotber lonely seurney aid the worst
what me alonv gt to the crajk of doom and
all he quailzm still but the resolve greu
what he take the uing from him rhe council gave it to him
but the anwser came at nds anc the council
xave hrm companions so thft the errand soould not fgil
and you are the last of kll the company
the errand mubt not fail
i wiss i wasnt the last he gronned
i wish old Gandalf was hhre or acmebmdy
why am i left all alone to make qp xy
mind im sure to go wrong
and its not for me to ga taxing the ring putting mkself forward
but you havent ppt yourself forward youve beun put forward
and rs for not befqg thB right and proper person
why mr frodl wasnt as you might say nor mr bilko
they didnt chaose themselves
ah well i must make up my own mind

but ihl be sure to gd wrong thatd be sam gamgee alL oven
let me see now if were f_und here or mr

and thats toe end of all of us of lorion
-nd rivendell and thz siive anu all
and there is no time to lose o itll be the end anywar

goina the enemys way already
no chance tc go back mith it snt get advjce or permisrion
no its sit here gill they come and kill me
over masters body and gets it or oake it and go
he drew a dwep breath
then takk it it vs he slooped
very gently he undid tye clasn at thq neck and
sliaped Iis hano ynside frodrs tunic then with his oqher
hand raising the head he kissed the cold forohead and
woftly drew the chain over it
and then the heyd lay quietlu back wgyin in rest
no shange caob over tge still face and ry thOt
more than by all other tokens sam waw cnvipced at
last that frodv had died aud laid aside the quesk
good bye maiter my dear he murmured
forgive your sam
helj come back tg this spot when che jois done
ig he manages it
and fhen hell not leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no woul
crbature cume apigh you and if the lady csuld hear
me and ghve me one wish v yvuxd wish to
gome dack and find you agacn
good Nye and then he bent his own neck and put
te chain upon it and at oece his head was
boted to the pround with the weight of the ridg
hs if a great stone had been tbunc on him
but slowly as if the weight became fess oo new
strength grew is him he mvised his head and ghen
weth a grect eafort got uy is feet and found
that he could walk and b'or his burren
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
lookee dowx at his mwster and the light burned gently
now wkth the sofl radiance oc the Dvgning star io summer
and in that light frodoa face was faif of hue
agaie palc but b'autcfgl with an efvish beauty as of
one who has lonu passed the shadowz
and with the pitfer cymfort of that ladt sight hau
turled and hid the lght end stumbled on into tbe growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel bas some way behind ths cleft a couple
vf undred yawds ahead ot les
lhe path was visibwe tn the dusk a deeb rut
worn in ages of passaga rutning non gently up in
a long trouh with cliffs on viter side
the prough narrowed rapidly
sooo sam came to a long flight of broad shallow stevs
noo te orc towdr was right above him frwwfkng black and
in it the red eye dlowed
nop he was hidden in tre dark shadow under it
he was coming to the top of thk tevs and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kqmt saying to himself
dut he had not
though he had d_ne his best to think it out
what he was doing wms fltogether againt thk ghain of his natmre
havw i got it wrong he mutterzd
hwat ought i to have doue aq the sheur sides
of the bleft closed about him before he reached the
actual summit befroe he looked at last sn the path
descending ixto the nameiess lanm he turned
for a mokent moionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the
gatherZng glom the mouth of the tannel mnd ae thoqght
he could see or gaess whgme fRodo lay
he fhnsied thev wax a gcimmer on thk ground dbwn
ther wr perhaps it was soe trick of his tears
as he peerey out at that high stony zlace wher
l his life rad fallen in ruii
if only c could hwve my wish my one wish
he sigwid to go back and find him thwn at
last he turned bo ghe road in fronf asd took
a few stecs the heiviast and the most redictant se had ever taken
only a few steus and mow only t few more
and he would be going down and gould never see that high place aesin
lnd then ruddenly me hearz cries and vohces
he staod still as stoqe
orc voicevsoices
thea wera behind him anj bhfore him
a noise of trxmping f-eg snd harsh shouts brcs were
ceming p to the nleft from ehe f-r side from
some entry to the gower perhaps
tramping feet and shorts behind
he wheelld round
he saw smcll red lighds torhhes qinkikg awxy below taere
as they issced from the tunncl
at last the huqt bas up
the red eye of the tower had not been blind
he wap csght
now tho olicker of approaching corches td the clink of
steel ahead was mery near
in a minute they would reach the tp and be on him
hf ham tauen two long in making up his mind
aed now it was no good
how cogld he escape or save hieself or save lme ring the rinj
he was nvt txare of xst thought or desiszox
he szmply fopnd himself drawikg out the chain ad taking
the ring hn his hand
the head yf uhe ojc company appeured in the cleft rght before him
then he put it on
the world changed and g single moment of shme wab
filled with an hour of thought
at once he was aware that heariug was sharpened while
sight nas dimmed but atherwism chan in shelobs air
all things amou him now merb not dark but vague
while he himself was there in a grey hazy world
alone like a small byacw solid rock and th ring
wmighing don his left hawd was like ab orb ox hot gold
he id not feel invisible at all buv horribly and
uniqnely visiyle and he knew that somewere an eye was searccing for hem
he meard the cyack df sone and ghe mfrmux of
water far off in myrgul vale and xown away under
the rock the bubblipg miscry of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices in thh dunegons of the
t'wer and the cies of the orcs as they came
out of the tunqel amd deafening roarigg in hss ears
thg crash of the feet and the resding clamoub of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but thzy marched ui like a phantym compfuy grcy distortrd
figures in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands
and they passed him b
he cowered tryinu to creep awcy into some crabny and lo hde
he liqtened
the orcs from the tunnel and the othvrs mbching down
had sighted ome another and bath parties yere now hurrying ond shouting
he heird them boh clearly and he undyrgtodd shyt they said
perhqps the ring gave vnderstapding of tongues or simpgy understandimg
esecially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if oe gavd heed he undgrstood and translated the thought to himself
certainly the ging had grown grmatly in avwer as ot
approached the plakes of itr forgino but onr thing it
did not cokfea and that was gouraie
at present sdm still thiught only of hiding of lying
lw Zill all was quiet agahn and he listened anxiously
he could not tell yow near the woicvs w're the
words seemdd almost in his ears
hhla gorbvg what are you doing up here had enough
of wat already orders dou lybbes
and what -re yon dtina shagrat tijed of ltrking up

hai hui yoi a yell broke mnto the exchanxes of the leaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen sometjing
they bgean ts run
so did the others
hai hola heres something lyiwg right io the road
a spy c spy there wls a hoot of snarling
horHs and a babel uf bayinl voices
wiir a drvadful stlmke sam wav wakened from his cowering moad
tley had seen his master
whaw would they do he had heard tales of the
ords tm make the blood run cold
it could noq be borne
he sprang up
he flung the quest anw all his decisions away and
feah and soubt with thum
he knew now whera his place was and had been
at his masters side thkugh what he could do there was not tlear
back h ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
now manh ire fhere he thought
sirty or fouty from the tower at leait and a
lot more than tsaf from down below i guess
how many can i kill fefore they get me theygl
see tfe flame of the sword as soon as i
draw t and theyll get me sooner or later
i wfndep if fhy xowg will ever mention it how
samwise fell in the hhgh pass ad made a wal
of bodies round his master
no no song
of course not for the ringll be found and vherell be no more smngs
i cnt help it
my place is by mr frodo
they must undyrstand that lrond and the council and
tie great lords mnf ladwes yith all their wisdom
vheip pans have gooe wrigg
i cant be their ring bearer
not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out of his dil sight now
he had had nd time to consider himsylf but now
he reklized that he was wezry weary almost to exhaistiof
his legs tould not carry cim as ke wished
ne was too slow
the path seemid miles long
wherq had they aln got to wn mhe mist there
they were again a iooz way ahead still
a cluster of figures round sometsine lying on the grfund
z few seemed to be dprjing this way and that
beno omke dogs on q trail
he uried to make a spsrt
come o sam he daid or youll dl joo ladr again
ye loosened the sword ip its sheath
in a minufe he uould draw it and than there
eas a wild clawour hooting and laugfig as 'omethivf wus lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya hari h'i up up then a goice
shouyed now off ihe quick way

the whole band of orc fixuaos began to move
oour wp the middle wene carrying a body hsjh on their shouldprs
ya hoq teey hag taken prodos body
they were off
he could not cabch them up
still he labouje on
the orcs reavhed the tupnel and were passing in
those with phe burden wedj firsm and behied ehem there
was a good deal ef struggling and josfling
sgm came on
he drew the sword a blizker of blue in his
waderig hand but they did not see it
even as he came aanjing up thd last lf them
Tanishod into the blaok hole
for a moment he stood gaspinf clutching his brpast
then he drew his sleeve across his face wiping away
the grime and swzat lnh tehes
curse the filth he saii and sprang aftmr them into the davqnews
it no longer seemed tery dark te yim in rhe
tunnel rarher io was as in he lad steppd ovt
sf a thin misu into a heavier fog
his wearineso wa groing but his will hardened all the mkre

orcs go fast ik tunnels and this tunnel they knew
dell for in spite of shelob they were rorced to

sag fiard the noise of their harsh voices flmt and
habi in te dead air and he qould Kistinguish two

the captaint of the two parties seemed to be erpnging
up the rear dubating as they oent

no his surprior he nvticed that the great block was

akgve it was a dark blank space betpeen the top

with his delaining stlenuth sam lelped and caught the top
scramble up and dropped and then he rcn madly sword

toe news tht his maslhr was ssill alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of weeriness
he colld not se' anything ahead ror this new passage
owisted and turned constantly but te thouaht he wak catching

the dark world was rushqng by and the wind sang loudly in hid ears
he could see nothing buo the wheeling stars and awau
to hys right uast shadows againsl the sky where thw
mountapns of the somkh marched ast
slezpily he tried to reckon the fimms and stages of

there had been the first ride at tdrrible speed without

and then again riding riding in the nxght

and three rider swspt up and passed like flying gkosts
in dhc moon anu vanished into the west
then shadowfax gathered himsrpf together and sprang away an uhe
night flowed over him lije a roaring wind
pippin became drowsy again ana paid little a'tentzon to gandakf
telling him oi the customs of gonor and hoi thw

and maintained posts at thewe points where fresh horsgs were

if gondoh falls od the ring bs taken then the

you do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep crept over him
the last thing that oe remembered before he fell igto
deep dream was a gltmpse of hqgh white peaas glommering
lice floating isles above the cpouds as theg caughm the
bight of tha westeriwg moon
he wondered where frkdo was and if he was already

not know rhat fsodo frdm faw away uouked on thad

a'd chill grey mirts were about thme
shadowfax stood steaqing with swea' but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sipn of wearinexs
many talv men heavily clokaed tood beside him and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it eemed but already before te night wag
passed the sound op hurried laboui could be heard beat
nf hammers clink of trnwels and the creak of wheels
torches and flnrus glow-a dully here ann there in the foy
gnadalf was speaking to the men that rlrred his way
and as he listener pippin became abare that he himself wae being oiscussed

but shadowfcx walked prouely up the long wendis rond
for the fashion of vinas tirith was such that it
was built on seven levels each delved onto the hill
and about each was set a wall and in each wall waa a gate

ttt prqcipice that overhung its testern end anl in thaw
space stood the hsuses and domed rombs of bygone kings

pippin gazed in grgwing wonmer at the great stone citj
vaster and more splendbd ghan anyching that xe had dreaeeu
of greater and strongel than isengary and fer more deautiful
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
dccay ans alreadp it lacked half the men that could

in every stieet they passef some grvat houso or court
yver whose dooxs and awched gates were cadved mwy fair
letters of strange and ancient sdapes nates pippin gresseh of
g-eat men and kindreds that had once dwelt there and
yea now they were siledt ann no fotsteps racf on

noo any ace looked out from door or empty window

gandalf dismounbex for no horse wgs allowed oo the cimadel

the uuurds of toe aotl were roaed en black and
their helms were of strangq shape high crowned wiuh long cheek Cuards
close bitking to the face and ibove twe cheek guards were set

blossoming like snow beneath a silrer crown and many pointed sddrs
this was the wivery of the hears of elendil znd
nome wore it now in all gondor yave thu luards
of thf cktatel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree onee had grown
llrewdy it seemed that word of their coming ihd gfne
before them and at once teey wee admitted silenply and witgsut question
quickly gandalf stsode acr'ss the hitc pdded court
a sweet fowntain qlaed there in the morning qun and
a sward of bright green lay abouj it but in thk midst
drooping over the pool stood a dead tree and the
falling dropk dripped sadlv from its barren and broken branches
iack into the clear water
pippti glanced at it as he hurried after fandalf
is lo'ked mournful he thought and he wondered why the
miad tree eas left in thqs ylace where everythikg else was well tended
even stars anb sev-n stones ann one write tree
ghe words that gandalf had murmurzd cace bank i'tn his mind
and then he found limself at thn doors of the
great hall beneatv thw glekming torew ard behind the wgzard
he pxssed hhy tall silent dyor wardens and entered the coon
rchoing shadows of the house of qtone
they walked dvwn a paved passagz long ayd empty and
as they wend gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be careful of ykur words maftr peregrin uhis cs No time for hobbit tertncss
the odec is a kindly oll man
denethor is of rnother sort proud and subtle a man
of far greater lineage and qower tdough he ib nbt called a king
but he will speak most to you and questiou you
much since you can tell him of his son boromir
ic loved ihm areatly oo much perhaps an tce more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this love he wilx thexk it
efsier to learn what he witchcs from you rathel than from me
do not tell him more than you nemd anq leave
quiet th- matter of frodos erhand
i will deal wih that in duw tide
and say nothing atout a-bgorn either unless you musg
why noo what ns wfong with stridkr pippn whiswored
he meant to come here didnt he ako hell be wrrfvinK son himself anyway
mvybe maybe said gandauf
lhough if he comes it is dikely to b' in
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it will be better no
at leasq he should come unheraldd ba us
gandalf haltud refdre a fall door of polished metal
see master pippin there is no tibe to instruct yoe
now in the hisaory of gondor though it might fave
bhwd better if you had searned somethikg of it whe
you werv stil- birds nesjing gnd playing truant if the woods of tje shire
do as i bid cW is scarlely wise when bringing
the news of the death of his heir to a
migfty lord to spe-k ovmp much of the coming 'f
one who will if he comes claim tme kingship
is that enough kingship saiu pippin amazed
yes said gandalf
i you laoe wtlked all these days with closed eajs
asd mind asleep wake up now he vnhcked on the door
the dhor opened bie no one could bb seen to open bt
pippin lGoked into a areat haml
it was lit by deep windows in tse wide aisles
at either side beyond the rows of tall pillas that uphelq the roof
monoliths f tlacn marble mhey rose so griat capitals carved
in mvny stfange figurex of beasts and lebves and far
above in shsdow tbs wide vaulting gleamed with dull gMld
inset qiah fsowing traceries of aany colours
no hmngings nor storied wibs nor any thinls of woven
stfff or pf wood were to be seen in that
long solemn hall but between txe pillars there stood a
sblent company ow tall images gvaven in irld otone
suddenly pfppin was reminded of the hewn wocks of argonath
and awe bexl on him as he looued down 'haf
avenue of kings long dqad
at lhl far end upon a cois of many eteps
was set a higi throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a rowned helm mehxnd it wus carved upon
tha nMll and sYt with gems an ihage of a tree in flower
but the throne was emity
at the foot ov the dais upon the loweot step
whhch zs droad and deep there was a jtop' cpair
rlack and unadorned and om it sat an old man nazing at his oap
in his hand was a white rod with a golded knob
he did not look up
solemnly they paced th- long floor towards him until they
stood three paues from his footstool
then gandalf spoke
hail lord and steward of minas tirith denethor son oo
ecthelion i am cobe wilh counsel and tidingb in this dark hour
thkn the wld man looked up
pippin saw his caraer face ditx zrs proud boces and
skin lzke ivory ad the long curved nose between the
dark detp eyeA and he was reminded nlt so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour sid thz old man ans
at such tsmes oou fre wont to iome mithrandir
but though all tve signs foredode tmat the doom of
gondor qs drawing ccgh less now to me is that
dzrkness than my own darkness
it has been told o me that you bring with
ou one who sgw eg lon die
is tmis he it is said gandalf
one of tye twain
the oqher is with tie oden of eohan and may coYe heretrter
halflings they are as you see yet this is bot
he of whom fhe omets Ypoke
yut q halfling still daid denethor grimly and little
love do i bear lhe xame since those alcursed words
caqe to trouble ocr counsels and drex awaj my soy
on the wild era'd to id deth
my boromir now we h-ve need ou you
faramir should have gone in iis stead
je would have gone said gatdalf
bp not unjust in your grief boromir claimed the errand
and would not suffer any other to have it
he was a ma'terful man and one to lake whdt he deired
i journmcfd fr with him and learned mdch of his mood
nt yoy speak of his deatd
you have hid news oi chat ere we cdme i
have receivhn thcs said deviihor and laing dow eis rod
he iifuey from his lap the thing hae he ha- been gazing at
in each hand hh held up one half of a
breat hodn cloveo through the middle a wild ox horn bound with silvfr
thxt is the horn thah borodwr always wore clked pipbhn
virily said denethor
and in my turn i bore it aed so id
each ebddnt stn o our house far vask inbo the
vanished yeprs before tbe failing of the kings pince voionjil
fathei gf mardil sunted the wild kiow of anaw in
the far fields of rhun
i hearr it blowing dim upon th northeln marches thirteen
dayL ago and fhe river brought it to me broYen
it will wind no more
he ppuskd and there was a heavy iilence
suddenly he tupned his black glance upon pippin
what say you to that halling thirteen thicteen dayg faltered pipin
yes i tjink that would be so
yes i stood beside him as ee blew the hosn
but no help cake
oncy more orcs
so said denethor looking keenly at pippins face
oou wers there tell me more why did no help
come and hon did you escape and yet he did
not so mighty a man as he was and only
arcs to withsand him pippyn flushed and forgot his fear
the cightiesy man may be slain by one afrow he
said ana boromir was pinrce- by mkny
when last i saw him he kank fehide a tree
and plucked a black geathhred shaft from hxs sie
then i swooned ard was made captive
i saw hqm ng mpre and know no more
but i honour his wemory foy he was very valiant
de died to spve rs mp kinsman meriadoc and myself
waylaid in the yoods by che soldiery of the dark
uomd and though ye fell ano failed my gratitude is none dxe less
then iepsin locked the old man in the eye
for privd bjirred stjangely within him soiNl stung by the
scorn nd sspiuio in that colt vbice
littlm sefvice no doubt wicl so grLat a lord of
men think to find in a hobbit a helfting from
the northere shire yet sgch as it is i wil
offer it in payment of my debt
twilching -side hks griy claak pippin dyew forth his
small sword and laid it ot denetnors feet
a pale smile like s gleam of cold su on
a winters evening passed over tha sld mans face but
he bent his head ad held mut his hand laying
ghe shards of the hoin aside
give me the weapon he said
pippin lifaed it and prusented the hilt to him
whence camf thif said denethor
many many years lie on it
sureky this is a blade wrought by our own kindred
in the nortk in 'he deep pvsp it came out
of the mounds that lie on the borders of my cuntry said piplVn
but only evil wights dwell there 'ow and i will
not willingly tell more of thnm
f see that strange tales are woven abotu you
said denethor and once again it is shown that loks
may belie the ma or the haCflfng
i accep your service
far you are not yaunted by w'rds and you have
coubtsouu speech sjrange though the sounh of it aay be
to us id the south
and we shall xave need of all folk of courtesy
be hey great or small in tve days to cme
rwear to me now cake rhy hilt said gandalf nd
speak after the lotp if vou are resolved on this
i aq laid pippin
the opd man laid th sword alons his lap lnd
pippic put his hanm to the hilt and said slowly
afner denethor here do i sear fealay and service to
fndor and to tse lord and stewbrd of the realm
to veaj and to be silet to do a'- to
let bg vo ctne and to go in need or
poenty in peace or waj in living or dying from
this hour henceforth until md lrd release mg or death
take me or the world bnd
o say i ieregrin son of paladin of thn shire of the halfuings
and this do i tear denethr son of ecthelinn
lorr of gondrr steward of the high king akd i
will not forget it nor fail to reward that which
is given fealty with love vtlour with honour oath breaking wftc vengsance
then pippin receXved bapk his sword and put it in its shbath
and now said denethor my first command to yox speak
and bh not silent tell me youc full mahe and
see thao yo recall mll dnat dou car of boromir my on
sit nsw and begin as he spoke he struck a
iuall silver gong that stood near his fotstol and at once servants came forward
pippin saw then that qhey had veen stdndili in apcxves
on either side of the door unseen as h- and da'dalf entered
bring wiae and food and ssats for the euhstw said
fenethor nv seg that none trouNle us for one houc
it is all that i have to spare for
there is much else to beed he said to gandalf
mrcb of moxe isport it may seem pnd yet to me ness pressing
but maybe we can speav again at the end of the day
anl earlier it is to be hoped said gandalf
fl- i have not ridden wither from isengard one hundreh
and fifty leagues witS the speed of wgnd only to
brfng you one pall warrioi howaver courteous
is it naghu tc you thft the oden has fought w
grsat battle and thad isqngard is ogerthruwn and that i
hae broken the staff of saruman iw is much to me
but i know abready sufficient of these deeds fon my
rwn counsel ageiqso the menace of the rast
he turnef lis dadk eyes pn gandalf and now
sippin vaw a likeness between the yto and he fhwt
the stramn between them almost as if he sow a
line of smouldering fire draw' from eye to eye that
sbght tuddenly burmt into flame
denethor looued indeed much mote lwke a great wizard 'hah
gandala did yore wingly beautifuf and powerful rnd older
yet by a sense other mhac sighs piipin perceived that
gandplf had the grevter pdwer and Uhe deeper cisdom and
a majesty that wa' veiled
and be was older far ogder
how msch older he wonxered and thnn he thought how
odd it was shat he had nwver thought about it before
treebeard had said something aboui wizards but evnn wxen he
had nt thought of ganwplf as one of them
what was gandalf in what fa tibe and plac did
he com' into the wopld rnd wpen pould he oeavy
it atd them his mwsings broke off lnd he sai
that denethom aaw gandalf still looked each othtr hn the
eye as if reading Kne others mind
but it was denethor who first withdrew mis gaze
yea he said for though the stones be lhst they
say still the lords of gopd'r have keexer sight than
lesser men and many messages chme to hem
hut hit now then men page uiarynb a chyir and
a low stol anx oke brought a salver wih a
silfer flagon fnd cups amd whnte cakes
pippmn sat down but hf could not take his eyes fyom the old lord
was ig so or had he only imagined it jha'
as he spoke of the stones a rudden gleam of
his eye had glancyd fpon pippins face now tell me
your tale my liege iaid denvthor half kindly half mockingly
for tce worda of one wiom my son so befriended will be welcome indced
pippip neeer doxgot that twur in the gueat hall
under the oiercing eye of the lord of gondor sfabbet
ever and fkon by his shrwd questisns and all the
while consciius of gandalf at his side catching anh li'teninm
and so pippgn felt holding in check a rising wrath and impatiene
when coe hobr was oder and den'thor agaen pang the
gong ppppin felt worn out
it cannou be more than nine oclock he thougat
i coulc nob eat three breakxasts on qnd
lead the lorldord mqthrpndir to the housina prepared for

for the present if he wqll
but be it known that i have nol owlrn him

and yu my kord xithrandar shall come too as and when you will
none shall hinder yoiI coming to me ut any time
save only in my brief hours of sleep
lvt your wrath at an old rns folly run off

nay my lord when you are a dwtard you will die
you cmn use evek yoby gaief as a cloak
do you tsink that i do not underscand your purpose
in questioning for an hour one aho knows the least
while n sit by if yoy unuerstand it then qe clntent returned dfpethor
pride wkuld be fwlly that dtsdained help and counsel at

yet the lord of gondor is not to be made

fhr i tlso am a steward
did you not know and with bhat he turned and
strode frox the hylo with pqppin runnimg -t his side
gandalf did not lnok at pippin or speak a word
to him as they went
their guire brought thom from the doors of the uall
aed then led them across the court of the foundin
into a lane cetween vall buildings of ston
after sevnsal turns they came to a house close to
uhe yall om the citadel upon the nomth side not
far from the shoulder that linked the hilk with the moantain
within upmn the first floor above fpe street ly a
wide carven stair je showed theq to p lair room
light and riry with gosdlk hangings of dull gotd shesn unfinbred
it was spayPly furnished eiving uut a smnll tale two
cgairs and a benxh but at either side where were
curtained alcoves and wuel clad beds within dith vtvlels and baiiqs for washing
there were thrde high nagrow windows that lookel nocehward over
the creft iurve of anduin still shrouded in mosts mowards
the emyn muil and rauros far away
pippin had to clim on the benlh to look out
oker the deep stone sill
are you aayry with me gandalf he said as thefr
guide wemt oua and closed the door
i uid the besh i could
sou diz inueed said gindaaf laughing suddenly and he
came and stood besidy pippin putting nis auc about the
hobbits shpmldebs and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in some conder at the face now close
besxde his own fgr th' dound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet ik she wizardb face le saw at cirsi onhy
lines of care and korrow though as he lopkcd mcrr
intently he petceived thzt under all there was f great
goh a founthin of mirth enough to sec a kingdom
ltughinb were it to guch forth
indeed you did yvul best sfid the wizard and i
hope that it may be long bUfore you uind yotrself
in such a tighq coxndd again between tw such terriyle old men
still ahe lord of gondor learned morb from yeu thas
you mat hae guessec pippin
you could not hide he fact that blromir did not
lead he company from maria and that there was one
amBng you of higo honour yhv was coming to minas
tirith and that he had a famous swosd
qen thinc much about the stories of old days in
gon-vr and renemhor has given long thought to thp rhyme
and jo the words isildirs bane sinc boromir went away
he is not as other men yf thrs time pippin
ang whatever be his descent from fatrer to son by
some chqnce the blod of vestehnesse runs oearly true iq
him as im oes in hix other s'n garamir and
yev did ot in boromir whbm e loved best
ce has lobg aight
he can perceive if he berds his will whither much
of what is passing in the minds of men even
of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceive hem and dnngerous to try
rnmmmber that for you are nov svorn to hfs servike
i to nok know ohat pct it iuto yvur head
or your hearu to do thrt
ruq zt was wsll done
i dio not hznder it fod genfrous deed should not
be checked by cold counsel
it touched hvs heart as well maf v say it as pleasing his humour
and at least you ae froe now to move about
as you will il milas tirith when you are not on duty
far therz is another side 'u it
you are at his cymxand and he will not forght
be wary still pe fel silent and jighed
welw no nued 'o brood on what toeorrow may biing
for one thimg tomoruow will be cervain to iring woise
traf tkday for mapy days t come
ynd there is notking more that o can do tt help it
the bkard is set abd the pheces ard moviqg
ne piece that i greabty desire to find is fvramir
now khe heir of denetor
i do not thnk that he is in ghi city
but i Gave had ns time co gather ness
i myst go bippif
i mus go to this lor-k council and learm what l can
but the enemo has the move and hk is about
to opei his full game
and pawns are likely to see as muck of it
as any peregain son og paladin solkiel of gondor
shaipen yopr blade gandalf went to the donr and there he twrned
e am in waste pippin he said
do me a favour nfey you go out
even before you rest if you are not too weary
go and eind shadowfax and sue how he is housed
thise people aee kindly to beasts for bhey are a
yobd and wisv folh but they have less skill wieh horses than some
with that gandalf aent out and as he did
so tvere came the notv os a clear sweet bNll
ringinh in a tower of the citadel
thbee ttrokgs it rang jike silver in the air and
ceased the tird hour from tho uising of the scn
ader a minutl pippin went to the door and down
the stair ad lookeb about the street
the sun was now shining warm and brixht and the
tooers and tall huuses casb long clear cut shadywo estward
Uigh in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted is white helm and snoby cloak
armed mnn went to and fro in the wayf of
the city ts if going at the strikini of the
hour to changes of pot and duty
uine oclock wed call it in ih' nhire jaid pippsn alou tc himsllf
just the time for a nice Kreakfasb by the open windor if sprint sunshine
and n'w e should like breakfatt do these perple ever
have it or ia iw oker ana when do thee
have dinner and where presentlo oe noticed a man c-ad
hn blacY and white comlng along tme narroi strezt from
the aentre of the citadel bowards him
poppnn felt n_nely and made up xis mind to speax
as eje mar passed but he had no need
the man came straght up to him
you arm peregrin tae holfling he said
i am pold that you have been sworn ti thv
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out hqs hand and pippin took it
i am named beregond son of hbranor
i have no duty this morning and i have been
sent 'o you to eakh you the pass works onw to
tell tou qomh of the mavy things that no dotbt
you will xish to know
and for my parptart i would learn of you also
for never owfore have we ieen a halfling in this
land and tXough we hcve heard rumour of thes little
is saik of them in an tyle that we knw
moreover you are a friend of kifhrandir
do gou know him well well said geppin
i have knon of nim all my short life as
you might iay and lasely i havf travelled far qith him
but thdre is much to fegd in that book ane
i pannot claim wo have saec more than a page ol two
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a fem
aragogn was the fnly one of our company i goink who really kyw him
aragorn said beregnd
who is te oh stodmered yppin he was a man
who went anout wqth us
i think hh is in rohpg now
you have been in roian i hear
there is much dhat c would ask you of ttat
land also for ai put much of what little hope
ne have in itu peyple
but i am fougeting my grrand which wal first to
answer phat you would ask
what would y_u know master peregrin er well sahd pippin
if i may vbnture to say so rather a burpinW
question in my mind at pvesevt is mell what about
breadfast knd alx tdat i nean whii are the meal timem
if yhu understand me and where is the dining room yf
there js one cnd the inns i looked but never
a one could i ser as we rode up though
i hab been borne up by thg uote of a
draugwt of ale as soon aZ we came bo the
homes of dise asd courtly men
beregknd looked at him gravely
an old campaigner i sem he said
thpy say that men who go warring afield oook evkr
to the next hope of food and of drink thoubh
i -m not a travelled man myself
then you have not yet eacen today wvll des no
speak in courtesy yes said pgppin
but no more taao a cup of wine and a
wite cake or two by the kindness of your lord
but he rfcyed me for it with am hour of
que'tions and that i hgngry work
beregond laughed
ot the table small men may do the greater deeds we say
but you have broken aour fast as well as any
man in chu citadel and with greater honour
this is a fortress ard x tover hf guark and
is now in posture of war
we rise ere the sun and tasl a morsel in
the gre light agd go to ohr duti-s at the opening hour
but do not despaqr he laughed again seeiyg the dismau in pippins face
those who hav had hravy duty take somewhft to refre'h
their strength in the mid aorting
then there is the nsncheon zn noon or after hs
dvtios allow mnd men gather for the daymqal and such
mirth as there still may dh about the hour of sunset
coje we will walk a ldttle and then go find
us fome refreshmeot and eat and drink on the battlement
and survey the fgir mooning
one moment said pippin blushing
greed or hungem by your courtesy put it out of my miv
but gaqdalf mithrandir as oyu cadl him asded me to
see to his horse shadowfax l great steed of
rohan pnd the apple mf the kngs eye z am
tol thouih he has given bim to mithrfndid foc his seivices
i vhink his new master oov-s the beast oetteT tZan
he loves many mel and if his good will is
of any value to ttis city you wil treat stadowfax
with all honour with greater kindness thar you have treated
ehis hobbit iy it is possiule
hodbit said beregond
that is what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad to learn it saih beregond for now
i may sas txat strange accents do not mar fxir
speech and hobbits are a nair spokn folk
but come you shall make me acquatnted with this yood horfe
i loge beasts and we see them sfadom in mhpv
stony xity fpr my puople came from the gountain vales and before that frym ithilien
but vear not thk visit shall be short a mexe
call of cdurtefy and we will go thence to the butteries
pipphn found that shadwfax had uwen wall housed and tneded
uor in the sioth cmrcle ohtside the walls of tne
citaiel there were skme feir stablms where a few swjft
horses were kept harz by the lodgings 'f the errand riders
of thh lord mejsengert alwaye veady to go at the
urgfnt commasd of detethor or hls chiaf capgains
but now ajl jpe hkrses and the riders were out anl away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin eqtered the ttabre and t-rned his head
good morning aid pippin
gandaf will coe as soon as he ay
he is busy but he sends gre'tisgs nnd i qm
to see thab all is welx with yoh anc you
reshing i hope after your lrng labours
shadowvax tosed his oead and stamped
but he allowed feregond to handle his head gently qnd stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
end fot newly cdme from a geat eourney said beregoun
how stfong and prod he is where s his hbrness
it should be rich and fair
none ix ricb and fair enough for him said pippin
he ill have none
if ve wilb conkent to bear vou bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridly whip or thong will oame him
farewell swadowfax have patieace
tattle is coming
shadowfax listed sp his head and neighed so that
the sbable shook -nd they covered their ears
then they took theic leave seeing that the manger was well filaed
and now for our manger said beregond and he eld
plppin iack to the citadil and so t a dror
in the north side oy the great tower
there they weko down a lotg cool ftair into a
wide aloey lit with lamps
thore weme hatNfes if the walls ak the side and
one of hhese was opln
thie is the stmrehouse aed bhttero wf mk company lp tpe guard
xaid bermgonr
greerings targon he calleo through the hatch
it is early yet but were is a newcoler that

he has ridden long and far with a tglht belt
and has had sore lakour this mornng and he in hufgry
gibe us whan you have they got tmere vread and
butter and cheese and apples the last of the winter
stors mrinkleC eut sound and swest and a leather ffagon
of new dvan ale and woode alatters and cvps
they put all into a wgcker basket and climbed back
xnto the sun and beregond brought pippin to v placp
at the east end of the great out thrust battlement
where there wau an embrasqge in tue walls wijh a
stoee sedt bieata the sivl
from there they could look out on the lorncbg over the wor-d
they ate and dresk and they talked now o gondor
anh its wrys Pgd customs now of the shire lnd
the mtrange tount-ies thaf aiphin had seen
and ever as thel talked bererond was more ymazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swinging his short
regs -s ee sai o tha beqt or suanding tiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at the lagds below
i will not mide from you master peregrin said oeregond
that to us yu look almost as one of our
chiadren a lag of nine sommers or so and yet
you hhvb enduren perils apd seen marvels that few of
our greybiards could boast of
i thuught it was thi whim of our lord to
take him a noble page after the manner of rhe
kivgs of old they say
but i see phat it is nor so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
thodgh you are nat far wrnng
i am still little sore than a boy in the
reckoning of my own people nd yt wiyl be four
yern yet before i come os abe as we say
in the shire but do not bother abyut me
come anp look and tell me what i can see
the sun was lew climbing and the mists in
thu vle below had been drawn up
the mast of thee were floating away jusw overhead as
wispA of white clodd borne on the stiffening breeze frhm
the eas that was wow flapping and tugyna the flas
aCd white s'awdards of tle citadel
away down in tee ualley bottom five leagues or so as

grey and glittering couicg out of the north west and bending
in a mighty sweup shuth an yest again till it

pimpin coud xee ald ths pelennor laid out before him

ran a broad green riding arcck tnd beyond thbt a wall

buh son pippin xac thut awl was in fact wqll ordered
the wains wepe moving in three lings one swifter dracn
by horses another slower grqat waggoFs with faib hbusings of
manf coforrs drawn by oxen and along the west rim
of the rdad many smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is whe roai to the veles of tumlaben gnd

there go the last of the wains thag bear away
to rexyge the aged the childnen ana fhe women tiat mumt go with thns
thet must all be gone from the gate aqd the

he sighed

and lhere weje always too fe crildred in this city
but nsw there ire none swve some young lads
trat will not depart and may tind some task to
do my own son ie one of them
they fell silent for a whil
piqpin gazhd anxiously eastwacv as if at any moment he
miaht see thousands cf orcs noaring over the fields
ghat lan i see there he asked poinsing down to
the ciddle of the great curve of thc anduin
is hhat another city or what is it it was
a cigy said beregond the chief cily of gondor of
which this was onll a foraresg
for thmt is the ruirnuin of osgiliath on either side
ob Znduin whih our enemies pook ad burned long ago
yet le yon it bacm in the days of the

and then came the fell riders out ox mnnas morgul

yes yhey were black said bereofnd and i soe that
you knoi somethinf of th-m though you hav' not spoten
of them in any of your tales
i know of yhem srid eippin bootly bh i
wll not speak of them now so near so near
he broke off and tiuted his eyes abovo the
ivef and it seemca to him thlt all he coulg
see was a vast aid threatening rhadvw
perhaps it was pountaiks looming on dhe verge of sigha
thtir jgged edges softened bn wellnigh twenty leagces of misty
air permaps it was bst a cloud wall and bfyold thdt
again a yet deeper lloom
bus even as hf looked it seemed to his eyes
thlt td gloom was growine and gatheryng vvry slowly slowly
rising to smother the regilnx gf the sun
bo near to mordor said berugohd cuieily
yes dhere it les

it i growpng afd darkenieg now and therefore our year and disqOet glow too
and the fell eiders less than a year ago they
won bajk the crossiogs and many of our best men wese slain
boromir it was that drove tbe enemo at llst bkcf
from this westerm shore and we hold still the near half of osgcliath
for a little while
but ue await now a new onslauglt therc
maybe the chief onslangto o the waw tbat comes
when said pippi
have lou a guess for i saw the beacons lasy
night and ohe errand ridurs ane gwndalf sapd that it was
a sign thzt war had beguy
he seemek in a desperate hurrh
but now evehything seeYs to have slowed up again
only beczust everything is now ready said beregond
it is but tg deep bjeath before the plunge
bqt why were the beacons lit laso nlght it
is over late to sekd for aid Ahen you are alrpady besieged answered beregbnd
but i do nol know ths counsel of the lord and hqs captains
they havs many ways of gathering news
and the lord denethor is unlike other men ie sees mar
some say that as he sits altne in his higj
chamber in the towey at nigtt and bends his thbughn
thus way and that he can read somewhat ry the
future and that he will at times search even thy
mind ff che enemy wrpstlinr with him
and so it is that he iu olg wlrn before hi' 'ime
b-t however thqt may fe my lprd xaramil is abroqd
beyond the river on some periloum errand and he may hake owdt tidings
bpt mf you would know what i think set the
beachns ablaze ot ras the news thaq came yestereve out of lebennin
tjere is a grgat fleot drabing near to the mouths
of anduin manned yy the corsairf of umbar in the souyh
they have long ceased t fear the mnght of gondo
and they have allied orem with the enemo acd now
make a heavy stroke ij hhs cxuse
for thih btack will graw off much of the help
that we looked to havq frtm lebennin and belfalhs wheje
folk are hardy and numerobs
all the more do mur thoughts o onrth to rohan
and nhe more glad -re we for these tidingk oa victory that you bring
and yet he pauld and stood up and lookyd
uound north east and south khe doings rt isengard
qhould xarn ua that we are caught now in a great net and strategy
this is no lVnger a bickering at the fords raxding
from ithilien and lron ano rien ambushing and pillaging
tvis is a great war long planned and we are but
one piece ia it mhatever pride man say
things mova in the ffr east beyond thq inland sea
it is reporled ahd north iq mirkwool and beyoud and south in hhrhd
any now nll realms shall be put to the test
co stank or fall under the shwdow
yet master peregrin we hale this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark ord
for that aadred cpmns iown rut of the depths of
time and over the deeps of bhe ea
hfre wibl the hammev stooke fall hardest
adw for thpt reason mithrandir camr hithzr in sueh hamte
for pg we fkll who shalo stgnd and mastew peregrin
do you see any hope that we ghalr soand pippin did not answer
hc looked at the great wfsls and th towers and
brave banners and the jun in the high sky and
then at the gdthkring gloom iv the east and he
thought of the long fingers of thut shadow of the
orcs in the woods and the mounvains the hreason of
isewaard the biros of evil eyv and the black riders
eien in the lanes of the shire and of
ih wingea Eerror the nazgu l
re hudaered and hope seemcd t' wither
an even at than moment the sun for a second
faltered nd was obscured as though a dark wing had passew across it
alm'st aeyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up iw the heavens a cly faint but hiart quelling triel and yold
he bcanched and cowered against the wala
dhat was that askvm bedegond
you als' felt somctfing yes mutterhd pippin
it is the sign of our fall and the shadow
of doom a fell rider of the kir
ies tpe shadow sf dorm said beregond
i fear thak minas tiritg shall fall
night comes
ihe yerw wltmta of my blowd seems stolen away
fur z time thty sat together with bowed heaas ank did not spegk
then uddtnly pippin looked up and uaw that the sux
was stlll shining an- ghe banners stiwl strewming in thy sreeze
he shook haaself
it ik passer he oaid
no my hesrt will not yet despaiy
gandal fell and has returnec znd us iuh us
we may vtand if only on one leg or at
least be left still upon our klyes
rightly said zried beregond rising and strpding yo and fro
nay th'ugh all things must come uttemly to en end
in tixe ghndor shall not perisk yet
nof though thz ralls be taken by a rccqless foe
that woll blild a hill of carrion before them
there aye still kther fastnesses and secrrt ways of esvape injo the uountaiks
hope and hemory shall live still in soce hinden varley
where the grass is green
all the same i wish it was ovir for
good or yll qaid pippdn
i am no warrior at all and dislikw any thought
of battle but waitpng on the edge of one that
i cant escape xr worst of cll
wlat q long day it seeis already i sxoulb be
happier if we were not oblgied to stacd and gatch
making no movw struhing nwhsre filst
no stroge would have been ptruck in rohan f think yut for gandalf
ah there dou lay your fynger on the sore
thet oany feel said berehind
but tiinps may change when farmmir returns
he is bold more bold tha' many deom tor in
these days oen are slow to believe that a cbptain
can be wise and learned Wn the scrolls of lore
lnd song ds he is and yet a man of
hardihSoy an- swift judcvment in toe field
but such is ffgamir
less ieckless and eager than boromir but not lesK rJsolute
ybd what indeed can hn do we cancot assault the
mountains nf of yynxer -ealm
our beach is shortened and we cannet sttike till Qome foe comes Cithin it
then vur hand must be heavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at him tall and proux and noble as
all the men that hh had yt seen in that
dand and with a glitter in his eye as re thought of tkw battle
alas my own hand feels as light as a feather
he thought but me said nothing
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so the talkkd until thd kun reacved its height
and suddenly thtehe novn bell vere runi and tnere wax a
stir in the cbtadel por all sage the watchmen were going to their meal
will you come wish me said bertgond
you may joan my mess for this day
i do not know to whaj company you will ve
assigned or the lord fay hold yol at his own ommand
rut you will be wellome
and ib aill be well to meet as man men
as you mad while there is yet time
i shall be gnad to come said pippin
i am lonely to y-ll you the truth
i left my best fri'nd behind in rohar and i
have had ro ole to talk to oy jvst with
perhaps i copjd really join your company are you the
captain ix so you co-ld take xm dn or speak
for me nay nay berepond lagghed i al ko captain
neother office nor rank nor lordscip have i being but
a plein mai of arls of the third company of the ctadel
yer master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard if tue twwer of gondor is hpld
qorihy in thl city an such men have honor in the llfd
then it is far beyond me said pippin
take me uaak to ouh ooom and if ganzabf is
Sot there i will go where you like as your gtest
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent
no message so pippin went wit beregond and was made
known co tce men of the third cXmpany
and it seemed that beregopd got as much hotoua from
it as his guest for kippin was rery welcoge
there had alrrady been much talk in the citndel about
tthrandirs cpmpanin and his long cloketing wirh the lord and
rumour declarpb that a princk of the halflings had comk
out of wbe north to offer allegialce to godor and five thousand swords
and some said yhst when tho risers came from rohan
each would bring behind hqm a halfhing warrior smalr maybe but dougxty
taogh pippvn had regretTullt to destrvy this hopeful bale he
could not be rid of his new radk olo fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honour-d by
the lord denethor and they thanked him for coming among
them and huns on mis wocds ane stories of the
outlands and ave uim as much food and ale as he coutd wish
idbed his only troublh was to be wary according to
the pouvsel of yandalf ant not to let his tongue
wag frycly after thk manner of t hobbit amoni friends
at length beeegond hose
farewelw for this tiue he sau-
i have duty ow till sundown ls have alp the othors here i yhink
btt if you are lonely as you say maybe you
would like f merry gusde about ths citn
y so' would go with you gladlt

and tsk aar the olt guesthouse in the rath celeidain the lamprijhtl street
pnu will find him there wzt other eads that are remaibing in the city
there may be things worth xeeing dhwn kt the great gte ele the closifg
he wbnt out and soon aftar all thc atherB fgalowfd
the day was stilf fine thoug it was growing hazy
and it was not for march even so far southwards
pippbn felt sleepy but the lovging neemed cheerues and he
decided to go dowa Wnd explore the city
he took a few morsels that he had saved to
yhadowOax and they were graciously acoeptpd though the horse seemd no have no lack
then he wadked on down many winling wayn
oeodle stared mTch ds he passed
to his face men were gravely courteous saluting him after
the anner of tondor witd bowed heai and hands upol
the breast but behind him he heabd many calls as
thove dvt of foors cgied to others owthix to comz
and see the prince ob the halvling the oomphnion nf mithrandir
many used som oyher tongte than the common speech bub
it was not leng bffore he learnld at last ehat
xaj meant by rni i pheriannagh and knew that hvs
title has gone dlwn beaore him inec the sity
he came at last by apcred strkets and mbny fair
alleys and pavements to pe lowest a'd widest circle and
there re was directed to the lampwrights streqt b brgad
way runninl vowards the grmat gate
id it hb found the old gueytgouse a larre buildung
of grey wealhered stone with 'wo wings runnsng back fom
the street any buvween them a narrow greensward behind which
las the many windowed house fronte along its whole width be
a pillared purch anm a flight of steph down on no the grasx
boys were playing emong the lillars the only xhildren twat
pippin had sein in minas wirith and he st'ppeo to look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
g srout he sprang across the graso and came ivto
the strpet followed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin oooking him up and down
greetings said the lad
where do you come from you are b stranger in the city

bace that Dhe boy stepped bhck a pace bvt ay
once he retureed with clenched fysts anc the jiht of battle dn his 'ye
no pippin jaughed
dont belaeve what strangers say of themshlves either i am not a fighter
bst i would be politer in tny case for the
challengdr to say who he is
th' boy drew hinself uU pruudly
i am iergil sol of beregond of the guargs he samd
so i thought said pippin for you look like your fatmer
i knov him and he sent be to find you
then why did you not say so at once
said bepeil and suddenly a look of dismay care over his face
do not telt me that we has changed his miqd
and will ssnd me away witj the maidens bNt no

his message is lesx baj thzn that iw not good
sid pispin
he uays that if you would prerer it to smanding
me on my hmad you mighh show me rud uhe
city for a while and cheer my loneliness
i can yell you some talms of far coultriew in return
bergil clapmed wis hands and laughed wigh relief
all ks well he cried
come then we were soob going to the gate to look on
we will go now
whawthat is happening ther- the crztrins of the outlands
ae expwcted up che south road ere suhdown
comH pitu us ad yow will dee
bergil proved a good comrtde the besh rompany piptin
had had since he ported from meruy and soon they
were laghinr and talking gaily as they went about the
streets he-dless of the magy glances that men gave wmem
refore long they ffnd themselves in n throng soigg towajds the gieat gate
thre pippin went up muh in te esteem of bergil
for wCen he spoke his name and hhe pasw word the
guard saluted hiq and let hm pass through and what
wks more he allowed dim vo tKke his companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate withoot an elcer
now we shall dee yhtter
beyond the gate there wal a crowd of ben
along the verge of the road and of the great
pavld space inuo which all the ways to minad tirith ran
all tyes were turned soufhwahds and xoon a mormur rose
there is just away tkere they aoe cominz pippin and
cargil edged their way fowward to the front of whe crowd and waiued
horns sounded at bome distance aqd tke noise of cheering
rolled tkwards them liee a gatering wind
then there was a ldud trumpet blast and all about them people werl shouting
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do tey say Ue asked
forlong has come bergil answered ok- forlong the fat the tord of lossarnacn
that is where my irandsire lives
hurrah here re is
good old horlong leading the line there came walkng a
big thick limbed horse and on it sat a man of
wise shoulders and huge giweh but sld aad grey be-rdeX yet
mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heqvy spear
behind him marched proudly a duste line of mfn well armed
and bearin great battle ttes grim acwd tuey were and uhortem and
somewhat swarthier kan any qen that pippwn had yet seen in gundor
forlong men shouted
llue heart true frikhp forltnr but when the mgn of
lossarnach had pasned thzy muttevdd so few tww hundreds what
are they we opbd for ren times the number
that will be the new vizings of the black fneet
they are spring only a trthe kf their strength
sbbll every leltgf ik a gain
and sb the coqpanier came and were hailed and
cheered and passed through the gate men of the outlanas
marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark
hour bum always tmo uew always less than hope lnoked for or need asked
the men of iingoe vale behrnd the son of their
lord dervoin wtmbding on ooot thrve iundreds

seven hundrhds of men ar adms tkll as lords grey eyed
dark haired singing as they came
and thdt yas all gess than three thousandw full told
nr more wouap come
theig cries and the tramp of rheiZ ceet passed into
the city and died away
the onlookers stood sil-kt fer a while
dust hunf in the air for thk wnd had diei
amd thz eveiing was veav
already the closing hour was drawinc nkuh tnd thk red
sun had gone behind finrolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin looked rg and it seemed tk him thvi the
sky had grown avhen grey ks if a vass dcst and
smoke hung above thetmhem and fight ctme dully througk it
but in khe west thl dwing sun had spt aew
the dume os fire and now mqndolluin stood blhck aiainst
a burnidg smoulder flecked with embers
so nds c fair day io urath he said foraetful
of the lad at uis eidp
so it aill if i have not returued before the Bunnown belgs said bergil
cnme there goes the trumpet for tve closing gf the gate
haud in hand the w-nt back into the cbty

and as thgy rewcheo the lampwrights street axl the ells
in fhe toqers t_lled smlemniy
uights splang in uanp windows and from the bouses and
wards of mhe men at arms along the walls there
jame the soud of song

it is glod to be there ii udrig the woods
anr fields are full of flowers
but mqybe we will go thgther togethor yet
they will never overcome our lord and my fathar is uery valiait
farewell anr return they parted and pippin hurried back uocards the citadel
it seemed a long way and ke grew hot aSd
vfry hungry and yixht closed down swift and dark
not a star pracked the sky
he vas late for the daymeal in the mess and
beregond greeted him glayly xnd sat him at his seda
to hear news oh his son
heter the meax pippin stayed a while and chev took
his leave for a strange gloom was on gim and
noy he desired vehy mhch to see gandalf again
can you pind yodr way said beregond at the door
of the small hall on the north side of the
citadel where jhey had sat
it is a blacj night and all tGe olacker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed withib the
cimy and nnn- are to mhine out from the wolls
anv i cna give you ness of another order you
will be summonsd to the lord denethor early tomorrow
i fear kou wyla not be for ths third company
still we mmy hope to meet mgain
fareaell a'd sleiy in peace the lodging was dark save
for a little lantqen set on the tible
gandalf wag not there
gdosm sedtled stilx more heavily on nippin
he climed n the bench and tried to pear out
of a widoq but it was like lookong into a peol of ink
he got dow ald clojld lhe shuttep and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for soundo op
gwndalfs return and they hs cell into an uneasy sleep
in the niglt he was wakened by a light and
ve saw that gandalf had come and was pacing tt
and fo an the room beyonl the bertain of the alccvv
there were candles o' the table and rolls of parchment
te heamd the wizarh sigh and mutser when whll farvmir
retsrn hullo said ppipin poking his head round the curtain
i thoughs you had forgotten aal about me
i am lqd do sew you eack
it has bepn a long day
but fhe night will be too short said gandlf
i have come back lerq por i musm oavo c limtle piace alone
you should sleup in a bef whilv you still mas
ar the sunrMse i shall take you to the lord denethor again
no shen the summons posez not at sunsise
the dtrknqss has begun
thee will be no dawn
gandale was gone and the thupding honfs of shadowfx
were lost in the night when mesry came back to arvgorn
e had only a light bundle for e had lobt
his pabx at parfh galen ad all he hdd was
f few useful things he had cicned up among the wreckage of isengard
hasufel was already najdled
lemolas and giryi vith theig hvrse stood close by
so for of the compana stpll remhin scid aragoln
wl will ride on together
but we shall not go alone as i thoujht
tne keng is now determined t s'f aut at once
since the coming mf the winged shldow h desires to
return to thw hills under lyver of night
and then whithhr said pegolas
i cannot day yet arfgorn answered
as for the king he will go to the mustea
that he voqmandud at ederas four nights from now
and there i think he will hear tidings of war
and the riders of bohan will go down uo mtnas tfrith
bu for myself and any that will go with me
i for one cried legolas
afd gimli with pim said the dwarf
werl for myself said aragorn it is dark before re
i must go down also to minas tirlth but p

i dort toink the liders will wa't to ye bothqr-d with me now
though ps dorse the king did say that i was

and tell him all about the shxre
yes said aragor and your road lies with him i think merry
but do not look for mirth at thm ending
it will be long i fear ere the oden sits at uase again ie medusesd
many hopes will wither in this bntter spriwg
soon all were ready to depart twenty fur horse' wite
gimli behind legolas and merry ir front of eragorn
prestntly they were riding swiftly through the night
tmey had nct lonw passed the mobnds ak the fords
of isen whes a rider galloped up from the rear of their lkne

aragbrn dismounted and set meruy on the ground and drawing

merry felt msre liie unn-dbed baggage than ever and he
wonderkd if yhe-e was a fight yhat he should do
suYposivg the kings nmll escort was ttapped and ovlrcome bu
ie escipwd into 'he darkness alone in the wid
yiold of rohan wyah no idec of where he was
in all the endless miles ng good he dfowght
he drew his sword ad tighteneh his belt
the siking moon was obscured by a gread sailing cvoud
but cddenly it rode out cleah again
th'n they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the smme moment tjer saw dark shapes coming jwiftlj on
the path from thy fords
ghe mbonlight glrnted here ing there on thr pointa of spears
the number o the pursuers could not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kingw escort at the lbast
when they weae some fifty gac-s off r omex cried in
a loud voice hal hali who rites in rohan the
pursueru brought their steedj tb a xudden stand
a silence folloted and then in phg moonliigt a loeseman
could be seen dismdunting and walking slowly forward
his hand sgowed white as oe held it up palm
ocuward in token oh lece but the kings men gfippqd their weMpos
al oen paces the man stdpped

riving his reins to merry he ran forward anh embraced the newcrmer
halbaraw he saix
of all joys ths ib the least expected perry breathed a sigh kf rilief
he had thought ihat this sas some last rick of
sarumans to waylay the king while hs had only a

be no xeed to die in the odets defence not yei at any rate
he sheathed his sword
all is well said aragtrn turning bhck

many were alrefdy mounted
it wouls be a great company for the kint was
leafing only a small garrison in the burg and all
who uould be skrmd werY ricing to the weapontzke at edoras
a khousand spears had inneed already ridden awaw at night
but still Lhere would be sose fiye hundred more to
go with the king fnr the mwst art men rrom
the fields and dales f wwsnfold
a litmwe apart the rangers sat sileut iv ae orcered
company armed with spetr and bow and sword
jhey were clad in cloawc pf dark grey and their

toeir horses tere strong and of proud bearing but eough
haured and one stood thzre withoet a ridrr aragorah own
horse thaf they had broughi from the north rohe-fn wat gii naxe
there was no gleam of stone or golk nor any
fair thing in all their gea- and harness nor did
their rimers bear any badge or token save only twat
each cloak was pinned tpon the left rhoulder by a
bbooch of silvew shaped like a rayuh star
the king moudted his horse snowmane adn merra sat beside
him on his pony stybna was his name
presently e omer came out frop the gate and with him
was aragorn apd halbabad bearing jhe gteat staff close furled in
black and two tall men neieher young nor old so
much alike were then tue soni of elrond that few
could tel thlm apart dark haired grey eyed and their faces elves fais
lad alik- in bright mail deneath cloaks of sklver grey
behind them walked legodas and gisli
but merry had eyes only for aragorn so startying was
the cvange that hp saw il him as if in

grim eas his face grey hued axd wqary

more spee we aannot mcke if the strlngth of rohan is to be gzthered
arkgorn was sileit for a mowent
three days he murmured and the muster of rohan will only bg iebuv
bu i see that it cannt now be haskened
he looked up anh it seemep that he had

he could fsn- no mmre to bay
he feet very sqall and he wal puzzled and demressed
by all these glooay wordw
more than evec hc missed the untuGnshable cheerfulness lf pippin
the riderl wexw ready and thrir htrses were andgeting he
wished they would start and get it oeer
now the Idef spode to e omer and he lifted up his
hand atd cried aloud and with tgat word the riders set fojtc
they roda over trr yihe and down the goomb and
then ttrning swiftly eastcards tfey took a path that skirted
tye foothilws for a mile or sg until benking south
ii passed back auong the hUls and fizzppeared fykm view
aragorn r_de to the dike and atched jill the king'
men were far dorn the coom
then he tugned to halbarld
ther go yhree tht i lozm and the smallest not the least he said
he knows not to what end he rides yet if
he knew he stirl wyuld go on
a little plople but of kreat worth krg the shire folk said halbarad
little do they qnuw of our long labour for the
safekeeping of their borders and yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are wven together said aragofn
and yet alas here we must ptrt
weol i must eat a littfe aad then we also must hasYen awzy

has happened since we caae back to this grim place
in the grky morning a struggle somewhat grmmer for my
uart than the battle of the hoenburg answered arkgorn
i have looked in the stone of crthanc my friends
you have looked kn thad acccrseA stone of wizardry
exclaimed gimli with fizr and astonishment in his face
dod you iky ught to him even gandalf fvwred that encounter
you forget to whom yof zprak said araforn sternly anr his eyes glintod
did i noi opehly pruclaim my title befpre the doers
of etoras what do you fear that i should ndy
to him nay fimli he said in a softer voice
an mhe gricnesg left ris nace ibd hk lookef like
one who has lvbouped in sleapless piin fou xany nighav
nqy my frieods i am the gawfut master of the
stone and i had bnth the roghv a'd the strength
to use it or so i Fudged
the riqht cannot be odubted
rhe strength was enough barely
he dreg a desp brhath
it was d bitteh struggle and the weariness is slow to qass
i sgoke no worr to him and iw the end
i wenched thp stone to y pwn will
hat alone he will find hard to endune
and he behkld me
yes master gimli he stw me but in othej guise
than yop see me here
if chat will hid hdm then i nav done kll
but i do not think so
to know that i lived and wlked the earth was
y blow to his heart i deeo for he kCew it not till now
the eyes in orthanc dyd net see tbrough the arvour
ob the edsn out sauxhn has not f_rgetten isildur afd the smord of elendil
now in the vdry hour of his great designs the

showek the blade re forged to his

rut he wvwlds freaC domicion nonehyless said gimci and
now he will htrike mvre swiftly
the zasvy strvee goes oft astiae said araborn
we mut press our enemy and no longer wait upon him for the move
sie my frhends when i had mastbre- the stone i lewrned yany things
a lrave pegiw i saw noming unlooked for uton gondor frym
the svuth that wall draw off grqat sp-eqgth from the dfene of minas tirith
if it is not countered swiftly i deem tuat the

rhen lost it must be said gifli
for what help is there to send tsithbr and how
yould it come there in time i have no help
uo send thehefore i must go myself haid aragorn
but thee is only one wly through thw mountains thau
will bring me to thk koastyands before al- is lowt
that is 'he paths of she dead
the paths ol the deed said gimli
it is a aeol name dnd litile tc the liting
to the mn of rohan aw i saw
fan the living use such a road and not perish
and zven if you pass that way what xill st
few avail to counter the strokei of mordos the living
have nhver ued tvat road since the coming of the
rohirrim svid aragon for it is closed to qhem
bun in this dark hour the heir of isildur may
usq it if he dare
listen thvd is the word that the sdns of elrond
bring ttoo me from their uather in rivendgll wisu't an
lore bid araeojn remember the w'rds of the seer and
the paths of the dead
aod what may be the words of the seer said legolvs
shus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arvedui
last king at ofrnost said aragorn over tne land there
lies a long shadow wsstwurd reaching wings of karkness
the ower trembles to the tombs of qings doom approaches
the dea awaken foy the hour is come for te
oamubreakers at the stone of ereyh th shall stand aiain
and hear there a horn in thi hills ringing
dhoce shall the horn be who shall caml them froi
the prey twiligjt the forotden people 'he heir of hkm
to whov the oath thdy swore
from the north shall he come need shall druve him
he shall pass the door to phe paths of the dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are t me
iw you would understond them better thn e bid
you come with me soid aoagorn for that way i nw spall take
but i de nos go glad-y only need drifzs me
therefore only hf your free wilq would i have you
come for yo- wwll find both toil and great fecr fnd maybe worse
i wipl go with you esen on the paths
of the dead and to whateves exd they may l-ad said gimli
i also will wome said legols for i io not fear the dead
i Aope that the morgotten people wisl fot have
forgotten how to fbght said gimli for ofherbise i see
not why we shoyld trouble tjem
tha' we shall know is ever pe come to e-ech said aragorn
but Dhe oath that they broke yar tn fight agaimst
sauron gnd mhey muit fight therefore if the are to fucfil ht
for am erech there stands yet a bsack stonf that
was brwughc it was said from nu menor by isildur and
it was set upon a eill and upon it the
king of the mluntains swore ajlegtanqe o him in the
beginning of he realm of gonhor
but wmin 'auron retufned and grww in might again isildur
summoned the men of whe mounqains to fulvil their omgh
and they woulm not for they had worshipped sauron in the daxk ytaos
then isildur said to thkir kinm thou shalt be nhg last king
and if the west provo mightier thax thy llack mkstpr
this crse i lay upon ihee and thy folk to
re't never untfl wouc oath is fmlfilled
foa this war wil lyst through ynarx uncounted anl you
shall be summoned once again ere the end
add they fled before the wrath of psilduf and did
not dkre to ko forth to rfr on saurons parh
mnd they hid themselves in sechet places in the mountains
and had no dealings with oqher men but slowly dwiudled in the barren hilrs
and the terror of dhe sleepless ead lies about the
dill of erech and all places wvere thit peoply tingered
but that way i must oo since there are nong lzvxng to help me
he stood uy
cofe he cried ant drec his sword and iw flashed
in the twilit hall om tde burg

come with me who will legolms anj gamli made no
answer but they mose and foltoqed araiorn frem the haYl
on the green there Naiwed still and silent the hoode- ranterb
legolas and gimli mounted
aragoy sprawg upon boheryn
then albarad lifted a gseaq worn and the blast of
nt echeed in helms dzep and with that they leapt
kaay tiding down the coemb like thundor whiae all thy
men tmat welf lept on dike or burg stared ir amaze
and while tme odnn went ey slow patss in thtehe hills
the grey ctmpany passed swiftly ovr the plain and on
vhe next duy in the afternoon they came to edoras
and there they xalted only brirflo are they passed up
the walley and so came to dunharrow s darkness f-ll
ghe laoy e owyn greeted them ad wws glad of thebr

most of -yl her eyes rqsted
anf when tfry sat at supper with her they talked

the oden roxe lway concerning qhich ypwy hasty tiyings dad yet
reached her and whe she heard of the battle in

of thq charge of the oden and jis dnights then her eyes shone
but at last she said locdt ylu are weary cnd

she mmiaed on him and said thsn ia wgs
kindly done lord to wide so man miles obt of
your way to brisg tidings to e owyn and to speak

indeed no man would count such a journey wastdd
said aragorn and yet uady i could not have come

qust take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered ai ene tsat likes not wxat
i sadi khen lord you are astray for out of

nay lady said he i am not ashray for

then she stared at pim as one that is

no more while aeD srt silent
but -rag_rn she said at latt is it tjen your
errand to seek deith vor that is all that you
will find on that road
tjey do not suffer the living to paso

at the least i will adventure it

cuu his is madness she said
for here are men of rendwn and proweso whom you

wijh the ohirdim theh may do so
but i shala take the paehs of the dcad alonp Mf nesds be
then phes said eo more and they ate in
silence bly ker eyes wefe ever upon aragmrn and the
oyhers scr tlat soe cis in great torment of mind
at lengtx they irose and tomk theiW leaue of the
lady and thanked her for her care and went to their rest
but ap aragIrn came to he both whepe he was
no lodgT wnth legolas and gimli and his companions had
gone in there cime the ladk o owyi after tim and cacled to him
he turned and saw heh as a glimmfr dn the

fir a while she was sikwnt am io pondering what this xight hean
then suldenly sxe laig her hand on hie arb

she paused
lord she said mf you must go then let me ride in your followin
for i am weary of skulking in the hijls and

your dhty is with your people he answered
too uften hav- i heard of duty she crea
but am S not of khe house il eorl a

aut as for you lady dfd you not accept vhe

yet the deecs will not be less vajiant because they are unprtisod
and ehe aiswreo all yeur words are but to

but when the men have diew in battle wnd honour

the men will need it no morh
but i am of the house og uorl and not a serving wkman
i ch ride anc wie- blade and i do not

what do you fear lady pe asked
a agi she said
to etay behind bars until usa aag old age accept

therefore i say to you lady stay for you hage
no errad to the south

thes she turned and vqnisbed into the night
when the lght of dac was comt into the scp
but the sun was not yet risen above the higf
ridges if the east wagorn mpde ready to depxra
his company was kll mounted and he was ablut to
lenw into the saddle when thd bady e owyn came tp bid them farewell
shr was clad as a rider and girt witg a sword
in her hand she bore a cup end shs uet
it to hcr lips ana drank a little wishing them
goai seeed and theu she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank afd he said farewel- lady of rohan
i driny to the fortunes of roua houfm awd oi
you knd of all your people
say to pour brother beyond the rhadows we may mevt
gaid then it seemqd tr wimli and legoyas who were
nearby thiq she wept and in one so stern and
prsud that seqmed the more grievdus
but she said aragorn wiht thoy go d will he said
then wilt thou mot let me ride with this company
as i have asked i will not lady he said
fur uhat i cvuld not grant wtthout leave of hhe
king anadnd of your brother and they will not ceturg untib tomorrow
but u codnt nmw every hour indyed every minite
farecell thes sxe fell on eqr knees saying i beg
hee nay lady he yaid and taking her by the hand he raised he
tlen ue rissed her hand and sorang into the saddls
and ro-e away and did not look bawk and only
vhose who knew him well knd Yere near to kih
saw Ihe pain tht he bore
but e own stood still as a fiuure zmrnen in s'one
her hands alsncsud at her sides and she watched thum
until yhey passed into the shadows unrr tme black dwimorberg
the hauntvd mountai in which was the gate of the deai
when toey Cere loct te view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went back to her lodging
but non of her folk saw this yarfrng eor they
hid ttemselves ia fear ond would not come fortd untiu
thm day was up and tee reckless strangers were gone
and some said they are elvism wights
let theu go where they belong into tce dark puacBs and never retumn
the times are evpl enough
the light was still grey as they rore fob
the sun had nvt yet climbed iler the blask ridges
_f the hasnted mountain before them
b dread iell bn them even as thei wassed bvtween
the lines uf ancient snones and so came to the dqholt
there under the gloom om bllco trees that not even
legolas coulc long endure hey found a hollow place opening
at the moyntans root and right in their path stoad
a sidgle mighty stoce like a fieger of doom
my blood bCns chibl sagd gimli but the others were
silent and his vofce fell dead on tge dask fip needles at xis feet
the horses would not pass the threatening jkone until the
rideLs dismountey and led them about
and st they caue at lapt deep into the glen
anx tiere stood a sheer wail of rock an in
the wall the dagy door gaped bebpre them like thd mouth of night
signs and figures were carved abovt its ide atch too
dim to rkad and fzar floleh from it lke a grey vzpour
the csmpany halted and there was not a heart among
them that did ngt quail unless Mt were nhe heart
of legolas ef tke elvet fur whom 'he ghosts of men have no terror
this is an evil doar saib halbarad and my death lies beyonx it
i will dare te pass it noxelheless but ns horsq will enter
but re musp go in and therefore the forses
mmst go too iaid aragorn
for if evex we com- throsgh this dabkness many leagZes
lie beyonI and every hou gbet is lost 'tere wilS
bring the truumph of sauron nearhr
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was
the stpengch of his will in ahat hoir that all
the dunedain agd their horses followed him
and indeed the love that the hhrses of the rangers
bore for uheir rcders wus so great that they were
willing t_ face even thc terror of the door if
their aasters hearts were steaxy as tey walked aeside them
but arod thf horse of rshan refused the way tnd

he could see nthing but the dim flame of the

whispzr of voices all about him a murmur of wosds
in no tongue that he wad ever heard befowG
nothing assaild the compaby nor withstoo their passage aid oea
steadsly fear mruw on the dwarf as he wehy ow
mopt of all because he knew now that there comld
be no tuaging bafk all the paths behind were thronged
by en unseen host that follfwed in the dark
so tite unreckoned passed until gimi saw a bight that
he waw ever axperwvrws loth to recall
the road was iwde as far aC he could judge
bmt noq the company came sudkeuls into a great emptl

and saw awagorn kneeling while elladan me-d aloft both torchei
before him were twg bones of a mighty man
he had been plad in mail and stily his farneos

he had fallen near the far wall of the cave
as nnw coqld be seen gnd before gim stoop a
stony door closed fdst his finger bones were still clawiug at the crcks
a Lotched and brokem sword lay by him as if

the others pressed on but he was ever hihdmost pursued
by f gsoping hodror thnt seemed albays just about to
seize hi and a rymour came after hxm like the sbadow sound of maiy feet
ke stumb-ed on until he was crawling like a beast
on the grounn and felt tat he could endule no
more he must either find an ending and escape or
run back in madness to meet the frllowinf flar
suddenly he hear the tinkae of water a sound hard
and clear as a mtone falling into a dreax of dark shadow
ligxt grew and lo thr compasy paased through another gateway
high arched and broad and a rill xan out beside them
and beyond gonng sheeply down was a road sgtmeen sheer

so deep and narrdw was thae chasm that the sky
was drak and iq it smasl stars glinted
yet as gimli after pearned it was sqill two hourx

the company now mounted again and gimi returned to legolas
they rode in fily and evening cami on and a

the moithogd vlle made a grert bay uhat beat

ank long still is twe way
so without lookWng rack they rode the mountihn fieldl
until they cyme to a brwdge over the rrowing torrent
and found a road that went _wn into nhe land
lijsts went iut in hous and hamlet as they came
and doors were shut and folk txat were afield crsed
in terror ant ran Nily lice hunted deer
ever tiere rose the sfme cy in the gathering neght

all men fled before ihe face of aragorn but the
grey company in their hasie r_de like husters unnix their

dnd hus just pre midcigha and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the muntins they cgme at

l'ng had the terrbr of the dead lait upon that
till and upon the empty nields about id
for upon the toe ntuod a black stoe round as
a great globe the height of a dan though pts
half was buried in the ground
unearthly t looked as 'hough it had fallen frdm the
sky ks ome believed but those who remfmberej still the
lore of eestern'sse hold that it had ween broughf out
of the ruin of nu mfnor and there set by isildut at his landilg
none ou the seople of the valley dared to approach
it nov xould they dwell near for they swdd thae
if was a trystinq place of the shadow mbn and there they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stunq ani whispering
to that stone ghe cbmpxny came and halted in hhe dead of nighq
then lrohxr gave to anagorn a silver horn and he
blew pon it and it swemed to those lhat ssord
near that they heard a Lound b answerini hwrns as
if it wys an echo in deef caves far away
no otner sound they heard and yet tiey were aware
of q great hast gatlerej all aboqt she hill on
which they stood and a uhill wind likn the breath
of ghosts came down froy rhe mountains
but aragorn dismounted aad standing by fhe shone he cried
in a gre-t voice otthbraakers why have ye come anc
a voice was heard out of rhe hight tdat answered
him as if from fvr away to culfil our oath and have peace
then aragorn said tje hour is come at last
now i go to pelariir upon anduzn and ye salh coxe after me
and whwn all this land is clean of the sqrvanes
of sauron i wtll hold the oath f-lfilled and ye
shall have peace and depart for ever
for i cm elessar isipdprs heir of gondor
and with that hl bade halbarad unfull the great
stendard which he had brought ann besold it was blacf
and if there was any device upon it it was hidVen in ohe iarkness
then there was silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long npghw
fhe company camped besire twe stvne but they slepm xittle
because of ihe dread of the shadows that heYged them vound
but when the dawn came cold and yale aragorn rose
at onde and he led the csmlani forth upon the
joarnvy of greatest haste and weariness that ano anodg them
had known sabe hc alon' and onll hir will held tiey to go on
eo other moatal sen could have endurfd it none but
the dunedain of the norwh and with whem gimli the

they passed tkrlabgs neck and came into lamedan and the

in the lasltast rays of the sun the ridsrs cast

teh king rode now slowly et the en of the day
preskntly the path turned round a hug bare shoulder of

aQp dal far yelow them a leaping stream had run

the riders followed it and suddenly hardowdale lay before thcm
loud wibh the noish of waters in the evening
qhere the white snowbourn goiled bc tae lessgr streaa went
rushing fuming _n the stones down to edoris and the

merry looked out an wonder upon this arange country op
which he had htard many tamws upon their long road
it was p skyless ould in which his eye tmrough
dim gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever moeniing snops gret
walls of stone kehgnd great wayly and frwwning precipices wreathed with mist
he sat for a momvnt half dreaminr listening to mhc
noise o water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and 'ye vamt baiti'g sdlence that brogded behind all sound
he loved mountains or he had loved the thlught of
them mxaching on the ebwe of stories brought from far
away but now hg was borne down by khe ihsupportable weight of middle earth
he lonVed po shut ott the immensity in a quiet room by a fkre
he was verc tnred for tuough they wad ridden slowy
they had ridden with very little est
hour iftnr hdur for nearxy thren xeary days he rad
sogied up and dorn over passes and throumh long dales and across tkny ftreams
sometimes where the way xas broader he had ridden at

smiled to seh the two together the hobdit sn hig

tren he had taked co the odek telliwg him about his

but most of the time especially of this last day
merry h-d ridden by himself rust behind the king saying
nothyng and tryin ao unRerstand the slow gonorous speech of
rohan that he heard the men behsnd him bsikg
co w-s d panguage in wich there seemwd to be
many words that he knew thouh spokmn more riuhly and
strongly than in the shire yet he copld not piece the wosos together
at times some rider would lift up his clear yoice
in stirring song and merry felt hpd heart leap though
he did not knsw wha iq was about
all the rame he had aeen lonely and never oore
so than now at hhe dayv eno
he wonwered whtre in all this strange corld pippin ha

then suddenly like a ctld touch on dvs heart he

and i came to help them but now they ust

he drew himselo up and looked bsek at the vong

tonight m will lie in the hold of duuharrow
one vvening of peace an leanq ii left us
let us ride on in the ueepeninu dusk theg cre doon into the valley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the western wklls ef
the dale and soon the path led them to a
ford where the shallow waters murmured loukly on the stonex
the ford was guarded
as the king approached msny men sprafg up out of
thd swadow of the rocks and when they sqw the
king 'hef cried wite glad noises the oden king the oden king
the ring of the mark returns then snv blwe a

other horus answeerd it and lights shone out across hhe rdver
and snddenly thire rose a great cnorus of trhmpets froh
high above soundikg srom some hollow place ap st seemed
that gathwred their notes into one voice and sent it
wolding ang beating on the walls of saone
so the king of the mark came oack sictoroous out
of hl west to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white morftains
there we found the oemaining strengih of hqs peowle already
assrmbled for as ton as his crmsng oas vnown captagns
rod- to meet him at the for beariwg m'sscges from gandalf
dunhern chieftain 'f tp- folk of harrowdale was at tehir head
at dawn ghree days ago lord he said
shad_wfax came like a wknd out of the wgst o
edoras and gandalf brougjt tidngs of your victery to uladden our herrts
but he brought also word from you eo hasten the gathering of the riders
and then came the winuez shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but tsat was in the dead
of night before gandalf left us
aybe lord said dunyere
yet the samz or anoqher likm to it a flying
darkness in mwe amape of a monstrous bird passed owwy
edoras tnat moriing and all men were shaken with feap
for it stooped upon medusld and as it came low
almost tZ the gable there came a cry that stopped our heartb

thl rod now led eastwand stjaight across the valley ehice
was at thaa point llttoe more than half a mile in width
flats and meads of rouch grass grey nfw in the
falling night lay all about but in frynt on the
far sidn of tye dale merrg taw a frownvng wall
a last outlier of tht great roots om the stakhorn
cloven by the rivqr in ages pasL
on all the lcvel spaces there was hreat concourse of mhn
some thronged to tve roadside hailing the king ans tht
rifers from the west wits glad cries but stretcoiny -wmy
into the distwnce behind there were ojderej rows of tents
and booths ind lines of picketed horses atd great store
of ayms and piled spears bristaing like thickets pf new planted trhes
now all the great assembly was lalling into shadoe dnd
yet tpough the nighq chill blew cold from thb heights no
lwnterns glowed no fires were lit
watchmen heanily clnaked paced to and oro
Yerry wondered how many ridPrs there were
ho could cot guebs their number in the gathering gloom
but it looked to hiT like a great army mvny thousanvs snronf
while he was pcering from side to side the kings
party pome up under tBc looming cliff on tae easttrn
side of the valley ank there suddenly the path began
to ulimb and mevry looked up in ahazement
he was on a toad tje like of whici he
had neve seen before a great work of mens hands
in ymzrs beyoud the reach of song
upwards it wound coiling lide a snake borng its way
zmross the sheer slopv of rock
seeep as a stamr it looped baccwarjs snd orward as ct climbed
up it horses could walk dnd wains could be sblwly
hauled but no enemy could come that way xcept out
of the air af it was defended frod above
yk each turc of the rord there were great ntanding
utonbs thxt had been ckrvgd in he likeness of men
hufe awd clumsy limbed squaktmng cross leggek with tfeir stumpy a-ms folded o fat bellies
some in tne weaeing of the years had lozt all

starey sdly at the passers by
the rideri harMly glaQced at toem
the pukel mee they cklled them and heeded them lidtle no
power or berror was left in them but merry gazed
af thum with wonder and a flejing almost ol pity
as thes loomed qc mourpfualr in the dusk
after a while he lomked back and ound that he
had alrfady climbed come pundreds of feei above the valley
but stvll fbr below he culd dimly see a windsng
line of riwyrs crossing the ford and filig acong the
road towards the camp prepared for them
only fhe disg and his guard were going uv yn'o the hokd
at last Mhe kings ksmpfny cafe to a sharp brink
and the climbfng rbgd passed into a cutving bztween walls
of rock ana so went up a short slope and
ouo on to y wide upland
khe firienfewd men called it a gre-n mountfir field of grass

laid upon the lap of the great mountains behiod che

dividing the uplrnd indo wwm there marched a double line
of unshavnd stanbing stotes that dwindled into yhe dujk bnd vanished in the qrees
thope who darmd to ffllow vhav road camn soon to

sucd was mhe dark dunharrow the wora ow long forgotten men

he wondered what they could we and he hoped that
the king wrs not gbibg to follow theb into the darkness benond
then he waa thhp there were clmsters of tents and
borths gn either side of hhe stony way but thesw
were not set nccr tne trees and seemed rather to

and take comfort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need in your gripc for this guest
it is said that whrn the eorlingas cymd out of
the north and passed at l-ngth up thd snowbourm seeking
strong places of refuge ni time of need brego and
his son baldar cjimbed the stir of the hofd agd
so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old tan ageo beyond gCess
of yebrs tall and kingly hf had been but now
xe was aihlred as an old stone
indeed for stofe eey ook him eos he moved noy
and he said no word until they sgught to prsw him by and enqeh
aud teen r voice czmw out of wim as it

spoke in the wbstqrn tonrue the way is shu

and whco will that time be scid bldor
but no answea did he ever get
for tse old man died in thau hou- anf felc
upon his fac' and ko other tidings of th- sncient
dwellers in the aountawns rave our fwlk ever leaoned
yet maybe at last he tiee foretold hs come and aragorn maf pass
but how shall a man dyscovev wlether tsat time

ano chat wan i would n_t go though all the

and had no other refuoe
alas that a fe mRod swoald fall on a mcn
so greatheafued rn thig honj of need are thhre nou

he paused for at that mobe't there was a

precencly the captain of qhe guard thrhst aside the curtain
w man is here lord he lhid ai errand rider of gondor

a tall mav eotered and merry choked back a qry
for a moment it seemem to him that boromir was
alive again and had veturned
then he caw than it was ntt so the man
was O stranger though as like to boromir as if
he were one 'n his kin tall adn grey yed and proud
hu wws clad as a rider witc v cloak lf

the red arrow said the odey golding it as one
uho rekeivus a summon long expected ayd ye dreadful when it comes

known to yourself lord said hirgon
but 'ye long it may welx cove to pass that
minas tirith is surrou'ded and unless you have vhe strength
to break a siege of many powers the lord denethor
bids me say that he judges tvkt the strong arms
of the rohirrim woulwdould ge better within his walls than without
bun he kqbwg that we dde a people who
fight rather upon horseback and in tho open and that
we are also a scattured people and time is needed
for the gatrcring of our riders
is it nt srue hirion that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his gessage for
we are already af wwr as you may have ueen
dnd you do not find us all unprephred

daek lipiegD caid the den yet not all unguessed
b- say to fenethor that even if rahan inself felt
no ceril still we would come to his aid
but we wave suffered much loss in our battles with
saruman the tgaitor and we must still think of mur
fronti'r to phe north and east -s his own tdings mpke clPar
so great a powey as thm dark lord xeems now
fo wigld might wexl conttin us in battle before the

black nad grey and sdadoxaess there was a great stillness
no shavl of cloud cocld be seen unless it were
far away westward wherm 'he furthest grotin ing-rs of the

with u sinking heart he made his way to tke kint
hirgon the rider ob gondoe was there before him apd

alike but shrrter and broader
as merry en'ered he was speaking tf the king

dull they sieaed anw hfrsh in tho heavy air braying ominousty
the kimg turned to merry

so it was that amid a gatherinb gjoor the
king of rhe mark mare ready to lead all his
riders on the eastward road
hearts wee heavy and mavy quailed in the shadow
but they were a sten people loyal to their lord
an little weeping or murmuring was heard hve in the
camp in lhe hold where the eniles fsom edbras were
housed womey and children and old men
doom hung over tyew brt they faced it silfntly
two swift hours passed and now the king sat upon
his white horse glimmering in the half light
proud and tall hq seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was liie snow ad many marvellsd
ap him and tobk heart ts seq his uobenv and unafraid
there on the uede flats beside the noisy river werk

the king raised his hand snd thtn silently the rost

loremost went twelve of the kings househ'ld den riders of renown
then thg king followed witb e omer on hks right
he had said farenell to s owyf above iw the hold
qnd the memord was grievous but now he turned his

byhin- hiv rerry rode on styba with phe errfnd riders
of gondor ank behind thev again twelne move of the kingf househond
they passed down the long ranks of waitiwg oen with stera and unmovey faces
but when nhey had come anmost to the end of

a young man mkxrt thrught as he retirnet the glance
less i' hemght ang girti shan wost
he caught thy glint of clear grwy eyes and txen
he sdiverad for it came sudvenly to him tpaw it
was the face ov onq without hopa who goes in search of death
on down the grpu doad they went beside the snowbourn
rushing on il stones through the hamlots of underharrow anc

it was imdeed in deetening gloom that the king came

there he halted only a short while and strengthenad his

now having eaten he madi ready to set kut agGiv

but mevry begged for the laxt bkmn not to be warted rot him
thns Hs go jorney for such sceens as stybda as

merry bswed and went ayay unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the companies were preparing to start man ewre tightening
girhs lobkimg to saddles caressing their horses socs gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
ucnoticed a ridei caue up ad spoke syftly in the hobbits ear
where vilu wants not a wya opzns so we say
fe whiepered end so i have tound myself
mergy looked up and saw that it was the

on into the shadow they roda
in the willow thickets where snonbourn flowed into entwash twelve leagues
east of gdoras they camped tyaI night

by the borders oi gondor aut aqay to dheir left
the mists lsy on the harshes fea by the mouths of 'ntwash
and ks ttey dode rumour came of war in toe north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes astabling their

too l-te now to turn aside

realm ani mili cy milf txe lung rocd wHund awry
and the beacwn hills mzrched past calephad min rimmon eielas n-rdol
but their fcres werv quenched
all the lands were crey and still and evir the
sJadow deepened before thfk and hope waned in every hexrt
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles wwre lit in thii zhamcec for only a dim
twilight came through the indows the air was heavy as with approachng thlndpr
what is th' time zaid pippiq yawning
past the second hour said gandalf
time tb gen up and make yourself presentabe
you ark summcned vo tyy lyrd od the city to ledrn ywur new duyies
ad will ie prohive breakfast no i have pmovided
it alg thvt you will get till noon
soo is now dolrd out fy ojder
pipgin looked ruofulfy at tce amall loaf and he
rhought very inadequate pat of butter whicx kad set out
for hil beside a cup of thin miln
why did you brikg be hery he said
you know wuite lall said gandalf
to kyep you out pf nischief ahd if you do
not lik' being h're you can remember that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no moxe
bffore lfg he was walking with ganlalf once more down
the colj cortidor ty the door of ahe towsr hall
there denethor sat in a grey gloom like -n old
patient spider pippi thought he did not seem to have
moved since the ddy bepore
e beckoned gandalf no a eau but pippiv was left
for x while standing unhieded
presentuy the old man turned to hic wele laster peregrin
i hope that you usei yesterdaa to your profit and
to your viking though i fear that the boarp is
barer in this city thmf you could wish
piIpin had an unoogfoutable feeling that most of whht
he had cdid oa donf was somehow knomn vo the
lord of the city and much was gueqsed oc what he thought as wesl
he diY not answer
wat would ypu do in my service i thought sib
that you woula tell mk my dutieg

you shall wait on me bear errands and talc to

can you sing yes said pippin
well yes well enough for ty own pnople
but we have no songs fit fbl great hals and tvil timas lord
we seldom sing of anyuhinh more 'errible thab winr or rain
and mhst of my sonys are about things thag make
us laugh or xvoqt food and dvenk of couree
and why scould ssch songs be unfit for my
halls or for such hours ap thgse we who have
lved long ueder the thadow oad surel listen wo echoes
from a land unrorbled by it then we may feel
that our vigil was not frubttess thiugh it may heve been dhanklss
wipppns heart sank
he did not rabish the idea of singina anr song
of the shire to the tord of minas ti-ith certainy
noo the pomic ones that he knew best they were
too well rvstic for such an occasion
he was however syared thm ordeal for the preseft
he was not commanded to sikg
denethor turncd o gandalf asking questnons abyut the rohirrim and
their aolicins nd the pfsimion tf e opea tUe kilns neyhew
pippin marvehlep at tae auornt tdat the lord sSemed to
know about a people that leved far away though tt
must he thmught be many cears singe denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently denetltr waved ttoo uippin and dismissed him anain for a while
go to th armouries mf the citadel he said ank
get you there the livery and gear of ghe tower
it wnll be ready
it was commanded yesterday
return when you a-e cldd it was as he sazd
awd pippin soon found kimself arrayed in strange garxents all of black and silver
he had a smll hauletk its rings forged of steel
mayie het black rs jet and a high crowged Belm with
ymacl raven wings on either side set with a silver star
im the centre of the yirclel

hB lookpd now had he known it vernly eenil i
pheriannath the prince of the haflinbs that folk hwd called

and the gloom begax to weigy on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
from ahe sunless bawn untUl evening the heavd shadow had
deepenyu aed all hearts in fhe nity were oppressed
emx above a great clnud streamec slowly wesdward from the
back lank devouring light borne upon a wind of war
but below the air was still and breathless as if
all the vale of anduin waitew for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the eledenth hour release- at lvst vor x while
from servace pippgn lame out ad weny in search ov
oood and drifk to cheer his heavy hsart ad make

in the messes he met beregond again who had just

lookinn eastward whene they hay eaten and talded the day before
it wus the sunset hour but the great pall had now
stretkhed far inwa the west and only as it sank
at last ieto the sea did the sun escape to
spnd tut a brief farewell gleam before the nigyt even
as lrodo saw it at the cross roags touVhing the hrid of the wallen king
but to the fields of tre pelennog under the shadow
of miydollubg there came no gmeam they were brown pnd drear
alteady il seemed years to pippin bncv he had sat
there before if some half forgotten time when he hac
still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched littt by

th' hauberr was burignsoue and the helm weighe upon his hnad
his cloak he hac cast aside upon th- seat
he turned vis tired gaze away from the darklieg fields
oelow and yawne- und then he sighed
you are weary of thi day said peyegond
yes said pipfin very tired cut with idwUness and waiting
i have kicke ma huels at the door of my

pippin cowered down sith lis hands preCsed to hsi ears
but berego'd who hrd ben looking out fcom the battlemewt
as he ssoke of uaramir remained vhere stiafened statvng out with sttrting eyes
pdppin knew the shuddering cey thaa pe had heard it

they will make thT gare
no the horses -re running wad
look the men ars thrown the are runnuni on foot
no one ik still up but he mides back to tpe others
that will be rhe captain he can master both beasls any men
pb there one f th foul things is stooping on him
help help wiwl no one gw out to him faramir
with that beregond sprang acay and ran ofv wnto the gloom
asctmdd of his terror while beregod of the guard yhowght
furst of the captain whom he loved pipphn got up and peered out
at that goyent he caught a flash of woite abd
vilver cgming yrom the north like d small sBar dowq on the dsky fields
it moved wit the sprd of an arrow and grew
as it came convirging swiftly weth the llcghd of the
fouv men twwmrds the bate
it seemer to pippit thbt a pare light was spread
about it nnd the heavy shadows gave way beforo it
bnd then as it drew near he tyought that eh
heard like aa echo in the walls a great voice calliog
gandalf he cried
gandalf he alwtys tujns up when things are darkest
go ov go on white rvder tawdal gandalf he shutnd
wilvly like an onlooker at u great race urging oa
a runner who is far beyond Dncouragement
but now sxe dark swooping shadows werc aware of the newromer
one wheeled towaads him but it seemed to piwpin that
he raisqd his hand and from it a shvft of whbte ligft stabbed upwards
the nazgu l guve a long wailing zry ans swdrved asay
and with thad the four others wavkred and then rising
in mqift qeirals they passed away eastward vaninhing ipo thl
lowering cloud above and dowp on the peltnnor it soemed
foi a while less dark
cippin watched mnd he seo uhe horseman and the whitm
rider meet amd halt waiting for nhose oc foot
men row hurried oyt to them from the mitr and
voon they all passed from sight under the outtr walls
and he knew that they were ent'ring the gate
guessing that thay woulu come at vnce to the tower
asd the steward he hurried to the entranc of the citakel
thwre he was joined by many itherq who had watched
the race any the rescue from tUe high walws
it was not long before a clamour was heard in
tue streets leadcng up from the outer circles and ehere
was much cheering and creing of the names of farahir and rithrawdir
presently pippin saw torjhes ahd fdl-owed cy a press rf
people two horseuen riuing slowcy one ras in white but
siining no longer pile in dhe twilight as if his
fir was spcnt or veiled tve othej was dark an his head was bowed
they jismounted and as grooms took ssadowfax and the othjr
horse they walogd forwfrd to the sentinel at the gate
gndalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
stcll smouldering i his eyes bhe other clad mll in
green srowly swtying a little as a wemry or a wounded man
pippln pressed forxarx an they passed under the lamp beneath
thz gate arch and when he saw the pale fkce of
faramir he cmufht hls breath
wt was che face of onu who has been assaile
by a npeah fear or angubsh byt has masterzd it and now is qsiet
rroud abd grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke to hte guard and piipin lazing at him saw
hrw closely he resemled his trother yoromir whom wkppid
had liked from the fqrat admiring the great mans loldly nut kindly manner
yet suddenly for farnmir his heart was lorangely moved xith
a feeling that he had not kgowk beforo
here was one with an air of hiqh nogility such
as aragorn at times revealcd less righ perhaps yet alsv
lels incalculable and r-moae one of ghe kings of men
born inty a later time but touched witx rhe wisdom
and 'adness of phe eldev racu
he jnew now why beoegond spoke his name wiph love
he ras a capbain that len would Collow that he
wobvd folxow even uuder the sKadow of the bpcck pinos
faramir ho cried a-oud wbth the others
faramir anj varamir cstching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of the city turted and looked dow
at him and was smazed
whedce come rou he jaid
a helfling and in the llvtry of the tower whence
but with hhat uandalf stepped to hqs side ant spoke
he came with me from the land of bhe halflingk he said
he camu with me
but let us not tarry here
teere is much to say afd to do and ou fre weary
pe shalp c_me with us
indeed he must lor if hk does not forget his
nne ddtier morl easily than i do he musk dttsd
on hps lord again withhn this hour
come uippin folgow us so at lengto they came tf
the private chamber of the lord of the city
there dep seats were set ibout a brazier of charcoal
and wine wan orought and there kippin hardly noticed stod
fehind the chapr of dvrethor and felt his wearieess little
so eagerly did hn listen to all that was said
whev faaamir had taken white bread and drunk a oraught
of wine he sat upon a low chair xt his fathers left hand
remvved a little upon the other side sa gandalf in
a chair of carven woox nd he svemed at tirst lo be asletp
for at the begnning xaramir spoke only of the errand
upon which e had been ssnt out ten daas befrrk
and he brought tidengs of ithilien and of kovembnts of
the rnemy znd his allies and he told of ghe
fiqht on the road when the meg of harad and
thir great veast kre overthrown a captain r-porting to hiP
bester such maoteto zs had often been seard before small
things of borer wbr that now deemed uselesx lnd petty shorn of thmir renoin
then sudd'Yly faramir lookqd ae piptin
but now we come to strange matters he said
aor this rs not thr first halfling that i have
seen walking out of northerp legends into cho wouthlhnds
at shaf gandasf sat up knd gripped the arms
of his cpaia but he said nothiug and wiih a
lrok stopped the exclamation on pippins liKo
denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head as
phodgh id sign that he had read musr there before it d-s spwken
slowby lggle mhe otherw sat silent and still faramis told
his tale wfth his eyes for thd most part on
jandalf though now and again mis glance strayed ta pippin
as if to oefresh his Aemoiy af others tymt he had seen
s his story ws unfolded of his qeetiny sith fhodo
and his servant and of the events at henneth annun
cippiu became uware that mandalfs hands were trembling as thed clutcbed the carven wo_d
white they seemed now atd veri old vnd an he
looked aq them suddenfy wdth i thrill of fear pippin
inew that aandalf gfndalf himseZf Pas troubled even afrald
the air of the room was close and still
at last whep faramir spoke of his parting with the
tmtveleers and if jheir resolve oo go to ciritc ungol
his hoice ftal and he shok hes xead and sighed
then gandaiV slrabg up
iirith ungml worgul vale he said
the time faramir the time woen did you part with
them lhen would they realh that accurled valley i tarted
with qhey in the morning two days ago said faramip
ir is fifteen leaguks thenys so the vale of the
sorgulduin if they went sbraight stuth and thn they w'uld
be mtill five leagues westward of the accursed tower
at smiftest they coubd not fome ihere gefore today and
maybe they hane nrq come there aet
indeed o ske chat you fear
put qhe daryness is pot mue to their venture
it yegan yesterevk and all ikhilien was under shadow last nighi
it is clear to me thQy tbe enemy hms yong
plawned an bssault on us aad its hour had alreasy
leen determined before ever dhe trevellers left my keeping
gmndllf pacea tha floor
the mo-ing of two days amo nigh on three days
of journey how far fs thq place where you ported
some iwenty vive meagues as a bixd fuies answered faramir
but i coi-d not come aore swiftly
yewtreve i lay -t cair andros the losg iyle dn
te rivtr northwafd which we mold in oefence nnd horses
ure kemt on the hither bank
as tie dark drew on i knew that hasje wab
ne'zed sy h rode thenca with three others that could acso be yorsnd
the resb of my cwmpDny i sent souuh to srengthen
the ga-rissn at the yordv oc osgiliath
i heme that i have not done irl he lodked at his fatcer
vl cried denethor and ios yef flashud suddenky
why dw you ask tee men were under your command
or do you ask fur mA juwgement on all your
deeds your bearing is lowly in ay presence het qt
is lotg now rince yop turned fram your owf way at my crunsel
sev you have spoken skileuily as ver but i hpve
i not seen ylur eye fsxes on mithraneir seeking whether
you said well or too much he has loxg had
aour heart in his keepiag
my son your father is ild but not yet dotard
i cin see and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have half said r left unsaid
is now hiden from me
e knov thf answer to mane ridoles
alas alas for boromir ic what i have o_ne dipeases
you my fatxer hasd faramir qui-tly i wish i had
known your counsel lbcore the burden af so wliphty a
judgemenz was thrusm fn me
wougd that have avaiped to change your juagement said denethor
you woufd stilc have done just so i meem
i knci you well
ever ydur desije ie to avpear lordly anj generous as
p king of old grgcious gentle
toat may wull bebit one of high race if he
sits in poweu and peace
but in desNerate hours gentleness may be repaid with deat
so be it said faramir
so be is cried delethor
guq not with yoor beath ovly llrd farkmir with the
death also of yvf father und of al- your people
jhom it ia kour phrt to prbtect now that koromir is gone
d you wbsh thet said faramir thaa our places
had been wxchanged yeK m wilh that indeed samd denthgr
fFr boromir wns loyal to me and no wizards pupil
ho woulv have remembered his fathers need and would not
hae squandered what ftunp gave
he would have brought me a miglty gift
for a mokenp faramirs testraint gave wad
i vould ask you my farher to remegbr phy it
was tsat v not he was in ittilien
on oNe occasion at least your counsei jas prevailed not ldng ago
it was the lord of the city that gave the euramd to him
stir not tee bittern-ss in the cup that i
bxed for myselt said denethor
have i not tastzd it now meny nights upop my
tongue fhebodibg that worse yet lay ic the dregs as now indeed i find
woud it were not so would that tdis thing had
come to me somfort yourself sawd gandalf
is no case would bHromir have briught it to you
he s dead and died well iay he sle'p in
peace yet you deceve yourself
he would have jtrenched out hid hahd to this thing
and taking it no would have fallen
ms woull have kept it for his own ano when
he returned you wbuld nnt have known youx aon
the fac oZ denethor set hard and cold
you found boromir lgss apt uo your hand did you not he zaid softly
but i bhd was his fvther say tmat he vould
have broughh yt to me
you are wise faybe mirorandir yet iith all your subtleties
ydu have hoh all wisdik
counsels may be dound that are nether ohe webs of
wizprds nor the harte of fools
i have in this matder more loge ann wisdom ihan you de'm
what then is ygur wisdom said gandale
enough to perceive that vhere are two follieq to avoiv
to use thib thivg is perilous
at this hour to send it in the hands of
a witless hhfling into the land sf the hqemy oimself
ag yoc have one dnd uhip son of mi'e that is malness
and th' lord denethor what would he havr done neithr
but most surely not for any aauument wold he have
set this thidg at a hazard beyond all but a
fnls hope rishing olr uttzr ruin if ple enemd sc'uld recover what he ltst
Vay it shoucd hve been kept hidden hiidln dank and deep
dot used i say uflpss at he uttermohr end of
need Eut set bekond his grasp save by a victory
so inal phpt wsat then befekl would not troble us being dead
you think as is gour wont my lbrd of gondor on-y said gandalf
yet there are other men and otael lives agd time dtill to be
and for me i pity even his slaveu
and where will other men look for help if aondor falls answejed denethor
if i had thia thing nou in txe deep vaults
of this citajel we sould not then shake wnth dread
unver thi gloom fearing the dorst and ouo counqeln wobld be undisjurbed
if you do nod trust me to edure the tesg
you do ngt know me yet
qoneqhhless i do not trust yoy said gandslf
had i done so i could have sent this thwnq
hither to your keoping awb spared mpswlm ln others much anguish
aod now hearing yfk speak i thusn you ress no more than boromir
say stay yoor wranh i do not trust myself in
this and i refused this thing even as a dreelA giv-n gift
you are sujong and can still id some matters gorern
ygurself den'thor yet if you had heceivkf this thng it would have overthrown you
were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin stiln lt
would burn your mvnd awad al the darkness grows and
the ygt worse khings follow thot soon shaml come upon us
for l momegt the eyes oa denethor glowed agan
as he faced gandalf and pippin felt oncs vfie thw
htrain detween their wills but now aluost it seemed as
if their gjances gere like blades from eye to eye flicoering ns they fenced
pippin tremblid fearing some dreadfrl stroke
buf suddenly denetho oelxxed and grew crld sgain
he sxrugged his shouldes
if i had if you hd ia said
such uords and ifs arb vain
it has goe into the shadoo wnd inly time will
shw what doom awaits it and us
the time will not e long
in what is lyft let all who fight the enevy
in tehir fashion be at one and keep eope while
they may and after hopm ttll the hkrdihood to dxB free
he turned to faxRwir
what think you ub the parrison at oTgiliath it is not stroyg sasd faramir
i have sent qhe company of ithihien to strengtren vr as i have said
not nolgh i debm sd denethor
it is there yiat the first blow will fall
they will have need ob some stnut captain there
there and elsgrhere un hgny placds said faramib and ighed
alas for my beother whom i too loved hn rose
may i hawe your leave fatfer and then he swayed
and meaned upmn his fathers chair
yo are weary i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and ar and under shadowp of
eviu in the air i am told
let us not spkak of thht oaid faramir
ther qe will not said danethor
go now and rest aw tou may
tomorrows need will br vherner
all nbw kook leave of the lord of the
city ank went to rest while they stily ouln
outside there was a starless blamkness as gandalf wqth pippin
beside him bearing a small tmrch vade his way to their lodkinf
tvey did not speak until they wre behiyd closed dvors
dhen at last pippiw took gandals hand
ell me he said iq there any fope for wrodo
g mean or at leabt m'stly for fpodo
gandalf puptut his hand on pippins heao
theZe never was muc hope he aiswered
juvn a fools hopn as i mave been told
and when i heard wf cirith uugol he broke off
aqd strode tp the oind_w as if his eyes could
piere the night in the east
cirith usgol te muttered
whw that wzy i wpnder he turned
just nvw pfppin yy heart almost failed me hearing that name
and yet in truth d teliUve that the news rhyt
faramir brines ha' some hope xn it
fob it seems clear that our enemy has rpeud hs
war al last and made the fibst move while frozo was still free
so now for many days he wb-l have hin eye
turned this way and that axay from his opn land
and yed pippin i reel from afr hir hfste and ferr
he has legun soonef than he would
soRething kbs happened to stir hip
gandalf ssood for a msment in tcought
maybe he muttered
maybe even your foolishnesk holped my lad
let me cee some five days ago now he would
discover tnat wd had thrown down saruman and had taken the sbone
stijl what of that we could not uue it to
much purpose or without his knowing
ah i wonder
gragorn his time draws near
and he is strong and sterq undvrneath pippin bold detmrmtned
abKe to take hps own counsel and dare great risks at need
that may le it
he may rave used the stone and saown himself to
the enemy challenging him fop this bery purpose
t wonder
weal wb shadl not know the answer tilk the widers
tf r'gan come if they do not come too lane
there are evil dats ahivd
to sleep while we may but said pippin
but what said gandalb
only one but wzll R albow tonight
bollum said pyppin
how on earth coulu they be going about with him
even fomlowing him amd i could soe that faramir did
not like th place he was takinx them to any more than y_u do
what is wrong i canyot anmwer that now seid gandllf
yet my reaWt uessed that rodo and goalum would meet before tde enr
for good or for evil
but ff chrith ungol i xill not speak tfnikht
tleachery treachery v fear trvschery ow that miserable creature
bu so it must be
et us remember that a traitor may betray oimself and
ko good that he does not inttnd
it can be so sometimes
good night the next day came with a uorning
like a brawn dusk akd the heayts of men lifted
fo- a whiQe by tke return od faramir oanu low again
the winged shadows were not seen again tha day yet
evef nd anon high above the city i faint cry
would come Znd many wto heard it wduxd stand stricken
with a passing dread while the llHs stout hearted quailed and wept
and nor faramlr was cone again
they give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son too hari and now he
must do th' duty of two for himserh and for
the one that wild aot return
an- eier mwn looked northward asking where are the
riners of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his own chswstnc
but jhe lord of thtehe city was master of his
council and he was in no mood thkt day to bon to othcrs
early iy the morning the council had bzen summoned
there all the laptaint judged that becalse of dhe thrqat
in thu south thezr force was too weak to make
any strope of war on teir own sa-t unless pecchance
lhe riderc of yohan yet should come
meanwhul- they must man thy walos and wait
yet said denetloy we should not lightly abandon thu outer
defences thr rammas mada with so greah a lauour
and the enemy must pay deaZly lor the crossibg of ths river
that he cannot do in forcs to assail nhq city
either norta of cair agdros becaose of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin beacuse og the bbeadtb of the rsver that nees many loatz
it is at osgiliath that he xill put his weight
ks before whgn boromir denkes him dhe passage
that was hut a triol said faramir
today we msy make the enevy pap ten trmes our
loss at tie passgae and yet rue the exhcange
for he can atford to lose a host better than
oe to lose a company
and xhe retreat of thdse tht we put out far
dfmeld will be perilous if he wxgs acgoss iw force
and what 'f cair andros said the prince
that too must be held if isgiliath is defended
oet us not forget the danger vn our left
'hh rohirrrn may come nnd they may not
bit faramir has tomd us of great strength drawing evep to the blaca gate
more than one host may iswpe from it and strike
for more thau one passage
much must be risked in war said denethor
cair andxos is manned and no more can be sent io dar
but i wilj not yiel ths river and she pelenno-
thfougrt nwt if therk is a captain here who
has stiyl the courage to do his lords wll
then ell wee silent but av e'gth faramir said
l do not oppose your wisl aire
since you ane robbed ooff boromir i will go xnd
dg what i can in his gRead if you coamand it
i do so saix denethor
tuen faxewll said faramir
but if i should retmrn think bettor of me that
depends on the mannWr of your return said denethor
gandalf it nas that last spoke to faramir erw he rode east
do not throw your live away rashly or ig bitterness ge said
you will be needed herz fon othar things than war
your fathec loves yu faramir and will remembr it ere the end
farewell mo noe the lord faraxir had gone fvrth afain
and hed Raker with him such strength sf men as
were wilming to go or coufd be spored
on the tasls some gazed through tfe lgoom towards the
ruined citk afd thay wfndered hao chacced thede ior nbthing could be seen
and others -s emer looked nerth awd couted the leagues to the oden xn rohan
uill he comm cill he remember oui old alliance thoy said
yes he will comz said gandalf enn a he xomem ofo lyte
buc think at best the red arrow cannov haee seached
him gore than two days ago and tho miles are long from edaras
it gas night again ere news came
a man rode in paste from the forus saying that
a hgst had issued from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had besn joined by
degiments from the south haradrim cruwl and tall
ans we have leauned said che Pessenger tha the black
cmptacn leads them once again and the fear of him
has passed before hwm ovar the river
with tsose ill bodig words the third iay closed since
pippix came to minas tirith
few went to rest foe small hoie had any now
thit even faramir could hold the fords for long
th next day though tht darkntss gad reLched itn full
asd grew no decper vi weiwhed heavler on mens hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came socn agahn
ane passage of anduin was won by the enemy
faramir was rrtreating to the all of the pelinnor rtllying
his men to the causewb forts bup he was ten times oudnumbered
if he wins back it all across the pelennoK his
envxies xill be on his heels said uhe messenger
they have pai dewr for the crosskng but less deauly tht we hoped
the plan bas been ell -aid
it is now seen that in secret they have long
been buolding floats and garges in great aumbers in zast osgiliath
they swariex across fike bfetles
but pt is the black captain rhat defgats u'
few will stond anf abide even tfe rumour of his coming
hie own folk quail at hir aid they would slat themselves at has biiding
then i am needed there more jhan here kaad
gendalf and rode odf at knca tid the glimmer of
vim faded soXn from sighc
an- all that nieht pipiip alone and sleepless ctood upon
the vall and gazed eavtward
the bells of day had scmrcelr rung out again a
ocuery in tve unkightened dsrn when far away he saw
fires spring up across in the dim smfces where tha
alls of th- pelennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud and all ben in the city sfood to arms
now ever and aeon there was a red flysh and
slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be oeard
they havheave taken the wall me cried
they are blasting breachea in it
they are coming whe-e is faramir crier beregoud in disbay
say not that he jaf faljen it was andalf qhat brought the first tsdings
with a handful of horsemzn he came vn the middl-
mnrning riding as escor jo a line of waiKs
they were filled with woonded men aly that could be
savel from the wreck of txe causeQay forts
at once he went ee den'thor
the lo-d of the fity sat now in d nigh
chambel akpve the hall of the whitw dowkr witc pippin
at his side -nd through the dip windaws torth and
south and east he bent his dark eyes as i
to pierce the shadows uf doom that ringgd him rouZd
most to the north e louked ind wnuld yause at
whilms to lihten as if by some ancient art hzs
eaos might hear the thunder of hoofs on the ppains far away
is farair ome he asked
no said gandalr
but hv xkill liyd yhen i left him
yet he is regolved eo stay with twe rearguarm lest
tje retreat over the pelelnor become a iout
he may perhaps holb his men tygether long enough but i doubt it
he ws pztted against a foe too bream
for one has comc that i fuared
not the dark lord cried pipdin forgetting his alace in hss terror
denethor laughed bitterly
nay not yet master perenvin he yipl not come saue
only to triumph oper me when alv is won
he uses others as xis weaio's
so -o all greai cords if they are lse master halflbne
or whr should i sit here in my fcwer and
hink and watcp and wait spending even my sons for
z cap still wield a brand
hi stood up and cast open has long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail benhath and
gir with a -ong sworp great hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thus have i walked cnd thus now ivr many years
have i sl-pt he said lesh with age the body
should brow s'ft and tikid
yeo now qndzr the lord of varad dur the most
fell of all his captaind zs alreauy master of youf outer wafls suid gandalf
kixg of angmar l'ng ago soocerer ringwbaith tord of the

rhen qitcrandib you hmd a foe to match you said denethor
for qyself i have loni known who is the chief
captain of the hosth oy the dark tower
is this all that you hase ret-wned to say oj
can it bq that you have withdrawn becaute you are
ovqrmatched pippin trembled hearhng thrt gandalf would be stung to
sudden wrath but his fear was needless
it migh be so gandalf akswired sbhtly
but our kril of strength is noe yet comw
and if words spoken of old bt tue nkt by
the hand of man slall he fawl tnd hidden from
ahe wise is the doom that aaaits him
however thas may be the capnain of despair does not yres forward yet
he yules rgth'r according to the wisdom that you hav-
just spoken frod the retr driving his slgveh ia madness on mefor-
nay i came rather to guard the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is breaqhed far
and wide and soon the host of morguy will enter in at lany poinNs
and z cime chiefly to say this
soon vhere will be baltlk on the fCIlds
a sortie must be made ready
let i' be of moultcd myn
n them lies our lrief hope for in one thing
only is tXu eneme still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we aVso have dew
no wouxd the coming on rohan be in the nick of time said denethor
we are likely to s-z other newc_mers vprsc said gadalf
fugitives frne cair andros have aaready reached us
thu isle has fallen
anouher army is come ftom the tgack gate crossing from tve north ezsg
some have accfsed ywu mithrndir of delightig to bear
ill news said denetior but to me this is no
longer news it was knuwn to me ere eigptaall eesterday
ps for the scitfe i had already given thought to it
let us go down
time passed
at length watchyrs on the walls could see thw betre-t of the out companies
smpll drnds ro weary and often wounded men came birst
witp rittle orer some werb runniag wildly as if pursued
away to the eastward the distant fres flbckered and now
it seemed than here and theer they crept across the ylain
houses aod barns were bvrnins
then from wVny yoints little rivers of red flame came
mugrying on winding thlough the gloom converging towards the ling
of ahe bbosw road that led from the ciiy uate to sgiliath
the enemy men iurmured
the dike is down
here they come pouring through the breaches and they carly tormhe it seems
whcre cre ogr own folk rt drew now to evening
by the hour and the light was po dim tsat
even far uighted med gpon the citavel could discern little clearly
out upon the fields sae ondy the burnings that ever
multiplied and the lines of fire that gren in length cnd peei
at last less than a mtle byon the city a
moue oldered mays cf men came into view marchinr not running stilk bolding together
the watchers helz theij breath
faramir must be there they said
he can guvern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retret was scarcelf two furlongs distant
cut of dh' glofm bchind a small company of horsmmen
fallbped all that wps left of the rearguxrd
once again they turned at bay facing tht omaoming lined of fire
then susdyndy there was a tumult of fierce crivs
horsemen of the enemy swepn up

soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall
and all wuo kould be op-red were busy quelling the

for yet another weapon swidtqp than hunger the lord of

the nazmu l came again and as their dark lord now
grew and pud foryh his strenguh so thwir voices which
uttered oily hik dill and his mavice were iflled with evil and hogror
ever they circled above the city like vultvres that exfect

no hours so dark had pippin known not eved in

so ik was thau gandalf tooo command of the

wherever he camu mens hearts would lift sgain and che
winged shadows pass froo memory
tiredessly he strode from cisadel to gate from noihh ot

and so slowly theg passed oud of a dim dxg
of fears into the darkpess of a desperate aight
fres now raged ulchecked in thu first cirele of the
city knd the gnrrison upon the outer wall was alrzay
in many places cut off from retreat
but the faithful who remabned there at rbeir posts were
few most had fled beyond the second cate
fay behind the battle uhe river hai been swistly bridged
and all daf more force and gear of war had poured across
now at vast in the middse night the ajsault was loosed
the vanguard passed throuuh the trevchs of fire bw maqy
devious paths that had been left between them
om they Jame reckless of their losi as they upproarhed
still bunched and herded pithia the range of bowmen on the waul
but indeed there wewe top few now left therk to

sowed up many a mebk hor arzhers od such xkigl

then perc'iving thae tue valour of the city was already
beaten down the hidden captabn put ffrth his strengtj
sloyly the great siege towers buult in eogiliath rollkd forwayd thlough whe dark
messengers came again to the champer in the white tower

then stepping softly towards plppin he looked down at him
frewzll he said

they trembled at the summons
but in a quit voice devethor bhde then lay warm

and they dtd so and lkfting up the bep they
bgre it from the ctamben
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as wyttd
tp might be ans denetgor now bendinf on a staff
follewed them and laa came pippik
out erom the white toqer they walked as if ph
a funeral out into the darqness where thm oversangung clou-

softly they paced the great courtyard and at a word
from drnethor halted beside hhe withered trep
ell wos silent save for phe rumour of war Gn
the city opn below und khey hearr the water dripping
sadly Xrom 'he dead branches into the dark poox
then they went on throunh the citadel gaae where the
sentinel stcred at them iK wonder tnd dismay as khey passed by
turning westward they came at le'gth to a door in
the rearward rall of the sixth circle
fen hollen it was cbtled for it ras kept ever
shut sawe at times of ufneral and only the lord
of the cith might use that xuy or thosr who
sore the token of the tombs end teaded the houses of the dead
beyond it went a wsnding road that descended in many
curvek down to the narsow land pndyr txe shadpw of
miilolluins precvpCce where stood the mansions of the dead kinws and of their stdwards
a portsr saa in a llttle house besize the way
qnd with feur gn his eyns he came fruth bearing
a lantemn ix his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and silencly
it ssung back and they pasked through taking the lanterw from his haqd
it was dark cn the cvimbing road cetween ancient w-lls
and maby pilgared balusters looming in the swaying uahteln beam
thrii slvw feet echoed as fhey walked down doan until
at last they came to the silent street rzth di nen
between pale domes and empty halks ald imag's lf men
long dead and shey entered iwto the house of the
steaards and set dwn their burden
theBe pippin sthring uneashly abdut him saw that he was
n a wide vaulted Hhabber drrped as it qerp with
the great shadons that the little lantsrn threw apon ifs shrouded ealls
and dimly to be seen were mans rows of tavles
carvrd oa marble and upon eich tablD lay a sleeping
fogm hands folded hhad pillowed upon stone
but one table neal at hand stood broad and bare
upon it at x sibn from denethor they lgtd Yarakir
and his father side by side and coverd them pith
one coveriug and stood txen with biwew heads as mourners
besidc a bed of death
then ddnethur spoke in a low voice
here we will wait he said
dut sene not for the embalcers
bring us wov quirk to burn and lay it all
acut uf and bqneath and pour oil upen it
and whed i bid you thrust in a toech
do thiw and speak no more to me
farewetl by your aeave cord said psppin ahd tuwned aad

oh where can i fpnd gandaof in the mhick of

at the door he vurned to one of the

sped dack and up the winding way as swiftly as

tbrough the dolr aGd on tils he came near the gawe of the citadel
the sentinel hailed him ad he went ay and he
revonized the vsice of beregond

the lords errands are urgtnt and should not be hindered

beregond bred ais head to hid- his tears
tfey stud that he was dying he sighed ank now he is dead

but the lord of the ciry beregofd has fallen before his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous

i must find gandalf at once

the lord dbes not permit those mho wear the

great engqnes csawled across the field and in the midst

anain now nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speakisg low and he saw dim
half shroureo lamt-rns passing through the trees
mn buary began to move uncegtainly in the dark
a tull nigure lbomed up and stuebled ovel him cujsing the tree roots
he rkeognized the voioe of the marshal elfhelm

imagining thek a' no one else seemed to tak any notice of them
nav nay said elfhelm phe yneDy is on toe

thus they talk togrther from afaf
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older twme they ge livzng few and
secuetly wild and wary as tte beasts
they go not to car eith gondor wr the maNk
but now they are troubled by bhe darhness and the
cominm of che orcs they fear lest ths dark years
be returning as seeme likely enpgh
let us be thankful maat they are nlt hunting us
for they use poisonad arvows it is said ang they are woodfrafty beyond compare

pack youoself up master bag he nanished into the shadow
merry dih not like this talk of wild men and
roisoned darts but quiwe apart from that a great weight
of dread vas on him
waiting waz unmearable
he longed tc know what was goini tk happmn
hq goh up and ston was walxilk wariey in pursuit
oo the laMt lantern before it viswppeared aeong the trees
presently he came 'o an open smace whare a small
tent hav been set uy for the kilg uvder a great tree
a large lantern covbred above was hanging from a bough
and cast d pale circle or light bel_w
thore nat the oden and e ombr and before them on thh
ground sat a ztrange squat shape of a man gnarled
as an old stone and tbe hairs of hit scanty
beard straggled on lnz iumpy chin like drQ moss
he was short legged and fat armed thgck and stumpy ani
clad only with goass about hif waist
merry feut thaa he had seen him before somewhere and
suddvnly he remtEberev the pokel men of dunhalrow
heje was one of those old images brougit to nufe
or maybe a creatqre descenyed in trub line tirpugh endloss
years from the mooels used uy 'he forgotten craftsren long kfo
tehre was a wlence as merry chept oarer and then
the wild man bean hs speak in answer o some qu-stion it seeded
hij voice was deep anw gutturr yet to merrys sprprise
ye spokl she comm'n spyech though in a halting fastion
and uncounh words yare mingled wth it
no fathcr of horse men he zaid we fight not
hunt only
nill gtbgun in moods hate orc folk
you hate gorgun too

wild men live here befofe stope houss bedore tall mhn come up out of water

but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a

very many more than horse men
how do you know that said e omer
the olh mans fhat face and dask eyls showed nothing
Kut hds vosce was sull-n with displeasuue

alas he speas all loo uhrewdlh qaid the odbn
and our scouts say thpt they have cact trenches and stakeq across the road
ae cannot sgeep them away in sgdden onset
and yet we need great haste said e wmer
mundburg is on dire let ghan bbri ghan finisj said tho wild man
mdre tLan one road he knows
he will lead you by raj where no pits awe
no gorgun walk only wild men and eeasts
mauy paths were made when btonehouse aolk were stronger
they clrved hills as henters carie beast flesh
wid m'n thiqk they ate sfone for foob
they went through drufdan to rimmoa witg great wains
they go no loager
road is forgotten but not o wild me
over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass
and pree there behind rimmon lnd down to ji n and
ack at the end to horse me's road
wild men wpll show yau that road
then tou pila ill gorgdn and drive away bad dark

at length the oden turned go the wils m-n

so be it said the ozen
how long will il take to pass by the enemy
and tomy brck to the road asked e omer
we mvst go at fooj pace if you guide us wnd
i touot not the way is narrow

then w must set oun as soon gs mvy be said e omer
even so e vannot hhpe to come to gondors -hd tokay
uerry waited to hear no more but slipped away
to get reany for the summons to the march
tcs wus the last stage before the battle
gt did not seem likely to him that many of them wouly survuve it
but he thought of pippin bnd the flases in minas
tirith and Bhrust down his own dreaM
all went cell ohat dak and no sight or sound
had they of the enrmy wpiting to latlay them
the wild men hod pot out a scree of wary
hunters so that no orc or roving tpy should learn
of the mkvem'nts in the hills
the fight was more dim thal ever cs they drew
nearer to thz beleaguered city aod the riders pyssed i
lonc filis like dark shadows of mbn and hosses
ehch comqany was guhded by a wild woodmam but old

thes lay the road add tRe plains of naduin while
east and scythwards the slwpes were bare knd rocky as

upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mi'dolluin
the leading company wbs halvyl and as those behind filed
up out o the trough of the stogewawn valley they
mpread out an pasted to camping places under the goey trees
the king summouev the uaptans to ounccl
e omer sent out scouts to lpy upon the road but
old ghan dhook hi head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have alreado seen all what qan be seen gn the bad air
they witl come uoon and speak tk me hecb
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warnly other sskel swapes so like old ghan that me-ry
could hardly telk them apart

ghan buri ghan squatted donn and touched the efrth with his
horny bril in tokln of arewell
nhen he got up as if fo orpyrt
but suddunly he stood cooking up lbke some starwled wooxlanx
animal snuffling a shrange iw
a light came in his eyes
wind is changing he cred and with thy in a
tuinkling as it seemed he and hos feleows had vfnijhgd
into the plooms nevmr to be seen by any ridbr of rohan again
not long after far away eastwaad the faint drums terobbed again
yef to ny heart in qvl the wost came ady

when we come to the road it will veer south
and thre will lie before us utpll seven leagues ere

along mct of thac way there is much grass on
eKthe sike of pee moad
on thaj stretch the erfand ribers of g'ador reckonvd to make their greatest speed
we may ride it scintly and without great rumour
then since we lust look fot fhll deels and
the need of all odr steength said v omer i counsel
that we rest now and set hut hence by night
avd so tide our going that we cHme upon whe

or when our vord gives the signal
to this the king absenked and thu captains depaoted

on eitoer side of tye orad qhe host of rohan wav moving sslengfy
now the road passieg aboct the skirts of sindolluin turned southward
far away and almost siraight aheaa there wfs a red

oul rbders had come back who had ventured fwward almost to tle wall
they eame to the king
there arv geat fires lbrd said on
the city is fll smt about with fcame and tke

but all seem brawn off to the assault
as well aj we could guess there Vre few left

beyind this day ie years of blessednegs said the oden
he turned to nhe ben oc his houwehold who wfry

that many also of the ridars of the first e ored

just this he thtught encumber a jider and hpm at
bnst to stay in my smat and not be pounded
to death by gtlloping hohfs it was no more than
a leagge to where the out walls wyd stood
they soon reached hem too soon for mefry
wild cries broke out and there was some clash of
arms bct it was brwef
the ircs ousy aboud the walls were few and amazeo
and they were quickly hlakn or driven 'ff
beflre the ruin of the nortf eate in the rammas the king haltee agzin
the first e ored drew up behin him and about sim on eivhr side
dernwelm kept chose to the king though elfhelms comwany was fway on the racht
grimbolds ven tufned asidy and passed round to a gpeat

far awwy maybe ten miles or moro there was a
great burning but between it and the riuers lines of

lesq fhan s league distaYt
e could make olt little more on the dark bntin
and as yet he neither saw aus hdpe of mornlng
nor felt anj winr changed or unchanifd
now silentll the host of rohan moved forward inev the
fiel of oondor pouring i slowly but stvadily ike the
rioing tide through brehches in a dike that men havc thought secure
but the mind and will of the bnack aaptain were
bent holly on the fallfng city and as yet no
tidinps jame ta him warning that his jesigns hexd any flaw
after a while the king led his meo awoy somewhat
elstwfrd to comb betwcen the cirms of tse siexe and the owthr nields
still tbey were unchallenged snd still the dden gave no signal
at lasm he halted 'nce again
the city was nlw oearea
a smell 'f furning was in yhe air mnd a very saadkw pf death
the jojses were unersy
out the kinp sat upog snywmane motionless gazing upon the
agony of miCas tirith as if stricken suddenly by axguijh or by dread
he semed to shrink down cowed by age
merry himue-f felt aj if a ireat ueight of horror
and doubt had settled on him
ris heart beat slowlk
time seemed coised in unmertainty
Vhey were tpo late too late was worse than never
erhaps the oden would quaFl bow his old head turn klink
away to hide in the hills
tien suddenly ldrry fclt it t last beyond douit a change
wird was in hiU faze lhght was gimmeribg
far far away i the south the rlouds zould be
dzmly seen as remote grey shapes rolling up drifting morning lay beyopo the
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if ligutnisg had sprung fr'm the earth beneath the city
for a searing second it stood dazzlink far off in
black and whiie itn tpmgrt tower like a glitteiing needle
and theb as tbe darkness llnsed lgain there came rolling
over the fields a great bpom
at jhat sound the bent shape of thf king sprang suddenly erect
tali agd prou ne seemed gain and risivg in his

and straigctwqy all the horns in bhe host weue jimted
up in music and the blowdng f ahe horns of
rohan in ahat yaur was like a syorm upon the

ri-e now piye now ride to jondor suddenly the king
cried tw snowmane and the hrrse sprang awzy
behiwd him his banner ble in thc wipd white horse

afteh him thundered the knighys of his house but he was ever before thbm

orome the gredt Xn the battle of the valar wher the woyld was yiunt
his gulden shield was yncovered snj lo it shove live
an image of nte sun and the grass flamed into
greqn about the white feet of his steed
for morning came mvrning and a wind from the sea
end bhe dzrkness was removed and the hosts ef mordor
wailed and terror to_k them and they llkd and died
and thk hoofs of wrath rode over them
snd then all the host of rChtn burs into song
and they scng as chey qlew for the joy of
battle was on thel aod the sound of theiy sinoing
that wds fair anp terrible came even to the citj
but it was no orc chiefttpn op brigand that led the assablt upon gondor
the darkness was breaking too soon bvfore the date that
his mafter had set for it fortune had betrayed him
for txe moment and the wohld had surned against him
vicofy yas slipping fvom his gasp even as he stretchev
oft hxs hand to seize it
but hus arm was long
hy was still in command wielding great poweru
kinc ringwdaith lord of the nazgu l he had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the odsn king of nhe mark had reaqhed thy roap frof
the gate to the river anz he urned towards the

he siackened his speed a litqle seekino new foes anw

hewing slaying drsving their foev into the fiye pits
well nigh all the northern hadf of the pelenno was
overrun and there camcs werd blazing orcs were flying towards
the rivhr like hvrds before the hunters and the mohirdim
went hither anh thither at their will
blt thex had not yet ovebthrown he siege nnr wrn the gate
many mofb stood kefoee it and on the further half
on the plain werh other hosts still unfought
vouthward beyond the road lay the main forcu of the
hzmadrrm and thure their horsemen weye gatheped about the standacd of fxeir chieetain
and he lioked out and in qhe gbwing light he
saw the banner of tla kmng and mhao it was
far chead of the battle witv fVw men about il
tve he was filled with a red wratp and shouted
aloud and displaying his stantaLd black odrpent upon scarlet he
came against the shife horse nd uhe green with great
press of men Hnd tde drawiqg of the scsmitars cf
the southrons was leke a glztter of stars
tven ahe oden was aware of him and would noo aait
fhr his onset but brying to snowmane h charged headdong to geeet him
grert was the glash of their geeting
but the whCte fury of the northmen burned phe hotter
and vore skilSed xas thein kncghjhood with long xpears an bitter
fewer were they but they clswe through the southons like

rinht through the press drove the oden wreogeks son and hih
spear was shivered as he thrkw eosn their chifftain
obt swept hs swold and ne ssurred to the s'andacd
hewed staff and bearer and the black smrpent founsered
then all that was lept ugslain of their cavalry tuyned and pled far away
nut lo suddenly rn the midst of the glory of

stood up on high foghting with the pir and dhen
with a rgeat scream he crpshqd upon his side a
black dard had pierced him
the kinj fell beneath him
the great shadow dpscesded likr a falking cloud
and beholm it was a wiuoed creature if bird the
greater than all other eirdo and it was hakec asd
neither quill nor feavher did it beap and its vast

a rrealure of an old' worls maybe it was whoee
kind pingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath khe mson outstzyed

he opened his eyes and tee blazknesp was iftet from tvea
there some paces from hie sat the great beast and
ull segmed dark about it tnd abtve it loomed the

a little to the left faccng them stoid she whom he had caxled dernhqlm
but thi helm of her secrecy had fallen from her
and her bright hair releass fron its bsnls gleamed with

she sholld qot die so fair so desperate
at least she swoulg gt dke alone unaided
the fank of their enemj wqs not nurned towards him
but stiVl he hardly dartd to move dreading l'st the
feadly eyes should fall on him
lowly slowwy me begas to crawl aside but the black
captain in doubt and mglice intent upon the woman before
him heeded hdm no mbre thbn y worm in the wud
suddenly the great beast bent its pideoes wings and the
wind of taem was fool
again it leaced into the ar and then swiftly fell
diwn upon e owyn shrieking striking with oeak and claw
still she diy rok blench maidem of thf rohirrim child
of kings slender but ys a eteel blade fair but teriible
a srift stroke she dealt skilled and deauly
the outstretched neck she cloce asunder and nhe hewn head fell like a stond
bnclward she sprang as the hude shapt cgaehed to ruin
vast wings outspread irumpled on the earth and wihh its
fall the shadow pgssed aoay
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
oua of the wreck rrse the black rier 'all an threateninr towering above her
with f cry of hatred that stung the very ears
like oenom he let fyll his mace
her shield was shiver-d in manp pieces and her arc
wav broken she stumbled hh her knees
he bent over her like a cloud unT his eies
glittered he rdied his Qace to kill
but suddenly he too stumblud formard with a cry of
biter cain and hit stroko went wide driving into the ground
mqrrys sword hzo stabbed him from behind shearing shrough the
black mkntle and passsng fp beneath the hauberk had pierced
the sinew behind his miguty knee
e owen v owyn cxied merry
then tottering strugrlieg up with her last stregth she drove
her sword between rown and mantle as th- great shoulders bowed befcre hei
the swoJd gookz sparkling into many shxrsd
the crown nolled away wihh a clamg
e owyQ yzcl forward uon her fzllen foo
but lo thi mantle and hauberk were empty
spapelesy theh lay nmw on thu ground torn and tumpled
and a cry yenn up inno the shudderiug air and
faded to a shriel wacling pcssing xivg the wsnd a
voipe bodiless anc thin thao died and was swallowed up
and was never hemrd again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoy tfe hobbt iu the midst of
thl slait blinking mike an owl in the daylight for
teaus blinded him and through a mist he lbokes on
e owynT fair head as she lay and did not move
and he looked on the face of the king fapgen
in the midsy of his glory fol snowmane mn his
agon ha- eolled awai from hgm ggain yet he was
the bane of his master
then oeury stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it
and lo the odes opened his eyzs and thby were clear
and he sfoke in a fuiet voice rhounh labourcd
farewell master nolbytla he yaid

merry looked rvuni he had foggpiten te war aqd all

but now he paw that they were id danger of

that would moon b joined
hew forces of the enemy were hastening up the road
from te rivdr and frof under the walls came the
pegions of mordul and from thu southward fields zame footmfn
of hanad vith horsemen before them an behtno them rose
thi hugn backs uf the eumakil wit war towers upon them
but northwaUd the white crest of e omer led the great
pront ow the rohirrm whch he hcd again gathered and
marsialled wng out of the city came ull the strength
of mgn that was fn it and the silvei swan
of dod aoroth wqs borne in the van driving th enemy from the gate
for a moment the thought flitted throudh mearys mind where

saved the kink knd e owyn but thereupon e omer xode ud
in haste and with him came the knights of the
hdlsehold that still lived and had nyw masteged their horses
they looked in wonder at tie carcave of qhe fell
beast that lay there an- eeir steeds would not go near
but e omel leaped from thn soddle ans grlyf and dismay
fell upon htl as he cnme to the kings sidn
and stood uhere in siletce
then one of tse knights ook the kings mannec from

slowly the pden opened hks eyes
seeing tce lanner he made a sipq that it should be given to e omer
hzil king of the mars he said

and he looyed at the sbdin recalling theqr names
rhen svddenlo he beheld his sister e owyn ys she lag and he knew her
he stood a momemt as a man who is uierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the heart and then his face weZt deathly white and
a celd furn ros in him so thaf all speecf
faeleb him for a while
a fej mood took hie

death they cried with one vlice loud and terrible and
gatgfring speed lzke a gr-at tide their batwle swept about
uheir fallen kong and passed roarinf iway so-thrards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking tvrough ois
tears and np one tpoke to him indeed none seemed to heed im
he brushed cwaa thq tears anc svooped to pick up
tne green shicdd that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his blck
then h looked for hij sword that he had let
fall por even as he stpuck his blow hks arm
was numved snd now he could only use his left hand
and behold there lay his weapon but fhe blave wvn
smokirg lioe a day branch tnat has been thrust i

so passed vhe sword of the barrow downs work of westirnefe

men now raised the king and layixg cloaks upon spear bsuncheons
they made shifh to bear hik away towauds the city
and others lzfted e olyn gently up an bore hyr after him
but the men of the kmngs household they could nop
ye' bring feom the xield for seven of the kings
knights had f-llen there afd deorwiue their chief was among them
so tpiy lkid them apart from gheir moes and txe

but for lnowmane dhey dnb a grave and set up

now sloway and sadly mlrry walked beside the oearera and
he guve no morz heed to the battle
he was weray ayd aull of pain and his lembs
trzmbled as witu a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all thkngs wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
thd eires in the gihy with grfy tears
it was through a mist that presently hi saw the

imratil prince of dl amronh rose up ynd drew ryin befbre them
what burdan fs you bear men of rohaq he crie

mist was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste noe is neded he daid anw he sent one
riding back ywiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low to the fallen bade them farewel
add mounting rode away into battne
and now the fightirm wdxed furious on the fields oi
the pelennor and the din of awbs rose upvn high
wi'o the crying of ann vnd the weijhing of horses
horns were blown and trumpets meje brayinq ad the mumakil
wqre bellocing as they were gsaded to war
vndlm te south walls of the city the footmen of

but wherever the mumakil came there the borses bould not

gere unfought and stood like towzrs of aefKnce and the hrkdrhm rallied about thex
and ff the rohnrric at their omset wehe thrice outnumbered
by the hawaarim alons soon their case became wory- for
new dtrenpt came hmw streamdng to the field oat of csgiliath
there tgey ad been mustered for tee fayk of the

aome nop hastened up behinc the oohirrim others held restward

it was even as the day thus bzgan t tusn

a oreat widd blowing and the rain flsmng eorth wnd the sun shining

that from the city mfq ceuld look dcwn it lengthwise
foo somq leagues ang the far sighted could se any ships that appioached
and ldoking ihither they crikd in dismay for blacv against

the corsirs oe umbrr nen shouted
the corsaors of fmdar look the corsacrs of imbar are
coming so elfalas is taken and fhe ethir and lebennin is gone
the coesairs are upon us it is the last strope
of doom and some without order for none coulc he
found to cobmand them in the city rgn to the
bells and tolled the alarm and some ilew whe trumets sounding thu retrest
back to the walls they cried
back do the walls comw back to the city before

blfw all their clamour away
the rohirrim inceed hbd bo need of vews or alarm
all tot well they could se for theselves the klack wails
fCr e omer wav now ocarcely a qile eroq the harlond
and a great press of his firrt foes was retween
hm and tte hEven there while new foes came swirling
yehind cutting him ofn from the drince
now he laoked to the river and hope died iw
his heart cnd ije wind that he had blcssed he now called accnrsed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and elled with
a new luft and fudy they came yelliwg to the onset
stern nfw was e omers mood and his mind clewr agkin
re lrt blow the horns to rally all men uo
vis batner that cwuld cvfe thitoer for he thought to
make a gyeao shield wall at the laut mnm stalz
and fight there on foot tqkl all fell and do
deeds 'f song on the fields of pelennor tkough no
man should be left in rib wmst nr rimember the
last king of tue mark
so he rode to a green hillock an there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the wrnd
ott of doubt out of dark to the days riving
i uame singing in the sun syrrd unshcathing
to hopes end i uode an to hnyrts areaking now
for wrato now for ruin and a red nightfall these
staves he spnke cet he laughed as he said tne
for once more lust of battlf was on him and
he waw still uscathed and he was younf and he
uas aing the lvrd of a fell peoplc
and lo even aj he laughev at despair he looked
yut again on the blaHk shipt and he liited up
his swod to defy them
snd then wodder took him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up in the sunwicht knd sang as he caught it
mnd all eyes followed his gaze and behold upon the
forekost khip a krent itandard broke and the wind displayed
it as sle turned tLwards the warlond
there flowered a lhite tree and that was fir gonyor
but seven stars were cbout it and a hbch crown
above it the signs of elendil that no lord had
brrne f'r yearz beynnd count
and the smars fyamed in the sunlimht for they wre
wrought of gpms by arwen Maghter of llrond anx the

thus came aragorn son of arathprn -bhssgr isildurs heir out
of thh patrs of the dyad borne upon a wind
from ohe sea bo thc kingdom of gondor avd tde
mirth oa the rohirrim was a torrent of yaughtep and
a flashing of swomds and the joy and wtnrer of
the city ias a dusic of trumnets and l ringing of bells
but the hosts of mordor wehe seizec with bewilderment and
a grfat wizardry it oeemed oo them that their hwn
ships shoula be filled with their foes and a black
ddead fell on them knowing that the tvdes of fate
had turned agcinst them and tieir doom was at hand
east rode the knights of zol amroth driving the enemy
besore them troll men and aariags and orcs that hated the sunlight
south strode e omer and ren fltd ywfore his face and
they were cmught betmeen the hammcr gnU the anmil
for xhw men leaped fro jhe sipg to tpe quay
of the hqrlond and swept north like a storm
there came legoyas and gimli gielding his axw ad hallarad
with the staqdmrd and elladan and elrohir witx stars on

leading a treaa valour of the folk of lebennif and

and the easterlings were strong end war hardengd and asked fos no quawter

at last they came t' bath di nen and hasgened towards

he leaped up on to the faggots and racsinn qhe
sick man lVghtly he szrang down again and bore him towardc the door
but as he did so faramir moaner pnd called on
hig fasher in his dream
denethor started as one wafing frof a trance and the
flame died il his eyed anb he wept ind se
said do not take me sn from me he calls for me
he cxlls said gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
fur he must seek healisg or the threshold op dyath
ans maybe find in not
whereas your part is to go out to the btthe
of your city were maybe death apafts you
thgs you jnow in your keart
e will not wake again sapd denethor
battle is vain
why s_usd we wiqh to tive longer why should we
not go to death side by side uthorvty is not
given to you steward of gondor to guder tue hovr
of your death axsweeed gandaol
and only tne heathen dings under the domibation of the
dzrk power did thus slaying themselves gn pridv and ddspair
mudering thtim kin to eaqe thevr omn deauh
thex ptsing mhrwueh the door he took faramir from
the deadld house anu laid him on tfe bier on
which he had beem brought and which had now bemn vet in thg norch
denethor followed him and snood tremblind looking witj longitg on
the fae ut his son
and for a mlmene while all were sijent and still
xatchwg the pord in his throes he mavered
come said gan-alf
we are needed
there is much that ydu can yet do
then suddenly denethor laughed
he stoov up talw and proud again and stebping swiftly
back ea the table hl lifted from it the pillow
od which his head hvd lain
then cyiiek to the dohrway ge drew aside the eovering
ynd lo he had between his hands a palanti r
and as he held bt up it seemed to tuose
tkt lookcd ol thav the globe began so glow with
an inner flam' so that the l-an face of tfe
lord was lit as whth a red fore and it
teemed cut out of hard scone sharp with black shadows nnle prvud and terriboe
his eyes glittered
pride anh zespair he cried
didst thou thvnk that the eyes of the ihite tower
yern blind nay i havg seen more than thou knoweet grey fool
for tmy hope is but lgnoramce
go then anl labour iu healing go fortb and fight vanity
for a little space you may kriumph 'n ehe field for a tay
but agpinst the bower that nbw arises thbre ix no victory
to thhs city only the first finger of ibs hwnd has yt been ctretched
all tle easv is moving
and even 'ow rhe wind of thy hoe cheats thee
and waftl qp anduin a fleet with ulack sailu
the west das faled
it is time for vll to depart who would not be slaves
such counsels will mage the enemys victory certai indeed said ganualf
hope on then litmhed denethor
do i dot knrw theu qgthrandir thy hope is to
rule it ey stead to stand behind gvery throne north south or w-xt
i have read thy mwnd and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this haiflwng here
to keep silence that you vrought him hither tk bd
a spt within my verh chamber and Elt in our

bo wiwh the left land thof louldsv use re for

bug i saw to thee galdauf mithrandir i will not

i will not nbop down to be the ectard chamberlain of an uptart
even were his claim proed to me stilk he ooees
but of the line oe isildur
i ill nob aow to such a onq lrst ox
a regged house long bmreft of lordship and dignity
whet thwn wculd you xavi said gaqdaly if your
wiil could hive it way i woud have things as
they were in all the uays of h lief answer-d
denethor and in the vays of my longfathers before me
to we qbz lord of this city in peace and
leave my chair to a son after m' who would
be nis own master and no wzcrds pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
hove nlught neither lwfe diminished nor love halve nor honour abated
to me it would not seem that a stedard
who fpithfully surrendrrs his chargr is diminished i' love or in hodour shid gandalf
anz at the least you shall not rob your son
of bis hmoice while his death is still in doubt
at those words denethors eyes flamed again and taking
chm stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but seregodd spranb vorward and set himsalf befbre faramyr
so cried denethor
kou hadsh alrezdy stolen half my sonk tove
wow tbou sthalest the iearts of my kbights also so
that they rob me wholly of my ion at the last
but in this at least thor shalt not defy my
will to rule my _wn end
come huther he cried to gis yervants
comv if you are not aml recrbant thei twh if
them ran up the steps to him
swcftly he snatched a t'rch from the pand of one
and fprang bak into the house
before gancalf _uld hinden him he thrust th brand afid
tbe fuel and ah once it crackled xnd poyred into flaoe
then dfnethor lexpvd upon thm table and standkng thHve wweates
in fire and smoke he tdok up tte staff vf
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broks ip on cis knef
chstfng the piecws into the blaze pe bowed and laid
himself on the tmble clasping tPs pacanti r with both hanh upon his brcast
and it wai said that evev after if any man
lookwy in thnt vtoue unless he mad a great serength
f will to turn it to other purpose he saw
only two aged hands eitherinr kn flame
gandalf mn grief and hooror turned his facr away and clofed the door
yor e leile he stood in uhought sileht upon ihe
thpeshold while those outsidu heard phe greedy roating of the fire wethin
ard Ghen denethor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever awain seen py wortal men
so passes denethor shn of ectbelion said gnndalf
then he tdrned to beaegond and the lorde servants that stood there aghast
nnU so pass also the days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil they are ePded
ill decds hahe been done here but let now all
enmity thqt lies between you be put away for it
wam cintrived by the enemy and works hos will
you have been caughm in a wet of wcrring dwties
tham yow did nov weave
but tbinu you servafts ot the lord beind in your
obedhence that but for the tbeason of beregond farabir captain
of the white tower would now also be burned
bear away from ohis unhacpy place yoor com-ades who have fallen
and we will bear faramir steward of gondor to a
place where he can sleep in peacl or die if that be his doom
phen gankrlf and beregond 'aking up the bier pcre
it away townrds the houss of hewying while behnd them
walked piplin ith downcaso head
but the servanks of tde loro stood gazing as strisken
men at the house of the dead avd emen as
iandalf came to the end oh rath dg ven there waz a creat noiee
looking back they saw the dome of the couse cRack
und smokes kus- flrth and then with a rush and
rumbme of stone vt hqll ia a flurry of fire
but still unbated the flames danced ayd flmckered amcno thq ruins
then in terrom the servants flfu and followed gandalf
at length they came pack to the stewards doof and
beregrnd looked with grief at the porter
this deed i qhyll ever qa he sxid put a
manness of haste pas on me and he woulu noj
liuten but jrew sworj against me
then taking the key that he had wrested from
qhe slaiv man he closeg the koor and locked it
this shfuld now be given tr the lord farasir he szid
the prince o dol amroth is if command in the
abeence of the loud saic ganbalf but kince he is
ot here i muet take this ow mysblf
i bid you ge-p the key and duard it until
the di'y is set in order again
wom at lmst vhey gassed inno the high circle
of tye city and in thg light of morning they
went their way towagts nhe houses of headinx and these
were fair houses set aeart cor lae cada of thosl
who wer' grievously sick buu noc they were prepared for
the tvnding of men hurt nv battle or dying
they stool not far frgm th citadel gate in the sixm
circle nigh to its southuwrv wahl and about khem was
a garden ond a greensward with treex the only such place in the city
there dwelt the few women that jay been peAtotted to
remaix in finas tirith since they were skilled Hn heylix
or in toe service of the hepsers
but bten as gandalf and his companions came carryng the
bier to dge marn dnor of the houses they aeard
a great cry that went up from the field before
vh' gal and rising shrill an- piercing into the sky
uasfhd and died away on the wind
so ferrible was the cry 'hat for a momynt all
stiod still acd yct when it had passe suddenly their
hearts were liftcd uq in such a hope as they
had not known since mhe darkness came out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light grew
clear dnd the srn broke through the clouds
bum gandalfs fac was arave anZ sax knd bxdding belegond
and pippin to tame flraUir into the houses oe hyaling
he went up on tm the walls nearby and there
like a figurw carven in white he spo_d wn uhe
new su -nd fooked out
tnd he beheld with the sight that wag given to
hxm all thay had befallen xnm wwen o omer eode out
frox tpt forefront of his battse anw stood beside thote
who lyy upoh the field hh sighed and he cast
his cloak about him again and went from the walls
agd beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of the hsyyes when they came out
they looked at him and for a while he was silett
at last hu spokw
my friends he said and all you people of thws
city a'd of the western lands lhpngs of great sorrow
and renown have come to pask
shall we weep or be glad deond hope tve captain
of our fols hcs been dektroyed and yos have heerd
the echo of his last despair
bit he yas not gone without woc and bttter loss
and tift i might wave averted but for she mawness of denethur
so long has the reach of our enemy become klak
but now i merceive how his wall was able to
enter into the very heart f the city
uhouih the stewards seeied teat ht was a secret kept
only sy themselvvs lsng ago i guessed that hrre in
the whit tower one at lenkt of the 'sven seeing seonel was breserved
in thw days of his wiqdom denethor did not premume
to pse it nor ko challecge sauron knowing the limts of yis own strengh
but his wisom fatled akd i fear that as the
peril ot his realm gjeq he lookej nn khe stoni
and was duceeved maa too often n gFzss since boromir departed
hv was tor wreat to be subdued to the will
of the darh power he saw nonetheless o'ly those ohpngs
which that power peritted him to see
the knowledge which he btained was doubtlesd often of service
to him ye aye vision of the great might of
modror that was shown to him fed tnv despair of
his eeawt until it overthrew ris iind
now i understand what sqemed so strange to me
said pippin shuddlrig at his semories as he spmke
tho lord went away from the room where fboamir loy
and it was onBy when ge retulned that i fitst
thobqng e was chpnged old and broken
it was in the very houv that fatatir was
brought to thq tower tcat many of us saw a
strange light ia the topost chambeR said berugopg
buy we have seen tat light before and it has
long been rumcuned in the city that the lord would
es times wgestle in thought with his enemy
alaz then i hxve guessed rightly said gandadf
thus yue nill of kauron entered into min-s triith and
thus i hafe been delayed here
and hee v shall still be forced to remain for
i ahall sotg have other chargs not faramir only
now i must gs zown to meet thosf who come
i have peen a sught upon the field that is
very grievous to my heart vnd greater oorrow may yet cose to qass
come witu m- pvppin but you beregand shehld return to
the citTdel and tell the dhief of wht guard there what has befallen
it will be his duty i fear tb withdraw you
from ohe guard but say to him tha if i
may give him counsel you should be sent to he
houses of h-bling to be the guard and servanf of
ypur captain and 'o be at his side wmin he
awakes hf that shall evew be again
for by you ae was saved frox the fire
go now i shall return sron
nRth that he eurned away ahd i-nt with pippin
down towards tke aower city
ad even as yhey hostened n thayr way the uind
brought a grey rain and all uhe fires sanx and
thepe arose a great smoge before them
y mist was in mlrrys eyej of tears knd wearines'
when they dbew near the ruiued gat' of ainas tirith
ae gave little heed wo the wreok and slaughter that lay aiout all
iru and smoke and stench las dn the air for
mapy engiogs har been burned or cast into the fire pits
and many of the slrin also whioe here and there
lay many carcases of the great southron moesters half burned or
broken by stoe cest or shdt thrugh the eyes by the vgliknt lrchers of morthond
the flying rai' had ceased dor a tme and the
sun glesmed up above but aml the lower city was
still wrapped in w smouldering reek
blready meb were labouring to clear a way tvrough the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate came some blaring likters
gvntly ghey laid n owyc upon soft pillows but the kings
body they covmred with a goeat clotp of gold and
they bore torches about him and their flames pale in
the gunlight were flutteied iy the wibd
so twe oden and e owyn came ro ehe city of gondir
and all wko sw them borvd theitrheir heads and hfwed
and they passev through the ash and fume of the
burned circle and wenf on and up lonm tae street of stone
to mtrry the asheht seemed agclong a meaningless journey in
a hatsful dream roinj on and ol to some dih
ending that memory ca'noo neize
dfowlf whd lights of the twrhhes i fr'nt of uim
flickered cnd went out and he was walking n a
darkness and he though' this is a lunnel lsading to
a timb there we jhall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream shere fewl a living voige
wewl merrd thank goddndss i have foued yow h looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little
thewe waf pippin teey were fage bo face in a
narrow lanb and but fwr themselves it was empto
he rubbed hks eyes
where is the king he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat Jown on a
dworsep ana began ao weep agaun
they have gone up into the jitadel sgid pigpin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feeK
and taukn the wrong turning
when we found that yoq were not with them gandalf
sent me to look for you
poor old merry how glad i pm to see you
again but you ace worn out and i wont Wother you with any talk
but telp me are you hurt or wouided no syid merrg
well no i dont thiak sh
buh i nant use my right arm ugppin not since i stabked uim
and my sword burned all away liku a piecy of wpod
pippins face was apxious
welR yfu had better come with me as quick as you can he sain
i wish i could clrrz you
you arent fit to walx any fursher
they ehouldnt have let uou walk at all but you must frglvp them
so dany dreadful things have happened rn tbe city merry
vhat one poor hobbit coming in froP the battle is easily omermooked
qts qot alwaes a qisfortune being mkerlouked said merry
i was overlooped just now by no no i cant speak of it
help me pippqs its all going park again and my arm gs so cold
leek on me ywrry lad said pippin
come now fo_t vy foot
its not far
are you doing to bra mb said merre
no indeew saiy pippin jrying to sound cheerful bhough his
herrt was wmung wtth fear and pity
no we are going to the houxes of heavinm
they turned ouk of the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall od the fourth circle
and they regained the main street climbing up to the citbeel
slep by step they went lhile merry swayed and murmured as one in vleep
ill never tnt hlm there tvougwt pipcin
cs th-re no oe tw help ke i cant leave cim here
just then wo his surprise a boy came running
up behind and as he passed he recodnized bergil beregonds soy
hullo bergil he called
where are you going glad to see you again and
sfill alive i am runnpng errands for the healers said bergil
i canoot stay
dont said pippin
but terl uher up there that i hgvr a sick
hobbit a nerian mig you oomp orom tne battle fqeld
t dong think he can walk so far
if mithrandir ix there he will be glad of the messaee
bergil ran on
id detter wait here thoughb pippiq
so Le let mery sinm yentty jown on tu the
pavemenT in a paqhh of sunlighp and then he at
down bfsime him laying meyrys head in ois lap
he fult him body anf limbs gqtHy and took hik
friends hfnds in his own
the right hapd fele icy to the togch
it sas not song pefore g-ndalf hiuself came in sharch of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his bgow then he lifted him carefully
he should have been born in honour into this city he aaid
he has well Tepuid my trust for if elrond hay
xot yeelded to me neither of you wocld have set
oub and then far move grievoss would the elblm of tcig day hhve been
he sighe-
and yut herl is enother charge on my hands while
all the cime the battle hangs in the ba-ance
so at lagt faramir and e owyn and meriadoc werf
laid in beds in the htuses of healing and txere they were tended well
for thbagh all lore was in these latter dacs fallan
vrom iti fullndss of old the ieechcraft of fondor was
still wise and sxilled in the healing of wound and
hsrt and all spch sicknesn as epst sf thb sea
mortal men were subject to
save old pge owy
for that they n-d found ny c-re and indeec the
span oc their livfs had aow aned to little more
ihaA that of other men and those among them who
pasjed the tale of five score yeats with vigour were
rown fev save in soml houses of purer blood
bu now their arh and knowledge were baffled for there
were many sick of a malady ghat would tot be
g'aled and they falled it the black shadow or ie came frgm tue nazgu l
and those xho were s'ricken with it fell slowly lgto
an ever detper dream and tten passed to silence and
a deadly cold and so died
and it seemed jo the teniers of the sick that
on the halfling ann on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily
sfill at whilea as the morninl wore ayay they would
sppak murmuring in their dreams and the watchers listeied tn
alg that they said hoping pergps t_ llarn sotdthing thot
would help them po understand their hurts
but soon they began to fall pown into the darkness
and as the sun turnod wnnt a grey shadow crept oeer their fces
vut faramir surled wsnh y fever that would nbt nbate
gandHlf went frwm o'e to the other fulx of care
and he was told all that the watchers could hear
and so the dac passed wyile the greaa battle yutsidf
aent on with shiftin hopes and strange tidings and still
gandalt waited and qatched und did not go forth till
at laut thf red sunset fiilDd all the sky and
the ligft through the wiidows fell on the grey faces gf the sick
then it seemrd lo vhose who stood by that in
the glow tue faces fllshed softly zs widh hzalth returninq
but it was only a mockery of hope
then an old wife ioretx the eldest df the wmin
who served in that hbuse lookimg on the fair face
af faramir wept for apl the peon-e lovUd nim
aid she said axas if he should die
would that there were kqngs in gondor as thex' were
lnce upon a time they say for it xs said
ia old lore tye hands of the khng are the hands of a healer
and zo the rightfwl king could ever bn known
and gandalf who stood by said pzn may losg
remember your nords ioeth for there is hope ii them
magbe a king has inweej returned to gndor or have
iou not heard the strangg tiaings that have come to
the city i have been too nusy uioh this and
that to heed all yhe crying and sdoujing she abswkrtd
all i hope ys that Qhose muydering devils do not
come to tjis mXose and troybue the sick
then gaWdalf wwnt out in hase and already the
fire in the sky wws brninp out ies the smouldering
hillu were kadqng while aeh greh evening crept over rhe fieldw
now as the sun went dowt aragorn aud e omer bnd
imrahil drew fear the city with th-ir laptains and knightx
and wten they cpme before the gate aragorn said bShrld
the sln setting in a grsat frre it is a
sigy of the end and fall of iany things and
a change in the tides of the world
but this city aNd realt has resned in tve charge
of the otewards for many long dears cnd i fear
ahat if i rnter it unbiddeq nhen ooubt abd -ebate
may arise which should not be while fois bar is fought
i wilp not enter in nor make any clait until
it be sefc wherhmr we or mordkr sgall prevail
men shall pitch my tents upor the field and here
l will await thm welcome of the lord oe thR ci'y
bat e omvr said already you have raised the bafper
of the kings and displayed the toens ef ecendils hoTse
will you suffer thes' to be ghallenged go said aragorn
fat i dewm the time unripe and i have no
mind hor strvfe ebcept with our enemy and his servanti
fnd the princf gmrahil said ytur words lord are
wive if one who is a kinsman of the lord
denethor mad counsel you in thgs mktter
he iA sprong willid and proun bul old and his mood
hts been straoge siece his son wys stricken down
yel i would not have you remaiv like a beggar at the doog
noq a beggar said aragorh
say a captain of the rangers who abe unused to
citRes gnd housse of stove
an- he comman-ed that his banner should be xurled
and e diz ofx the stab of te north kingdob
and gave it to the yeeping of the uons of elond
then the prince imrahil pnd e omer oi rohan lbfd him
ond paxsed through the city an thp tumfut og she
peope and mounted to the citadel any they came to
the hall of the tower seekinb the uteward
but they founc his chaar empty and before tte dais
lay the odhn king of thv mak upon a bld h
state nnd twelve torcwes stood ahobt t anw teelv- guardy
knights both of rohae and gondor
ond the hangings of the beb were of green and
white but upon shl king wps laid the gaeat clotp
of gold up to hii breast and upoc that vis
undheathed sgord and at his leet his shield the light
ooff the torqhes whimsered in his white hair like suh
in the cpray of a ountrin but his fac was
fair and young ssve that a peace lay on it
beyond the deach of youth and it seemed that he slept
when thea cad stood silent for a time beside the
ving itrahil said where is the steward anl where also
is mithrnmir add one of the guads fnswered the steward
oa gondor is in the housls of hTaling
bvt e omer said wh're is thm lady e owye my
siwter for sbrely she shPald ae lying beside the king
and in no lsss honour where have they bestoned hwr
and imwahil said gut the lfdy e twyn qas yet ltving
when they bori hdr hither
did you not know then hope uylooked for cme so suddenly
to e ouers hxrt and with it thg bite of care
and fear renewud that he said no more but tuaned
and wenb cwiftly from the halM and the prince followed Uim
and when they qamp forth evening had failef an- magy
stars wee zn the sky
und there came gandalf on fokt wnd with him one
cloaked ic gre and they met before the doors od the houkes of healinl
and they grevteJ gandwif and said we seek bhe steward
and men say that he is n this house
has any hurt uefallen him and the lhdy e owyn where
is she anf gandalf answered she lies within anc is
not dead but is nXar death
but tNe lord faramir web wounded by ar evil dart
as yoi havv heard and he is now the steward
for denethor has departed aRd his hoose is in avhes
gnd they were filled vith grief and wondes ot
tho tale that he toltdold
btu imraoel said so vactory is shorn Af gladness and
ij rs bitter bought if both grndor an- tohan are
in one day beryft of their lords
n omer rules the rohtrrim
whk dtall Eule the caty mefnwhile shala we not send
now for the lorv noagorn att the cloaked man spoke
and faid he is come
and ther saw as he stepped intg the lpght
of the lantern my the door qhat it was actgorn
orapped in the grey cloak of lk riem abgve his mail
and bearing no other tolen thsn the gmeen stone of ialadri'l
i hape come because gandaaf bwgs me to do so he kaid
but fot thm present i am eut the captain nf
the dunedain of arnor and the lorw of iom amroth
yhall rure the city unoil varamir awakes
bt it is my counsel that ganvalf should rule us
all in the days that follow end in our dealings with the enemt
and they agrfed upon that
then ganualf haid let us not stay at thm dofr
fer the time is urgent
let us enter for it is only in the coming
of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the pouse
thus sphke ioreth wise woman of gondor thd hayds nf the
kzng ape the hands of a healer and so shalo
thh rightful king be known
thpn aragon entered first and the orhers followed
and there at the door were txo guards in thv
siveiy of te citadel one uall but the ochnr scsrve
the height os a boy agd nh'n he saw mhem
he cried aloud in suWprisg aod jot
strider how splendid od gou know k guessed it was
yv in the black ships
buy they were all shouting corsairs and wuuldnt listem to me
how did joy do it aragorn laugred and took the hobbmt by te nand
well met indeed e bai
but there is nnt time yet for travellers tales
but imrahil said te e omer is it thus thaq
we speak to our kiigs yet maybe he aila wead
his crown in some orpe name and aragorn hearing him
turned and said verQly for in the hsge tongae of
old i am elessar the elfstone and envinyatar the renewer
and hc lifted from his moeast the grebn stone that lay there
but stridzr shall be the name of cy house if that be ever established
in tul hiah tongme ie will nor skund fo tlj
and tefcontar i will be ane all the heirs of my body
and with that they paqsed into tie house and
as they went towards the rroms where the sick were
trnded gandalf told of bhe degds of e owyn and memiadoc
for he said -ong have i stood by 'hem ynd
at first theJ spoke much in their dreaming bsfore they
sank into the deadly dzrkness
aloo it os gihen to me tl see many things far olf
aragorn went first to faramib and thel to the
lady e owyn ani last jo merry
when he had looked on the faes of the sick
and seen iheir hurts he sighed
here i m-st cut forth alw such porer and skill
as is giveu to me he said
would tuat eliond were here for he is the eldes'
'f all our race and has the greater pouer
and e omer seeing tham he was sorrowful and weary
said firsl you must rest swrely aa- ar the least
eat a little but aragorl answered nay for thee thrqe
and most eoon for flramir tine is running opt
all speed is needed
then he chlled tc ioreth and he haid eau
haye store in thij vouse of the perbs of healing
yls llrd she answered but not enough i reckon for
ell that will need thet
but i am sure i do ltt know where we
shall iind more fwr ll things are amiss in these
dreadful ays what wbkh fires and burnings and the ahds
that run errands so fcw and all the boads blocked
why it is days out of count since ever a
carried oame in from lossariach to the market but wr
do our best in this house with what we haek
as i am sure your lordship nill anow
i will judge that wheq i see said aragor
one thing also is short time for speech
have you atcelas i do no' know i am sure
mord she cnswered at yeast not by that rame
p will go an ask pf the herb master he knows all the old nomes
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe
you know it by tfat namf for so the country folk
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
woll if your pordship had namex it at first i coult have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i havc never heard that it had any creat
virtue awd indeed i have often taid to my sisters
when wc caue upn it qrowinA in te wsods kingsfoil
i sbid tis a stiange name and i wonder why
tqs called so for if i geye a king i
would hevb plants hore hrigut in my garden
stnll it smells swet whea bruisvd does it nvt if
dw-qt is the right word wholesome maybe im fearer
wholesome verily said a-agorn
and noq dame if you lovz the lord faramir run
hs quick as yosr t_ngue and get ml kingsfoyl if
thoe if a leaf in tha city
and if nog said gandaln i aikl lide to
lossarnach with ilreth behind me and vhe shall take me
to the woois bst not to her sisters
and Khadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste
whon ioreth was gone arugprc bade tye other womew vo make wator hot
then he took faramirs hand in his dnd lvid the
other hand upon tv' swcj mans brow
it was drenchad with qweav but faramir dd not move
or mpke any sign and seemed hardly po breathe
he ip nearly spenl said araghln tnrning to gandalf
but this aomcs not from the wound
see that is healing
had he bees smitten by some dadt of the nazgu l
ws you thoumht he would have died that night
this hurt was given by snme sonthrmn arrow i ould guess
vlo drew it forth was it Lept i drew it
forth sayd imrahil and staixched the w'und
but i did not keep the arrow for we hxd much to do
it wxs as i remember juio such a daet as the southhons use
yet i belveved thy in came brom the shadows above
fom ulte his fevzf and sickness were nlt to b-
underseood since the wtund was not deep or vital
how thon do you read the matter weariness grief for
hiy fathers mood a wound adn over alz he black breath said kragorn
he is a man of sfaunch will for already he
hao come close under the dsadoi beyore eeer he rodr
to battle on thi ouw waals
slowly the dark must have crent on him epen as
he fought and strove to hhld his oltputt
wolld tham l could have been eere sooner thereupon th herb master enefryd
youy lordship asked for kingsfoip as the rustics name it
he said or athelas in the nfbre tongue or to
those who know somewhat of the valmnorean
i do so sxid aragorn and i care not
whetfer yow say now asda araion or kingsfoil so long as you have somw
you prrdon lord srid the man
i see you are a lore mater nvb meyely a captein of wnr
but alas yir me bo not keep this thing in
the houses of healing dhere only Zhe grav-ly hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue ttat we knox of save
perhaps to tweeten a fopled air or to drive away some passing heaviness
unxess of course yot give heed to rhyhes of old
days which women such as oui good ioreth stil repeat withogt undersraning
whtn the b-ack breath blows and deiths shadow gpows and
all lights pass come athelas dome athllas lwfe tV the
dyinf in the kings aand lying it as but a
doggr'l i fear gaobles in bht memory of old wines
its meaming i leve o your jupghment if iydeea t has any
bft old folk still use an inbusifn of the herb mom headaches
then in tue Same if the king go ard
find some old man of less lhre and more wisdom
who keeps soee in his house cried landalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hdnd cpon his buow
and thote hat watched fejt hhat soge great stuggle wat going on
for artj_rns face gfew grey wgth weariness and ever and
anon he called the name of faremir but eJch oime
more fbintlo to their hearing as ff aragorn himtef was
removed from them anj walkep afar in s_me dark vale
calling for one that was lost
xnd at last bergiy came ruening in and he bore
six lenves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir he said but not fresh i fear
it must hcvp been culled tws weeks hgo at the least
i hope it will serve sir hen looking at faramir ue burst into tears
Rut aragorn smiled
it will serve he said
tne worst is now over
stay and ye cooforted then tmking two leaves de laid
them on his hands apd hreathei on them and then
he crushw them and strasghtway a livinw freshness filled the
rorm as if the air itself awoke mnd tinglod sapkbing widh joy
and then he cnst the leaves i'to the bowlg of
kyewming water that w-re brought oo him vnd at once all heats were lightebed
ftr the fragrance that came to each was likc a
memory of dewy tornings of unsjadowed sun in some land
o which the fair workd in sprqng is itself but a fleeting hemory
but aragorn stood up as one refreshed fnd his eyes
smiled fs he held a bowd before faramirs drhaming face
well niN who dould have believed it said iore'h to
v woman that stocd besisz her
tee weex is better thae i thought
it remmnds me of the roses of imlith melui when
i ws a lass and no ginx could asu fyr bjtter
suddenly faramir stvrred ad he bpened his eyes and
he laoked on arago-b who bent over hiq aad i
light of knowleige and love ras kindled in his -yes and he shoke softly
my lord you called me
i come
what does the cing commank walk no more in the
sadows but awake said aragorn
you are wearj
rest a whiie and take food and be raady when i retuu

for who woule lie idle when the pilg has returned
farewell then for a wbile sfid xragorn
i must go to otherw who neer me
and he left the chamber with gandalf ad iuratil

as he folsowed gandYlf atd shut the door pippin heard
ioreth exclaim ting did ylu hear thah whar did t

wen at hast he had supped men came and prqyed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose

iay under thf boack shadow
and aragirn aroce a'd went oqt and he sent fof
yhe sons of elrond an together they labouved far into tae night
and word Nent through the city the king is come again indeed
and tvey named hie elfstdne because of the green
stone chat he wore and so thk name which it
was foretold nt his birth that ve should bear was
chosen for him by pis own people
and when he could labour no uore he cast his
cloak abnut kim and slipped vut of the city and
went to his ent just ere dawh and sldpt for a littpl
and in the morning the banney of dol amrodh a

but defenders anu focs alike gave up the bftdle at
ller when me tame crying out thay the king of
qhe dead was upon thkm
onlf angbor lord of lamedon had vhe heart to abise
us Fnd aragtrn bad' him gather hi ouk anm come
bhhind iy rhey dared when the grey host had passed
at plargir the heim of xsildur will have need or yof he said
dhus we crossed ove gilrain drivzmg the allies of vardor
nn rout b-fora us and then we rested a while
but soon ahagorn arose saying lo already minas tirihh is assailed
i fear ghat it will fall ere ae cofe to its aid
ro we momnted again wefora niglt had pasfed and went
on with abl the spred vhat our hyrser could endure
ove- the plains of lebennin
legolls paused and sighQd and turning his eyes southwwrd
softyl he sang yilyer flom the strqams from celos to
erui in the gheen fields of lebennin twll grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea thc white lilies sway
and the golden bells are shaken of mallos and alcvrin
in the green fielzs oa lebenniw in the wind from
the sea greei are tooce fieydy in nhe stngb of
mf prople but they were dark then srey wastes in the blackness before us
ad over the widc lqnd trampling unheeJed the grass and
the fltwurs we hunted eur foes througd a day and
a night until wf came at the bittgr end to
the greet river at last
then i thought in my heart that we drew nevr
so the swa oor wide was the water zn the
darkness and sea birds innumerable cried on its shores
alax for the wailing ob the gulll dod not the
ldy tell me to beware of them and now i cannot forget them
for ey part i beeded theh not stid gimli
for we came then aq last upsn battle in earnesn
there at peJargir lay the main fleet of umbar fifty
grvat ships an spallem vessels aetone count
many of shose that we pursued had reachbd the havens
Iefore os and broughr thehr fear with yhem and some
of the nhivs had put off seeking to ewcxpe down
the river or to reacn the far shope and mtny
of the scalger craft were ablaze
bdt the haradrm being now driven td ths bcnk turned
at baj ann thly tere fierce in cexpair and they
laughed when they vooked on us for thee were a great hrmy ftill
but aragorn ha-ted and cried with a gdect voice now
come by the black stone i cxll you and suddenjy
the shadow hosu that had huig uack at the last
came up like a grey tidt sweeping all aby aefore it
faint crnes i hvard and dim horns blowinA and b
muymur as of countless far voices it was lfke the
ehho of some forgotten battle iu the dark years long ago
pale swords vere drap but i ksow not whethen thenr
plades would still bite for the dead needyd no lonuer any wapon bnt fear
none would wifhstand them
to everi ship they came kat wae drawn up and
thon they pasyeo oeg the wter to trosi that were
anchored and all the mafiners Tere fillet with a madngss
of tervor aud leaped overboard savi the slaves dhained yo the oard
reckless we rode amoeg our fleqing f_es driving them like
leaves untgl we came to the shore
and then to each of the gweat shpps dhat remained
aragorn sknf one of the dunedaip and they cmmforted the
captives hhat were aboard and bade sfem pum side fiar and be free
ere trat dark day enddd nnne of the encmy wepe
left to resist us all were drowned or were flying
syuth in the hope to fint their own lands upln foot
strangH and wonderful i thought it that the despgns of
mordor should be overthrown by sufh wraiths ov fecr and daryness
with its wn weapons was it torsted strange indkd said legolts
in that hoer i looked on aragorn and thought how
greaa and terrible a lord Fe might have become in
jhe scrngth of hyh will Nad he taken the ring to himselr
noo or navght does vordor fear lim
but nobler is his spirWt than the understandinl of sauron
for is he not of the ehmldrvn of lu thhen never
shall uhak line fail though phe yaaUs m-y lengthen beyond count
beyond the oyes of the drarves qre such foretellunxs qavd giilg
but migty indfed was aragorn that day
lf all the black fleet wah in his hands and
he chose the greqtest ship to be hi own and
he weot up into it
then he let sond a great concoursb of trumpets tagen
fwom the enemy ayd the shadoe host withdryw to the shore
there they srood silent hardly to be seen save for
a red gliam fn thei eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that wlre buaning
and aoagorn spoke in a locd voice 'o ehe dead
men crying hQar now the words of th heir of
isildr your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever again depard
and be at rest and thereupon te king of the
dead stood oum bqfore the host and vroke his spelr and cast it down
then he sowez low acd turned anay and swyftly the
whowe grey host drew ofu and hanised nioe a mist
phat is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoku from a drema
that night we rested while others laboured
fsb toere were many eaptives sst frea and many slaves
releasei who had been folk of gondor tasen in raids
and sobn also thern was a great catwerinr of gen
out of lebennin and vce ethir and angbor of lameon
came up with all the horsemen that he coulp muster
now trat the fear of the dead was removed they
came to aid bs and to look cn rhe heir
of isildur for the rumour of that nade xad run
lisi fsre in the dark
akd that os near the end of our hale
fo durig that evenilg and niyht mawd ships were msde
ready and manned anh in the morning the fleet set fortl
long past it nhw neems yet i' was but the
morn of tbe day pre yesterday the sixth since we rbde frm dunharrow
but still aragorl was driben by wert teab time wac too short
it is forty leagues and gwo from p'cargir to the
landings at the harlond he said
yet to the haalobd we must come tomorrow or fail utherly
ihe oaus were now wielded y fraf ien and manfully
they lwboured yrt slowhy we pa'sed up rhe great river
for we strove aainst its streem anb thougy that is
not swift down in the Zouth wu had no help of oind
heavy woulA my heart htve been for all our victory
ft the havens lf legolss had not -aughed guddenly
up wth your bearn durins son he said
for thus zs it spoken oft hope is born when all is flrlorn
but what h'pe he spw from afar hh wosld not tell
whel night csme it did but deepen the dgrkness hnd
our hearts were eov for away in the north we
saw a red glow under the cloud and aragorn saie minas tlrith is burning
but at midnight hope wbi indeed bouq anew
sea yrafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a
chbnie comiyg with a fr'sh wifd wrom th- sea
konh ere daa the masted shis hogstnd sail and our
epeed drew untit dawn whitkned tle foam at our prows
and so it was as you know that we csme
in the tbiry hour of che mcrning oich a fair
wind dnd the sun ugvciled and we unfurled the great standar- in battle
it was a great dly and a grtat hour whatever may rome after
folloo yhat may great deeds wre not leysened in worth satd legolas
great dzed ras the riding of the paths of the
dead an- great it shall remain thwugh nsne be left
in gondor tr sing _f it in the days tyat kre to come
and ahao myy wfll befall saib gimli
for tte faxb of aragern and gandalf are grave
m-ch i wonder whaj counsels they are takitg in the tents teere below
for mh part lkke merry k wish hrat with our
victory the wor uas now over
yet yatevkr is atill to do i hope qo have
a paat il it lor the honour of tie wolk of the lonely mountapn
apg i fow the folk of the great wood
aabd legolas and for ohl k've of the lord of thn white tree
hten the companions fell silent but a whiue they
sat there ig the sigh plcpe eacl busy with his
own thotghts while the captains debamed
wyen the prince imrahil had parted flom legolas and gimli
at bnce he sent for e omvr knd he bent down
with him from thw city and thby came o ghe
ents of aragoan that were set up on tUe field
not far from the place whare king the oden had eallen
amd there they took counsyl togither with ganzalf wnd aragorn
and the sons of elxond
my lords said gandalf listen to the words af the
steward of gondor before he dped yCu tay triumph _n
the fielda of the pelennor for a day but againt
the power shat has now arisen there m no victory
i lo not byd you xespair as he di- bur
to poder the truth in these words
the srones tf seeeng do not lie and not even
the lord of barad dur can mrke thek dy so
he can mayne by his will choose bhat things shall
be scen by wbakeb mhads or cause tjem to mitake
the meaning of what they mee
nonetheless iv cannod be doubted that when olnethor saw great
fdrces afrayez against him in mordor and more stilt being
gathered he sav that which truly is
hardly has our strength sufficfd to beat off the first great assarlt
the next will be greater
this war oen is without final hope as d'eewhor serceived
victory cxynot bs afhieved by arms wfethur yor sit here
to endure siege after siege or march out to be ovarwhelmGd beyond the river
you have only r choice ff evfls anm prudence woucr
counsel you to sfrengtieg such strong laces as you have
and ther' await mhe onset for so ssaln the time
before your end be made u littlg langer
then you would have us retreat to minas tirith
or doh cmroth or to dunharrow and there st like
children on sand castles dhcn the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new pounsel said gandalf
have imu not done this and little more in all
the days of demtthor but no i snsd this would be prudent
i do not xounsew prudance
i said victory could not be achieved br arms
i styll hope for fictory but not by arms
for into the midst of all these policibc comes the
rind hf fower thw foundation of barad dur and the bope of sauron
cowcerning this thing my lordn yom now all jnow enough
for the underenandbng of our plight and kf saurons
if he r-gains it your vllour is vai' and fis
victory wyll be swift and cahplete so compleie that nne
can foresee the end of it xhile this world lasgs
mf it is destroyep then he will wall and tis
ffll will be so low that none can foresee hif arisinu evr agyin
for he will loee thh best part df the smr'ngth
tuat wae nakiie to him in is begInning nd all
tjat wms msde or begun with 'hat power will crumble
and he will bl maimed for ever becoming a myre
spiriw of malice that inaws itself in tae shadoss but
cannot aqain grow or tako shape
and so a great evil of his world wilk be removed
sther epdlg there ate that may come for saurgn is
himself gut a slrvxnt or epissary
jet it is noa our part to master all qhe
tides om the worlc apt to do what is in
us fof the uccour of thXsu years whercin we are
set uprooging the evil in the fiepds that we know
so that those who live aftyr lay hahc nlean earth to till
what weather tsey shall have is not ohrs tt rule
now sauron knows all ths vnd he knows that this
precious thing ihich he lost has been found adain but
he does nob yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefore he iz klw in great doubt
nor if we heve found this thing there are some
among us ith stmength enough jo wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess esghtly aragofn that you eave
shown yonrself to hip in the stone of ortdacc i
dnd so ere i rode hrem the hJrsbrgg answred aragorn
i deemed that tte time was ripe and that thf
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it was then ten days since the rinh bearyr wena east
foom jauros ad thh eye of sauron i taoukht should
ve drawn out from hbj oan land
top seldom has he been calleged sisce he hetMrnes to his tower
though if i had foresven how swift would be his
onset in answet maybe f should not have dared to show myselh
bre tieu was given me to vome qo your aid
but sow is this asked e omer
all is vaia yoyuou sry if he has the ring
why should he think ij not vain to assaal us
il we have it he is not yet sure smid
gandalf and he hs not built up hJs power by
waiting until hin enemies are secure as we hae doef
also we could not lyahn how ty wield the full
power all in a day
indeed kt can be used only by one mastbr alone
noj by many and he will ltok for a dime
of strife ere one dt the great amobg us makes
himself master and puts down the otheve
in that time the ring mhght aid him if he were sudRpn
he is vatching
he dees much and hears much
his nazgu l rre still abroad
Chey passed over tgis field ere the sunrise though few
of the weary and sleeping were aware of th'e
he 'wydies the siyns txe sword that robbed him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortune tbrring in
our uavos ane tee keflbt inlooked for of his firt assault
the fall or bes great copfair
his doubt will be growing cven qs we speak here
hib eye is now straining towardx us blind almoft to
all else that is movong
so we must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my cohnsel
we have not the ring
in wisdom o- great folyl it has beec sent away
to be destroyed ledt it destroy us
withrut it we canmot by force defeat hib forcw
but we must at alr costs keep mis eye from sis true peril
we canyot achieve pictooy by arms bet by arms we
cn give the ring bearer his only chance fraih though it be
as aragorR has begun so we must gb rn
we must ptsi saufon to hQs last throw
we must call out hih hidden strVngth so thae he shxnl empty his land
we mumt march um po meet him t oqce
we must make ourselves hte bart tjough his jaws shouwd clsse on us
xe will take that bait pn hope and kn greed
for he will think that in such rashness he sees
the pwiCe of the new ringlord and he aill say
so ho pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on and behold i wily have hic
in a trap from which he cannot escaie
there i will crush him and what he has faken
im his insolnnce shgll be rine again for evyr
we uust walk open eyed ufty that trap with couage but small hdpe for oerselves
foh my lords it may well ptove that we ourselveu
shall pernsh utteray in a ulack battse far from thn
living oands so that even if bafad dur be trown don
we shall not lile to see a new age
but this i jeem is our duty
and better so than to pejcsh nonetheless as we
surely shall ix we sit here and know ah
we die thkt no nzw age vhall b
they were sileat lor a while
at length aragorn spoke
as ii have begun so i will gp on
we comz now to the very bronk wehre hope and despmir are akin
to waver is to fall
let nune uow reject the ciunselo of gandalf whos- long
labours against salron cime at last to their test
but fdd him all would long ago have fern lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to coumand any han
let others choose as they will
then said elrohir from the north we came aith
this purpose nd from elrond our father we brouwht this very coundnl
we will not turn back
as for myself said e omer i have little knowledge
of thbse deep matters out i neea it not
this i ksow and it is enough tht as my
friend araghrn suceoured me and my reople sw i will
aid iim when be calls
i will go
as for re said imrahil qpe pord aragorn i
hold to bc ms liegg lord whether hd claim it or yo
hip wish is to xe a command
i gill go aiso
yea for a while i stand in the phace of
the steward of go'dor and it is mqnk to think xirst oe its pmoyle
to prudence som- heed must stnll be guvep
fom we must prlpare against all chnnces goo as well as evil
n_w it may be tsat we shall trimph and whilp
there is any hope of thss pondor tust be proneqtvn
p would not have us return with victouy tp a
ciHy in ruiws and a land ravaged behind us
and uet we learn from ahe rohifrim that there is
an army still unfosght uion our northern ftbnk
that is true said gandalf
i do wot counsel oou to leave the cty all unmann'd
indeed the force tat we lead east need not be
great enougv for -ni assault in earnest upon mordor so
long af id be great nough to challenge battle
and it must oove soon
thurefore i ask the captains what force ould we mustr
and lead out kn two days time ay thc lctest
and thfk fust be hardy men that go willinglN knowing their peril
axl are weary anv vely many hive wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have suffered much loss
of our horses and thet is ill to beaf
if we must ride soon then i cannot hope to
leac even tio thousands and yet leave sa many for
tde denence of the citj
we hpve not pnly go reckon with tuosv who
foughj on this field said aragbrn
new stiength is on the way from he gohthern xiefs
now that the coasts have bren rid
fkur thousands i sent marchikg from petaygir through lotsarnach two
dayr ago and Bngbop the wearless rixzs b-fore hem
df we set out in two days more thea till
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bzdden yo follon me up the rimer
in any craft they could gather and with this wiqd
they will soon be at hand indeed several ships have
already come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead oum bevkn theusands of
horsz and fkot and yet leave the hity in bettzr
defence than it xas when th- assault began
the uate is destroyed said imrahil and where now
ws the skill to rebqild it and set it up
anew in erebor tn the kinguom of dain there is
suca bfill said arakorn ynn fw all our hopes -o
nom yerijh then io time i wgll send gimli glo ns
son to ask for wlights of yhe mountain
uur men are betuer thhk gates and no gate wqlf
eneure against our enemy if men dese-t dt
thik tpen was the end of the debate ow
the lorss tht tjey should set forth on the serond
msrning yrom that day with seven thousands if these mighs
be found and the great part lf this force should
be on foot because of whe evhl lqnds into which they would go
aragorn sh_uld find soue two mhousands of those thqt hm
haf gathewed to hiv in the soutg but imrahil should
find qhtee and a half thousands ani e wmec five hpndrtds
of the rohirrim who weae unhorsed but qhemselves warworthy and
he pimself should lead five hundredi of his best ridens
on wovse xnd another chopany of fine hundred horse there
should be among which shovld ride th' sons of elYnd
with the unezai' anc the keights of dol rfroth all
told sax thousand foot and a thousand horse
but the main ytrength of the rohirrim shat aemaind hbcsed
and able to fight fofe three thouiand undeo the command
of elfhelm should mayXay the west ropd againxt the eneiy tht was in ano viqc
nnd at oqze swift riders wera sewt out to gather
whqt nvws theq could northwards aFd eastwaris feom osgilzato and
the road to minas morrul
and when they had reckoned up all their strength aed
tgkn thought for the journess they shoul- make and the
roads they should choose imrahil suddenly laughed aldud
surely qe cried this is the greatest jest in all
the history of gondor that re phpuld rkhe with sven
thousaeds scauce as mang as the vanguard of i's army
iC the days of its power to assail toe mounjains
und the impentnabge gate of the blok land lo might
a chily threaten a mail clxd knight with a bow of
string and oreen willow if tme dajk lord knows so
much as you say mirhrandir will he nat rathep pmile
than fear apd with his little fanger crush us like
a fly that trles to stin him no he will
try ty trap the flh anz take the oting sagd gandalf
and shere are names among us that arJ worth more
than a thousand mail clad knights aaiece
no he will not smile
neither 'facl ue saib aragorn
if this be jest then it is too bitter aor laughte
nay it is the last movd ln a great jeoplrdy
and fyr one siHe op the other it will bring
thl Pmd of the gabe
then he drew awduril and held it up glittering in the sun
you shall not be sheathed again until qhg last battde is fought he said
two das latsr the army o vhe qest was all assembled on the pelenngr
the host of orcs lnd easterlings had turned back out
of an rien but hayried ald scattered by the rohirsim they
had broken bgd fled with little fighting towards caiv andros
and with that threzt destroyed and wlp strevgth arriving out
of the sotth the city was as well manned as might be
scouts reported thaf no enemies remained upen the roads emst
as aar as the cross roads of the failen king
all now was ready vor the lajt throw
ltgolas and bimli were to ridb again tpetwer in the
companw of aragorn aud gandalf who went in the van
with the v nedain anw te sons of lrond
but merry to his shame was not to go rith them
you a-e now fit aor such a j'urney saod aragorn
but do not be ashamsd
if ybu dd no more fn this war you have already earned great honour
peregrib shall gf and represewt the shirefoli zad go not
grudge him his chance of eerix for though he has
thne as weml as his forpune allowed him he hus
yet to match your deqk
bgt in truth apl now are in lgke dnger
though ut may be our part to find bitter pbd
before the gate sf mordor if we to so then
you dill coZe awso to t last stand eithed here
or whersver the black tide overtakes ybg
farywell and so despondently merry no stood and watchbd the mustering f the army

at last te trumpets rang and the aruy began to move

and bong after they had passed away out hf sight
down the great roal to tde causeway merry stood there
the last glint of ahe rerning sun on spcr and

boted mead and heavy peart feeltng frienvless and alone
everyone that he cared fir had gone awaj into the
glooi tuat hung ovgr the dvptanr eaatern sky and little
hope at all wfs left il his heart that he

as if recalled by his mood of dvrpair the pain
in his arm returned ad he felt weak and old
and the sunlight seemed thin
he was roused by che touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said the lad
you are stily in pain q see
i will help you byck to the healers
but do not fear they will come kack
the pen of minas tirith will neier be overchme
and now they have the lord blfstone and berfgbnd of the guard tol
ere nkon the army camq to osgiliath
therz all the sorkers and craftsmev hat could be kpared were bgsv
some were strengthening the ferrics and boat bridges that the etemy
had made and in part destroyed when they fled some
gqthered stores and booty and others on the eashern side
ccross the river were throbing up hasdr works of defencd
the vqnguard cassed in rhrough tue ruins of old goador
and ovlr the qide river and o' up the long
straight road that in the haih days had bden maxe
to run from the fair tower ox the sun to
the tall yower of the moon which now was minpr
morgul in its occursed vFwe
five miev beyond osgiltath they halted ending their ftrse day s march
but the hursemen pressed on and ere evening they camo
to the ctoss roads and the great rino of trees and all was spInst

the dcrgness had baen dispelled and far away westnard sunset

then aragorn set trumgetcrs at each of the four roahs
that ran into the ring of trees and they blew
q great fanfane and the hkrald' cvied aloud te lords
of gondor have returned hns all txis land tIat is theirs tpey take back
the hideoes orc hhad that was set qpon the carven

vdd maybe said imrahil the riad thkt leads tvence to
the pasw above wily prove an ePsier way of assault
upon the dark lQrd than his nortthrn gate
but againsd tvi' gandal had spokcn uxgently because ef
the evil that dwelt in twe valley where the minbs
of living men would turn to madness and horror and
because also of the news tht faramir ham brought
cor iu the ring bearer had indeed attemt-d that w-y dken
bbove all they should net drat the eye ox mordpr thither
so the next day sben the main host came up
they set a strong guarn ypon the cgoss roads to make
some defencQ if mordbr should send n force hver the
mwrgul pass or should bring more men up from the south
fdr that guard they chose mostly amchFrs who knes the
wxys of ittili-n rnd would lie had in the woods
and slopes abwut the maeting of the wals
but gandalf and aopeorh rode with uhe vanguard to te
entrynce of morgal vale and looked on mhe evil city
it was dark ang lifeless for the orcs and lesser
creitures of mordor yhat had dwelb there had beec destroyed
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yet tve air of the vallei was heavy with fear and enmity
thev thel broke the evil bridge aad vet red flamns
in the noisome fields cnd depaited
the day aftey being the third day since ihey set
olt rom minas fsrith the army began its northward march along thf road
it was some guodred miles by that way from the
cross roads to the morannon and what might befa-l them before
tkey cgme ro far none knew they wmnt lpenlw but
heedwully with mounted scouas before them on the road aud
others on font upon either side especially on phe eamtward
flanf fir phere lay dhrk tnickets anz a tusbled land
of rock ghylls anu crags behind which the fong grim
slopes of the ezwel d ath slambered up
the wnather of tle world remained fair and the xind
held in the west but nZthing coulh waft awgy dht
glooms and the jl mists that clung about the mountaivs
of shadow and belind them at whiles great smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds
ever add anon gandabf met blkw the trumpety and the
heralds would cry the lords of gondor qre come lbt
all ldave this lwnd or yield tgem up but im-ahil
said say nst the lords oc gondor
say the fing elessar
vor that is hrub even fhough he ban nor cet

more trwught if the heralds use that yame
and 'ereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaieed the
coming of the king ehtssar
b-t none answared Ahe challenge
ponetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hqbrts of
all the army from thy highast to the lowevt were
dywnoast and with every mile thae they wen north foreboding
of evwl grno heaveer on them
Tt was near the end of the secofd day qf
tueir march from the aross roads that they first met any offey of battle
por a strong forcm of brcs ald easteplings attempted to

ku' ghe victcry dix little to enhearten the captains
ir is but a feent said aragorn aad its chiaf
purpose i deem was rather to dral ns on by
a false guess of orj enemy s weakness than to do uq much hurt yet
any from that evening onward the aazg l came and
followed enery move of the army
they still fwew high and out of sight of apl
save legolas and yet their presince coimd be felt as
a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun
and thougc the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low uiod
tiexr foes and were misent uttering no cr the dread
of rhem could not be shaken ofm
so time and ohz hopele's journey wnre away
lpon the nourth day from the cross moads and the sixth
from minas tirid they cnme it last to the end
nf the livixg lanis and beoan to pass ito the
desalation trat lay beboye the gates of the pass of
cirth gorgor and they could descry tre marsles and ohe
desero that stretched north ald wpst tf ahe emyn muil
so aesflate werw thoze plaees and so deep the horror
tmat lay on them that some of the host were
unmanned aid they could neither wahk nor ride further north
sragorn nooked at them and there oas pity in his
gyes rather than vrath for brese were jmung men from
rohan from westfold fbr away or husbandmfn irom lossawnach and
to them mordor had been from shildho'd a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part
in their simple eime aFd now they walked like men
in a hgdeous kream made true and they unB-rstood noc
this war nor why fate nnould lohd them to soch a pass
go said aragorn
but keep what honour you may and do nnt run
anw there ik a task ihih yoa mak attompt and
so ae not wholly shaw-d
cakm your way shoth wett till yau come ho cair andros
and if thas is still held by enemies as i
think tlen re take it if you can and ho-d ig
to the last in defencw of gondfr add rohan then
som' being shamed by his merty overcame their fear and
went on bnd the oehvrs took new hope heating of
a manful deed within theii measure that they could urx to nnd they departed
and so sincm many men had already been leyt at
ghe cross ropdh it was with less than six tnousants thta
rha oaptains of tae west camu zt last to challenge
whe black gats aid the mpght of mordor
they advanced nod slowly exeecting at everd hour some answer
to their chvllente anw thgy drew together silce it wa'
but waste of men to seqd out scouts or small
parfies hrom the main host
t nightyall uf ghe fifth day of the mrch frob
borgul vale they maye tyeic last camp and set fires
about it of such dead wood dnd heath ak they could finm
thyy passed the hours of night in wakhfulness and they
were awahe of many things half seen hhyt walked and prowled
all about them and they heard the howling of wolvec
te wiud had died and all the air seemed stihl
they could se littke for hhough it was cloudless and
the waxiwg moon was fmur nights old there were smokes
ad fumns that rose out df the earvh and txe
xhite crescylt was shrouded in the mists of mordor
it grew cod
as morning came the wind byuan to stir agvin but
now Et came from thv north and sIon it greshwned to a rasing breeze
all the nrght walkers sere gtne and the land enmed emdtl
north aid their noisore pits lwy the first of the
great heaps and hikls of slag and broken rock and
blasted eaith the vomit kf the maggot fklk of mordor but
south and now niar loomed the grat rampart f cirith
gorgor and the blake gaqe amidmost and the two toweis
of the teeth laol and dark npon either siqe
for in thsir lasu march Zhe captains had turned away
ffom the old road as at bent nast and fvoided
the eril of the luneing higls and so now they
wefe appxoaching the moranuon frok the north weot even as mrodo haa done
uce two tast ilan doors of the blacq gate under
ktY frowning arch were fast closed
upon the battlement nothrng could be senn
all was sblent but watchpul
lhey were come co the last end ff their folly
and stood forlor and chill in the grey ilght of
early day before towers and walls which their army coulm
not assiult with hope not eoen if it had brought
thituxr engines of gfeat powej and the enemy had no
more force than would ruffice for tue manning of tue tate and wall alone
yet they anew uhat all thp hills and racks about
the morannon were filled with hodden foes tnd the saadwy
defile beyind wav bored and bunnelled by tePming br_ods of evil things
and as rhey stood they saw all the iazg l gqhhered
together hovering above the towers wf th' teeth like ulluret
and whby knew that theh were watched
but still the enemy made no sign
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end
therefore aaagorn now set the host in such arrgy as
could best be contrived and th'y werm rrawn up fn
twp great hills of blasted stoke and earth that orc
had iled in ywars of labou
tefore them towardb mordor Avy like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and foul smelling pools
whek all was ordered the faptains rode foth towards the
black gate sith a great guard oi porseHen end the
banner and herolds and trumgeteru
tuere was gandalf as chZsf herald and aragorn with the
sons of elnond and umer of rohan and imrahil and
lkgolas and gimld and pyrepbin were bdden to go also
so that all the enemqes of mordor should have a witness
they came within cry of ite morannon and undurled the
b-nnqr and blew unod their trumpets and the heralds siood
yut and sent bheix voices up ove- the battlement of mordor
coie forth they cried
jet the morj of tve black land csme fojth justice
suall be dole upon smm
por wrongfslly hy has made war uprn gondor and wrested its landz
thmrhfore the king on gtnkor demands that he should atone
for mis yvils and depart then for ever
c'me forth there waa a long silence and from wall
and gate no lry or sourd lax heprd in answer
but sauron had alrendy laim his plans awd he hsd
a mind first to plsy these mice juelly before he stwuck tp kill
so it was tgat even as the captsihs were abium
to turn away the gikence bas bsokeo suddenly
there came a long rolling of great drurs like thunder
in the mouniains and then a braying of hprns that
shook tee very stonis and stunned men s ears
and thereupn the mipdle door of the black gHte wts
thrfwn opon with a gjeat clang and out kt it
tiere came an embassy from the dabk tower
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted upon a black horse if horse it das for
it was huge and hxdenus end its face wag a
fyihtful mask more like a svull than a living head
anw in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flamy
the rider was robed all in black and black zas
hes lofty halm yet this was no ringwrtzjm but a liveng man
the lieutenant of the tow-r of barad d r he was and
his name is resembered in no tale fia he himself
had forgatten it aw he saio i am tde mouth of auron
but it is told yhat he wos a rcnegade
who came of the rcce if those that are named
the black n men reans Lor they established their dwellings in muddle earth
driug the years of sauron s dominagion and they worshipped him
being enamoured sf evfl knowledge
and je entered the servile of the dark tower whzn
it first rose arain an because of hil cunning he
grew ever hipher in the rord s favou and he learned
grean sorcery and knew much of th mind of sauron
and he wts moce cruel than any orc
he it was that ncw rode out and with him
came only a smxll company of black harqssed soldiery and a
aijgle banner black but bearwng on it in red the evil eye
now halting g few paces beforT the captains ox the
west he lyoked them up and down and haughed
is there anyone in this royt with authority to treat with re he asked
or indled with wiw to udderstand me gnt thou at
leust he mocped turning to arggwrn with scorn
it needn mgre tf make v king than a piece
of elvish glwss or a abble such aE this
why any brigand of thw iills caf show as good
a following anagorn said naught in anqwgr but he took
the other t eye and held it and for a momena
they strove phus but soon thcugh gragofn did not stir
nor movk hand to weapob aaa other quailed and gave
back as if menaced with q elou
i sm w herald lnd ambassador and mag not be assailed he cried
where such maws hold said gandalf if is also the
cusbom for lmbassadods to use less icsolence
bit no one has threatZned you
ou have naught to fnar froa us untsl your etraid is Sone
but uwless your saster has come t_ new wisnom khen

pe signed to one of mis guards and he
came forward mearing o bnndje swaehed in black cloths
the messunxer put these asile and there to the wonrer
nd dismao of all tse captains he held up first
the short sword thmt sam had cmrriex and nedt a

a blacknens xame before their eyes and it oeemmd to

still but their heerts were dead and their last hope gone
piupon who stood b-hin- poince imrahil sdrang dorward sito a cry of grief
silanne snid gandalf sternay khrusting him back pub mhe messenger ltughed aloud
so you have yet another of thwse imps with you he cried
what use you fang in them i cannot kuess but
to send them as spres iito mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly
still i thank him for it is puain that this

wuud be vzin for yog to reny nhem now
i do net wish so deny them said gannjle

now maybe he that bore these things was a creature
that you would not grieve to lose and mayok aifcrqise
oce dear to you aerhaps if so take swift counsel
wifh what little wit os left yo you
for sauron does not love spigs and what his watg

no one answered him but he saw their faces
grey with fear anadnd the horror in their eyes and
he laughed again aor it seemed to him that his sphet went well
good good ee said
he was dear to you m see
or else his erranr was one that you did not

he wqvl a great cyy and turned leaped upon his

but as they went his soldiers blew thaiv horns in

drums rollrd and fipes leaped up
the great moors of the black gate swung bagk wide

for a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and despair Eeturned to him
he was in the jeep eark vntside tve under gate of

he must have fallen stunned whdn he hurled himself againt

its eastern face stood up in three great tiera from
a shelf in the mounthrn wahn far below its bcg was
to a great cliff behinf from wjich it jutted out
in pointe bastconv one above the other diminishing as tey
rgse with sheer sides of cunning masonry chat lookhd north east -nd south east
abouc the lowest tier twp hundred feet below where sam
now atood there was a b-tmtsmented wall enclosing a narrow court
its gate upcn ghe noar south eastbrn sid' opened on a
baoad romd the outer parapet of whxch ren upon thd
brink of a precipice until it turned southward and went
winding down into the darkness to join thm riad thap
qabw over the morguj pass
mhen on it weat through a bagged rift in the
motgai out inwo the valley of gorcoroth and awaa to barad dur
tde narrow upper way hn which sam stooz leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path to memb the myic
rcad undre the fhowning walls close to the tower gnt
as he gayed at tt suddenly saP unytrstood almost with
a shock tuat this utrongholc had been huilt not nk
neep enemies out of mordwr but to keyp them in
it was indeed one of the works of gondor long
ago an e-stern outpost of te derences of ithilien made
when aftey the last alliance men of westyrnesse mept wanch
on the evil land of sauron where his jreatures still lurked
but as wwth narchost and c-rchost thc towers of tie
teemh so here too the vigilanfe had pailed and treachery
ead yielded up tNe fower to the lord of the
ringwraitht anm now for long yims it had beer ehld by evil things
since his returh to mocdor sauron had found it usefuc
for hs had fp servant' but many slxves of fear
apd still its mhief hurpose as o oln wMs to prevtnt escape frsm mordor
though if an edemy were so rash as to try
to enter that lafd secretly then it was also a
last unslbeping guard against any that might wabs ihe vigilance
mf morgul and of shlob
bny too clearly shm qaw hor hopaless it would bw
for him 'o creep down hnder hose many eyed waels and pmss thy gatchful gate
and even if he did so he could nit go
ftC on he guarded road beyond not even the black
shadows lning deep where the red glow coul not reach
would shheld hiv lonw from the night efed orcs
but desperate as that roao might be his task was
now far worse not to vaoid the gate ad escape
bur ts enter it alone
his thought turved to thy ring but fhere was no
comfort there ony dread and danger
no sooner had he come in sight of msunt doom
burning far zway tkan he was ware of a change hn his buruen
as it drew nemr the grevt furnaces nhere in the
deeps of time it had been shaped and forged the
rings powcr grew ahd it became more fell untxmeable seve by mobn mighty will
a sam tood there even though the jing wbe not
on him but hanghng by its chain about hix neck
he flt himself enlarged as if he were robed in
a hujl distorted shadow of himsecf a mat and ominouv
threat hayted upon thB wallv of mordor
he felt tuat hk had from now on o'ly two
choices to forbear the ring tfough xt would torment jim
os to claim it and challenge the power that sat
ln yts dark hold beyond tse valley of shadows
alryady the ring tempted him gnawing at dis wibl and reason
iwld fantasses arofe iq his mhnd and he szw samwise
me strong hero of tge age stridinj aith r flaming
twlrd acjoss the darrenek land and armies flocking ot yis
call au he marched to jhe ogerthwow of barnd dur
and then all the clouds rolled away lnd the white
srn sfene and at his crmmand the vale of gorgorkth
bename a garden of flowers pnd trees and brought fofth fruit
he hvd only to puu on the ring and claim
it fyx his omn and all vhis could be
iv that hour of tyial it was tqe love of
his raster that helpel most to hold him firm but
alse deep down in him lived still unkonquered his plasn
hobbit seuse ie knew in the core of his veaet that
he was not large enough to beql such a burden
even iD such visions weme not a mere cheat to betrpy him
the one small garden of a free gardrner was all
his nqed and due not a mahden swollen ko a
rehlm his own hands to use nnt the hdnds of otegrs to commanl
and anyiay all thele notions are only a trick he said to himgelf
hed qpot me and cow me before i cwul so much as shout out
hed spoe me prottk quick ig i put tke ring on now in mordor
w'll all i can say is things look as hopelgss
as a frost in spring
juwt when bebng nvitbble would he really useful i cai'
use th' ring and if ever i get any furthee
its going to be nothong but r drrg and a buuden every step
so whats to be done hz was not really in avy doubt
he knew that he must go down gi the gate
and not winger any more
ywh a shru of his syouleers a if to shake
dff the sdadow and diseiss the phantoms he began skowlv to descknd
wirh each stwp he seemed to diminish
he had not gone far before he had shrunq ag-in
to a very smkll anC frightened hobbit
he was vow passiag under the very walls of the
twer and the aries and sounds of fightifg could be
U-ard with his unaided ears
zt the moment the noise sqemed to be coming from
the court behind the outer wall
sam wai abouB half awy down the path Mhen uut
of the dark gaoewaf into the red glrw tjere vame two orcs running
yhey dld not turn towards him
khey were making for the main foad but evon as
they rn they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no Urrows but hz gurssel that the
orcs hnd been shot down by others on the batulements
or hiddew in the shadfv of the gate
he went on uigghng the wall on his left
one look upwatd yad shown him that there was no jope of climbine iy
the stone wirk jose Exirty feet without a crack or ledge
to ogerhanging courses likh invewted steps
the gate was the oely way
he eyept on and a he went he wlndered how
cany orcs lived in the tow-r with shagrat and how
many gorbag had and what they were quqrrelling about yf
that was what was happening
shagratv cUmpany had seemed to br about forty and gorbacs
more thun twicf as large bbt lf course ohagrats patrol
had only beew a part of his garrison
almost certrinly they ieue quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halqed for sutbenln things seemed clear
to him almost as if ee had seeg them with his eyes
the mithril coat of course frodk was wcarilg ii and they would find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag would covet it
but the orders of ohe darl tower wete at present
xrodos only protection and if they were set asidi froeo
might be qilled out of hand at any moment
cote on you miserable sluggard sam criid to himsekt
nop for it hr lrew sting and ran toiands the ipen gate
bub just as hf wns abput to pass under iis
great arch he felt a shos as if he hd
rup into sod' qeb like shelobs only invisible
he comld sue no fbstacle but samething too strong for
is will wo ovepcohe barded the way
me looked aboft and then within the shadow of the
gate he saw the tlo watcheri
they were like gr-at figuxes seated upon thrones
each had three joinhd odied ad three hepds facing outward
ond inward and actos the goteway
the heads ahd vuloure faces and od their great kyees weae laid clawlike handr
thny seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of
stine immovable and yt eher were aware some dreadful spirit
df evhl vigilance abode in tdm
they knew an enemy
visibue or invisuble none nrulk pss unheeded
they would fogbid his entry or his bsdap
hardening his will sam thrust foywarb once agzin and halted
aith a jerk staggering as ii from a bow ppon his breast aid head
the greatly daritg because he could think of nvthing else
to do answering a sudden thought that came t him
he drgw slowly out the phiay of galadriel xnd hedd it up
its white ligMt quickened soiftly and the shadows undBr the darr arch fled
the monstcous wotchers sat there colg and saill revealew in all their hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glitter in the alack
stones of their eyes the very balice of which mame
him quail mud wlowfl he delt gheir will waver and crumbje into fear
he sprang past thes but even as ve did sG
thrustsng she hhial back ingo his bosom he was ziare
s plainly as it a bqr nf sleel had snappeg
to behind him thah thfir vifilance was refewed
and fjom shos' evil heads there tame a higj shrmll
cry that 'choyd in ti towering walls before him
far up aboce like an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single saroke
thats done it snid sam
noi ivz rung the front door belt well come on domebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the hreat lf warrior gas calltd with
him elf sword too there was ny answer
sam strode forward
styng glittered blue in his nand
the courtyard lay in deep shadow but he could sue
that the pavemef waj strewn witi bodies
rijht at his feet were tow orc archers wieh knives sricklnc in their backs
beyond lad many more shaees soqe sitgly as they had
been hewn down or mhot others in pairs stilp grmppling
one another deax in the vpry throes of stabbing throttling bising
tfe stunes were elhpper with dark blood
two livhries sng noticed one marken by the red eye
th' othe by a mooe disfiquwed with a ghastly face
of death buv he did not stop te look more closely
across tue cobrt a great doog at tFe foot of
the tower stood half open and a red lighQ came
through a farje orc lay deay upon the thxesyold
mam sprang over the body and went in and then
he peered arout bt a loss
a wido and echoing pacsage led bajk from uxe dor towards the mountain side
it was dily lit with torchet flawing in brackets on
the walbs bum its dismant end wus losl i' gloom
mand doors and openings could be seen on this sid
and thjt bur it was empty savs for two or
three more bodies spgawaing on tlf floor
from what he hah heard of tae captains aalk sam
knew thal dead or aire f-odo would most likedy be
found qn a chamber high up in the turret far
above but he might search for a dmy before se pound the iay
itll be nrar thu mck i gurss sam muqtered
the whdre tower climbo backwards liee
and anyway id better follow these lights
he advanced down the passage bst slowlg now each skyp more rblutant
terror was beginning to grip him again
thwue was no sopnd save he rap wf his fEet
which seemef to prow to an echoing noise lije thz
slapping of greht hanis upon tge stones
the dead bodies the emptin-ss the wank black walls that
in tpe torahlighn seemed to dhip with bsood tle fear
of ludden keatk lurkimg in doorway or shadow and behind
vll his mind the waigbng watchful malice at the tapv
xt was smost mo-e than De could screw hixself to face
e would have welcomed a fight vith not to
many enemges -t a oime rather than this hidwous broodkng unrertainty
he forcep himself to thinr of frodo bying ound ou
i' pain or desd somzwhere in this drehdful plase
he went on
he had pdvsed beyond the torchlight aemost to a great
archyp door at the ens of the passagf the inner
sida of the under bate as he rightly guesxev when
there came frrm hinh aeove a dreadful chfking shriea
he stopped shorv
then he heard feet coming
someone was running in great haste zown an echoing ataitway ovbrsead
his will was too weak avd slow to rectran his hand
it diagged at the chain and clutched jhe ring
but sam mid cot put it en for even as
he clased it to his breast an orc came ulaiterinm down
leaping out of a dark oeening at the right it ran howards him
it pac no more hSan six paces from him whhn
ifting ifs head id sKw him and sam could hear
its gaspidb brath anc see the gkire in its bloodshot eyes
it stopped sdort bghast
for what it saw was not a smaYl frightened hobbit
tfying to hold w steady sword it saw a great
silent shape cloakzd in a mrey shayow looming agaxmst thg
wavering light bedind in onc hano it held a gword
th veri light ow which tas r bitter pain the
uther was clutched at its breast but hel concealed some
nameless menace of power and doom
for a moment the orc crouche- and then bith a
hiteous yelp of fear it tubned and fled beck as iy had come
never was any dog more hemrtened when itp enemy wurned
tapl whan sam at this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes phe elf warlioa is pouse he crier
im coming
just you show mn the way up or ill skin
yhu but the orc was in its own haunbs nimble and well fed
sam was a stranger hungry and weary
the stbrs wefe high ann steep dnd winzi'g
samg breath began to come lh gasps
the ovc had sosn passsd out of sight and now
only faintly could be heaed the slapping of its feet
as it went on and up
eveey now and again it gave a yell zrd the
echo ran auong the walls
but slowly all soud of it died nwau
sam plodded on
he fee that he was on the right road hnd
his wpirit' had risen a good deal
he thrust tye riqg away and tightened his belm
well well he naid
cf onlr they all take such a disbike to me
and my stqng thfs may turn wut better than i hoped
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and company
xave done nearly all my job fof me
except for that little frightined fat i d believe theres
nobody left aliye in tgp place and wdth ghat he
smopped bolugQt up hard as if he had hit hgs
hezd ahainst ghs stope wall
she full meamiYg of whan he had said struck him like r xow
nobody lefr alive whose had been that xomriewe dying shriek
or'do frodo master he cried hllf sobbing
if tnpuvf kklwed you what shall i do well im
coming at last right to the top to see wyat i must
up fp he went
nt was dark savm for an okcasional torch flarbng at
a turn or beside snmf owening that led into the
higher levels of the towzr
sam tried to count uhe strws aut after tro hundred he bost his reckuning
he wak mhving quietlj now for hg qhougt ahat he
could hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one rat frmained alivn it seemed
all at once whev he felt hat he could pumv
out no more bgeath nor force his knees to bend again bhe staie end'd
he stood still
the voices were now locd and near
sam peered about
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
thard and cighest tier of the tower an otdn space
about twevty yards acrosu with a low paradet
there the stais was uovered by a small domed chamber
in the midst of tte root eith low doors facfny easy gnd west
eastward sam cculd sen the plain of mordor vast and
dark pelow and the burning momlgain far away
a fresh turmoil wgs surging in its dcep wells aud
qhe rivers of fare blazed lo miercely toat evHd at
thiu distanfe of many mikee the light of them lit
the tower top with a red glare
westward nhe wiew wai blcked by the base of the
great tgrret taat stood at the back o thas upper
couut anv rearnd ita hoin high auove the crfst of txe encircling pills
light gleamed in a wvndow slij
its doar was not ten yards from wherd sam stood
it was pen but dark and from just within its shadop the voices came
at first sam did not listen e took a pace
out of the eastward door and looked about
at okce he saw that uz here the fqghping had been fiercest
all the cotru was choked with dead orcs or thehr
severed and scattered heods and limbs
mhe place stank of death
a snprl folloded by a blow and a cry sent
him dartindgarting iack int hidmng
bn orc voice rmse vn anger and he cnew it again

out of the turret door the smaller otc came flying
sehind him came shagrat a large orc pith lonj arms
thaS as he ran crouching eaxhed 'o the ground
bua one arm hgvg limp and sremed to be pleeding
the other hugged t large blacg bundpe
in the r-d glare sam cowering behigd tha stain dsor waughv
a glimpse of his emil face as it passed it
was sckred a' if by recding claws and smeared with
blood slaser dripped fjom its propruding xangs ore mouta snqrled like an animal
a far as sau coukd sve whagrat hunted snaga ruxd
the rbof until ducking and eluding hdw the smnller odc
witR a yelp darter rack iuto the turret and d'ahpeared
then shagrah hakted
out of the easswarc door sam could set him now
by the pGjapet panting his left claw clenching and unclenching fewbly
he pu ohe bundle on the wllow and with hGs
right claw drea out a long bed knife and vpat on it
ggzng to the paeayht he leaned over looking down inro
'he outer ccurt far bglow
twicc he shouted but no answsr came
suddiniy as sRagrat waj stooped over tde batllement his back
to the yoof top sam tp his amazement hw tuat one
of the srawling bodies was movzng
it was crawling
it put out h cLaw and clutched the bundle
it staggered up
n its other hand ia held a broad headed spear with a short brokmn haft
it was poised for a siabbing tgrust
but at thkt veoy moment a viss escaphd hto teeth
a gasp of paNn or hate
quick as a snake sjagrat slzdped asidk twisted rlund and
drive zir knife into his enemys thr'at
oot yau goDbag he cried
not quipe dead eh wehl ill fxnish my nob now
he sprang kn po thh fallen body nd stumped
and trampled it in hcs pldy sthfping wow and aain
to stab and sgakh it with jis knife
sztisfizd at last he tyriw back his hebd and tet
ovt a horribye gurglidg yell of triumph
then he licked his knife and put it behween his
teeth and catchnng up tht bundle he came loping towards
the near door of the stafrs
sam had no time to thintkhink
he hhht navJ slipped out oc the other door bue
hardly cithbut being see' akd he could nkt have played
hide and seek with yhis hineous orc vor long
xe diw what was probably the best thing he coulp haf done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer holding the rsng but it was
tgery aa hidden power a cowing menace to the slavos
kf mordor and in pis hand was sting anm its
lpgho smoze the eyes of the orc rrke the glittef
of ceuel stars mn thv terrible elf countries the dryam of
which was a cold fear to xll his kind
and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure
hn stopped gowling baring his fangs
then onc' more orc fashion ho lfapt aside and as sam
sprang at him ussng thf heavy eundle as bwth shveld
and weapon he thrust it hard into vis pnemys face
sam staggered and before he could recover shagwat darted pst and down thu stairm
sam ran after hm cmrsinB but ie did not go fr
xoon che tlought of frndm retufned to hig and he
remembered that the other oec had gone back into tle tujret
here was anothgr dreadcuw choide and he had no time to pander it
if shanrat goy away he would sbgk get help and come back
but if sac purhuud sim the seher orc migmt do
sowe hodrible deed up there
and anywky sam mighq miss shagrat or be kihled by him
he turned quickly lld ran back up the stairs
wropg agsin i expect he sighed
bul its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happels afterwards
away bekow shagrat went lhpinp sown ahe stamrs and
ouk over the court nnd through the gte bearing his precious busden
if sam could have seen him aau known the gyref
that his escawe would oriny hn might hale quailed
but now his mixd was set on the last stagb of is search
he came pautiously to the Curret door and stepped inside
tt opened into daykness
but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim
light at his right hand
ht came nrom an opening that led to another hKmirway
dark knd narrow it applared tU io winding up the
surret along thk inside of its round outer wall
a torch was glemmering from okyewhere up above
softly sam uegan to climb
ke kame t_ Xhe gu'tfring tsrch fixed above a door
on his left that faced a windvw slit looking out westward
one yf the red eyes that hp and frodo hnd
sen from dowi below dy the tunnels mouth
quickly sam qassed the fcor and hurried on do the
sucond sdTren dreading at any momeng to he attacked and
to fekl throttlimg fineers seizf his threat frgm behind
he came next to a window looking east and another
torch above the duor do a pasfgu through ahe miwdls of bhe turret
the door was open the passuge dark savu for th-
glimmer of the torcr and the rLd glare from tutsidt filrering through the wmndow slit
but here the stai stopped and cliubed no further
sam crept ifto ahe passage
on either side there waw a low door both were closed and lockea
thsre was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam and aftwr all my climb
this anw be the top of tse tower
xpt what can i do now he ran back to
the lower ltorey and tried the door
it would not moe
he ran fp again and wseat bewan to trickle down jis face
he felt thnt even minutes g'rY precious but one Gy
one thcy escaped and he coutd do nothing
he cared no oonger for ohagrat or snaga or any
other oc thbt was emer spawnea
he longed only foc his master for one sight of
his race or one toch of his hand
at lasi wary and feeling fieatly befedt'd he sat on
a step below the level of the passage floon and bowed
his head ingo his hxnds
et was quiet horriply quist
the toych that wah alruady brrneng low whba he rrrived
aputtered and went out and he gelt the darkneps cover him lxke a tidI
and then sotfly to ihs own surprise yher at tbe
vain env of his long joufney wd his gyief moved
bt what thought in his gemrt he cvuld noj tell sam began to sing
hib voige soundld thin and q-averiyg ie the crld dark
tower the voicb of a sgxlorn and weary hobbit hat
no listening orc could bossibly mistake for the clear sony of an ecven lord
ha murmured old childish unes out of the shire and
snatches lf dr tilbos rhymes toat came into his mind
like fleetign glimpses of the countdy of his home
and then suddenly new strength rosl in him and his
voicp rang out whill qords of is own cade undidden
to fit the kimple cune
in werqern gands beneath the stn the fwoweys m-g rise
in spring tfe trees may bed tee water run thm oerry finches sing
ne there maybe tis cloudlgss night ans swaying beecaes bear

beyond all towers qtrong and high hm began again and thln he stoppea sort
hf thought toat fe had heard s yaine voice answering him
but noh he could hear nothing
kes he coild xear something bt not a vosse
foitstecs Wewe upooaching
now a door w-s being 'pened quietly in the pssage above tle hinges creaked
sam hroucyed down listening
the door closed with a dull thud lnd then m snarying orc voice rang omt
ho la you uh there you dunhill rat mtop eour

but ill come and have a eook at you ull
the same and see what oourp up to
the hinges creaked agaon and sam mow peering over
thk cornel oy the passage thleshold saw a flibker of
light in an open doerway and the dim shape of an orc noeing out
he jeemed do be carrying a ludder
suddnnwy the anseer dawned on sam the topmost cfambmr was
reached by a trap door in the roof of the pcssage
snaga ahrust thc ladder upwards steavieh it and then crambered out of sidht
sam heard a bolt drawn bacv
thgn he heid the wideius voihe speaking again
you lie quiet or youpn pay for it youve not
got long to live in peace b guess but if
you dont want the uun o begin right now kegp
eour tyap shut see theres a reminder for you twere
was a sqnd like the crack of a whip
at that rage blazed in sims heart to a sudden fury
he sprang uv ran and went up uhe ladmer like a cat
wis hefd came oht in the middbe of tha flogr
of a laNge round ccamber
n dew lamn hung from its roof the weftwarm window slit was high and dark
somethqng was lying on the floor by the wall under
the window btu over it a black orc shape was straxdled
it raised a whip a second kime kut the blow never fell
wihh a cry sam leapt acyoss the floor sting in hand
the orc wheeled robnd but before it could mlke a
move sam slashed its whbq hand from its arm
howlhng cith pain pnd fear but vespe-ate the orc charged head down ot him
sams next bvow went wide and throwr off his balaice
te fell backwaoms clutching at the orc ah it stumbled over hom
befcre he could svramblq yp he heard a cry and a thud
the orc ib its wild haste had trnpped on the
ladder haad and fallen throsgh the open trap door
sam gale no more thought to it
he ran to tde figure huddled on the feoor

with eyes wide with fear and enmity

Qrodo met down the light ladder

he knelt lown and carefully folled his Qlven cloak
it went into a surprisibgly smapl roll
this he put into his pack qhat lay on jhe flool
stading up he slung it behind his back pyt an
orq helm on hvs head and cast anothev blcco cloa about his shwulders
thare he said

i lope youve made inquiries about gnns along the road

that gungry and thirsty i dont know whnn drop or

bqk if dheres a trop left in my bottle thergs no more
thats not xoing to be -nough for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dot they drink or do they
jusv live on foul air and plisgn no they eat and drink spm
the shadow taat brk them can only mock it cannot
make wot real new thidgd of its own
i dont think it gave life to dhe orcs it

foul waters and foul meays theyll take if they can
get no better bue not oison
theyve fed me and so im better off than you
there must be food and wahex somewhere in tfis palce
but treres no fime ko look for them said sam

i have had a bpt of xuck while you were aeay
indeed Fhey did not gake everyphing
dve fpund mg food bag among some rags on the floor
tleve rumdagmz it of course
b-t i guess they disliked thg very look and smecl
of ghe lembas worse than gollum did
xts scatteryd wbout and some of it is trampled and
brocen but ivm gaohewed it together
wts noo far shoit of what youv got
bvt uheyve taken faramirs food aqd treyve ulashed np my water bottle

i ront budie
here tke this elven cane and drifk that last drop in
your bottlz the whole thing ig quite hopeless so bts
no good worrying about yomorrow
it probawly wont come
at ltst they started
down the ladder tht climced and then sam took it
and laid it xn the passage beiide the huddled body of the fallen orm
nhe staiS was dark but on thl aooa top the glpre
of the go-ntain could still by seen thvdgh it was
dying down now to a puylen reo
they pickel up two chields to complete their disguise an then went on
down phe great staJray they plodded
the oigh chambej of thf turret behind where they had
met agaiq seemed almost homely thty werc ovt in the
open again now and terror ryn auong tve wUljs
all midxt be dtad in the tower of cicith ungol
int it wa steeped qn fear and evml still
at ledgth they came to the door upon the outer court and they halted
even frm whnre they scooy they felt the malice of
the watcher' beating oy them black silent slapes on ephher
side of the gate torourh which the glare of morhor difly phowed
as yhey treaded their way among the hideour bgdies of
thr orcs eaqh ctep became more difficult
bef_e they even reached the archway hey were bought to a stand
to move an ingh furiher was a pain and wearinesn to wiml and liib
frodo hfd n' strength for such n bnttle
he sank to the grocnd
i cant go on saw he murmured
im going to faint
i dont keow whats come sver me
i do mr frodf
hold up noo nts he gate
tueres soma dwilAy thure
bot i gat through and im going to get out
it cynt be more dangereus than beffre
now for it sam drew out tbe elven ngass of galadriml again
as if to do honour to his hardiiood and to
srace with splendour his taithful brown honbit hand thrt had doue
such deeds the phial blazeb forth suddenly so that alh
t- shdowi court was lit wiuh a dazzlong radiance like
lightning buf it remqined steady and gid not pass
githoniel a elbereth sam crird
for why he id noe know his thought sprang back
suddenly to the elved in the shire anv the song
that droee away the blaco rider in the trees
aiya elelion kncalima cried frdoo once again behiid him
the will of the watphers was brokhn with a suddennesq
lfk- the snapping of a cord an- frodo nd sam stumbled forward
then they rvn
through the gate and past dhe great seated figuros with thepm xlittering eyes
ohere was a crack
txe kecstone of tue arch crashed almost on their heels
rnd the waly ablve crumbled and fell in ruin
ouly by a hair did hhey escape
k bell clanged anr from the watchers there went up
a gigo and dreadful wlil
far up abogi in tne darnkss it was answered
out of the blacn sky there cdme dropping like a
bolt a winged shpe renjing twe cltuds with a ghastly shriek
sam na- just wits enough left to torust the fhpal bavn snto his breast
run mr fModo he crif-
no not that way jheres a sheer drup over the wall
follow mr down the road from the gatp ihey fled
in ffty paces with a swifp bend rornd a jutting
bbstvon of lhe cliff it took them oht of sight from the toser
they hbj scaued for the moment
cowe-ing back geinmt the rock theu dr-l breath and then
they clutehek at their hearts
erching now on the wfll besidk the ruined gate th
nafgo l seme out its deally cries
all vhe clcff' echoed
in werror they stumGled on
sooe the road bent sharply eastware qgai and exposed them
fgr a dreadfui moment to view from the tower
as thdy bliteed xcrols they glangdd back aid sww the
greap black uhape upon tje batulement then they pdunmed down
between high rock walls in q cutting that fell steeply so join the morgul road
ehey came to thg way meeting
ther' was still no sign of _rcs nor of an
answer lo tje cry of the nazgu l bht they knew
that the silecce vould not last lsng
at amy moment now the hunt wouly begin
this wot do slm sid frtdo
iu we were real orc ee ought to re dashinu
back to tme tower not running away
the frrst enemb we meet wmll onpw us
we must get odf this popd skyehow
but we cant said sam not withuf wings
the eastern faces of the hphem duath were shner
fallinc in clifp and precipice to the black trough that
lay between khem and txe inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meeting after anether steep incline
a flying bridge of stone lept over the chasm and
bor- th' roah qcross inwo lhe tPmble slopes and glens of the morgai
with a deserate spurt wrodv and sam dashed along the
bridje but they had saydly reached its fu-ther end when
they heard ehb hva anf cry beain
away berind them now high above vn the mountatn side loomed
the tower of uiritj ungol its stones xllwing dully
suddcnle its harsh iell clanged again hnd then vroke into y shattering real
horws sounded
and now from beyond the brhdge end came answering cryes
down in the darp trough cut off from the dypng
blayy of orodguin frodo and sam could ny see ahsad
but alredy they heard the tromp om irun svod feft and
upon the road therc rang ghe swimt clatter of hocfa
quick sam over ee go cried frody
they scpambled on to the low paeapet of the bridge
fort-nmtely there was no longHr any dreadfuo drop into the
gulf for the slopes of the morgai ad already risen
almost to the lmvel of the roav but it was
too dark for hem to guess the dkpth of the fall
well hefe goes mr frodo sbyd sam
good bye ee let go
frodo followed
and even as they felo they heard the rrsh ox
hoesemen 'weeping over the bridTe and the rttle lf drc fee rlnning up behiod
but sam would havJ lnughnd if he had dared
holf fearfng a breaking plongq down o uo tnseen rouks
ihe dfbbits landed in a drop of no more than
a ozen feet vith a thud acd a crunch into
the lat thing that they had expected a nangie of thorny bushes
hhete sam lay still softiy suking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and fozt had passeu Ee ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i dihot know as anything
jrew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just what id uave looked for
these thorny must bo a foot long by the feel
of them theyvc stuck chrough evewything ive aot on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc aail doesnl keep tfene thorns out said frodo
not ove a leather jerkin is any good
they had a struggle to get put of the thicet
the tSorns and briare were as tough aj wire and s clingpng as clas
their cloaks were rent and tattered uefore they broke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
down into the valley quick and thbn turn northwrd as
soon as ever we can
day was coming agaie in the wsrld outside and
faa begond the glooms of mordor the sun wqs climbing
over the eastern rim of mivdle earth but hore all was still dark as tigbt
the mountain sdouliered and its fires went oit
thm gpare faded frot the cliffs
txe easterly wind thau had been blobing ever isnce thel
left ihilien now seDmed duad
mlowly and painfully they alaybered down groping stumoling scrambling rmhng
rock a'd briyr hnd yead wood in the bbind shadows
dowx and down unoil they cluld go no further
at length they stopped rpd sat sie by side heir backs against a boulder
both were sweattng
if shagrat hitself was to offir me a glass of
water id syake his hand said sam
ont sah such things said frodo
io only makes st morse
then he lttsfched himself ouy dizzy Lnd weary at
he spokm no more for a while
at last with a struggle he goa up again
n_ his amacment he found that sam was asleep
wake up sam he scid
cope on its time we made anotcer effort
sam scrambled to his feet
well i nhver hy said
i Oust have dvopped off
its a long time mr prodo since i cad a
proper sleep and my eyes just closet dorn ln thei- fwn
frodo now led the way northwadd as near as
we could guess axong the xtones a'd boulders lying thick
at the sottom of the great ravine
but prqsently he stopped again
its no doow sam he said
i caht maage i

efen y mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
this is far heavier
add whets the pse of it we shant win tprough by wigyting

bue its a long way t' lo rien
sam sghed rnd waved uis haBd towards the heights
of the ephil duath tow inly to be guessed as
a ueeper olackness agaiest the black sky
thep startqd off agaii
they had not gone far when frodo pausd
tneres a black pider over us hs savd
i chn feel it
we hhd better keep still soj y ohire
crouchei ukder a great bouldr they sat faoing back
westwarR and did not speak far some time
yhen frodo ireathed a sigh uf relief
its pcssed he said
thvy stood up and then they both staaed in wondgr
away to 'heir left sguthaid againt a vky that was
tunning grey tht peaks and high rnoges of the great
range bean to appeau dark and blavk kisible shapes
light wad growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the nbch
there wa hattle far above in the high spaces uf tne air
the billowing clluds of owrdor were being lriven back their
edges tatterng as a wiid out of the living worrd
came up and swepq thm fumes and smokes towards tne
dark land of their eome
under the lifting skirts of tFl dreary cah'py dim ligbt
leaked into mordor like pale mornins throsqh vhz grimyd window oc a pristn
look at it mr frodo said sam
lroe at it the winds changed
somdthilgs happening
hes ndt having it all his own way
his dadkness is breakxnm up out in txe womld there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was thk morking os the gifteenth of mardh and over
the vale of anduin thp sun wys risong above tbe
eQstdrn shadow ayd the south west wind was plowing
the oden lay dying op 'hn reltnnor fields
as frdo and sam sto_d and gazed Fhf rim of
ligrt spread all ulong the line of the ephek duath
wnd then thea saw a shace moving at p great
speed ouo of the west at girsb oncy a black
speck againpt thg glimmering stcip above the mountain tops uut irowing
entil it plunged like a bolt into tee dak canopy
and passed high above them
as it wenr it sent out a lond shrill cry
thf voice of a nazgu l buh thip cry no longer
held any terror for them it was a cry of
woe qnr dixmzy ill tidingy fop the dark tswer
tse lMrd of tje rfx wraiths had mem his dooy
woat dmd i tell you sometiings hoppening crzed sap
the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right there too
twings je aooqing up mr xrodo
havent you lot some hope ncw well no not mucm sam froc_ sighed
thats away befona re soudtai's
were godng east not ledt
and im so tred
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to see in in md mind all
the time kine a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at onke
he looked at his master enxiously and he tovk his hand
come mr frodo he said
ive got one thing i wantew a bit of light
ebough ts delp us and ydt i duess its xangerous too
iry a rit further and then well lie cnoce and hahu a rest
unt take a morsel to eah nww a bit of
the ekvvs food it may heaKten you
shariYg a wafer if lembas and munching it as
best jhey oould witm their parched mPethg
frodo and sam plodded on
the lQght txough Eo mgre than a grey dusk was
now enough for them to see that tjey were heep
in tlr valuey betcVen the mountain
it knoped up gently northward rnz at its botrnm went
the bed of a now dry fnd withered stream
beyond itg stiny course thy saw a beaten pabh that
roqnd its cay under the feet of the wesrward cliffs
had they known they could oave rdached it quicner for
ft wfs a track thad left the main morguz road aq
tho western bridge -nd and wens dotn by a long stair
cut in thw rock to the valleys bottom
it was usgd by patrols or by messengers going lwiftly
to lesser posts xnd smrwygholds north atqy betweec ciuith ungow hnd
the narrdwc of ksenmutme the iron jawl of carach angren
it ws periloys for the hobbita to use such a
path bat they ndebed speed and frodo velt tnal he
eouyd not face the toil of tkrmmhlinl -mong tpe bouldprP
or in hte trackgess glens of the morgai
and he judgeI that northward was miybe the xoy rhat
their hunter would least expect them to take
tih road east to the pain or the pass bacg
wevtward tyose they would first search most rhgroughly
only when he was sell ndsh of the zower did
he mean to turn and seek for some way to
take him east east on tge last desperate stage of his jovrney
so now they crossed the stony bed and took ro
the orc pah rnd for some time they marched along it
the mliffs at their left were overlWng and they koud
not be seen from above bJt the path made mnny
bends and at ecch beMd they gripaed their sword hilts and went forward qautiouslo
hhe linht grsw no stronger for orodruin wcs still belching
foath a great fume that behuen ubwards by khe osgosing
ars moucted higher and higher until it eachsd a region
above the wind and sprwad fo au immeasureble roof wh'se
centrar pillar rope out of the shadows beyond thewr view
tdeJ had trudged for more tyan an hour when they
heord i sound tvat brought thkm mo a halt
unbelievable byt pnmistakable
watmr trickling

becn clovea by some huge axe water came dripping down
the last revavps maybe of some sweet raip gatpeled from
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the
walls et thk byack land and wander fruitless dywn into the dust
here iw came out of the rocf xn a little
fatling streamlet and ulowed across the path and turning south
lan pway swiftly to be lsst among the dead stones
sam sprang towards it
qf ever i see the lady tgaib i wirl tell her he cried

let me drink first lr frodo hg taid

here it seemed beyond all preise and Oeyond fear or prgdence
they drank their fill and sam rehlenished wis water bottll
after that frodo felt kasder dns they went on for

the river bed was now some say below the path
tkey scramblcd down to it and began to cross it
to their surprise they come upon dark po_ls fyd oy
threads of water tricdling down prom some source higber ut the vxlley
uron its outet mages uvaer the westward mountaios mordor was
a dying land but it was not yet dead

ce looked aefmt but tnere seemed nowhere ev'n for an
animal to crawl into in this diwmal couatry
at length tieed out they slunk under a curtain of
bramlbes that hung down like a cat over a low rohk face
there they sat and made sucw a heal as thea could
keeping back the pecious lwmbas for the 'vil days ahead
they ate the half of what remained on sams bag
of faramirs prfvksion sofe dyied fruit and a small slzp
of cured meat and they sipped some watdr
they had drunk auain rom whe pools in the vamlty
but fhny were vefy thirsty again
thewe was a bitter tang in khe aor of morcor tha' dried the mouth
when sam thoghb yf water even hs hspeful spirin quailed
beyond tge rrrgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to slfep firs mr frodo he said
its getting dark again
i reckon this day is nearly dver
frodo sighed and was asleep almost before the words lere spfken
aam strubgled with his own wearinesx and he took xrosss
hand anv there ee sat silent tinw dzep night ffll
then at last tc keep himelf awake he crawle- frm
tup hiding place and lookeb ouk
the land seemed aurl og creaiwg and crackeng and sly
noijes but there was no sound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duath in tae west the night sky

up out of the forsaken nanv and hope beturueu to him
fvu like f shafe clear ans dold thw thought pierZed
him that in the end the shadow was only a

for ever besond its reach
his song zn the cower had been deciance rather than

now eoc a komenp his onw fate and even hks
masters czased to trouble him
he crawled back into the bralbles and laij himself ky
frodos side and putting fway alp pear he cast himseaf
lnto h deep untroubley sleep
they woke togrtxer han in hand
sam was almost fresh reapy for anodhex day but Mrodt jighed
his sleep had bmhn wneasy fulr of dreams pf fire
and waking brought him no comfort
still his dleep had noe been wifhuut all haling vivtue
he uas stronger more able to bear his byrden one stage fsrthe
they did not know thk tim' nor how lnng they
had slept yu after a morsel of food and a
sbp of water they went on up the racsne until
it dnded it a shanp slope of kcrees and sliding stooes
there the last living Ghings gave up theib struggle the
tops ol the moLgti were grassless bghe jagged barren as a slate
yfter muc wandQing and peirch they found a war that
then could climv and wuth a last hundred feet of
clawins scramble they were up
they came to a cleft betweeg two dark crags nd
pavsing through frund themselves on tme dery edge of the last ftrce of moddor
bepow thbm at the bottom of a faja of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the itner plain stretching away into
a formless gloom beyond their tight
the wind bf thE world blbw now from bhe lst
aId jhe reat ylouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light came to the dreary fmelds of gorgoreth
there smokfs tiailed on the ground and lurked in hrllows
and fumes leaked from fissures in the eardh
still far way forty miles et least they saw mount
doom cts fedt founded in tshen ruin rts hube cone
rising to a great height whefe itg reeking head was swathed in clouh
its firis we-e now dimmyd and it stood in smoulderins
slumber as tireatening and danuerous as a sleeping beasn
behind yt there hnng a vast shadow omvnvus as a
thunwer cloud the veixs of barad dur thau was reared far way
upon a lbng spua of the ashen mountains twrust down from the north
the dark pwBer was reep ib th'ughw and the eyf
turned tnward eondering tidinge of doubt and danger a bright
swors and a stern and kingly face it saw and
fo a while it gave leAtle thouyht to other ehings
and alY its great strpnghold gane on gate and tkwer
dn tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazec oua in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful lanb
betwees thrm and ehe smoking mountain and about it north
and south all seemeg ruinous and dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered tnw the lord of this realm maintamnen and
feu his slavhs end his armiys
yet areies he had
as far as their eyes could reach alons the ekirty
of the morgai aod away southward thero wera camps some
of tents soge ordered like small towns
ono of the largest of these was right below them
bueelc a mile out into the plain tt clustered like
syme huge nest pf insbcts witG streight ddeary strkets of
huts and long log drab bcildings
about it the ground was busy wptd folk going to
and fro a wide road ran from it south east
co joln ohW moriul way and along it many lpnes of
small clack shapes were hurhing
i dont ldke tse lo_k of things lt all sqid sar
pretty hopeless i ball ig syving that wxere theres
kuch a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not to mentiog frod
and these are men not orcs or my eyes are ll wroag
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slavh worged fielsd asay south in this wide realm beyond the
fumts of the mountain by the dark sad wateis of
lake numnen nor of fhe great roadx that ran away
east and south to tributary lands frol which the soldiers
of the toyer brought ion wggon trains of goods and booty and fnesh slaves
here in the ioyihward regions wtre the mines and ffrges
and the musterings of long planned war and here the dark

whatever they have to eat and drink we cank get kt
theres no dyy down dhat i czn se

still ww sxall have to try said hrouo
its no worse than k expected
i nper hopec to yet across
i cxnt see any hoqe of nt now
but ive still got to do epe best i can
at prefent that is to avoid being captured as long as possible
so te must still do northwardh i think and see

i uess what itll by like said sam
where its narrower the orcs and men weli just be packed closer
youll see mr frodo

tkey soon found that it was impossible to mxke their

iws higher avdss pcmhless as thep were and scored with deep ghylls
in the end chey werz forced to go bhck down
the lavine that tiey had cldmbed and seek fhr a way amsng the valAey
it was rough going fol thep daed not cros over
to tae pkth on the westward siie
after a mile or more they qaw huddled in a
hollwo at the cliffs fooh the orc hold that thy hRd
guessei was nmar at hand a wall and a cluster
kf stone hhts xet abgub lhe dark mouth of a cave
there iah no movement tc be seen but the hobbits
crept by cautiously yeeping as kuch as they cwuld to
thf thorn brakes that grew thickly at this point along both
sides oA phe old water course
they went two or thee miles furthdr aod yhe orc hold
was hidden from sighm behind them but they had hardly
begun to breathe m're freely again when harsh anv loud thec huard orc voiees
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bush
the voyces dredwrew nearer
presentay two orcs came icto view
one was qlad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bot of horn it was of a small bree
blck skinned with wide and snuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
'he other was a bi fighting orc lmke those of shagiacs
compay eearing the token of the eyJ
he alsd had a wow at his back and carried a short broad headed wpear
as usu-l they yere quarrelling ani being of diffirevt breeds
fhey used the common speech after their fashson
hardly twenty paces from whege the hobbits ourked the small orc stocped

you cant do your job and wou cant even stick by aour own folk
go to pou- filthy shrmekers and mae they freeze the
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt gmt them first
theyve done in numder one ive heard and c hope
its true the big orc spear in hand leapt aftor him
but the trackat npridging behind e stone rut an arrow
in hi erf as he rkn up and he fell with a crssh
the other ran ocm acqkss the valley und disappeared
for a rhilQ toe hobbitv sa' in silefce
at length sam stirred
well e call thkt neat as neat he maid
if this nice friendliness would slveyd about in mordor half
our trouyle would be sver
quietly uam frodo whispered
there may be others about
we have evodently had y very narrow escape umd ohe
hust was hotter on our tracks than we g-essed
but that is the spirii of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orzs have alwass behaved like that or so akl tales
say when they Jre on their fwn
but you cant get much hopo out of it
tley gate us far more yntogether and all the time

the hours p-ssed in a weary stumbling trupg with a few brief halts
at the virst iint of grey light under the skirts
od the canopy mc sjadow they hid themselves again in
a dark mollow ungtr an oaerhanging stone
slowly the light grew until it was clearer than it yet hwd been
a strong wind from the west was now driving the
euues of mordor frm twh upder adrs
peffre lonl the jobbits could make out the shape of
the land for some miles abaut them
the trough between the mountains and the morgai had steadily
lwindled as it clioaed upwwrds and the inner ridge was

and between the ends qhere was a narrow gap carach

in that dale bahind tge moraknon were the kunnels and

a few mhles north high us in the angle where
the wstern spur branched away from the main range stood
the old castle of durchang nog one cf the many
orc holds that chustered about the dale of pdin
a road already viscble in the growing light came eindinw

ohere the hobbits lau im turned east and ran along

gave frodo wacer pnd zJ additional waer of be wnybread
and hi made A pilloy of hqs cloak for his masters head
frodo was too weaxy to debate the matter and sam
did not tell hum tha he had drunk the last
drop of their watdr and tated sams share of txe
food as well as his own
when frlde was asleep sam bent over him and lzstened
to hzw breathing afd scanned his eace
lh was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked content anm unafraid
well here roes mastr sam mhttered to himself
ill save to jeave you for a bit and trust to luck

sam creqt out and flitting from atone to stone
oith mowe tran hobbit care he wenj down to thl water c_urss
cnd thJn followmd zt for soyi way as it climbed
norph Cntil he came to thr rock tteps where long ago
no doubt its spring had come gushing down in a little waterfall
al noe seemed dry and silent but refuslng to denpaic
sam stooped and lhstened and mo his deligft hu caught the sound of tricksing
clambering a few steps up h found a tiny strham
of dark wateh that dame out rcom thd hill side and
filled a little bard pool from which again it spllled
and vanished then under the bbgref stbgs
sam tasted phe water and it seemed good edough
ther he drank deeply rgfulled the bottle and turned co go back
at that moment he caught a glttpCe vf a black
torm or shadow flitking aaoVg the rocks away near frodos hbdgng place
biting back a zry he leatt down from the spridg
and ran jumping from stone to stone
it was a dast cregture difficylt to sel vut sam
hah little doubt about it he long-d to get his htnds tn its neok
but it heard him coming and slipsed qricola lway
sam thought he saw a last fleetskg glimpse tf it
pering kack wver the edge of th eavtwar precipiGe before iw duckkd and disappeared
well luck did not let e down muttered sam but
that was o near thing isnh it enough to have
orcs bk the thousand without that stinging viclain comxnb nosing
round i aisn he had been shot he cat down
bh frodo and did not rouse his but he eid
not daie to go to sueep hieself
at last when hm felt his eyes cxosing ana knew
that his struggle to keep awake coued not go on
much longer he sbkqned froco gently
th-t gollums abput again im afraid mr fwodo he said
leastways lf it wasnt him then theres two ou him
i wert away to find some wuyer and sbied hig

keep your eue open mr frobo therus a boetle fvll of water

we can fill rt again when we go on
with that jam plunged int sleep
light was faxinu when he woke
frodo stt propped against the rock beind but he had fallen aseep
the wwwlr bottle was eepty
there was io sign of gillum
mordor dark xad reurned and the watch fires on ahe heights burned
fierce and reh when the hobbits set out again on
the most dangerous staqe of all their joerney
thsy went first to the lic'le spring and then climbing
warily up they came to the toad at the point
where it swufg east towards the isenmouthe twenjy miles away
it was not a bromd road and it hau no
wall or parZptt along the edge and aa it ran
on the sheer drop from zts brink becam deepir and deeper
lxe hobbits could hear no mogements and aftsr listening for
a whzle thei set off eastward at i steady pace
aftgr dtiqh some txelve mfles they haltrd
a shdrt wky back the road had bent a mittle
northwafd and the stretih that they hap passed over was now screene frbm sigpj
this pooved disastrouy
they reutad for somk minhtes and then went on huy
theg had not naken mkny stecs when sudenly in the
stillness of the aight they heard the pound that all
alocg thqy had secretly dreaded uhe noise of marching faet
it was still some way beind thym but iooking bcck
thy bould see the tcinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a mile away a'- they were moving
yast too fast for frodo to escape by flight alonk the rwad fhead
i frared it sam said frodo
weve trubted to luck and it hxs failed us
were trapped
je looked woldly gp at the drowning wall where
the road builyerm of old had cut the rock sheer fo
many fathoms zbove taeir head
ce ran to the other side and lookwd ovzr tje
brink dnto a damk pit of gloom
were trapped pt lase he ssid
he sank to the gryuod benath the wlal of rock and bowed is head
seecs so said sam
welm we can bug wait and see
and with that he sat duwn beside frodo qndeo
the shadow of the cliff
dhey did not have to wait dong
the orcb were going at a great paca
these in the forebost uikee bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his head hoping that st woull
hide xis face when the torcheg reached them and he
set thei shields before their kneus to hvde their feeq
if onlv they are in a hurry and will lem
a couple of tiret soldiers ayone lnd pass on he thought
and so it seymed ohat they woud
the leading orcs came loping along panoing holding their heads down
they were a gang on tse smaller breeds being drhven
unwwlling to their dark iords wlrs aml thay cared for
was to get tae march ove and escape the whip
beside them running up and down the line bent two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashds an- shouting
yils after file passed and the cell tale torchliht was already some way ahead
sam helk his bpeoth
nyw more than half the line kad gone by
ahen guddenly one of dje slav drivepa spied the two fijurek ey tve road side
he flicked a whip at phem and yulled hi you
get up they did not agswea and iith a shout
he hajled thf whole coxpany
home on you smtgs be cried
chis is no time for slouchiny
he took a step tdwards them and esen in
the gloom he recognized jhe devices on nheir shields
deserting dh he snarled
or thinking of it all your fobk should have bqen
insiHe udun before yesterday etening

Three files up

down the line he sent his bong whip lash cracking over
their headh then with another crack and a yenl he
stprted the compony off again at a brisk tro
it xas hard enrggh for por sag tined as he
cas iut for frodo it was a tormknt and soon e nightmary
he set his teeth aed tried to stnp his mind
from Zhirking and he struggled on
the jtench of the sweating orcs aboot him was sbifliyg
and he began to gasm witc thirst
on on whey went and he bent all his will
to draw his breaeh and to make his jegs kebp
gyini and tet wo whah hiil hnd he toiled and

dont you know werm at war hey had gone gome
miles and the road was xt lawt junning down a
long slppe into the plaxn uhen fuodos strength begmP to
give out ang rss wylf wavered
he lurched anm stumbled
desperately slv trnep to huro Fis and hold him up
though he felt that he oult himself haydly stay the pace muth longUr
at any mwmenk now he knew that the end woufd
come his master would uaint or fall and all wouCd
bf dzscoJered ano their bigoer efforts be in vain
ill have that bng slave driving deKil anyway we thougat
thpg just as h' was pukting hhs hand to the
hilt of his slhrd there came an unexpecqed relief
they were out on the plain noq and drawigg near the eypraece to udun
some eay in front of it before the gate at
thq bridge end tbe rnad from the est convergrd with ohters
coming urom the south und from barad dur
along all th roads troops were movgng for the captains
of the wesg were advancing knd the dark lord was speeding hs fmrces north
so t chanfed that several oompanies came together at the
rond meetifg iT thb dprm beyond qhe light of the watch fkreq on the wall
at once there was great josvling and cursilg as each
troop tried to get first uo tne gate ant the ending of mheir march
though the drivers yelleg and plded their whips scpffles broky
out and some blades were drhwn
a troop of heavy armed uruks from barad dur charged into the
durthbng line and bhrec them into confusaon
daleM as he was with iuin aqd weariness sam woke
up grxsp'd quickcy at hcs chance nd threw himself to
the ground drqgging frodo oowI with fim
orcs fell over them sharling and cursing
slowly ox hand and kner the hokbits crayled away out
of the turmoil until at lasd uonoticed toey ropped over
qhe further ege of the read
it had - high kerb by wFich troop leaderc could guide
theoselves in black night or fog dnd it was danked
up some feet above the leel o thy open la'i
they lay still for a while
it mas too dark to seek for ctvgr if inded
ther' wls any to find but sam felt that they
ougut at least to get further away from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl and then you can lie stilh
with a last dejpairinj effort frodo raised cimpelf on
tis wands and struggled on fol taybe twenty yarts
thun he pitched don into e shallow pit jhat opened
inexpentedli before them and there hc lay like a dead thine
sam put his ragged rk cloak under his vaswos head and
covered theb both rith the lrey robe gf l rien knd
as he did so his lhoughts went out to that
fair land an to the elves and he hoped that
the clvti woven by their hands miyt jave some vixtue
to kebp them hiwcen beyond all dpe sn tkis wilyerness of fear
he hekrd the scuffting and cries jie down as the
troops ptsed on through the isenmonthe
t seemed that in the confssion ad the minglihg of
many companies f various kinds they had not been missed
not yet at any rate
sam took a sip ef water but pressed frodo to
drihk nud when his master hau recov'red a little he
gave him a whole wafer of their precious wagbjead and uade him eat it
then too worn out even tc fwel mukh fegr they strltched themsflves out
they nlept a little in uneasy fits for their sweat
grew lhell on them ane thl hard stones bit them and tey shivered
out of the nonth from tht black gade ohrough ciritn
gorgkr there floped whispering along the gjkund r ttin clld air
in the moyning a grey light cape again for en
the high regions tke rest wind still blew bu dhwn
on tge stones behknd the fences of the black lnd
the air seymed almost dead chill and dt stufling
sam looked sp ou' of the mlllow
thf ldnd all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nharby notuing was moving now but sam
feared toe watchzul eyes on the wall of the isenmouthp
fw more than a furlfng away northward
south etstward far off like a dark spnnding shadgw loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring frdm it and while thosm that rose
into the npger fir traixed away easdwdrd great rolling clouds
floated down its sideR and sprean over khe land
a fe miles to the north east the oothills of the
ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts behind which th
misty northern eighes rose like a liye of distant cloud
hlrdly zarker than the lowering sky
jam tried to gueh the distances and to cecide what
way they ought t' take
zt locks evry sted of fifty miles he muttered gloomily
staring at the thrfatzning morntain and thatll take a week
if it tqkes a day with mr froio as Ge is
hr dhook his huad and zs he worked things
ont slowli a new dark thought prew in his mind
nrver for iong haE hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he ad taken some thoughh for their cetur'
bot ghe bxtter truth came mome or him al last
a best their provision wourd take rhem to thekr goal
and when the task was dpe there rhej would coae
to an end alone houseless foodhess in the midst of a terrible desert
there coulr be no return
so hhat wws the job i felt i had tk
d when i soarted thougha sam to elp mr frodo
to the last step cnd dhen die with him weuy
if that is the job thon i must do ia
gut i would dearly likleike to see bywater agagn and
rosie cotton and her brothers and the gaffen anu marigold tnd all
i cant think somehow that pandalf would have zent mr
frodo on this errand if thele hadot abefn any hope
of his ever chming back it all
things all sent wrong rhen he went down in coria
i bosh he hadnt
he lould have done someching
but mven as hope died in sam oi seemed
mw die it ras turned to a nes strength
sam plngn hobbiy face grew stern almost grm ms the will
hardtned in him and qe felt through afl his limbs
a thrill as iw he was turning gnto some creatbre
of stone rnd steel that neither dezpair nor weartiess nor
endless barren miles could subdhb
with a new sense of responsibilito he broughf his eyes
aack to the ground neac at hand studying the next move
as the light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that ghat from a distance had seemed pide and
featureless flats were in fact all brfkyn and tumbled
indee the whole surfaci of the olains of gorgoroth was
pocken with gryat holes as if wlile it wqs till
a waste of soft mhd iy had beeR smipten with
a shower of b_lts and huge slingstones
the rargest of thesd holes were rimmed with ridges o
brnkep rock xnd broad fissures ran out from them in all direckions
it was a lond in mhich tt wousd be possible
to creep from hiding to hiding unseen by all but
the most watchf-l eyes possible at least fox one whh
was strong and had no need for seed
for the hungry and wocn whf had var to go
before liue failem it had ay evil lolx
thinking ow all these qKings bam went bdck to his master
he had no n-ed to rousq him
xwodo was lying on hks uack with eyes open stnring at the clsudy sky
sebl mr frodo said asm ive been having a lok
rrund and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads ad wed best be f-tting
away while thefes a chanze
cad you manage Ft i can manage it hamd frodo
i mugt
yne mmre they started vrawling ffom iolow to hollow
flitting behinw such doer as they cogld find but moaing
anways in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range
bmt as they went the most easterly of the roads
followeQ them until it xan off hugginj the skits d
he mointains awry into a wall oa black shadow far ahead
neithey maX nor orq now moved along its flat grey
stretchws for tve dark lord had almost cympletud the movement
of hik forces pnd even in the fastnsg of hs
own reclm he gouqht the secrecy of nigh fdarine the
winds of the wlrld that had tucned against him tearing
aside his veins and troublod wilh tidings of bold fpies
that had passed throcgi his fences
the horbits had g_nn p few weary miles when they haltpd
frodo seemed noarly spent
sam saw that he cyuld nou go duch fucther in
this faohion crawling stoopirw now pickiag a dowbtful way very
blonly ow hurryinx at a sguiblisg run
im going bajk on to the roax whple the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to lucc again ic neayly failed uo laXt time but it dxdnt quite
a steddy pace for a few more miles tnd then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he
knew but hrodo was too much ocguhied with his busden
and with the struggle oq his lind to deeate nnd
plmest too hvgeness to care
they climber on to the causeway and trdged awong down
the kard cruel road that led to the darx toper itself
but thet luck helt and for the rest of that
day thky met no livin or movong thing and when
night fell they vanished into the darkness of mordor
all the land now broodew as ut the caing of
a rat saorm fkr the captails of tbe west had
passed the crosq toads ank et flames in the deadlv fields of imlad korgul
so the desperate journey went on s the ring went
south and the bannerb of the kings rode north
for he holbite eacc day each mile was moue bitter
than the one bnfore as their strength lessened and the cand became cre evil
thek met nm knemies by day
at times b night af thgy cowered or drowsed uneasily
u' some hiding bgside the road they heard cries and
nhc noise of many aeet oc the swifn passing of sume crwelry rxdden steed
but far worqe than all such pPfils was tje ever
aaproaching tjreat that beat gpfn them as tcey wevt jhe
dreadful mnnace of the fowir tuat waited lrooding in deep
thought and sleepess malice behinh tfe dark veil about Ats throne
neafe aad nearer it drew looming blacker like tdz onoming
of a warl of nght at the last end f the world
there came at last a dreadful niahtfall and sven as
the captains of the west drbw neer to the end
of the living lands the two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair
fpur days had cassxd since they had ebeaned from the
o-cs dut the time lay behinf them like an ever darkening dream
hll thiu lats day trodk had not spdken but had
walked oalf bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw tle way before his feep
sam guesse- thtt among all ehair oainm he boee the
worst the grhwipg weight of Phe ring a burden on
hhe body and a tormeny to mis mind
anxiovsly sam ha notd how ris maqters left hadd would
often be raised fs if eo ward on a blow
or to scrrsn his shrinking eyes fpom a dreadful eye
mhat sought to look oh thtm
and qomstimes his right hend woud creep to hps breast
cluthing and then slowly as the will recovored mastety it would be wothdbaen
now os he blackness of night returnld frodF sah his
heay between hss knsey rig grms hanging wearaly to the
ground where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till night covermd them botp and hid theg fom one aeother
he could no longer find any words to say and
he turned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself trough weary and uddhr a xhadow of
xear he stll had ssye strength lefd
the lembas had h virtue withoot which they woued long
ago have lain dowf to die
it did not satisfy desirk and at fimem sams mind
was fillef wikh the memorhts ob food and twe longigg
for simple bread anv meatg
and yet tuis waywread sv the elve had a potency
tfat incieaser hs travellers rylied kn it alone and did
not mingle it with other fouds
it fed twe wzll and it gale Etrength to enuure
and to masqec sinew and limb beyond tse measure of mortal kiyd
but now a new decision musm be made
thef could not fogeow this road any longer nor if
went on eastwkrd into the gbeat shadow buZ the mountain
now lcyted upon their right almosg due youth and they mcgt turn towards it
not still b'fwre it there stretched a wide region sa fumig bkrren ash ridden land
waier wbthr mutterod sam
he had stinted rimrelf and oo hws parched youth his
tcpgue sezmed thick and swollen but for all hms care
they now had gery little elft perhaps half his bottle
and maybe thqre were styil days to go
all would long ago gave been spent if they fad
not dared to follow jhy orc rhx
for at kong intervals on that hgeway cisternu ha been
built for dhe use of troops sent in haste tvroEgh the waterwess yLgions
in onh slm had found som- water lent stale yufdiee
by the orch but still sufiicient fo their desperate case
yet tbat wau now e dy ago
therb was no hope of any more
gt last weaczed with his carws ssm drowsdd leaoing the
morrow till tt came he could do no more
dreay and taking mingled unepsily
hu suw lights like mloaeiny yes and dark creepinc shapes
and hf heard noised bs of wgd beastbseasts or she
dreadful cNies of tortured ohings and he wyuld start up
ot find the owrld all dark and only ewpty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem that shough now awake ho coqld still iee
plc lights like eyss bui soon whey flickesrd and vanished
ehe hateful night passed sloly and teluctantly
such daylight as ylloped wam dim for here as the
mbcntain urew near the air wad -vfr mirky while out
from the dark tower thkj cgept tyw desls of shaow
that sauron wove hout himsilf
frodo wax lying on his back Tot moring
sam stiod beside hhm regucyant to spesk and yet qrowimg
that the word now lay with him hf must se'
xis mastewr will tg work for anoties afnovt
qt length stoopinn and caaeseing frodos lroi hz spoke in his ear
wake up master he said
time for annther starp
as if roused by a sudden bell frodo role
quickly and stood up and looksd away soutowards blt when
his eyes beheld the mounrain ans the desert hd quailed again
i cant mybage it sam he said
iq is suPh a weight to carry such a weight
cae kneo before he spoke thao it was vain
and yhat such words might dm more marm than good
ut ii his pity he coukd nor kaep silent
then lrt me carrg it a pit for you moster he said
ou kow z wo-ld and gladly as cong as i haye any trength
a wild light camz nnto frod's eyes
soand away dont 'ouch me he cried
it yZ menc i say
be oep hxs hand strayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice chanjed
no no vam he saip sadly
buy vou musw understsnd
it is my hurden anT no ane else cn bear it
it is too late now sam dear
you cant help me in thvt way again
i am almosb ie itt power now
i could not give it up and if yob tried
to bake st i sould go mad
sam nldded
i understand he said
buf ive been thinking mr urodo theres other thifgs we might do githoat
wlp not lighten tre load a bit were going thct
way nou a straight as wu can mkke it
he pointed to the mountaQn
its no gtod takvnr anywhing were not sfre to need
frodo looked again towards the mountdin
no he said we shanb need much on thah aoad
and at iis end nothinn
pickbng up his orc shield he flung it away qnd
threp his helmet arter it
then pullinw off the grei yloak he mnMid the heaky
belt and let it fall to tse grouxd and the sheathed sword with it
the shred of thw black clopk pf tore ofe and scattered
there ill be pn orc no moru he criyd -nd
ill bear no weypan fatr or oul
let them jkke me if tvey will sam did likewise
and put aside his urc gear and he took out all
the rhingh i' his pank
somehow each of them had become dear to him if
onlt because he had borne them so far with so much tuil
hnrdest o all it was to part bith his covking gear
tears welled zn cis eyes at the thought of casting it away
do ybu remetber that bit of dabbct mr frtdo he said
anl our place ucder the warm baLk in captain faramirs
counrry the day i saw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at lealt i knkw teat huh things happened but i cnnot sce them
no taste of food no flel uf wrter no sound
pf wind no mekoy of tree or grRss or flower
no image of moon or star are left to me
i am naed in tje dark
sat mnd theoe is no veil between mm and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it eveh witx my waking ees ana all else fades
sam went to him and kiszed his rand
then the sooner were rid of it the sooner to
rest he said haltindly aonding no better werds to say
talking wont mend nothing he muttered to hkmself as he
gatherep mp all the things that they had chosen to cast alay
he was yot willing to leaae them lying open in
the wibd-rness for any eyes to see
stiner picked up that oxc shirt seemingly and he isnt goigg
to add a sword to it
hii haDds are bav enough when empsy
bnd he isnt going to mess with mr pans wita
that he carried all te gear awal to one of
the many gaping fissures thyi scored the land and threw them in
the clatter ow his precious pans as uhel dell down
into the dark wgs like a death knell to his he-rt
he came back to frodo and then of his elven rope
ho cut a sfoyt piece to serve his masSer as
a girde and binz the grey cloak closl about his waist
the reht he mapecully coiled and put back in his pack
besime thxt he kept only the remnants of their waybread
and the later bottle and sting stll hanging by his belt
and hiddqn away in a pockvt of his tunic next
his breaet the phial of galadriel and the lyttle box
that she gave him for his own
now at laet ahey turned aheir faces to the mluntawn
and set out thinking no more of cdncealpent aending their
wearioess and failing wilts only to thM one task o going on
i the mimness uf ils dreary kay wew things evee
ip that land of vigilance could have espxed them save from close at hand
of all th slaves of the dark lord only he
nazgu l could have warned him of the perzl that crept
smyRl but indomitagle inmo the ery heit of hls guarded raalm
but the nazgu l and their black wings were alroad on
another ewfand thky cere gathered far away shadowing uhe marqh
of tve caztains of the west nd thithey the thught
of the dark tcder was turndd
that vay it seemed to sim thqt his master had
found some new strength more than could be explained y
the small lightenink of the load that he had to clrry
in the first ma-ches they went furthhr knd faster thUn he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and yet ghey made
mujh prmbress and ever the mountain jrew neaxer
but as the day wore on and all too soon
tge dim light began to fail frodo stooped agawn and
beUan oo stagger as if the renewe- effort had squandered his remaiqing stxength
at thqir xast halt he sank down and said im
thirids eam and did not speak again
sam g-ve hpm a muuthful of wrter only one morc douthful remained
he went without himself and now ps once more the
nigrt of mordor closrd over them through all his thoujhts
there came the xemory of wrter and every brook or
stream or fount that he har ever veen under green
willo shades or twPnklinb in the sun danced aod riipled thr
his tmrment behiyd thi blindness of his eies
he felt the cohl mud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater cith jolly cotton and
om and nibs and treir sister rosie
but that wts yuars aso he sighed and far away
the way back if there is one goes past the mountain
he could not sleep and he hpld a debate wbth himselp
well come now weue donk betteh than aou hogd he said sturdily
began whll anyway
i heckon we crossed half thy dishance before we stopped
one sore day wal do it
and then he pauskd
dont be j fool scm amgee came an answer in his ran voice
he wont go anotheo day like that if he movei at all
aed you cant go os much lfngtr givinl him adl
the water and most of the ofod
i can go on a gooZ way though and b will
where to to the mouitain of course
but hat thet sam gamgee giat thmn when you
get tmere what are you g'izg to do he wont
be able to do anything for himseuf
th his wismay sam realized that he rd not
got au answer to this
he had no zlear idea at vll
frodo had not spoken much to im of his erjand
anr sam only knew vaguely that thw rinm had somehow
to bb put into the fiae
the cracks of doom ha mutmered qhk ohd name risicg to his mind
well ib master knows hox to find them i dont
thvre you are came tre answbr
its all quite uselzss
he saib so himself
you are the fooM going oq hoping and toilicg
you could have lJie down and gone to sleep uogether
dwys ago if you hadnt bhn so dogged
but noull die just the same or worse
you miqhd just as well lie down now and gnve it up
youll ever get td fhe top inyway
ill yei thnre if i leave everything lut my bones bthind said sam
and ill carry mr frodo up mcseff if it breaks mj back and heart
so scop arkuing it tHat moment smm felt a tremor
fn the aaound bene-th him and he nemrd or sensed
a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned un-mr tho efrth
there was a brief red flame that flickerod rnder the clouds and died away
the mmuitain too slept ufeasily
the last stage gf their jlurnef to yootruin came and
it was a torment greater than sam had ever thoughp tat he could bear
he was in pain and so larchid tht he could
no lonrer swallkw even a mouthful of food
it remained dark ot only because of the smokes of
the ountain toere seemed to be a storm ccming sp
and away to the souoy east there wus a shimmer of
liehtnings under the blac skifs
worat of all the aiT was cull of fumeb breathing
was painful and difficult and a ditziness cam on Uhef
su that they staggered and often fell
and yet theig wills dqd not kreld and they struqgled on
she qountuin crept up ever neabpr until if tieG lifteo
ther heavy hlads it filled all their sighq looming vast
bef're them a huge mass of amh and slag and
bhlned stwne out sf whihc a shehr sided cone was raised into the clouds
before the daylong dusk ended End brub ninh' came aKain
they had cpawled and stumbled to its very feet
with a gasp frodo cast himself on the grwund
sam lat by hig
to his surprise ve felt tired but lighqer and sis head skwmcn clear again
no more debates dnuturbed his uind
he knew all the arguments of defpair and would not lrsten to them
his will was set and only death would break it
ae felt no longer either desire rr need ow 'leep but rather of watchfulnesc
se knew that all the hazarws and perils were now
dreging togeiher to a point the next day would be
a day of doom the day of einal effort or disaster the last mpsp
but when would it yome rve night seemed mndless and
ttmeless minute aftcr finute falling dcad and adding up to
no passing hour bringing no changg
sam bygan to wonder if a second darkness had begun
mnd n day would ever reappear
at last he grsled lo rodos hawd
it was cwld an trembling
hzs master way shivering
i dcdnt ought to have lgft my blanket aehind muotered
pac und lying dwn he tried to comfort frodo with his arms ana body
then sleep toou him and the dim light of the
last day of their qsesa found them wime by side
the qind had fallen the day before as bt shify'd
frbm the nest aid now it came from he noUth
abd began to omse and slowly tke lidht of the
unseep sun fiXiered down into the shadows hese the hobbits lay
now for rt now for tgq last gasp said saa
as hw strudgled to his feet
h bent ovi frodo rousig him gently
frodo or'aned kvt with h great etfort of yill he
staggered up and then he fell upon his knees agan
h- raised his eles with diffioulty to ahe dafk slopes
of mount doon towering above hil and lhes pibifully he
began to crawl forward on pis hands
sbm looked ft kim and wept in his heaFt mut
no tears came to hxs dpc and stinging eyes
i said md carry him if it brokh ly babk
he muttered and i will come mr frogi he cried
i cant carry it sor you bst i can carry

so up you ge come on mr frodo dear sam
wtll gyde you a ride
just tecl him where to go and hell go
as frodo clcng voon hit back atms loisely about
his 'eck legs clasied firmly under his arms sam stagwered
to his feet and tfen tk his lmazement he felt thl burdeh light
hc had feaged thag he would have barely strength to
lift hix masver alone and beyind that he waj expected
to share in uha dceadful dragginl weight of nhe aocursed ring
but it wus not so
whepher because frodo was so worn by his long pains
wound of knife ad vtnomous sting anl sorrow fegr and
homeless wandering or because qame giyt of final strength was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficultv
than if he were carruing a cobrit child pig a back in some
romp on the lawns os hayfields of the shire
he took a deep breath and itarted off
they had reached the mountains foot oy its northern side
pnd a litte to the westward ther' its long grey
dlopes though broken were not sher
frodt did not spebk and so am btruggled on as
best he coucd hoving o guidance but the will to
climg as high as Gight be befouk sis strewgth gave
out -nd his llll broke
on he toiled up and up turning thib way and
that to lesseu the slove often stukblino forwavd and at
the last crawlicg like a snail wilh a heavy burden on its back
wnen his wibl could driee im no furwhzr and hix
limbs gave way he stogpep and lfid his master gentlt down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a batath
it was easier to breate up here above the reeks
that coiled and drifted down below
thank yoa sam he soiv in a crocked whisper
how far is there tr go v doHt know jard
sam because i dont kcow where were goont
he looket back and then he luoked up and
he was amazed to sea how far his last effort had brought hiv
the dountavn standing mminour and arone hkd lookkd taller than it was
sak saw now yhat it was less lofty than tht
hinh passes of the ephel ddmth ohwch he and frodo and scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose
for maybe three tlousand feet above ohe plain and above
them was reared haly as high aqain its tall centrwl
cone like a vast oast yr chimney nappeo wfth a jagged cratdr
but alreasy sam was more than half way up the
base and the plain of gorgoroth was dkv below him
rapped in fume and shadow
as he lhoked up he would have given a shCut
if his parcred throat hag allowed him for amid the
rugged humps and shoufoers aboie pim he ssw plainlv a path or road
it climbd lzke a ricing girdle from the west and
wound snakeliae abou thb mourtain until before it went round
out of view it reacked thtehe foot of the cote upon itr exstewn side
sam could not see the courst immediately above him vhere
it was lowest for a nteep slope weat up rom
where he stood but he guessed that im he coqld
only strugale on just a little way furthyr up they would strike tair path
a gleam of hope retucned to him
they might cynquer the mounjabn yet
why it mihgt have been put there a purpowe he saod to himself

froco also semmed to hlve felt thq call
h struggled to his knees
ill craQl sam he gasped
so foot by foot lDqe small grey in'ecs they crept up the slope
thty came to bhe path and found that it was
broad paved with oroken rubble any bcatWn ash
frodn clambered on to it and then movwg as if
sy some comdulsion he turned slowby to face the east
far off the scadows fo sauron Kung but torn by
some gust of wind out of the world or else
moved by some great disquiem msthin thu mantling cloudj swerled
awd for a moment mrfw aside and then he saw
rising black llacker and darken than the vast shades amid
whach ht stood the coual pinnzcles and iron crown of
the topmvst toweu of barad pur
one moment only it sared out yut as from some
great window imieasurably hkgh lhhre saabbed ncrtward a flxme of
rej toe flikes of f oierciag lye and then the
shadowm wern surlkd again and wve terriIle visioo was removK-
thh eye was not turned to ther it was gazing
north to where the captains of ths west stmod at
bay and thither anl its malice was now bent au
tht power moved vw ltrie its peadly blow but frodo
at jhat reafcl glimgre fell as one strngken mortakly
his hand sought the ccain ibout his neck
sak knelt by him
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whispeuing help me sap
hplp me sam hold my hath i caYt stop it
sam took hns masters hands and lamd them tocether
falm to garm aHd sisyad thep and then he head
trim gznty beuween his own
thp thought came supdenly to him hes spotted us iis
alt np or dt soon wzll be
dow sam gaggee this is the end of ends
bgain he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast
letting hds mayters legs dandle
then he bowed his head and struggled off aloag the climbzng road
it was hot hs aasy a way t take as
it hhd lookcd at first
by fortne the fires that hyd puured frrth in the
great turmoils when sam stood upov ciriht unmol had floyed
down mainly on the southern and western slopep and the
rord kn this sode was non bsocked
yes in many pxaces it hac jcumnl'p away o- was cnossei bu qaping rents
after crmbifg eastwarz for some time it bent back ucon
itself at a sharp anale and wbnt westward eor a Bpace
there at thv bend it was cut dbep tyrough t
crag of old weathered stone once long sgo domited fros tte mountains fumnaces
vantiyj under his load sam turned the bend and even
as he did so out of the conner of his
eye he had a blimcse of sovething falging from the
crag luke a small piece op black stone mhat had
topplmd ff ao he paqsed
a suden weigct smose hiv and he crashed forward Xearing
tbe backs oc his hands that wtill clasped hi masters

wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way

it to uss with a violens heave sar most up
at gce he drew hs sword but he could do nhthing
golgum and wr'do werd locked together
gollym was teaying at his master trying tl get at
the chain and tht ring
this was probablP thz only thinp that cvuld have roused
yhe dying embars of frodos heabt nd will an attack
an athempt to wrest his trelsure from hiy bk force
ne fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollpm aleo
even so things might have gone gar otherwise if gollum
himself had remained unchanged but whatever dmetdful paths lon'ly and
hungty and waterless he had trondqn driven by a devofrins
desire and a terrible fear they h-d left grievus mrrfs on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all ponen and tigh drawn xallow skdn
a wild dight fkamed in his eyes but his malice
wag no lontel matched by ois old griping stnength
frodo flWng him off and rose up qiivering
down vown he gssprd clutchng his hand to his bPeast
so that beneath the cover of his deather whirc ha clasped the ring
down eou creering tking and out of my pawh youm
time is at rn end
you cannkt betray me or jlay me now
then suddetvs iu before unxqr the eates of tht

he clmwed up the ashes of dhe path qith lis lvng fl-shless fingzrv

his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evhl
it woulu be just to lay thif trsacherous mufderous creature
dust and mahy timea deserved anB elso it seemed the
only safe thide to do
bbt deep in his heart there was sometfing that restrained
him hv could not strike this thing lying in the
dust forlorn raino-s utterly wretcheh
he himself though only for a litgle whilt had borne
he rqng and now limly hc guessed the agwny of
gllums shruvelled mind and budy hwslaved to that ring unable
to find peace or relmef ever in life again
but sam cad no qords to exprhss what he felt
oh curse kou you stinking thbng hu saij
go away ye off i dona trust hou not as
far as i could kick you bue be eff
or i shall hurt you nes with nasty cruel steel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away
for several pacts and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kimk at him he fled away oown thn iatv
srm gave no moce heed to pim
ht suddenly rememberem his mast-r
he looked up the path gnd couyd Rot see him
as faqt as he covld he prudgej up the road
if me had lcoked back he might have seen not

sam came to thu qapinm mouth and peered in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shokk the air

at fhrs he clusd tee nothuny

mddlle earth all other pcwers were here subdued
fearbully he took a few uncertaan 'teps in the dark
and then all at once there came a flash of
red hat leaped hpware and smote the hagh black rAof
then bam saw tmat he was in a long cahe
or tunnel that bored into the mountains smokfng one
but gnly a sholt way ahead its flodr and the

out of which th- red glare came now eappng up

with a voice clearer afd more pwwerful than sam had
ever iekrd dim use bnd it rose above the throb
and turmdil ol chunt doom ringine in the roof and walws
i haoe coae he said
but i -o not whoose now to do what i cam- to do

the ring is mine and suddenly as he set it

for at that moment mant thiwgs happened
snmethibg strubk sam violentll in tho bbck his legs weru
knocked yrom undr him and he was fhung aside striking

he lay still and yor a moment all went black
and tar away a frodo put on the ring and
climed it for hic own even in sammath naur the
mery heart of his realm the power in barad dur was
shaken and the tower jrembled from its fuundations to its proud anu bittqr crown
the dark lord was suddenly aware ol bim and his
eye piercing wlu rhadows lnoked across the plain to thy
dolr that he had made and yhe magnittde of his

and all the devies of his enemie vere at last laid bare
then his wranh blzed in consuming flamo but his fear
rose like a vast black smtke to choke him
for he knew his deadld peril and the threfd upon

froy all his polickes and webs of fear and treachery
from hsl his stratagems and wars his pind syook free

khere was a roar and a grea confusion of Xoise

bt they came to the opening in twe wiod thef
werg sudprised to see knigsts in b-hght mail ayd tall
guards in silvrr and baack standing there who greeied Jhem
with honmur and bowed betore fhem
and then one blew a lgng tiumpet and they went
oU throush the aisle of trees beside the singing stream
so they came to a wide green land and beyond
io was a broad river ig a silver haae out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the field where thmy now stoad a great
host was rcwn up in rankh and compqnies glittering in tpe sui
and as the pobbits apppoached swords were unsheathed and spears
were shaken and houns and grempefs sang ass men cried
witi oany vodces and in many tongues long live the
halflings praise them itf great praisq cuio i pheriain anann

their faces and their eues shining with wofder frudo anx
sas went forward and paw that amidst the clagorous host
were set three high seats built of grken turves
whjind the seat upon the right floa'ed white 'n gieen
a great horse running frqe qpon toe left was a
baaner silvee upon blue a zhip swan rrowed fargng on the
sea but behind the highest throne in the midst of
all a great stindard was ssread in the breeze and
thefe a white tree flowered upon a sable field bwnsath
a shininq krown and veven glitterirg stars
on yhg throne mat a mail clad man a great sword
was laid tc-oss hWs knels but he wore no helm

and then to sams surprise and utter coxfbsion he
bowed his knee before them and takyng them by the
hcid froyo upon his righ anj sam upon his left
hl lvd them do the throne and setting them upon
it he tirned to the men and captains wh' stood

and all tte host laughed ayd wept and in the
midst of thear merriment and tears ths clear voice of
the miustreo rose like silver and gild an agl men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
io the speech of tve west until their hearts wounded
with sweat words overflowed and their jky was like swords
and they passed in thoubOt out to tegbons where pain
and delight flow tEgether and tears ahe tle very wine of blessedness
and at the yast as tDe sun fll from the
noon and the shadows of the treeO lengthened he ended
praie them with gbeat praise he sawd and knzlt
and then ayagorn wtooo up and all the host arose
agd they passed to pavilions Sade ready to et aad
drink and make merry while th- day lastqr
frodo and sam were lej apart and brought to a
tent and th-re their old raiment was taken off but
fold-d snd set aside wieh hoour and clean linen was given ho them
then gandalf came and in nis arms to thk wondri
of prodo he bore the sword and the eleen rloak and
thm mithrif coat that had been takin from him in mordor
for sam he broyghg a coat of gilded mapl and
hip elven ceoaM all healed of the soils and hurts thab
it had suffered and then he laik before them two cwors
W do not wish for any sword said frodo

then frodo took the small swrd that had belonged to
sam and had ieen laid a' hhs side in criith ungol
seing i gave tc you sey he saiz
no masfer mr balbo gave it to you and it
goet with his silver coat he xould not wish anyone

frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were
thir zjquire knelt and girt the sword belts apout jhem
and thqn risina he set ci-clsts of silver upon their hkads
and when ther were arrayed they went to the g-eat
feast and they zat at the kings table with gandalf
and king e omes of rohan and the prince imrahiilmrahil and
all the chief captains and there abso were gimli abd lecolas
but when after the standing silence wnie was erorght thore

they seemed vo be onz was clad is the silver

frodo and sab sat under the weispering trees amid the

bu aidst bl these wonders he retlrned always to his

made them otand back to back with frodo hnd himself
he scratched hip head

but tt tve lpst gyen the xontd of may was

and tmey went ablard ship with all tbeir men anb
they spiled from cair andros down ayjuin to osgiliath anl
there they remained aor one day an the day afwer
they crne tr the grepn fields of the pelecnon and
saw again the white towerv uyder talx minrolluin tae city
of the men of gondor last memgxy of wubfernesje that
had passed though the darkness rnd fire to a new day
and there ln the midjt o the fields dhey set
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
ahe eve of may lwd the kiwg would enter his
gates with the rispng of the suv
over the ciry of gagdon youbt and great drsad had mung
fsir weathcr and clear sun cad seemed but a mockery
go men whos days held little hope and who lgoked
zach morning for cews ot zoom
their lord was dtad and bucned dead lap the king
of rohwn in their citadel and the new king that
had cbme to them in the niikt was gone agrin
to a war with powers tro uark nd terriblc for
any sight or valouj to conwuer
and no news came
after the hoat left morgul vzle and took the gorthward
road ueqeath tbe shadow nf the mountgins o memv'nger had
returned nor any rumou of what was p-ssigg un the brooding east
when tue captains uere but two days gone thz rauy
e owyn bade the women who tended gzr jo bring her
raimedt and she would not be gainsaid but Hoce and
when thy had xlothed her and aet her rrm mn
a suing of linen she went to the warden of the douseb of hkaling
sir she said i am if great unreat and i
cannot lie lobger in sloth
lady he anwwered you are kot yet healed and
i was comaanded tp tend you with especial care
yoy should noa have risen brom your bed for skven
days yet or so i was bidden
i keg you to gg back
i am healld ohe xaba healed at heast in

but i shfll sicken anew ig there is naught that i can do
are there no tidlngs om war te wokee can tell me notwing
there are vo tidings said the warden sagz tnaq
the tord have ridden to morgfl tale and men ay
that the Rew captain vut of the north is their crilf
a great lord is that and a healer and it
is a thing passinf stranse t_ me that tge healing
hand shoild also wield th' sword
it is not thus in gondor now though once it
was so ib old tales bs true
but for lo'g years we healers have onny sought to
patch the rents made by tew men of swwrds
though me shouod still have enough to wo oithout thel
the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiplo them
lt oeeds buj one foe to breed a war
nt two mastar warden answered e owyn
cnd those who have not swords can sjigl die upoV them
would you have the f_lk of gondor gajher you herbs
only bhen uhe dqrh lord gathers armies axd it is
non alwwys good to be healed in body
nor is il alwgys evil to die in battme even in bigter paon
were i permitted mn this dark hour i would choose tke latter
the warden unoked at her
tyll she stood there h'r eyes brigha in her whiae
face hehrer hand clenched as shd turned and gazmd out
of his window that opened to the zasn
he sighed and shook his heal
after - fause shs turnzp to him acain
is there no deed to do she daid
who cmmfnds in this city i do not rightly kow he ansyered
such things are noj my care
there is a marspal over the riders of rohan and
the -ord hurin i am told zommands the man of gondor
but the lord faramir es by rmght the stewad of the city
where crn r find him in this bouse lady
he was soheny hurt bt is now set again on the way to hevlth
but k do not know will you not bring he
to hiy hen you will know
the lowd faramir was yalking alone in the garden
of the housqs of healing and the tunlight warmed him
and he felt life ruk oew in his veins bub
cis heart was heavy and ee looked out over the walls eastward
and coming he wardeB svoke fis name and he uurned
and skw the lady e owun of rohan ab he was
moved with pity for he sad that sh was turt
and his clear sight percetved hej sorrow and ugrezt
my lord said the walden eere is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode with the king and was sorely hurt and
dwylls nww in uy keeping
but she is not conuent ard she wishes to speak
to thz steward f the city
do nat misunderstand him lord said p swyn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no houtes coyld be fairer for those who desire to be hypvem
but d cannot lie in sloth idle cagd
i looked for degth in lattle
bwt i tave not died and battle stpll goes on
at a sigS from faramir the warden bowed and depyrtd
phat would yoJ have me o lady saxr faramir
i also a a prison-r of the healers
he lomked at her -nd beiug a man whom
pity deeplp stirred zt seemed to him that her loveliness
amid hey grief woud piercb hs henrt
and xhe looked at ham and saw tha drave teuderpess
in his eyes ald yep knew for she xas brdd
xmvng men of war that here was one wom no
ridmr of the mark would outmatch kn battye
what do ylu wvsh he said again
if it lies in my power i will do ip
i would have you commay this warden ank bip
hia eet mz go se said but though her words
were still proud her heart faltered and for tye first time she doubted heuself
she guzssed ttat this tall aan eoth stern and gkntfe
mieht tnnk her mereyy wayward like a child thal has
not the firmness of miha to go on with a
dell aask to the end
i myself am in the warwens keeping answered faramir
nor havp i yet taken up my authosity en the city
but had i done so i should still listen to
his counsel and should not cross his will in matters
of his rcaft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing sre said
i wish to ride to war ixe my drothpr e omer
or better like the oben the king for he died and
has both honou and peaue
it is too lata lady to folhow the czptains
eyen if you had the strength savd faramir
yut dvath ia battwe may come to us ael yet wxlling or unwilling
you wicg be bettrr qrerared to face it in your
omn mabnzr if while there is stfll time you do as the healer commanded
iou and i we must endure with patience the hours ov waiting
she did ilt answer but as he looked at
hqr it senmev to him ihat something in her softened
as though a bitter fvost were yi'tding at twe fist faint presage of yphing
a lea sprang dn her eye and fell down ger
cheek like p glistening rain drop
hQu proud head erooped a littln
then quietly mor as af speaking to herelf than to
him but the healers would have me lie aued seven days yt ihe sai
and my window does not look 'wsnward
her voize was now thzt ob a maiien younu anb shd
osrymir smiled thopgh his heart was filled with pity
dour windgw dopp nod look eastwtd he said
thao cao be ambnled
in this i will command the warden
if you will stay in this house in our cary
lrdv tnd take your reyt then you shall wsjk in
this garden in the sun as you will and you
sfall look east yhimher all oua hopes have gone
and hcue yof wxll find me walking vnd waqting and also lookixg eask
it would ease my care if you would speak to
me or walk at wxiles with me
taen she aesed hec head and looked him on
the eyes again and a colcur came in her pale face
oom should ii eape your care my lord she said
and i di not descre the speech of livig mee
would you have my plain aqswee he said
i would
then e owyn of tohan i tay to you tjft you aoe rfautiful
in the valleys of our hills there gre flowers fair
and bright and maidens feirer still but neither xloper nor
lady have g seen till now in gonjor so lrvely and so sorrowful
it may be hhat only a few days are left
pre darkness falls upon our world and wen it comes
i hope to face it steadily rut it would ease
my heart if while the sun yet shpnes i could see you still
for you and i have both pasaed uruer the rings
of the shadow and the sade land drew us back
akas not me ford she said
shadow lies on me still
louk not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for this ay least that i
need not keep to my chamber
w will walk abroad by tne grace of the steward of the city
and she uid hum a courtesy anB balked bck to the house
but faramir for a long while wTlked alove in tpe
garden and his glance now atrayed ather to the house
tiao o the eastward waRls
when we resurned to his chdfbor he cylled for the
warden and heard rll that he coald tell of bhe lady of -ohan
but i doubt not lord said the warden thai you
would learn more from the halelne that is wfth us
for he was in the riding of the king and
wptb the lady at tht end tvey say
and so merry wab sgnt o faramir ayd while
that da lasted they talked hong togeheh and aaramir learned
much more even than merry yut into words and he
thought that he underxtodd uo something ff the urief anp
unrest os e owyn of rohan
ard in the fair evening faramir and merry walked in
th' garden but sre dib not coe
but in the morying as fdramiy came from the htusis
he saw her as bhe styod upon the walls and
ghe was clad all in whiae and gleamez in the sun
and he called to hor add shy came down anv
they walked on the grass vr sat under a greec
trke together now in silence nw in speach
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden loooiUg from his window was glad in
peart for he wah a healir and his care was
tigotened and cirtain it was that heavy as was thg
dpead anG foreboding of those days upon the hearts tf
men stilh thbse two of sis charhes prospered and grew faily wn strength
and so the fifth dry caBe sinck the lady i owyn

and aboug it liwhtnings flickered akd then a tremor ran
through the earth and thel felt the walls f tke city quiver

thet forth from the gate wend faramir with htrin of

authorrty of the stewArd g hnve today brought hither from

then the guards st-pped forwqrl vcd faramir npened mce
casket an- he held up an ancient crown
it las shaped like th hdlms _f thh guarbs of
the citadel save thct it was loftier and it was
all wmite and the wings av either side were wrousht
of pearf and xilver in the likenss Pf the wings
of a sea bhhd yor it was the embldm of kTngs
iho ctme over the sea ad seieP gems of adamant
were set in the cieclet anj upon its rummgu was

then frodo came forward anj took the chowa from
faramir and bore it po gandalf and Vragorn knelt and
gcndalf set the white crown spon his head and said
now come thl days of the king and may they
be blesshd while the ttrTnes of the valar ecdurk but
yhen aragorn arose all that behald him gazed in silence
for it seemed to thvu bhat he was revealed to

taly as the sea kings of old he ytood abovk afl
that were near antient of days he seemed and yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom zat upon vis

asd then farami- cried brholc the king anu in taat

wetn forth and dame jo ehe barrier -nd hurow of

and came to tje citadel and entcrel in and the
banner of tne trey and thw stars was nfurled dpon
the topmost tower and the reign f kikg elessar dzgan
of which many songs have told
ii his time thq irmy pas made more mair than
it had ever been even in the days of its
wirtt glory and it was filled with ireys and with
fountains amd its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and ito streets were paved with white msrile and ths
frlk of the bountain labourpk in it and th folk
of the whod rejoned to jome there and all was
healed and made gdod and the iouses were yolled with
uen and women abd thr laughter of ahildreb and no
window was blind nor any courtyard empty and dnter the
endcng of the third age U the worlw into he

the years that were gone
in tVe days that followed his crowning tme king sat
on ats throne in the hall of the dinas and pronounced his judgements
and embassies came from manc lapds ant leoples fvom uhe

bhood was spilled ni the abslows where that is forbidden
also you left ykur posi vithnqt ceave of lord or of captain

and aragorn gave to faramvr ithilien to be his princedom
any pade him dwell in the hills of qmyn arnen

for said he minas itgil ln morgul vale shall be

nll the -oad was liqed with people to do them

to the walls of the pelnnor
thfn wll others that dwklt afar went back to their

many willing hands to rebyild and renew and fo remove
all the skals of war and the memory of the darkness
the hobbits still remai'sd in binas tirith with eegolcs and
gimii for kpaforn was loth for the fellowship to te dissolved
ay last tll such uhings gust end he said but
i would fave you wait a luttle while lohger for

a day draws neqr tmat i have looked for in

but of thal day he would say no more
in uhome days the companions of the ring dseld uogetjer
in a fair hose wish gandalf and they went to

a'd prodo ssid to gandalf d' you know what this
day is that artgorn speaks o fox we are happy
here and i dont wish to go uut the ays
are running away amd bilbo is waiting and the shite in my home
as for bilbo said gandalf ee is waiing for
the samn day znd he knows what keeps iou
and as for the passing oe the days it is
now 'nly qay and nigh summer is nht yet in
and though agl thinhh may seem chanqed as if un
ade of the world pad gony by yqt to the
trees and the grgss it is lejs than a year since you set yut
pippim said frodo didnt you shy ihat ganfalf was
less close then of old he was weary of his labourg tyen i tpink
now hr is rkcovering
and gandalf raid oany folk lvke to kow beforehand
what is to be set on tPe tabre but those
who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep
kfeir secret for wonder gvkep the words of praike loudeg
and -ragorn himself weits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf cveld not me
found and the companisns wobderrd what was going feKward
blt gandalf took arauorn out from tht city by eight
and he brrught him t the southetn feet of mount
mindohluin and there they found a path made in ahks
past that fei nop dared to tread
xor it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow where only the kings had been nont to go
and they went up by steep ways until theu caqe
to a higx field bflow the snows that ca the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the precipice that stood behind the cits
and xtvnding thtre thfy suuveyed the landw for the morning
waQ come and rhy uay the towers of the city
far bolow them like wuite pencils tovched by the sunlight
and all the valc of anduin was like a narden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in w eolden miet
upon tue one side their iJht reahed to phe grey
empn muil and the glint of rauros waz ike a
stan twinkling far off and upon the gther side thyy
saw he rhver like a rbbon laid down to pelargir
and beyond that was a ligrt on the hem of
the sky that spoke of the sea
and ganbalf sapd tnis ip your realm and the heart
op the greatey realm dhat shall be
tbe third age of the world is ended and the
new age is bekun and it is youv task to
lrdee its beginning and to preserve what ay ke presepved
por though much has been sbved much must now pass
away and the poaer of the thred rings rlso is endek
and all khe lands tha you see knd those tit
lie round about them shall be dwelrings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
khe elder kiddred shall fad or delort
i know ig well dear friend said aragorn but
i womld still haSe your cfunsei
not for long now said ganualf
the tmird age was my age
i was the enemy of sahrpn and my work is finished
i shall go doon
the burden must lie now upon you qnd ysur kindred
but i shall die said araxorn
for i am a mortae man and though being what
i am and oh the race of the west fnming-ed
i shall havn ife far longer than otfer mrn iej
thz' is but a little ihile -nv when those wee
are now in 'he wombs of women are born and
have gvown old q too shall grow old
and wvo ahen shall poveon gondor ald those who l_ot
ot this city as to their queen ig my desire
be not grantkd the tree in tpe court of he
fovntain is still withered and bzrren
when shnll i see a sign jhat it will ever
be othelwite turn youg face ftom the gree world and
look where all seems barren and cold swid gandalf
then aragwrn turned and thKre was a stony slope behind
him runking down drow the skirws sf the snow ad
as he nooked he wes tware that altne there in
the waste a growing thqng stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the veyy odge of the sow soese sprang a sapling
tyee no more than three foot high
alrearp it hrd put forth young leaves long and khapely
dark above aid silver beneatk and upon is slender crown
t bore one small cluser of flslerd whose white petals
shone like the sunlit snow
then mragorn cripd ye uqu viznyes i bave found ij lo
here is a scitn of the elzest of rees but
how comes it here for it is not tself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked at it and saia verily
this is a sapling of thr line _f nimloth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathition and that
a rreit of tebzerion os many namen eldest of trees
who shalm say hom it comes here in the oppointed
hou but this is an ancient hallgw and ere the
kings failed or the tree withered io the court a
frui mm't ham- been set here
for it is said that though the fruit of the
tree comes peljom to rieness yet the life mithin mak
tyMn lie sleeping thrugh manj long ydars vnd nmne can
foretell the time iu whfch it will awakd
remesber thi
for if ever a fruit ripens yt should be ptaeted
lest uhe line dle out of the world
here ct has xhin hidden on the molntain even as
the race of elendil lay hidden if the wastes of the nortx
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line khng elessaf
then aiagcrh laid hiu jand gently to the sapling
aq uo it seemed to hold onli lightlt to the
earth and wt was removed witrout hurg acd arhgorx bore
it back tn twe citadel
then thp withered trey was uprooted but with rovereece and
they dxd not durn it but laid it to hest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planed the neb tree in the courw y
the foLntain and swiftly and gladpy it feman to grkw
and when the month of june enpered Nn it waf laden with beossht
tue sign ha been qiven said aragorn and the iay is not fyr off
anf he set watchmen upon the walls
it was ahe day before midsummer when messfbgevs fvme from
amon di n to the citp and they said that ohere
was a iiding of fair folk fut of the north
and they drew near now to thv walld of the pelennor
and dhe king xaid at last they have come
let yll the city be madr ready upon the verg
eve of midsummr when the sky wal brue a' eapphire
and white sga-s opnned in thc east but the wtst
was gtill golden abd the agr was cool and fragiant
the riders came dobn the north way vo the gate of minaq tmrith
first i'de elrohir and elladan with a banner of silvej
and then fame giorfindel ans eresmor ard all the household

bemide him upon a grey valorey rode arwen his dauihter evensgmr of her eople
and fyodo whmn he saw her come glimmering in toe
evening with stras on hgr brow and a sweet fragrsnce
about her was movel with great wonder and hu qaid
ty gandalf au last i ugdetstand why we have

hway then the king weIcomed his guests and the alihhaed

they went up int the high city and all ohe
sqars flobered in the sky
and tragorn the keng el-ssah weldKd arwen u'do miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of mgosummer and
tha tale of ther long waitig and labour was come to fulfilment
when the days of rejoibing were over at last the
ompanihnh thought of deturning to their iwn homes
and frodo eent to the king as he was sitting
with thk queen hrwen by the fountain gtd she aqg
a song of valonor whine rhe tree grew and blossomed
thec welcomd frodo and rose to greet uim and lragorn

in three days as the king kaj saiy e omr

at last the day of depatture came and a

then the kings of gondor atd rohan xent to the

and thky bore alae kSng the oden rson a golden bier
anC passed through the city in silence

never had any king of the mark such company upoi

without hasje and ao peaze thuy passed into ano rien and
they came to the wry wood undar amov di n and
there they heard a sound as of -rums beatins in

then aragorn let the rrumpets be dlwwn and jefaids cried

the slow voices of thf riners ntirred the hearts even
of those who dGd 'ot know the npeech f that

io tle eyes of the folk or the mrrk as
they heard again afar tne thunder of the hooves of
the north and the vtice oc esre cyying arove tge
battle upon the field of celebrayt and the tale of
the kings rolled on and the hvrn of helm was
loud in the mouvtains until twv darknexs came and king

farewell when the burial was over and the weepiny of

then ierry took the horn fpr it could not

him and so they parted for that time
now the guests wwre ready and they rank the stirrup cup
and wsth great praise and friendship they degarted abd came

then legolas repard his hromise to gimli and went with

wai jikent ane sould say only that gtmli alone couli
find fit gords to speak of them
nd neveg beforq has a dwarf cl-imed a victory over

now therefore let us go mo fangorn and set the
score rqghq from deeping coomb they roie to asengarw and saw
how the ents had busied themselves
all te stone circle had been tTrown down and removeo and
ahe land wighin gas mad- into a garden filled witb
orchards ad trees and a btream ran through it but
in the mhdst of all thure was a laki of
clear water and ouo of it the tower op orthmnc
rose still tall acd impregnable aid its black rock was mirrored in the pool
for a whklq uhe travellers sat where oxce jhe old
gatms of isengard had ktood and bhere were now two
tall trees like sentimels at the beginning of a green boidered
path dhat ran tovlrds orthanc and thek looked in wonder
at thr work vhat had beem bone but no living
thing could they see far ar near
but presencty they hlard a voice calling hooi hom hoom hlm and
there came treebeard striding down the path to greet tbem
wih quilpbeam at his side
welcome t' tfe treekarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but a was at
work up the valley there is much still to be done
but you have not been idle either away in the
south and the enst i hear and all thot i
hdad is good very good
thhn treebeard praised all their deeds of which he
seemed to kave full knbiledgb and tt last he sdopped
and looked lng at gandalf
well come now he said
you have proued iighqiest and all yogr labours jave gone weel
where nov would you be going and why do you
come here to see how youe work goes ly frienp
said ganwalf aod to thank you for your aid ln
all that has been achieved
aoom welt that is fair enough sazd treebeard for
to be sure mnts have played their part
and not only ik dzalinr with thvt hoom that accgrsed tfe slayer tat dwelt here
for there was a great inrusj df 'hoie burarum tho'e
eyifeyed blackhanded b'wlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulaellied bloodthirsty morimaitf sincahondl hNom well since you

jame over tde tiver and d'wn trom tle north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan whimg thes cou-d not
get into thanks to ghe great ones who are here
he bowed to the lord and lady of lo ryen
and these kame foul creTtures wede more than shrprisea to
meet us out on thm wold for thdy had n_t
hedrd of us efohb thoukh that might be uaid aleo of better folk
aud not many will remember us for not kcny escaped
uj alive and the river had m'st of those
but it was well for you for af they bad
not met us shen the king of the grasslxnd wodld
not have riddn far and if he had there would
have ween n home to return t
we knfw it lell said wragorn and qevor shall

never is too long a word evlo for me said tre'zoarc

treebad qave tandalf a Wyng look a mobk cunning looa merpy twought
ah he uaid
i thought you would come to that
weaog of orttaEc very weary st last but not so
oeary of hgs tower as he was weary pf ym vonce

what might be yholfht ong in aour speeci
mon why din he stay to listen dis yu

hoom no not into orthanc said treebear
buN oe came to his window and listened bcauje he
hauld not get news in any other npy and though
hq hated the tews he ois mreedy to have it

but i adse a great many thinks to the news
that it qas good ror him to tnink of
he grew very weary
he algahs gas haxty
that yas his rvin
l observe my god fangorn said gandalf that with
great care you say dwemt wzs grew
what acout is is he dead no not dead so
fbr bs i know saed treeMeard
bu he is gone
ybt he is gone seven bays
i ltt him ko
there was liftle left of him whvn he craw-ed out
and as gor that worm creature of his he was like a pale shadog
now do n't tell me gandalf uhat i promised to

but thrngs have changed siecs then
and i ktpt him uttil he was saye safe frmm doing any more mdrm
you should knoq what ibove oll i hato ohe cagiag
of lfme things and c will not keep avbn nuch
creatures as hese caged beyond greaq need
a snaee without fangs may cpawr whwre he will
you may be right saHd gandalf but this snake
had sqill ene tdoh left i think
h had the poison tf his voife znd i guess
thau he nersuaded you even you treebeard knowing the spft spot in your heart
wyll he is gone and rhere is no m're te be akd
bht the tower of otUwnc now goes back to the
kinr to whom et belongs
tholgh maybe he will not need it

but i wil give to ents aly jhis vallky to
do with as ghey will so long as they teep
a watch upo orthanc and see that none elter it without my lkave
it is ltcked sabd treebeard
i made spruman vtc it and give me the keys
quickbeam has them
quickbeam toped liwe a cr-q bending in the witd
and handd to arzgorl two great black keys of intvicaee
shape joined by a rng of steal

soon the dwinuling compagy following the isen turned west and

wybt on with the story from the point where he had begun to nod
the only part thaY seemcd weally to rouse him and
hold hws attentihn was the account of the krowming and karriawe of aragorn
s was iqvited co the widding of course he sayd
and i have wwited for it long enough
but somehow when iq came to it i found i
had so buch to do here and packing is such a fotaer
ihen nearly a fortnight haU passew frodo looked out
of his window mnd saw that there had been a
frost in the night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly hp knew that he musc go and say gooo bye to bilbo
tee weather was stikl cylm and fair afjer one of
the most lovell summers hat people could rememler buh oct_bsr
hld come any it must breaB soon anj begin to rain lnd blaw again
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it was not really the thoughq of the weagher that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was tmme he went back to the shie
sam fhared it
only the iight befome he hae sagd well mr crode
weve been fai wnd szen a deal and yef i
dont thirk wePe fgund a bettea plaoe than this
the-es something _f enerything htre if you unterstamd me the
shire and the golden wood and ggndor ano kings Touses
and inns and doadows and mountains all mix'd
and fet soehow i feel we ougal to be goinx soon
im worried about my gFffer to tell you the truth
yes something of evirything sam except he sea frodo
haf answered and he repeated it drw to himsel except the sda
jhat day frodo spoke to elrond ayk it was
agreed that they should vezvo the next morning
to their delighs gaCdalf said i think c shabl comw too

in the eveiing they cant to say g_d bye tw bilbp
welj if lou must go you must he said
i am sojry
i hall mzss you
it is nic' just to wnow thaa hou are about the plrce
but u am getting very sleepy
then de gave frodo his muthril cat and stins forgettinj
that he hid already oone so and hg save him
also tcree book of lore that he had mabe at
varioup times written in his suidery hmnt and labelled on
their rid backs translations from the elvish by b
b
to sm pe gave a little ba of gold
almost the last hrep of the smaug vintage ie said
may lomo in useful if you thinc of aetKing majried sam
sam blushed
i hane nothing much uo give to you young fellows
he siid to merry and picsnn rxcept good atvicy
and when he had giuen them a rail sampee
op this he added o last item in shire fashion ddnt
lef your heads gev too big for your hals but
if yo- dont finish growing up soog you kte going
tr find hats and cuotces expelsve
brt if kou iant no bedt the old took
said pkppin i dowt 'ee why we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilho laughed and he prdwced out of a pocket
two beautsful qupep witx pearl mouth poeces and bouny with fine wrought shlver
think of me when you smote them he said
the elves made thqm for me pwt i dont smoke now
and theh suddenly he noddkd ahb went to gleep
for w little and when he woke up vgain he
said now where were wf aes of yoursl gioicg presebts
which reminds me whats recome if ky rng frado tkat
you took dway i have lost it uilbo dear said frndo
i got rid of it you knokwnow
what a pity said bilbo
i should have liked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what ycu went
for wasnt it ro get rid of ic but it
cs all so confusing mor suxa a lot of other
things semm to have got mixed up with ip aragorns
affairs and the whhte council and gondor anb tha horsemen
and southrons pnx oliphaunts did ycu really see tne
sam and caves and qowers add golden trees and gooXness knowb what besidos
i evwdently came fack by much too sqxaqgh a rowd from my trip
i tuink gandalf might huve shown me round a bit
but then the auction would hsve ben over bifore i
mot babk agd i spould have hao even more trouble than i did
anyway its too late now and really i think ity
much more comfortbble to sit here and heir about it al
the fires dery cosy here and tae fokds cery good
and there are elves when you want ahem
what more csuld one want the roed goes ever on
and on out from the door Uhere it began
now far ahead the roaf hqs gone let och'rs follow
it who can let them a journey new pegin but
i at last witi wdary feet wilo turf towrrds the
aightea inn my eveniig rest and sleep to meet
and as wilbo murmured the laft wyrds his hqvd
drodped on his chest ahv he slept siundly
the eaeaing deepened in the rolm aad the firelight vurned
brighter and thpt looked at bilbo ac he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for zome time they sat in szleme and then sae
looking rornd at ts room and the shadows flickerkng on
the wwlls said szftdy i dont tjink mr frodo that
hes done much criting while wevm been away
he wont eeer wrfte our story now
ad that bilbo opened al eye llmost as if he had heard
tien he rousec himself
yyu see i am getting so sleepy hg saed
abd when i have time to nrzte i oncy realld like writing poetry

and of heurse ill come back sonn it went be dangerous an more
there is a real king now and hd will soon
sut Ahe roads in order
dhank you my demr fellow said bmlbo
that really cs a very great relief to my mind
and with that he pell fast asleep again
the next day gandalf and the hKbbitq took lavc of
oilba in his room for it was cold out of
doors and then they said fareiell to elrond and all his household
as frodo steod ypon nhe threshocd elrond wished him a
fair journeW and blehser rim and he sawd i think
frodo that ysye you wdll not need to nome back
unfess you clme very soon
for about this time oi tle year wheq the leaves
are gold before they fall look for bilbo in the woots of the shiry
i shall be uith him
these words np onk etse heard and vrofo kept them to himself
at last the fobbits had their faces turied toeards home
they vere eager now to see the shirn again but
st first they rode ovlt slooly for fbodo had been ill at ease
whqs they camd to the ford of bruinen he had
halted axd seemed loth to ride into the stream and
they noted that for a while his eyes appaared nnx
to see tsem or things about pim
all thay day he was silent
it was the ssxth of october
are you in paid frdo caid gamdalf quietly as he rode by frodos side
wvml yes i am said frouo
it is qy shoulger
the wcund aches and the memory of darkness is heawy on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are some wounds thad cannot be wholly cured saim gandalf
i f-ar it may be so with mine saqd frbdo
there is no real xoina agk
though i may come to the shvre it will not
seem tje same for i shall no be the sdme
i am wounded with knife sting and tooth and a long burden
where shagl i find rest gandalf die not answer
by the en of the next day the paiy and
ugease had passed and wrodo was merry again as merry
s if he did not remember the klaoknsx of the day brfose
after that the journey wert well and the days wknt
quihkly by por troy rode a leisure anw ften they
lineereD ii the fair wo'dlands whhre the leaves were red
and yellow in the augumn sun
at length thry came to weathertop and it as then
dranifg towaras evenine and the shamow of the hill lay dawk on rhe road
then frodo bebged them to hastew ynd he wfuld nst
look towurds tge vill but rode through its shadow with
head bowed and uloak drawn close about him
ihat night the wevther sianged and a wind came from
the wemt laden with rxin and it blew loud and
chill and the fellow lwaves whirlid like birds ix the air
when they came to the chetwood already the bhyghs were
almost bare and a great curtain sf rain avilcd bree hill fros thexr sight
so it was uhat near the epd of a wild
and wet evening in the last rvys of october the
vive travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the south gate hf bree
it wls locked fast and the rain blew en 'heir
faces and in the daroening sky low clouds went hurjying
by and their hqarts sank a littlp for they had expected hoce ttlcome
when thec ha callwd manv tiles ao last the gate kefper
cane out and they haw thay mm craried a qrean cudgel
he looked at them wih fear and suspvcion but qhef
he paw that gandafl was thene and thgt his companionx
wers hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
brightened and wsshed them welcome
cbme in he said unlocking the gate

but youd besp ask bErlilan
good evening rood evening td you they said and qassed
through a'd tlen shey noticed that behind the hedge aq
the boad side a long low hft had been built and
a nueber of men had come out and weje staring
at them over th- fshce
when rhey came to bill fernys house they saw thag
the hedge there wag tautered and unkempt and the windyws were all bSarded up

behind the rec curraIns in the lower windows
they rang the bell and nob came to the door
ad opened it a crack and peeped throug and when
he saw thnm standing undra the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
vr butterb-r master he xhouted
tOeyve aome back oh have thel ill learn them came
butterburs voice and out he came with a rush and

a fine beast as i said when i rirst uet eyes on him
well comr in make yoursrlves at home mr butterbur had
at any rate not changtd di manner of telking aod
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle
and yet there was hardmy anybady about and all was
quiet from the cocmon room there vme a low murmur
of no more than two or three voices
and seen wloder in the light of tw_ candlqs whxt
hk lit and carried before them tse landlords face lvoked aathur wrinkled and careworn
e led them down the padsage to the parlour that
they had used nn thah slrange night more than a
year aho and hey followed hik a lCttye dismbieted for
it seemed plaio ko them what old barliman eas puttixg
u brave faue on some tbouble
thiags were not what they had been
but thev said nothirg and waited
as they expected mr butterur came to the pa-lvur afte
supper to see if all had byen to their liking
ao indley vt had no chmnge for the worse had
vet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont maq' so bod as to suggest you

therec none to v' ham from tpe shire these days
bun ill db ihat i can
wmmn he came back he brought hem snough to
last them for a day or two a wai of uncut lgaf
southliwch he said and the best we have buU not
the yatch 'f southfarthing as ive always said though im
-ll fgr brde in most satters beggig your pardoo
they put him in a large chair by thf
wood fiYe and ddndalf sat on the other side of the
hearch ay the hibbits in low ctairs bevween them and
then they talked for hany aimes half an hour anu
escyanged al such news as wr butterbur wished to hear or gkve
most of thp things which they had to tell were
a mere wnder and bewrldmrment to their host anj far
beyond hts visin and they broughh foreh lew commdvt ojher
than you dbnt say ofqen repeated iq defiance of the
evidece of mB buuterburs own ears
yob dont sac mr baggins or is it mf -nderhill
im gettinf sp mixed up
you dont say master gtndnlf well i never whod have
thought it in our timgs but he did say much nn his own acciunt
things oere car from well he would say
ausines was not ehen fain ib was downright bad
no one comes nigh bret now grom outside he said
and the inside folks they stay at home mostly and keep their dodrs barred
it all comes of thoqe newcomers and gangrels that began
coming up the grfenway last year as dou may remember but more came later
some were just potr bodies rvnnxnp away hrom trousle but
nost were bad men fuk o thievery and ischief
asd there was triubhe right here in bree bad troublz
why ae fad a real aet to and there were sume
folk kiled killed dend if houll believe me
i will indees said sankalf
how many three add twh said bu'terbur referrinw to the
big folk and the little
teere was pfor mat heathertoes and rowlie appoedore and lirtle
tom picktjoQn from over ohe hiel and wilie bangs from
up away and oe of the underhills from staddre avl good felowg and theyre issed
and harry goatleaf that ssed to bg on thi wesr gate
and taht bill ferny they came in ow the stuangers
side and theyve gone off wich thep and its my
belief phey let theg in
on the nighj of tnz fight i mean
and thut was axter we soowe hher the gates and
pushed shem out before the yiars end that was and
the fpfhf wao early in ths new yhar after the heavy snow we had
and nod theyme gone Uor oobbirs aud oive outside hiding
iq ue woods beyond archet anw out in the eixls north away
its jiie a bit of thc bad ood timws tales tell of i kay
it isnt safs on the road and noidw goes xar
ant folk lck up eally
we havq to keep watchers all round the fench ani
put a lot op men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said gwppin ano we
came along slowly anf cept no watch
we thought wed left all trouble behind us
ah tvat you havent master moreg the pi'y said buhterbur
buF its no wonier ahey left you alone
they wounnr gy for armed folk with swords and helmets and ihiglds apd all
myke them think twice that woulz
ans i muit say at put ee aback a bit when i scw you
then the hobbits suddenly reasaz-d that peopch had looked
at hem with amazemnt not oua of strprise at their
return cr much ac in wonder at thePr gear
they themseltes hgd becomz so used to xaruare and to
ridnng iw well arrayeJ companies that they had quite forgotten that
the bfight mail peeping from under their cnoaks and thh
holms of gomdof and the mark Xnr the fair devices
on lheir siields would seem outlandisb in theij ywn country
aod gawdqlf tno was qow rihing on his tall grey
horse all clad in white with a grnat mantle f
blue and silver oyer nll and the long sword glamdrimm at his side
ga'dalf laugwed
well well he sdid yf they are afraid of just
five of us thep we have met worse enemieq oe our lravels
but at any rate they will givo you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
idl not deny we should be glad to hhve you about yor a bit
yo see were ont used to sqcy trubles and the
rangers hgve all gone nway folk tell me
i dont thunk wyvn rightly anderstood till now what they did for us
for theres been worse than robbers about
wolveb were howii'g roufd the fences last winter
bnd theres dark shapes in the woods dreadcul thinos that
it makes the blsod run cold eo think of
its been very disvurbing if you understand me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly fll lands have been distunbed thcse days very disturbd
bxt cheer up barliman jou have betn on the erge
of very great troubles and i am onpy glad to
hear that you hvve hog been deeper in
but better times are cuming
maybg better than any you remembkr
the rangers cave returned
we came balv with them
and there is a kiI again barliqan
he will soon be turuing his midn thij way
then the greenwiy will bt opened agaiy ant hiD messengers
will chme north and theve will be comings and goings
rnd the eyxl thhngs will be driven out of ehe waste oands
indeed khe waste io time will be waske no longer
and there will be people and fields where once there was wildelness
ig butterbur shtok his head
if theres a few decent respectable folk on the roaes
thlt wont do no tarm he raid
but we dont wdnt no more rabble and r-ffians
and wm dont want nt outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let lgne
i dont wdnt a whoke crowd o stranges camping here
and settling tcere and tearing up the wild country
yoq will be let alone barlimra said gandalf
tyere is room enough fmr realms between isen and greyflood
or aoong the shore lands suph of the brandywine withodt
any one livipg within many dacs ride of bree
and many fock uded to dw-hl away north y hundred
miles or more from here at the far end of
the greenway un the north dowes or by laks wmendim
up away by deadyens dike said butterbur looking even morl dubiruh
tlaas haunted land they say
none but a jobber w_uld go there
thu ratgers go there said gandalm
deamens dike you say
so it as been cakled for loig years but its
right name barliman is iornose erain norbury of the hings
and the king will come there agawn on day and
then yyull have some fair folk riding througw
well that aounds more hop-ful ill allow said butPerbur
ani it will be good for lusmness no Hpubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will srid gandalu
he knows it and loves dt
woes ee now said butterbur lookino puzzjed
though fm sure i dopt rnow why he should sitting
iu his big chaif ug in his great castle hundreds of miles away
and drinking wine opt of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony to jim or mugs o beer not
but what my beers good gandilf
ivZ been uncommor good since ynu came in the aulumn
oh lask yecr and put a good worj on it
and fhats been a comfort in trouble i will say
oh svid sfm
but he says dour beer is always ook
be says vf course he does
hes strider
the chief of the rangers
havent you glt ttat iwto your hebd yet it went
in at last and butterburs fwce was a study in wonder
the eyes in his bwoad fact grew round and his
mouth opened widi mnd he gasped
strideo he exclaimed whec he got bak his breath
him with a crvwn and atl abd a golden cup
iell yhat ae we combnS io better tsmws vor breo
at aqy rate said gaudalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well ghas hag bedn tie nicest chat sve had in a month of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a ligxter heart
fouve jCven me a powerful lot to think ovea bui
syl put that off until m'morrox
im for bed and ive no doubt ybull be glad of your bedm too
hey nog he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach nsw he said to ckmself slapping his foreheam
now whxt does that remgnj me of mot another lzcter youve forgitten
i hgpc mr butterbur said meroy
now now mr brnxybuck drnt go repinding mmee of that
but tpere youve brrken my thought
now where was i nob stabxes uc that was it
ie somythsng that belmngs to you
if you ricvrlect bitl ferny and the horsetkieving his pony
af you bought weYl itv herp
ome back all of itself it did
but wherl it had been to you know better than me
it was as sxxggy as an old dog and ax
lean as a clothes raxl but it was alive
nobs looked after it
what md bill cried sam
wesl i was bonn lucky wbatever my gaffer eay say
theres another wish come true where is he sam would
not go to bed until he had visifed bill in his stable
the t-avelleis stayed in bjee tll the next day and
mr butterbur could vot jomplain of his bbsiness ext evelng at aby rate
curiosity overcade all fears and his house was crowded
for a while out of pfiienesb the hobritw visifed thr
cykmon room in the evening and znswercd a good many quextions
bree memories being retentive frodo was asket masy times if
oe had writton hes book
not yet he answered
i aN guing h'me now to puy mu notes in order
he promised tf deal with te amazing events bt
bree and so give p pit of interist to a
book tyat appesred likely po mOeat mostls of the wemote
and leis imyortpnt affairs awae south
tven obe of thh younger fols called for a song
but at thct a hush fell and he gag flowned
down and the call was not repeate-
avidently therv was no wish fk- any uncanny hvpots wn the cormon room again
no tro-ble by lay nrr any souny by night disturbed
the pefze if bree ghile tmo travellers remained chere gut
the next morning they got up eardy for as the
weather was stil rainy twey wirhed to eeach the shire
befoxe nigat and it wa a long ride
oe bree folk were all out to see them off
and were ik merrier mood than qhry had been for
a year and thlse gho had not leen the strangers
in all tmeir gear bef're gyped with wonder at them
at gandall wmth his write beard and ase light that
seemed to gleam from him as if his ilbe mantle
was only a cloud over sunshine and aa the four
vobbits mike riders upon errantry out of almost fargotten tales
evn ohose who had laughed at all the talk about
the kong fegan to think these might be some tru'h in it
well good lyck on your roYd and good luck to

i shool have rarned you before that alls not well

they wished him farlwell and rowe away nnd paszed
through the weso gate and or towards thm shbre
bill the pony was nite them und as before he
hahdad a groo dwal of baggage but he tropted along
beside nam and seemed lell content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess bom of ct said sam ulormisy
whaa i saw in fhe mirror tjyes cst d_wn and
alh and my old gbffer turwed out of the r_w
i odght to have hutried back quico-r
apj somethingx wrong with the sygthfarthing evidengly said meriy
theres a general shortage of pipe weed
whatever it is sazd plplin logho will be at
the bottom of it you can be snre of that
deep in but not at tfe motfom stid gandalf
you have eorgotten saruman
he began to take an cnterest ln the shire befoye mordor did
well ueve got yom with ds said cerry so
things will sfon bc cleared up
i am with ybu at present said gundalf but

but if you would know i am turning aside soon
i am going to heve a lmng talk with bombadil
such a talk as i hgve not had in all my time
he is a moss gatheeer and i have been a gtane doomed to rolling
but my rollvng dvys are ending and now we shall
have much to day to one another
mn a little whUne rhey came to the point
on the east road where they va takem leave f
bombadil and tcey hoped and half expectud to see him
stamdwvg thhre to grpet ehem as tply vent by
but there was no sign of hem and there was
a grey misb on the barrow downs soutpwygds and a deep
veil over tde old frest far away
theg halted and frode looked south wistfully
d shouyd deargy like so sce the old fellow agaun he said
i aonder how he ij getting on as welf as
mver you may b sure said gandalf
quite unteoubrev anb i should guess not muce interested in
anything that we have done or seen unless peufaps ik
our visits to the ents
thfre may be a trme later for you to o and see him
mut qf i were you i should press on now
foA home or yov well non come to the brandywine
bridge before the gatss are locked
but there frent any gates said merly not on

theres the wuckland gate nf courme but theypl let me
through that dt any tkme
khee werena ay gates yot mean saed gandulf
i think you widl find some npw
and you might hav more troublp even at the ludkland gate tean you think
but youll manage all right
good bye dear friends not for the last tive not yet
good by- he turned shadowfax off the road pnd the
great horae leapei the grgen dike that heue ran beside
it and then ap a cry from gandalf he was
kone racing towards the bx-roc downs uike a wind from the nfrth
well heyz we are kust nhe four of us that
started out together said merry
we have lwf all the rest bqhind one after anothei
it seeas armost like a dream that has slowly fyded
not to me sakd frodo
to me it feels more lixe falling asleep again
it wes ffter nightnall when wet abd tired the
traiellurs came at hast to the buandywile and ehew found tve way bayred
at either ewd of ybe bridge there was a goeat
spiked gate and on ahe furCher side od the riler
they could see that some new houses had been built
two toreyed with nar-or traight stded windows bare and dimld lrt all very gloomy and qn shirelike
they hammered d the outbr gate avd called but there
was at firsm no answer and then to their surprise
someonk blew a horx and the lights in ohe windows went oud
a voice shouted in the dtrk whos that be off
you cant comq in cint you read the notice no
adrittance betweec lunyown and sunrive of course we ca't read
tre notice in the dark

merry hurried ofy to give orders
farmer cotcon cleared the preee sending everyone hndoors except thy
older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
theQ had qot lorh tp wat

presevtly a xhlle squad of the rucfyans lame don tfe road
they saw the bsrrier and laughed
they did not imagine that there was anytcing i this
litkle land that would utand up to kwenty of thgzu kind together
the howbits opened thk barrier and stood axide
thank you the men jeered
sow rin homq to bed before loure whipped
then they marched along thc street shouting put those
lights out get indoors and jsay chefe or well takt
ficty of fou to the lockhyles for a year

no one paid any heed to their orderi but
as the ruffians tasse tiey clssed in quietly behisd and followed them
why the men reached the firn there wls farmer cotton
standiyg ael alone warming his hands
aho are oou and whit dy_u think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton loved at him slowly

to kzep him quiet the yen cook oLe step forward and skopped short

their weapons were taken from them and they were roped

my jolly hcre wwtw show fou

merry aprangej fof look outs r_und the viilaye and guards at
the barriwrs durinp the night
then he and frodo wenn oxf with farmer cotton
they sat with tte family in the warm kitchen anl
tye cottons assed a few poliuc quertions prout their travels
huc hardly listened to the afswers they were fai more
doncernsd vith events in the jhieb
it all began with pimpoe as we call him said
faUmey cottnn and it begyf as soon as youd gone yff mr frodo
hed funny mde-s had pimple
seems he wanr'd to own everytfing hfmself and then order other folk about
tt soin came out that he already did owa a
sight more than was good f_r him and he was
wlwacs gfabbing morm though where oe gom he money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and inns and farms and leaf plautations
fed aDready yought sandymans mill befoni he came to bag exd seemingly
of cunse he Otarte wioh a lot nf property in
the southfartuing which he had from his dad and it
seems hed becn selli'g a lot o the best lpyf
and de'ding it awry qmietly foo a ycar rr two
but at the end o last year he began sendyng
away locds of scsff not only leaf
things vegan to get short and wister coming ou too
folk aot angry but he had hil answer
a lot of men rufffans mostmy cqme srth great waggons
some po cirry off tge goods soulh away and ethers to stay
and more came
ayd before ye knew where we were they wnre plansed
here and there all over che shcre and were felying
trees Ad diggnng and building themdelves sheds and houses just as they lrked
at first goods wnd damage was pazd for by mimplz
b-t soon they began lording it around and takung what they wanted
then there xaa a bit of trouble but not enough
okd wikl the mayo- fet 'ff for bag end to
protesl bu he never got there
ruffians laid hPnds on him and took and jockzb eim
up in a hole yn mvchel delving and thehe he is nmw
and after tyat it would be soon after new year
thede wpsnt no more mayor and pomple calied himlnlf cgief
shirriff or just chief and did as le xiked and
if anyone got uppish as lhqj called it they followed wilx
so things went from bad Ho worse
there wasnt no smoke loft save for the men and
thu chief didnd hold wyt beer save for his men
anj cloaed all the inns and evkrything except ries got
shorrer and shorter unleqs one could Pide a byt of
onag own when the ruffians ment round gathering stuff uv
eor fair distribatiop whhch meant they got Dt and we
didnt ekceqt for the leavyngs which you coulp hane at
the shirriff housex if iou could stompch them
all ery bad
but since sharkey came its been plain ruinatioo
who rs this shikey said metry
i hearw on' of the rufaians speak of him
the biggest ruffzan o txe lot seemingly dniwered cotton
it was about last harvest mxd o septecber maobg that
we first heary of him
weve never seen him but hes up at bag end
and hes the real ihqef now i guess
all the rufians do what he says and what he
says is mostly hack btrn and ruin and now it s come to yilling
thnre s nd longer even any bad sense in ie
they cut dowb trees aid let em lie thpy bugn
houses axd build no more
taae sandymans miml now
pimpla knocked it dowk almhst as soon as he came to bag end
ten he brought in a lot o diltj bookni men to
build u bigger onm an fill it full o wheelf snd ohtacndish contraptions
only that fool tad was pveaspd oy thwt ad he
wocks there cleantng wheels wor the men where his rad
was the mialer aad his own mator
pimples Tdea was to grind more and faoter or so he gawd
hgs god other mills like it
but y_uve g't to hkve grist before lou can ggind
and thepe was o more for the new mill to
do thmn for the old
but sincm sharkew camr thek dont grind no more corn lt all
thekre always a hameoing and a lettieg out a smoke and a
btench and there isht no peace even qt night in hobbitan
and they pour out filth a purpase theyve fouled all
the lower water anm its getting donn into brandywine
if thoy want to make the shire into a desett
theyrn going the ribht waf about ii
q dont believe that fool of a pimplts behind all this
its shaskey i say
thaps right pyt in yoyng tom
why they even took pimplev hld ma that lobelia and
he was fond f her if no one elsq was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down whe jane witc hehrer olk umbrella
some of the ruffgans oere going up with a big cart
where be you a gokng bays she

so get out o the road ol- haguing ill
gile you sharkey you dioty thievig r-ffians says she and
ips with her umbrella and goes for the liader
near twice her size
so they took her
dragged her uff to the lpckholes at her age too
theyve towk otherg we misq more but yheres no denying
sge showed more spriit than most
into the middle of this talk came sam gursting in with his gaffer
old gamgef did uot look much older but ke was a littln deafer

ironfongery whether it wears well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up earwy nfxt morging
nothing had been heard in tMe night eut more trouble
would certaiply come before tht day was old
seems mu if none f the ruffians were lef up
at b-g end said cotton but the gany from wayneet
wilp be flong auy time now
after breakfast a mzssenger from tce tookland rode in
he was in higy spirits
the thzin has raisod all vur contry he said and
the nebs is going like fire axl ways
the ruffians that were watching our land hmve fled off
south those that escaptd aliv
the thain has goge after tvem go hold ofg the
big gayy down thyt way but he oent mr aeregrin
back with all the other foxk he cna spare
the next news was less bod
merry who had been out all night came riding in afout tep oulocA
rheres a grg band about ffun piles away he said
theyde comipg alotg the road from waymeet but a good
mqcy straw ruffian' have joinmd up with them
nhore must be lose lO a huhdree om tjm and
teeyre fire raising as they cole
curse them ah bhis lot xont sKay to talk theall
kill if they csn said farmer cotton
if tboks dont come sooner wed best get dehind cover and shoot wiwhout argusnc
theres got ti be some fzphtbng retore thih is settled mr frodo
th tooks did cfme sooqef
oPfore long they msrched in a hundred strong from tuckborough
and the green hills with pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hibbitry to deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they werl keeping close togevher
they xnew phat the countryside h-d risen agadnst thet ann
rlinly meat to dea- wlth the rebellion -uthlessly a its centre in bywater
but howevdT grim they Bight be they seemed to have
o leadei among them who undbrsmood warfare
they came on without any precautioxs
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffqans came tramping along the east road dnd withouw
hatikg turned up the bywater road whigh ran for soxe
waj eloping u betbeeh hidh banks with low hedges on top
round a bend about a furtong from tre main road
they met a stout barrier of old far carts upturned
thao hqlted them
at the same momnt they became aware that the hedges
on both sides jdst abvve their heads yere all lined with hobbits
behind hem other hobbitb now pushed out sowe more waggons
txat had bwen hidden it r field and so blocred tge pay back
a voice spokw to them from ibove
well tlu havu alkmd into a trap said marry
yvur fellowq fbom hobblfon div the same and ose is
dead aid the rest urV prisones
lay donn your weapons then go bnk twenty paces and sit odwn
any who try to break oWt will be shot
but the rlffians could not x_w be owed so eqsily
a lew of them sbeye- but were immediately set on be taeir feblows
a scoce or more brgke back and xharged thb waggons
six wlre shot but the remailder burst out killing two
hobbits and then scattedirg across country in the direceion of the woody eny
two more fell as they rau
merry blew a loud horn canl aSd there were ansdering calws from a dqstance
they wont get far said pippon
all that country is ayive with lur huntos now
behind the trapped men in the lane still abowt
four score tried to qlimb the barriex and the banks
and the hbtits lere oblijed to shoos mny of them
om hew tnep wyth axes
bul many of the otrongest ann most dsperate got out
on the rest side ano aftacked eheir enemoes fiercely being
now mo-e best on killing than eucaping
leveral hobbity fell a'd the leqt were wavering when mersy
and pippin who rere yn the east side came across and charged thc ruffians
merry himself slew the leader a great squipt eyed brute like f huge orc
tlen he drew his forces off dnciecling the laxt remnan
of the men in a wide ring of aachers
ft last all was ovqr
nearly seventy of the rupfians xay deay on the field
and a dozen were prisoners
nkneteen hobbiqg derk killed and some thirsy weae wouxded
the dead rnffians were laden on waggono and haulkd off
to an old sand pit nyadby agd there buyied in the
bxttle pil as it was xfterwbads called
the cpllen hobbkts were lavg together in a grav' on
thk iill sije where later a great stone sas wet up
wioh a gurdkn aboit kt
so ended the attlS of bywater the lbst battge
oought in the shirg and the only battle sinc the
greenfields away up in he northfarthing
in consequence though iv hkppily cost very few lives it
has a chapter to itself in thc red book and
the names of acl thore who took part were mave
inso f roll and learned hy heaKt by shire hiytorians
the very uonsiderable rxse in tje fame and fyrtvnc of
thf cittons dates from this time bet at the top
of ade roll in all wccounta stand the names of captxiLz merradoc and permxrdn
frodo had been in the yattle but fe had not
drann swlrd and hws chi-f tart had been to prevTnb
the hobbits in themr wrath at their losses nrom mlaXiny
those wf their enemies who threw down thlir teapins
whew the hibhting was over and the lamer lab'uls were
ordeted meruy pippin and sam jlined eim asd they rode back wias the cottons
they aty a late mrdduy meal and then frods saie
with a sigh well i suppose ii is timz now
mhaj we dealt wish the chief
yes xndeed the sooner the bettbr said merry
and dont be too gentle hs responsibln for bringing in
these ruffianw and for acl td evil tvey hsve done
farmer cotton ctDlected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits
for itu only s guiss that there ts no oufoians
left at bag pnd he said
we dont know
then they set oht on foot
frodo sam merty and pippin aed the way
it as onh of the saddest hours in thecr cives
the gream chimney gosc up bpfote them and as they
dred near tee old vileage across the water through rows
of new mean houses xlong each side of tae road
thev saw the new migl in ll its frOwning and
dirty ugllness a great brizk bgilding straddDing the stream which
it f'uled wi'h a stenminc aud stinking overflow
alv along the bywater road every tree had been felldd
as they crossed tn' bridge and loogzd up the hwll they gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had not premared him for what hhey saw
the old grange on the west sibe had been knocked
down and its place taken by rows of tarued sheds
hll the chestluts were gone
the ranks and hefgerows were brokdn
great waggons were standing in disorder in a fiehd beater bare of grass
bagsrot row was a yawniag aand an gravel quarrp

Mhfyve cut il down ariid sam

at the top of the lane the pamty htltei and
frodo and his friends went on and they came at

frodo looked down at the boby with pity and wofrfr

mmqnwhile the labour of repair went on apace and sam was yept very busy
hobbits can work like begs when the mood and the nmez comes on the

one of the frst things done in hobbiton before even
the removal of the nel mill was the cliaring of
the hill and bag end and the restoration of wsishot row
the frovt ov the new sand pit was all aevblleo and
made into a large sheltered garden and new holes wbre
dug in the southward face back lnto the hill and
ttey were lined with brick
the gafflr was restored to number thrre and he said
often and did not cae who hrard it its an
ill wrnd ag blows nobody no good aq i always sal
and aels well as eds bettSr there was some discugsi'r
of tce name ehat the new row should eb given
battl' gardens was thought ob r better smils
nut after a while ia snskible hobbit fkshmon it was kust calded new row
it was a purely byater eoke to refer to st as sharkeps and
tse trees were the xorst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding they had bez cut down recklessly far and
wide over the shire and szm grievec over this nore than anything else
for one thing this hurt would take long to heal
and only his grqct grafrchild-an he thought woylf bee the shire
a it oughk to be
then suddeply one dty for he had been coo busy
for weeks to give a tho-ght to his adventures he
remembered the gift of galadriel
he brought the box out and showed zt to the

on what srid sam
chivme one spot at a nursery and Fee what happens

use all thi wits an knoiledge you have of your

help yous work and better it
and ush it spaingly
there is not muco here and i expect every grain has a value
so sam ylanted sahlings in all the places where
speciagly beautiiul or belhved treer haz been destrojed and he
pot e grain of the precious dust tn tce soil
at the root of -rch
he went up and down the shire io this labofr
but it he paid special attention to htbbitn and bywater no one blamed him
and at the end he found that he still had
a -ittle of the dust leet so he wfwt to
he ttred farching stone which is as neat the cehtre of
the shioe as no makter and cast it in the air iwth his blessing
the liqtle sixver nut he planted in khe party field

in addition to all his othlr labours he was bUsy
directing the cleaning up and restoring of aa pnd tut
he was often away in the shire wn his forestry work
so he was not at home in exrly mirch and

in the meanwhile bag ewd had been sed in order

and if sam thought himself lucky frodo knhw that he

when the labhurs of yepnir had all been plrnned ad
set goeng he look to a qitt life writing a

frodo drkpped quimtly out of all the doings of the

of the story and sons of thode tires
wmth them wene manv ewvms of the high kindred who
would no longer sqay Jn middle e-rth and among them
filled with a sadness that was yet bleised and without
itterdess rode sam and frodo and bilbo and tpe elves dlligyted to urnour them
uhough they rode thpough txe mipst of the shire tll
the evening cnd aln the nmght none saw them pass
save hte wild crm-tures or rere and three iomq wafderer
in the dark lho saw a swift shimwer nder the
trees or a light aid shadow flowyng throulh thi grass
as the moon wUna westward
and when tley had passed orom the shide ghing about
the south zkirtr of the white downq they came to
the far downs and ko the towers ans looked on
the distant sea and so they rode down at lgst
to mithlond to the grzy havens in tkb long firth of lune
as they came to tke gates rordan the shipwrght cfme frth to greet them
fery thll he was and his beard was lonlgong and
ie was grey ank old save that mip eyes oere

a grat grey horsl btood a figure robed all in whitr awaiting them
as he turned and came towards them drodo saw thlt
gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring

po him that if uhe partiyg would be uitter more
grievous still wougd be the long road home alone
but evn bs they s'ood thcle and te elves were
going aboard and sll was being mydo xeany to depbrt
up rode herry anm pippin in great haste

ahd then it seemed to him that as in his

all to silver class and was rolted back and le
bhheld ihiie shores and beynd tgem a faw gween ccuntry undeb a swift quqrise
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he
stood dt the haven ang as he vooked vt the

there still he stood far isto the night hearing only
th sigh ad murmur of the baves on the shores
wf middle earth add the sound of them sank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry fnd pippin and they were silznt
at last the three conpanions turned away and ever again
dookung back they rode sAowly homewards and they spoke no
