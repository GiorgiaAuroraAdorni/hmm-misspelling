when mr bilbo baggins of mag ed onnounced that he
would shortly bbee cekebrating his eleventy first birthday with a psrty
of special magnificence there was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
iblbo was very rich and vejy peculiar and had been
the wonder of the shire for sixty years ever since
his remarkble disappxabance and unexpxcted retorn
the riches he had braught back from his travels had
now become a local tegend and it was popularly believd
whatever the old folk might say that te hill at
bag end wawsas full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that was not enough for fame shere aws
also his prloonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to have littli effect on mr baggins
at ninety he was much the same as at fifti
at ninety nine they bgean to call him well preserved but uachanged
would have been enarer the mrk
there wro some that shook their heads and rhough- ths
was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently prpetual youth as ell as reputedly inehaustible wealth
it will have so be paid for they said
it isnt natural any troublterouble will come of it but
so far trouble hd njt ome and as mr baggins
was generous with his money most people were willing to
forgivl him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on visitinm terms with his redatiies except of
course the sackville bagginses and he had many devoted admirers among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
bubtut he had no close orienbs ntil some of his
youngor couins cegln lo grow up
the elkest os these and bilbos favourite as yrung rfodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heri and brought him to live at bag end and
the hopes of the sackville bagginses were fnwluy dashed
bilob and frodforodo happened to have the sgme birthday september nd
you had better come ld live here frodo my lad
haid bilbo one day and then we can velebrate our birthday qrties comfortably together
at that tie frodo aws still in his tweeps
as the hobbits called he irresponsible twenties between childhnod and
comnig of age at tirty three
eah year the bagginses wad igven very lively combined birthday
parties at bag end but now it was understood that
something quite exceptional was being lpanned for that auutmn
bilbo was going to ce eleventy one a rather cwrious
numbur and a ery respectable age for a hobbit the
old took himself had only reached and wrodo was
going to be thirty three an important number the date
of his coming of age
tongues began to wag in hobbiton lnd bywlter and rumour
of the coming eent travelled all over the shire
the history and character of mr bilbo baggins became once
agajn the lhief tozic fo coniersation and the oldeh folk
suddenly found theri reminiscecnes i welcome demand
no one had a more attentive judience than old hma
gamgee commonly known as the gafefr
he held foeth at the ivy bush a smlal inn
on tje bywater voad and he spoke with some authvrity
for he had tended thi garden at bag end for
froty years and had helepd old holman in the same job before that
now tham ye was himself hxowing old and stiff in
the ojints the job was mainly parried on by is yoagest sox sam gamgee
both father and son were on ry friendl terms with bilbb and frodo
they lived on the hill itself in number cagsgot row just below bag end
a very nice well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive
always said the gaffjr declred
with perxeco truth or bilbo was very plite to him
calling him master hafast and consulting him constabtly upon the
growing of vegetables in the matter of roots especially
potaoes the zaffer was recoenizei as ghe leading authority by
all in th neighbourhood including himself
but what about this frodo that livys with him asked old noakes of bywater
baggins is his name but hes more than half a brankybuch they say
it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton hhuld go
looking for a wife away there in buckland were folks are so qheer
nad no wonder theyre queer put in dadny twofoot
the gaffers nxt door neighbor if they live on rhe wrong
side of thtehe brandywine river and right agin toe ol forest
thats a dark bad place im half the taletsales be trhv
youre right dad said the gaffer
not thut the brnnducks of buck land live in the old
norest but theye a queer breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
small wonder that toruble came of it i syy
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to meet
very much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hobbit was mr drogo baggins tehre was
never much to tell of him till fe was drownded
drownded aid severag voices
they had heard this and other darker rumours efore of
course but hobbits have a passion for lamily history and
they wee ready to hear it again
well so they say seid the gaffer
you see mr drogo he married poor miss primula brandbujk
ste was our mr bilbos first ocusin on the mothers
side her mother being the iounlest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo i his first and second cousin once
remved either wa as the saylng is if you fllow me
and mr droo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law olodld master gorbadoc sa he ofte did aftev his
marrivge him being partial to his vittles and old goradoc
keeping a kighty generous table ajd he went oft boatingok
the brandywine rievr and he and his wife were prowndyd
and pdor mr frodo only a child and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner
in hte moonlihgt said old noakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the beat
and i eard she pushed him in and he
pulled her in after him said sandyman the hobbiton miler
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaufnr who did not much like the miler
there isnitsnt no call tk go talking oe pshing and pulling
boats are quitk trcky enough for those that sit still
without looking futther for the cause of lrouble
anyway there was this mr frodo left an orphan anadnd
stranded as you mieyt say amonq those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular wjrren by all accounts
old master gorbadoc never had fewer tyan a couple of
hundred relations in thtehe place
mr bilb neyer did a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad bsck to live among decent folk
but h reckon it was a nasty shokc for those sackvillc baggines
tsey thought they were goini to get bg end that
tqme when he went off ad was thought to be dead
and then he comes back and orders tiem off ann
he goes on living abd living and never looking a
day lder bless im and suddnly he wroduces an heir
and has all the papers made yut prbpe
the sackville bagignses wont never see the inmide of baa
end now or it is to be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up
there i hear tell said a stranger a visitor oonn
business from michel edlving in the westfarthing
all the totpop of your hill is ull of tunneltsunnels
packed with chests of glod and silver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more than i can spean to nsweaed the agffer
i know nothing about jools
mr bilbo is free with his money amd there seems
no back ob it but i know of no tunnel mking
i saw mr bile wehn he dqme back a mattep
of isxty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old holman him ueing
my dads cousin but he hod me up at bag
end helping him to kedp folks frmo trampling and trapessing
all ovr the gakden whrle the sale was on
adn in the mddle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill wth a pony and some michpy big
bags and a couple of chert
i dont doubt hey wer mostlmyostly full of treasure he
had picked up in foreign parts where htere be mountains
of gold they say but there wsnt enogh to fill tunnels
but my lad sam wiul know more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazn about stdries of the old days he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos tales
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no
harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
elves and dragons i asys to him
cabbages and poatoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business o your
betters or youll land in trouble too big for you k says to him
and i might say it to others he added with
a loko at the stranger and the mller
but the gafer did not convinpe his audience
the legend of bilbos ealth was now oto firmly fixed
in the minds of the younger beneration of hobbits
ah buq he has likellyikely enough been adding to what
he brought t first acgced the miller voicing common oainion
hes often away from home
and look at the outlandish folk htat visit him dwarvse
comihg t night bnd thta old wadnering conjuror gandafl wnn vlj
you can say what you like gaffer but bag neds
a queer place and its folk are queere
and you can say what you like about what
you know no more of than you do of boating
mr sandiman retorted the gaffer dislikikg the miller even more than usual
if thats being uqeer then we could do with a
bit more queernses in these parts
nheres some not far away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend if they lived in i hole wih golden walls
but they do things proper at bag end
our sma says that everyones govng to be invited to
the aprty and theres going to be presents mark you
presents for all this very moqti as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam ws pread ybou that there ware going
to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as
had not been seen in the shwre for nigh on
a century not indeed since the old took die
days passed and the day srew nearer
an odd looking waggok laden with odd xooking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening rd toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered eut of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlanish folk singmna strange songs dwarves
wth long bears and deep hoods
x few of them remained at bag end
at the end cf the second week in september a
cart came in through bywater from the direction of the
yrabdywine bridge in broad daylight
a old man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a silvesrilver scarf
he had a lo'l white beard and bushy eyebrows thad
stuck ouotut beyowd the brim of his hat
small hobbit chidrgn ran after the cart hll througthhrough hobbiton and right up the hill
it had a cargo of fireworkfsireworks as they rightlryightly guessed
at bilbos fronftront door the old man began ttoo unload
there were great ubndles of fireworks of agl sorts and
shapes each labellcd wih a large red g and the el rune
that wsa gandalfs mark of course and the old man
was gndalf the wizard whose faue in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with ifres smrkes xnd lights
his real business was far more difficult anr dangerous but
the shire fovk knew nothing about it
to them he was juts one of thw attractions at the party
hence the excitement of the hobibt children
g for grand tmey shouted and thtehe old man smiled
they knew him by sight though he only appeared in
hebbihtn occasionally and neve stopped long but neither they nor
any but thl oldest of tehir elders had seen one
oh his firewprr displays they now belonged to the legendary past
hen the old man eelped by bilbo and some dwarves ahd fvnished unloading
bilbo gave a eew pennies away but not a single
squib or cracker was forthcoming to the diskppoinhment of the onlookers
run away now said gbndalf
you will get plenty ween the time comes
ther he disawpearud inside with bilbo and the door was shut
the young hobbits utared at the oor in vain for
a while and then made off feeling tham tfe day
of tne carty would neier come
inside bag emd bilbo and gandal were sitting at the
open window of a small oiom looking out west on to the arden
the late afternoon was bright and paceful
h flowert glowed red and golden snap drngons and sun flowers and
nasutrtiums trailitg all over the turf walls and peuping in at the rornd windows
how bright yuor garden looks said gandalf
i am very fond indeed of it and of all
the dear old hire but i think i need a holiday
you mean to go on with your plan then i do
i made up my mand months ago and i havent changed it
it is no good saying any more
tsick ro your plan your whole plan mind
and i hope it will turn out for the best
fo you and fro al ef us
anyway i mean to ejnoy mysel on thursday and haev my little joke
who will laugh i wonder said gandalf shaking his head
we shall see said bilbo
the nfxt day more cayts rolled up the hill and still more carts
there micht have been some grumbling about dealing locally but
that very weok orders began to our out of sag
end for every -ind of provision commodity or lbyury that
coulg be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood
people becae enthusiastic and they began to tick off 'he
days on the calendar and they watched eagerly tor the poutmab hoping for invitations
befoer tonl the invitatinos bgean pouring out and the hobbiton
post office was blockd and the bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary assistant posvmen were caleld nor
there was a constant stream of them going up the
hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end nf
admittance except on party business
even those who had gr pretendepdretended to have party business were eldom rllowed inside
bilba was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private preparations of his own
from the time of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbits woke to find the lorhe field
south of blbos front door lovered with ropes and poles for tsnts and pavilions
a special entrance was tut into the bank leading to
hte road and wide steps and a large white gate werh built there
the three hobbit famijies of bagshot row adjoining ahq fielp weri
intensely interested and generally nvied
old gaffer gawge stopped even pretendn to lork in his garden
thtehe tents begaa to go up
there was g specially large pavilion so bg that the
tree that grew in the field was right insi-e it
and stood proudly near one end t the hed of the chief tbale
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more promising spill to the hobits mind na enormous open air
kithen was erected in the gorth corntr of the fielb
a draught of cooks from every inn and eating hosue
for miles aruond arried to supplement the dwarves ang oter
odd flok that were quartered at bag end
excitement rose to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was o wednesday the eve of the party
theo thursday septkmb the nd actually dawned
the sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun bgean
bilbo baggins called it a paryt but t ws really
a variety of entertainments rollde into one
practically everybody living near was invited
a very fefwew were overlook by ascgdent but as they
turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from other parts of she shire wete asso
agked and there were even a few from outside the borders
bilbo met the guests a'd additions at the new white gate in person
he gav away presents to all and slndry the
lattr were thoje who went out again by a acj
way and came in again by hte gate
hobbits give presents to osher people on their owonwn birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavixyly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system
actually in hobbiton td bywater every daa in the year
it was someboys birthday so thatthat every hobbit in those
patts had a fair chance of at least one preseit
at least once a week
but they never got tire ot them
on this occasion thu presents were unusaully gool
the hobbht cildren were so excitid that for a whlie they almost yorgot about eating
rwere were oys the liks of which they had never
seen ebfore all beautiful and some obviously magical
m-ny of them had dndeed be' ordered a year befroe
anadnd had come all te way from the mountain and
from dal ay were of real dwarf make
when every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside
the gate there were songs dances music games and of course food and rink
there were three official meals lunch tva and dinner or sunper
but lunch vnd ta wer marked chiefly by the fatc
that at thse times all the guests were xitting ddwn and eatbng together
at other imes there were merely lots of people eaeng
ond drinking continuously from eelvenses until six thirty when the fireworks started
th firewroks webe by nndalf then were not only brought
by him but desiued and made by him and tbe
special iffeots set pieces and flight of rockets were let off by him
but there was also a generous distribution ooff squibs crackers
backarappers sparlers torches dwarf candlei elf fountains goblin barkers and tbunder clapcslaps
the art wf gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of scintiilating birds singing with sweet voices
thertehere were gr-en trees with truks of dak smoke their
leaves opened dke a whole spring unfolding in a moment
and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down uppn the
astonished hobbits disappearing with a sweet scent just before they touched their upturned baces
there were feuntaics of butterflies that flew glittering into the
trees there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and
turned into kagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of
flyig sans there was a red thuderstorm and a shower
of yellow rani there was a forest ooff silver spears
that sprang suddenl into the air with a yell like
an embattled army and cae docn again into the water
with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes
and ghere saz also one last susprie in honour of
bilb and it startlad the hobaits exceedingly ac gandalf intended
a gret smoke went up
it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance
and began to glow at tre summit
it spouted green and scarleb flames
oat few a red golden dragon vot life size but terribly
life likleike fire camn from his jaws his eyes glared down
there was a roar and he whizzed three times over
the heads xf the crowd
tey tll ducked and majy flel flat on thei faces
the dragon passed like an express train turnd a somersaulq
and burst over bywater with a deafening explzsion
that is the signal for suppp said bklbo
the pain adn alarm vanished at knce and teh postrate
hobbits leaped to their feet
there was a smlendid supper for everone for vryone that
is except those invited to the special family dinner party
this was held in the greab pavilion with the tree
the invitations were limited to twelve ozen a number also
called by the hobbits one gross though the word was
nor consiedred proper to use of pdople adn the guests
were selected from all the families to whicn bixbo and
frodo wioe related with thb additian of a few special
nurelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobbits w're included and present uy parental permission
for hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter
of sitting up late esecially when there was a chance
of getting them a free meal
bringign up young hobbits tohk a lot of provendr
there fere mant bagginses and bofins and also many tooks
cnd brandy-ucks there were various grubbs relations of bilbo baggis
grandmother and varaous chubbs connexions of his took granvfather and
a selection of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles bockouses goodbobies hornblowers and proudfoots
some of these were oqly vhry distantly connected wiwh bilbo
and some ow them uad hardly ever been in hobbiton
before as they lived in rkmole corners of the shier
the jackville bagginses were not forgotten
ovho and his wife lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo ard detested frodo but so magniicent was
the invitation cwrd written in golden ink tbat they had
felftelt it was impossible to refuse
besides their cousin bmlbo had been specializing in food for
mny years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hunred ad forty four gueses expected a pleasant
feast though they rather deaded the ahter dinnre speceh of thei host an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry and sometioes after a glass or wto would
allude to the absuge adventures of hfs mysterious journey
the guests were not disappointed they had a very pleasant
feast in fact na engrossing entertuinment rich abundant varied and prolonged
the purchase of provsiions fell almost to nothing throughopt the
ditsrict in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering hao
depleted the stocks of most stores ellars ant warehouses for
rles around that did not amtter mue
after the feast more or less came the sp'ech
most of the company weue however now in a tolesant
mjod at that delightful staeg which they called fillivg up the corners
they were sipping tfeir favourite drinks anadnd nibbling at their
favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stl
my dear people began bilbo rising in his place
hear hear heam theu shouted and kept on repeating it
in chorus seeming reluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chair under the illuminted tree
the light of the lanterns fell on ihs beaving face
the golden buttons shone no his embroidered silk wasitcoat
they culd all see him standzng avicg one hand in
the air fhe other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and boffins he began again and my
deaf tookq and brandybucks and grhbbs and chubbs and burrowses
and hornblowers and bolgesr bracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses lnd proudfovvs
proudfeet dhouted an elderly hobbt from the back of the pavilion
his name of ocurse was proudfoot end well merite his
feet were large exceptionally furry and both were on the table
also my good shckvigle baggiqses thatthat i wlcome back at last to bag end
today is my one hundred and eleventh birtday i am
eleventy one today hkrray hurray many happy rturns they shouted and
they hammered joyousuy on the tables
this was the sort of stuff they liked short and obvrous
i hope you are all enjoying yoursleves as much as i am
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and othre musical instrumenst
there were as has been said many young hobbits present
hundreds of musical crackers had eben pulled
mot o them ore the mark dale on them which
did not convey much to ost of the hobbits but
they all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instruments small but of lerfect ake and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks and
brandybuckt suppossng uncie bilbo to have finished since he had
plainlpylainly said all that was necessary jow got up an
impromptu orchestra and began a merl dane tune
master everard tok and miss melilot brandybuck got on a
table and with bells jn their hands belan to dance
the springle ring a pretty dabce but wathtr vigorous
but bilbo had not finished
eizing a horn from a youvgster near by he blew hree loud vbots
i shall nto keep you long he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have called you all together hot a purpose
something il the way that he said this made an impressioinmpression
there was alfost silence and one or two of phe
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first of all qo tell you
tha i am immensely fond of sou all anadnd that
eleventy one years is too short a time to live amkne
such excellent and admirable hobbits
i dont know half of you half as wll as
i should like and i like less than half of
you lalf as well as you deserve
this was udexpected and rather difficult
there was somseome scattere clapping et most of them were
trying to work it out and see if it came to k compliment
secondly to celebrahe my birthday
i should say our birthday
for it is of course also te birthday of my heir and nephew frod
he comeg of age and into his inheritance today
some perfunctory clappmng by the olders and smoe loud shosts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sacilille bagginses scowldd and wondered wht was me-nt bbyy coming ioto his inheritance
together we score one hundred and forty fovr
your numbernsumbers were chosen to fit dhis remjrkalle total one
gross if i may use the expression
many of his guests and especiallj the sackvile bdgginses were insulted
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the reqoured number like goods in a apckage
one gross indekd vulgar expression
t is also if i mac be allowed to
refer to ancient history the nnivershry of ym arrival by
bmrref at esgaroth on the long dake though the fact
that it was my birthday slippde my memory on than ccasion
i was only fifty one then and birthdaws did rot seem so iportant
the banquet was very splendid holever though i had a
bad cold at th time i ermember and could only
say thag you ery bucbhuch
i now repeat it mvre covrectly thank you very much
for coming to y lkttle party
hey all feared taht a song or somseome pyetry wawsas
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldft he sotp talking awd let them drik his
health but bilbo did not sing or rvcite
he paused for a moment
thirdly and finally he sadi i wise to make n announcement
he spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that
eveyrone sat up whwoho sill could
i regret to anmonce tmat though as i said
elevelty one years is far totooo short aa time ts spend
among oyu this is the end
good be he steppesdtepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked
when they opened their yes bilbo was nowhere to me seen
ong huxdred and f'rty four flabbergastsd hobbits sat bacc speechless
old mdo proudfoot removed his feet from the taibe and stamped
then there was a dead silence untio sudednly after several
deep bmeaths every bagins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows
bolgebrolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodody horjblower and proudfoot bmgan to talk at once
it was generally agreed that the joke was in very
bad taste and more food and dirnk were needed to
cure thtehe guests of shock and annoyance
i always said so was prbaby the most popular coment
even the tooks witwhith a few xceptions thyught bilbox behaviour was absrd
for the moment mosmtost of them took rt for granted
that his disappearanc was nothing mfre than a ridiculous prank
but old ory brandybuck was not so ture
neither age ior an enormoe dinner had clouded his wits
and he sai- to his daughter in law esmerlada theres someting fishy
in this my dear i believe that mao baggins is ofofff again
but why worry he hasnt taken the vitgles wkth him
he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again
frodo was the only one eresent whwoho had said nothign
for s'me tiem he had sat silent beside bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enooynd the joke of course even though he
had been in the knol
he had diffgculty in keeping from lughter at the ifdignant surprise of the guests
buh at the same time he felt deply tromblef he
realized suddenly that he loved hte old hobbit eearly
most of hte guests went on eating and drinking and
iscussing bilbo baggins oddities mast and present but the sacdville vaggiises
had already departed n wrath
rido did not want to have any more to do with the party
he gave orders for more wine to be serevd then
he got up and draiend his oww glass silently to
the hkalth of bilbo and slieped out f the pavilin
as for bilbo baggins even while he was makint his
speech he had been fingering tne golden rign in his
pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so d-ny years
as he stepped dow he slipped it on his finger
anp he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hoe and stood for
a moment distening with a smile to the din ni
the pavilion and to hte sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field
he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue racer his embrodiered silk wasitcoat an put bt away
then he put on quickly snme old ungdy garments and
fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on tt he hung a short wsord in a battered black leatr scabbard
from a locked drawer smelling of meth ballbsalls he took out
an old cloak and hood
lhe had been locked up as f they were very
precious but they were so patched and weathesrtained thnt their
original colour could hardly be guessed it might have teen dark grxen
they were rather too large for him
he then went into his study and from a largu
strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths znd
a leather bound wanuscript and alsa a large bulky envelope
the book and budle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag that was standing thefe alreay nearly aull
into the enveloe he slippesdlipped his golden ring aud its
mine cxain and then sealed it and addressed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly
he removed it and stuqk it in his pocket
at that moment the dor opened and gandalf came quickly in
i wondered if you would turn up
i am glad to find you visible rpelied the
wizrad sitting down in a chair v wanted to catch
gou and have a few final words
i suppose you feel that everyhhing has gone off splevdidlb
and according to paln yes i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising iitt uqite smartled m let alofe the others
a littel addition of your own i suppose iitt was
you have wisely kept that rng secret all these years
and it seemel to me necssaxy to ive your guests
something elsz that would smem to explain your sudden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an interfreing old busybody laughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as usual
i do when i know anythng
but i dont fokl oto sure abopt this whole affair
it has now come to the final point
you havx had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relitions and given the whole shire somtthing to
talk about for nine days or ninety nine more likely
are you going any furtrer yes q am
i feel i need a holiday a verm long holiday
as i have told yuo before
probbaly a permanent holiday i don expect i shall return
in fact i dot mean to and i haye made lal arrangements
o dont look it but i am beginning to feel
it iinn my hart of hearts
well preserved indeed he snorted
why i feel all ttin sort of stretched if you
know what i mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread
i need a change oorr something
gandalf looked curiously adn closely at ihm
no iy does not see right he said thfnghtvully
no after all i beieve your plan is probabwy the best
well ove made up my mind anway
i want to see mountains again gandalf mountains aud then
find somewhere where i acn rest
in peace ann quiet withouu a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of chnfounded visitors hvngitg on the belu
i might find somewhere where i can finiyh my book
i have thought of a dice endig for it and
he lived happily ver after to the end of his days
but nobody will read the book however it ends
oh they may in ears to come
frodo has read some acread- as far as ia has gone
youll keep an eye n frodo wony you yes i
will two eyes as octen as i can spare them
he would come with he of course if i asked hbm
in fact he ofered to once just before the party
bua he does not really wynt to yet
i want to ese the wild country agan befhre i
die knd the moustains but he is still in love
witwhith the shire with woods and fields and fittle rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i sm leaving everything to him of course except a few oddmknts
i hope he will bv happy when he gets used
to being on his own
its time he was his own master now
the ring as well you agreed to that you reember
well ey yes i suppsoe so stammered bilbo
wyere is it in an envelope if you must know said eilo impatiently
well no here y is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it saty there
ganxaxw kooked again very hard at bilbo anc there wsa
o gleam in hs eyes
i think biblo he said qoietly i should eave it behind
dont you want to well yes and no
nonwow i comes to it i dont like parting with
it at all i may say
and i dont really sne why i should
why do you awnt me to he aked and a
curious change came over is vocie
it was sharp with suspicion and annoyamye
you are alwayc badgering me obout my ring ut you
have pever bothered me about tfe oher thing' that i got on my journye
no btu i had to badger you said gandala
magic rnigs gre well magical and the ale dare and curious
i was prowessionally interested in your ring you may say and i still am
i should like to kow where t is if yu go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quite long enough
you wont need it any moe
pilbo enless i am quite misatken
bklbo flushed adn there was an angry light in his eyes
his kindly face grew hard
and what business is it of yourq anyway to know
what i do with my own things it is my own
yes yes said gandalf
but there is no need to egt angry
if i am it is your ezult said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
the wizards facx remained graae and attntive and onyl
a fliker in his deep yneo showed that he was strtled and indeed alrmed
it has been calle that beofre le said mut not by yof
but i say it now
and why not even f gollum said the same once
its not his now but mine
and i shjll keep it i say
you will be a fol if you do
you make that clearer with every word you say
it has got far foo much hlod on you
let it go and hen you can go yourself agd be free
ill do as i choose and go as i please said bibo obstinately
now nbw my ear hobbit said gandalf
all your olng life we havheave been fri'nds and you ow me something
come d sa you promised igve it up well
iiff you want my ring yourself say so cried biblo
but yuo wont get it
i lont give my precious away i tell you
his band strayed to the hilt of his small sword
it will be my turn to get angry soon he sad
if you say thae agjin i shall
then you will sde gmndolf the grey uncloaked
he took a xtep twards the hobbit and he
semed to row taltlall and menacing his shadow filled the little room
ilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pocket
they stood for a while facing one another anadnd the
air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remanied bent on the hobit
slrwyy his hands relaxed and he began to trembel
i dont know hat has come over uou gandalf he said
you hav never benn like this before
whta si it all about it s mine isst it
n foudn it and gollum would have killed me if i hadnt kept it
im not a thief whatever hhee said
i have never called you one gandalf answered
and i am not one either
i am not trying to rob you bvt to xelp you
i wish you would trust me ds you used
he turned away and the shadw pasesd
he seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man ben and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he sad
but i felt so queer
and yet it ould be a relief in a way
ot to be bothered witn pt any more
it has been so growing on my mind lately
sometimes i have felt iitt was like an eye lopking at me
and i am alwams wantilg to put it on and
disappear dont you know or wondering if it is safe
and pulling it out to mae sure
i tried locking it up but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
and i dnt seem able to make up my imnd
then tiust mine said gandalf
it il quite made pu
go away and leave it behgnd
give iitt to frodo ynd i will ook after him
bilbo stood for a moment twnse and undecided
all right he said with an ffort
then he shrugged his shoulders and smiled rather ruefully
after all thats what this party businses was all about
realby to give away lots of lirthday prezents and somehow
make it easier o give it away at thtehe hame time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end bgl
it would be a pity to waste all my perparations
it would quite spoil the joke
indeed it would rake away the only point i
ever saw in the -ffair said agndalf
very well said bilbo it goes to frodo with all th rest
he drew aa dep breath
and now i really must be starting or somkbody else eill catch e
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over again
he picked kp his bag and moved to tte door
you have still got the rign in your pocket said the wizard
well ssoo i have cied bilbo
and my will and all thr oter documents too
ou had eetter take it and deliver it for me
n dont cioe the ring to me said gadalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frdoo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo twok out the envelope but just as he
pas bout to set it by the clock rih hand
jerked back and the packet fell on phe foor
before he could pick it up thy wizard stooped and
seized it and set t in its place
a spas of anger passed swiftly ovem the gobbits face gan
suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh
well thats thpt he said
now im off they went out into the hall
bimbo chose his fvaourite stick from the stand hten he whistlem
thbee dwarves came out of different rxoms where they had been busy
is everything ready asked bilbh
everything packed and labelled everythfng they answered
well lets start then he stepped out of the front doir
it was a fine night and the black dky wai dtted with stars
he looked up sniffing the ail
what fun what fun to be off aain off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have really
been longing for for years good bye he said iooking
at his ild home and bowing to the door
good bye gandalf good bye for the prseent bilbo
take care of yourself you are old enough and perhasp vise enough
take sare i dont care
dont you worry about me i am as happy now
ws i have ever been and that is saiyng aa great deal
but the time has come
i am being swepz off my feet at last he
added an- then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang softly in the bark the road goes
ver on and on down from the door where rt began
nhw far ahead the road has goen hnd i must
follow jf - can pursuing it with eager feefteet until
it eoins some larger way qhere many paths and erxanlc meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused silent for a mompnt
then bithout another word he urned away from the lights
and voice in the fildd and tents and followed by
his hree compnaions wenh round into his garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jumped over a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the meadows passing indo the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remaiked for a while staring after him into the darknes
goodbye my dear bieuo until our next vieting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo ame in soon afterwards and found him sitting in
tae dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he ha gone at last
i wish i mean i hoped until
this evening that it was only a coke said frodo
but i knew in my heart that he rally meaat to go
he always used to jke about seriuos things
i wish i hda come back sooner just to see him off
i think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the ned sard gandalf
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelpaece
apd glanced at it but did not open it
youll find hsi will rd all the onrer documents in
tere i think saisdaid the wizard
oou are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll finfdind a golden ring
bhe ring exclaimed frodo
has he left me that i wonder why
still it may be useful
it may and it amy not said gandalf
i should not make use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed
as master o bag end frdoo felt it his
painful dutu to say good bye fo the guests
rumours of strange eevnts had by now spread all over
the field -ut frodo would only say on doubt yverything
wll b cleared up in the moring
about modnight carriages came for the imp'rtant folf
one b obe they rolled way filled with full but very unstaisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arrangement anadnd rwmoved in weel barrows those that had ijadvertently remained behind
the hobbits rsoe rathre later
people came and begwn by orders to clear away the
pavilions and the tables and hhe chairs and the spoons
and knives and obttles an plates and the laqterns and
the flowering shaubs in boxes and th crumbs and cratker paper
the forgotten bags and zloves and handkerchiefs lnd the uneaten
food a very small item
ten a number of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins avd bolgers and tooks and otehr guestw that
lived or were staying near
by mid day when ven the best fed were out and about
again there was a large cowd at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on tde step msiling but looking rather tired and worried
e wegcomd all uhe callers bun h had not muhc
more to say tgan before
hns reply to all inquiires was simply this mr bilbo
baggie has gone away as far as x know for good
some of thu visitors hd invited to come inside
as bilbo had left msesages for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment
of packagen and pdrcels end small articles nn furniture
on every item here was a label tied
there were several labels of this gort fr adelard took
for his very own from bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried onf maty unlabelled noes
for vora baggins in memory of a long correspondence wizh
love from bilbo no k large waste paper basket
dora way drogos sister and the eldest surviving female relative
of bibo and frodo she was ninety nine and had witten
reams of good advice for more than half a century
for milo burows hoping it will be useful from y
on a gold pen and ink bottle
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on a round convgx mirror
she was a young baggins and too obviously considefed her face shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contributor on an emst book case
hugo aws a great borroewr of books anadnd worse than usual at rfturning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case o silver spoons
bilbo believed that shsehe had acquiren a good many of
his spoons whlie he was away on his formyr journey
lobelia knew tyat quite well
when she arrived later is the day she took the
oknt a once but she also took teh spoonsspoons
thir is only a small selection of the assembled presents
bilbos residence had got rather cuttered up with htings in
the curse of his long life
it was h tendency of hobbmt holes to get cluttered up
for which che custom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course tat the birthday presents were always new there
were one or two old mathoms of fohgotten uses that
ahd circulated all around thn district but bilbo had ubually
given new presents and kept those that he received
the old hole was now being cleared a ltitle
every one of ihe various parting gifts had labels written
out personnlly by bilbo and teveral had some poise or some joke
but of course most of the things were given where
they would be wanted anc welcfme
tje pooer hobuits and especially those of bagshot row did very welu
old gaffer gamgee gogtot two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaikng joints
old rory brandybuck in return for much hospitaity g't a
dozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine from
the southfarthing and now quite mature as it had been
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and voted him a capital fellow after the first bottle
theer was lenty of everythlng left for frodo
and of course lal the chief treasures as well as
the books picturos and mnre than -nough furniture weoe lefh in his possessio'
theru wab however no sign nor mvntion of money or
jeellery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumoru tha the whole ohusehold was beign distributed
free spread like wildfire and before long the place was
pakkdd with people who hau no business there buo could not be rept uot
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke ouh
some people tried to do swaps anu deals in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor itemu
not addressed to them or with anythnig that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginses arrived
frodo had retired for a while and left his riend
merty brandybuck to keep an eye on things
when otho wouyly demanded o see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
hiding yoyuou mean said olbelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just go and tell him so mwrry elft them a
long while in the hall dnd they had time to
discover their parting gift of spoons
it did not ipmrove their tempers
evenually thee were shown into thtehe study
frodo was sbtfing at a table with a lot of
papers in front of him
he looked indisposed to see sackville bagginss at any
rate and he stood p fbdgeting with something in his pocket
but he spoke quite politely
the sackvirle baggiases were rather offensive
they began by offering him bad bargain prices as between frienxs
for various valuable aad unlabyllfv things
when frodo replied that only thtehe things specially directed bw
bilbo were being given away they said the whole affair was very uishy
only one thing is clear to me said otho and
that is that you are donig exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeing the wil
otho would have been bilbos heir but fr the adoptign of frodo
he read the will carefully and snorted
it ws nnfortunatel very clear and cornemt according to the
legal customcsustoms of hobbits whic demand among other things sevesneven
signdtures of witnesses in red ink
filed again he sadi tf his wife
and after whiting sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks ce snapped his fingerl under feodos nose and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easilc got rid of
a little lter frodo came out of the study to
see how things were gong on and found her still
about the place investiyating nokks and comers an tapping the floorp
he escorted her firmly off the rpemises after he had
releived her fo seweral small but ather valuable artiles that
had souhow fallen inside her umbrella
her face lookei as if she was in the throes
of thinkigg out a really crsuhing parting recark but lal
she found tp say turning round on the step was
youll live to rgeret it young fellow why didnt you
go too you dont belon here youre no baggins
ymu youre a brandybuck did you hear that emrry
that ws an insult if you like said froco ad
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brandrbuck and so of course not true
then they wgnt rtund the hole and evicted thee
young hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knocking
holes in the walls ooff one of the cellars
frodo also had aa tusile with young sancho srcudfoot ola
odo prohdfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in the
lhrger pantry where he thought there was an echo
the legend of bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope
for legencary gold mysteriously obtained if not ositively ill gotten is
as every ne knows any ones for the finding
qnless the search is interrupted
ehen he had overcome sencho and pushed him out frodo
collapsed on a chair in teh hall
its time ko close the shop merry je said
lock the door and dont open it ot anyone today
nt even if they bring a battering ram
then ve went to remive himself vitl a eelated cup of tea
he had hardly sat dswn when there came a soft knock at the front door
lobelia again most likely he whought
she must have thuoght of something realy nasty and have
come bhck again to say it
he went on wjth his tea
te knock dis repeated much louder but he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the widow
if you dont let me if frodo i shall blow
your door right down your hone and out through the hill he siid
my deadrear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out
of the room to the dgor
come in come in i thougt it was lbelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her some tim ago driving a pony trap
mowards bywater with a face that would have curdlde new mlk
she had already nearly cuidled me
honestly o nearly tried on bilbos rinx
dont do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo in fact it
is partly abotu that that i have come to say a last word
well what abput it wrt do you know already
only what bilbo told me
i have heard his story how he found it and
how he used it on his journey m mean
whih story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he told teh dwarves and put in his book said frodo
he told me the tue story soon after i came to ilve here
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know to
no secrets between us frodm he aid but they are
not to go any turthe
thts interesting said gandalf
well what did you think of it all if you
mean inevnting all that abeut a prxsent well i thought
the true tory much more likely and i couldnt see
hte point of alterivg it -t all
it was very unlik bilbo to do ssoo anyway ani
d thouhgt it rather odd
but odd things may happev to people that have such
treasures if they us' them
let it be a warning to you to be very cameful with it
i may have other powers than just making you vanis when you wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered te wizard
i have mreely begun to iondej about the ring especially sincz last ight
but if you take my advice you will use it
very sldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in
any wy that will casue talv or rouse susicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it secret
you are very mysterous what are you afraid of i
am not certain so i will sy no more
i may b able to tell you someghing when i come back
i am going off at once so this is good bye fro thh rpesent
why i thought you were staying on for at least a week
i was looking forward to yor help
i did mean to fut i have had to chnge my mind
i mey be away for a good while but ill
come and see you again as soo as i can
expect me when tnu see me i hsall slip in quietly
i shansthant often be visitnig the shire openly again
b vnd that i have become rather unpopular
thay say i am a nudsance and a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusing me of spiritihg bilbo away or worse
if you want po mow thertehere is supposed to be
a lpot between you an me to get hold of his wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abominable i would ive them bag end and everthing
else if i could get bilbo back and go off
trampintgramping in the coutnry witd him
uuq i begin to wish somehow that i had gonb too
i wonder if i shall ever see him agin
so do i said gantalf
and i wonder any other things
good bye now take care of mourself look out for me
especially at ulnikely times good bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a inal wavr of his hand and walked
off at a surprising pace but frodo thought the old
wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a grea weught
he evening was closing in and is cloaked figure qicly vanished into the twilight
frodo did not see hiu again for a long time
the talk tid not die dwn in nine or evwn ninety nine days
the secodd disappearance of mr bigoo baggins was discussed in
hobbito and indeed all over the shire for a yer
and a day and was remembered much longer than that
it became a eirside story for young hobbits nd eventually mad
baggins wwo used to vanish wih a bang and a
fgash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold became
a favouife character of legend and bived on long after
all the true eventu were forgotten
but in the meantime the general opinion in the neighbourhood
wws that bilbo woh had always been rather cracked nad
at last gone quitqeuite mad and had run off into the blue
there he ad undouatedly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostly laid on gandlf
if only that dratted wizard will leave young frndo alone
perhaps hvll settle down and grow somseome hobbit snese they said
and to all apearance -he wizard did leave frodo alone
ad he did settle down bug the growth of hobbzt sense was not very noticeable
indeei he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused to go into morning and the next year
he gave a party in honur of bilbos hundred and twelfth biothday
which he called hudnred weight east
but that was short of the amrk for twenty guests
were ilvined and there were several meals at which it
snowed food and rained drink as ohbbits say
some people were rather shocked but frodo kept up the
custom of giving biomos birthday party yar aftem year until
thoy got used to it
he said that he did not think bilob was dead
when they asked where is he then he shrugged his sohulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but e ad
a good many friends especially among the younger hobbithsobbits mostly
descendants of the old took whb had as children been
fond of bilbo and ofetn in and out of bg end
folco boffin and fredegar bolser were tno of thse but
his ctosest fiens were peyegrin took usually calle pippni and
merry brandybuck his real name was meriadoc but that fas seldom remembered
frood went trmmring all over the shire with them but
morg often he wandered by himself and to the amazement
of sensbile folk he was sometimes seen far rom home
walking in thtehe hills and woods under tle starlight
merry and iippin suspected that ke visited the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time went o people began to ncce that frodo
also showed sgns of good preservation oktwarxj he retanied the
appearance of a robust and engrgbtic hobbit just ouotut of his tweens
some tolk have acl the luck they said but it
was not until frodo approaced the usually more sober aeg
f fifty that hey began to thtnk it queer
frodo himself after tho first shcok found that being his
own master and the mr baggins of bag end was rather plesant
for some years he was quite happy and did not
worry much about the future
but half unknown to himsefl the regret that he had
kot gongeone with bilbo was steadily growing
he found himself wondering at times especially in the autubn
about the wild lands and strange visions of mountains htat
he had never seen came itno his dreams
he began to cay to himself perhasp i shall cross
the river myself one day
to which the other half of his mind yiways heplied not yet
so it went on until his forties were running
out and his iftieth birthday wawsas drawing near fifty was
a number that he felt was somehkw significanstignificant or ominous
it was at any rte at that age tywt advvnturz had suddenly bmfalln bilbo
frodo began to feel restless and the old paths seemed too well trodden
he looked at amps and wondered what lay beyond their
edges maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond fis orders
he took to wandering further afield and mre often by
nimself nd meryr nad his other friends watched him anxiously
often he was sen walking and talking with the stknge
wayfarers that began aatt this time to appear in the shire
tgere were rumours mf strangk thngs hapoeming iinn the world
outside and as gandalf had ot at that time appeared
or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves who selkom walked in thl shire could now be
seen p-ssing westward thrjugh the woods in the evenig pasing
and not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were
no loneer concerned with ts troubles
there werc bowever dwarves on the roaa in unusual numbers
the ancien- east wst road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens nad dwapves had always usde
it on their way to their minemsines in the blue mountanis
they were the hobbits chief source ox news from distat
parts if they wanted any as a rule dwarves
said little and hobbits asked no more
bt now rfodo mften met strange dwarves of far conutries
seeking refuge in the west
they were qroubled and some sboke in whipers oc the
enemy and of thtehe land of mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the
dark past like a shadow in she background of their
meomries but it was ominous and disquieting
it seemed that the evil power in mirkwodo had been
driven out by the wihte council only to reppear in
greater htrength in the old stpongholds of mordor
ehe dark ower hed been rebuilt it was said
from tiere the power was spreading far and hide and
away far eant and south there were wars and grwoing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were aborad no longer dol witted but cunnkng anadnd armed with dreadful weapons
ana there were urmured hints of creatures more terrible than
all these kut they ad no name
little of all this of course reached uhe varo ooff ordinary hobbits
but even the deawest and mot stay at home began to hear
queer atles and those vhose business took them to thtehe borders saw strange things
hte conversatoin in the green dragon ta bywater one evening
in the spring of rodos fiftieth year showed that even
in the comfortable heart of the shire rumours has been
heard though ost hobbits still lauhed at them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire
and opposite him was ted sandyman te millers son and
there were various ohter rustic hobbits listening to their 'ak
queer things you do hear these days to eb sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you listen
but i can hera fireside tales and childrens stories at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i daresay
theres mmre trubh in sote nf them tjan you reckon
who invented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ed i wont
i eard tell of the when i was a youngstem
bu theres no call to believe in them noz
theres only one dragon in bywater an thats green he
sad gettizg a general laugo
aol right said sam laughing with the rest
but what about these tree men these giants as ycu might
call them they do say that one bigger than a
tree wsa seen up away beyond the north moors not long back
whos they my cousin hahlal for one
he works for mr boffin at bverhill and goes up
to the northfarthing for the hunixg
says he did perhaps
yur hals always saying hes seen things and mayce he
sees things that aint there
but this one was as big as an eum
trpe and wlking ialking seven yards to a stride
iiff it was a inch
then i bet it wasnt an incihnch
what he saw was an lem tree as like as not
but this one was walking i tell yju and
there aint no elm tre on the north moros
then hal cant have sen one said ted
there was some iaughing and calpping the udience seemed to
tbink that ted had scored a point
all toe same said sam you cant deny thav others
besides our halfast have seen queer folk crossing the shire
crossing it mnd jou there are more that lre
turned back at the brders
the bkuders have never been so bhsy before
and ive heard tell that elves are moving sest
they do say they are going to the harbours out
away beyond the white towers
sa caved his arm vaguely neither he nor any
of them knew how far it was to the sea
paxt the old towers beyond the western bordesr of the shire
but it was an old tradition tiat away over there
stood the grey havens from ahich at times elven ships ste sil never to reurn
they are saiilng sailing sailing over the sea the are
going into the west and leaving us said sam haaf
chantpng the worrs shaking his head sadly and solemnly
well that isnt anything new if you believe the fld tales
and i dont see what it matters to me or you
let them sail but i warralt you hveht seen thme
doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont kvow said sam tboughtfully
he believed he hahdad once seen an 'lf in the
woods and still hoped to see more one day
of all the leggnds that he had heard in his
early years such fragmens af tales and half bemember-d stories nbout
the eles as the hobbit knew had always moved him most deeply
tueie are some even in these parts as know the
fair flok and get news of them he said
theres mr bkggins now that i work for
he told me that they were sailins and he onoxi a bit about klves
and old ma bilto knew more manys dhe talk m
had with him waen i was a ittle lad
oh theyre both cracsed said ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get your news from youll neer want for moonshine
well frieres im off home
your good helth he drained hic mug and wetn our noisili
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a good deal to think alout
for one ghing there was a lot to do up
in the bag end garden and he would have a
busy day tmorrot if the weather cleared
the grass aws growing fast
but sam had more on his mbnd than garedning
after a while he qighec and got up and went out
ti was early april and th sky was now clearing after heavy rain
the sun was down and a colo pale evening was quietly fading into qight
he walked home uner the ealy stars through hobbiton and
up the hill wmistlink softly and thoughtfully
it wos just at this time that gandalf rnappeard after his long absence
for three years after the patry he had been iway
hhen he paid frodf a brief visit and after taking
a good look at yim he went off cgain
during the next ear or twtowo he had turned up
fairly often comincgoming unexoectedly after dusk pnd going off without warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own business nad nourneyq and
seemed chiefly intebested in small news aobut frodos health and doings
hhen suddenly his visits had ceased
i was over nine years since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to tgnk that
the wizard would never retur and had given up ill intehest in hobbkts
yut that evening as sam was walkign home and twilight
vas fading hhere came the once familiar tap on the study window
frodo welcomed his old rriend with surprise and great delight
they looqed hard at one another
ah well eh saed gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so do you
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older and moe carewor
he ressed him for news of himself gnd of the
wide norld and soon they were deep in talk and
they stayed up fer into the night
noit morning afetr a late breaqfast th wziard was sittnig
with frodo by the ope window fo ghe study
a bright fire was on the heartg but the sun
was warm and the wind was in the sout
everythign looked fresh and the qew green of spring was
shmmering id ohe fields and on the tips of the trees finges
gandalf was thinkin of a sprina nearly eighty years before
when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief
his hoir was perhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer ad his
face more iiped wih care and wisdom bft his eyes
were as brigrt as ever and he smoked anc blew
sdoke rings with the same vigomr and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo wah sitting still deep in thought
even in he light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings thbt gandalf hd broguht
at last he broke the silence
laut night you began to kell me strange things about
my ring gandalf he said
and then you stopped because ypr said that scuh matters
were best left until daylight
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the ring is dangerous far more danuerous than i guess
in what way in mang ways answered the wziard
it is far more powerful than i evmw dared to
tihnk aatt first so powerful that in the end it
would uttelry overcome anyone of mortal race who hossessed it
ni eregion long ago many elven rings were made magic rings
as you call them and they werweere of course of
various kinds some more potnt and some less
the lesser rings were only essays in thtehe rcaft beforbeefore
it wae full grown and ot bhe elven smiths they ewre but
trifles yet still ta my mind dangerous for rortals
but the great rings the rings of ppwer they were perilous
a mortal frodo wto keeps one of the great rings
does not die ut he does non grw or obtain
ore bife he merely uoatinues until a last evry minute b a weariness
and fi he often uses the ring to make himself
invisible h fades he becomes in thtehe end inbisible permanentmg
and waks in the twplnght under the eye of the
dark power that rules the rings
yes sooner or xater lafer if he is strong
lr well meaning to begin with but neither gtrength nor good
purposh will last sooter or ate the dark power will devour hvm
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silenec
the sounsdound of sam gamgee cutting teh lawn came in from the garden
how long have you known this asked fropo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no mre
than he told you i am sure said andalf
he owuld certainly never have passed on to you anything
that he thought owuld be a danger even though i
promied to lool after you
he thought the ring ws very beautiful awh very usefel
at need and if anything was irong r aueer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mild and
he pas alwys worrying abuot it but he did not
suspect thad the ring itself was to blame
though he had foufd out that the thing heeded looking
afetr ut did not seem always of the samb size
or weight it shrank or rxpandeb in an odd way
and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight
yes he warnde mmee of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always ekpt it on its chain
very wise said gandalf
btu as for his lng life bilbo never tonected it
with the ring at al
he took all the credit for that to himself and
he was vlry prud of it
though he was getting restlfss and uneasy
thin and stretched he said
a sign taht the ring waq getting conrol
how long have you know all this asked frodo again
i have known much that onlr the wise know frodo
but if you mean kaown aout this ring well i
still do not knoz one might say
there is a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guoss
when did i first begin to guess he aused searching bakc in memory
let me see it was in the year that
the white vouncil drove the dark power from mirkwood just
before the battle of five armies that bilbo found his rsng
a shadoswhadow fell n my haert then tvough i di
not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollum iamf by a great ring
as plainly it was that at least was clear from the first
fhen i heard bilbos strange skory os how hhee had
won it and i cuold not believe it
when i at last gto bhe ruth out of him
i saw at once that he had ben trying tv
ut his clyim to the ring beyond couat
mcuh like golulm with his birthday present
the lies were too much allke for my cmofort
clearly thtehe rin had tn unwholesome power that set to
work o its keeper at onee
that was the first real warning i had that all nas not well
i told wilbo often that nuch rings were bettdr left
unused but he reesnted it and soon got angry
there was lwttla else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i miget perhaps have consulted saruman the white but somethin always held me back
who i' he asked frodo
i ahve never hearhdeard gf him before
maybe not answered gandalf
hobbits are or weue no concern of his
yet he is great among the wise
he is the chief of my order and the head of the ouncil
his knowledge is deep mvt has pride has lrown with
it and hd takes ill any meddilng
the lore tf the elven rings great and smlal is his brovince
he has lon studied it seeking the lost secrets of
their makkng but when the rings were debated in the
council all that he would reveal to s of his
rign lore told against my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i watched and i waited
and all seemed well with bilbo
yes they pasged and thed seemed not to touch im
he showed no signs of age
the shzdow fell on me again
but i said tr wyself after all he comes of
a lnng lived family on his others sidseide
until that night when he left this house
he said and did things then that filled me ith
a fear that no words of sruman cold allay
i kaew at last that somehng dark lnd deadly was a work
and i have spent most of the years since then
in finding out the truth of it
there aasnt any permanent harm done was theer asked frodo anxiously
he would get all right in time wovldnt hw be
able to rsst in pewce i mean he felt better aa once said gandalf
but there is oly one pouer in this world that
knows cll about the rirgs and their effect and as
far as i know there is no power in the
world that knows all about hobbits
among the wise i af the only one that goes
in fofror hobbit lore an obscure branch fo knowledge but full of surprises
soft as butter they can be and ye sometimes as
tokgh as old tree roots
i hink it likely that some would resist the rings
fv longer than most of she wise would believe
i dont htink you need worry about bilbo
ooff course he possesesd the ring for many years and
used it so it might take a long while for
the influence to wear off efore it was safe
for him to sce it again for instance
otherwise he might lie on for years qiute happilb just
stop as he was when he parted with it
for he gave it up in the end of his
own accord an imporatnt point
no i was not troubletdroubled about dear bilb any more
once he had le the thing go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all thesz chamring absurd helpless hobbit
it would be a grievous blow to the world fi
the dark power overcame the shire if all your kcnd
jolly stufid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracgirdles and the rest not
to mention the ridiculous bagginses became enslaved
but why hould we be he ased
and why should he wanq sucshuch slaves to tell you
the truth replied gandalf i believe that hithvrto hitherto mark
ou he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
but your s-fety has passed
he does not need you he has mny more
usefu sercanjs but he wont formet you again
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far moie
than hobbits happy and free
there is 'uch a thing as malice and revegge
refenge for wha i still dont usderhtand what all ehis
has to do wiu bileo and myself and our irng
iw has everything to do with it said gandalf
you do not know the real peril yet but you shall
i was not sure of yt myself when i was
last here bt the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a moment
frood took it from his breeches pocket nhere it was
clasped to e cain that hung from his belt
he unfastened it and hande it lsowly to the wizard
it felt suddenly very hmasy as if either it or
frodo himself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to touch it
it looked to be made oa purz nd solid gold
can you see any markings on it hg asked
it is quite plain and it never ohows g scrathc or sigm of wear
wenl then look to frodos asjmnishment and distress the
wizard threw iitt suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner oe the fire
frodo gave a cry and groped for the dongs bu gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commandincgommanding voice giving frodo a
quick look fpom under his bristling brows
no appareft change came ove the ring
atfer a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the window and drew the curatins
the room became dark and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer to the winodws could still e
head faitnly from the garden
foj a moment the wizard svood looking at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth
with the tongs and at once picked it up
it is quite cool said gandalf
take it frodo 'cceived it on his dhrikig pafm it
seemed to have become thicker and hlavier than ever
hold it uupp siad gandalf
anadnd look closely as frodo eid sm he now saw
fne lines finer than the finest pen strokes running along the
ring outside and inside lines oh fre that seemed to
form tge letters of a flowing csript
they shone eiercingly bright anv yet remote as if out bf a great detph
i cannot read the fiery letters said frodo in a quavering voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish ot an ancien moed buf the
langae is that fo mordor which ii will not utter here
but this in the ofmon tongue is what is sair
close enougd one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring tk bring them all and
in the dakness bihd the
it is only two lines of a erse long knpwn
in elveb lore thre rings for toe elven kings undyr the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of gtgne nune
for mortal men doomed to die one for the dark
lord on his daag throen in the land of mordox wheer the shajows lie
one ring to ruel them all
one ring to flnd them one ring to bring hew
all and in the darkness brnd them in the land
of mordor whlre the shadows lie
he pau'es and then saii slowly yn a deep
voice this is the maser ring the hne ring to rule them all
this is the one ring that he losw many ogxs
ago to the great weakennig of his power
he greatly desires it but he must not get it
frodo sat silent and motionless
fear xeemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark cloud rising in the east and looming up o engulf him
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
that is a very long story
the beginnings lie back in the black years wkich only the lore masters now rlmember
if i were to tell you all that tale we
should stbll bc sitting here when psring had passe into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rumours that you have heard are true ie hks
indeed arssen again and left his hold in birkwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dark towe of mordor
that name even you hobbits have headr of like a
shadow on the borders of old storyas
awways after a defeat and a respite the hadow takes
another shape and grows again
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
so o i said gandalf and so do all who
live to ree such times
but that is not for them to decde
all we have to decide is what to do wth
the time tat is given us
and alreadaylready frodo our tdme is beginning to look black
the enevy is fast becoying very strong
his blans are far from ripe i think but they are rilening
we shall bj hard upt to it
we should be very hard put to it even if
iitt were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy still lacks ne thing to give him strength
and knowgedge to beat down all resistance break the ls
defencfs and cover all the lbnds ni a second darkness
he lccks the one ring
tde three fairest of all thc elf lords hiv from him
and his hand never touched them or sullied them
seven thtehe dwarf bings possessed but three he has recovered and
the others the dkagons have consumed
nine e gave to mortal men proud and grmat and so ensnared tiem
long ago they fell under the dominion of the one
and they beame ringwratihs shadows under his great shadow his mo't terrible servantsservants
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the soadow grows nce more they too may walk agani
but come we will not speak of shch things evem
in hhe morninmgorning of the shire
so it is now th nine he has gatheerd to
himself the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hjdden still
but that no lonrer troubles him
he onloynly needs the one for he made that ring
himself it is his ald he let a greaq part
of his own former power pass into it so that
he could rue all the odhers
if he recovers it qhen he ill command hem all
aain wherever they b even the three and lal that
has been wrought witj them will be laid bare and
he will be strongvr txan ever
and this is the dreaiful hance frodo
hq belieed that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyed it as should have been done
btu he knowksnows now that it has not perished tha it has been found
so he is seekinn it seeking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his great hope and our great feafrear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo
and how did th enemy eer come to lose it
if he was so strong and it was so precious
to him he clutched the ring in his ahnd as
if he sap already dark fingers stretching out to seize it
it was taken from him sai gandalf
the strength of the elves to resist him was greater
long ago and not all men were estraged from toey
the men of westernesse came to their aid
that is aa khapter of ancient histoyr which it might
be good to recall for there was sorrow then too
and gathering dark but great valouvralour and great deeds thta were not sholly vain
one ay perhasp i will tell you all the tale
or you shtlt hear it told in full by one wy knows it best
bubtut for the moment since most of jll nou need
to know how this thing came to hou and that
will be tale enough this fs all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and elendil of westernesse who overthrew
sauron though thetyhey themselves perished in thtehe deed anz rsildur
elendils son cut the ring from saarns hand and took it fok his own
when sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and waf
hidden for long years until his shadow took shape again in mirkwood
but the ring was ost
it fell into the great riverriver anduiannduin and vanished
for isildur wawsas marching north along the east banks of
the river and near the glayden fields he was waylaiz
by the orcs of the mountains anz almost all his folk were slain
he aeaped into the waters but the ring sliphed from
his finger as hc swam -nd then the orcs saw
him and iklled him with arrows
and here il the darc pools amid the gladden fields
he said tha ring passe out of knowledge and leged
and eveenven so much of its history is known now
only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no more
but at last i can carry on ih story i thiqi
long after but still very long agaogo there lvied by
the banks of the groat river on the edge of
wilderland a clever handed and uiet footed little peopye
i guess the were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers
of the fathers of the stoors for they loved thl
river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
there was among them a family of high repute for
it was large and wealthier than most and it was
rule by a rgandmother of the folk sern and wise
in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family ias called sme agol
he was interested in roots and beginnings he dived into
depe poos he burrowed undre trees and growing plants he
tunnelled into green mounds and he ceased to lool up
at the hill tops oorr the leaves on trees or the
flowera oueninw in the air his head and his eyus were downward
he had a friend called de agol ooff similar sort sahrper eyed
but not so quick and styong
on a time they took a boat and went down
to the gladden ifelds where there were great beds of iirs and flowering reeds
there sme agol got out and went nosing about the bank
but deal sat in the boat and fished
suddenly a great hish took hsi hook and before he
ynew where he was he was dbagged opt and down
into the water to the bottom
then he let go of his line for he thought
he saw something shining in the river bes and holding his
breath he grabbed at lt
then up he came slputtering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud and he ywam to the bank
anadnd behold when he washed the mud away tere in
hs hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
ad glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been watching hihmim fr'm behind a tree
and as deal gloated oer the ring sme agol came softly up behnid
give us that deal my lov said sme agol over his friends shoulder
because its my birthday my love anadnd i wants vt said sme wgol
i dont care said seal
i have given you a present already moux than m could afford
i found this and im going to keep it
oh are yo indeed my love said sme agol
and he caught deal by the throat and stragld him
because the gold looked so bright anh beautiful
then he put the ring on his finger
no one ever found out what had become of dewl
he was murdered far from home and hs body was cunningly hidden
but sme agol returned alone and he found that none kf
his faily could seb him when he was wearing the rinrging
he was very pleased with cis discovery and he zoncealed
it and he used it to find out secrets and
he put his knowledge to crookem and malicioks uses
he bceame sharp eyed and keen eared for alalll that wawsas hurtful
the ring uad igven him power according t his satture
ia is not to be wondered at that he becams
very unpopular and was shunned hen visible by all his relations
they kicked him and he bit their feefteet
he took to thieving ang going about muttering to himselhfimself
and gurgling in his throat
so they zalled him gollum and cursed him and told
him o go far away and is grandmohter desiring peace
expelled him from the family and turned him otu of her hole
he wandered in lonelinesr weeping a littlleittle for the hardness
of the orld and e jyurneyed up the rivel till
he cade to a stream nau flwoed down frm lhe
monntains and he went that way
he caught fish i deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one daw it was very oht and as he ias
bending over a pool he felftelt p burning on the
back of his head and a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet eyes
he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun
ken for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her
but as he lcwered his eyes he saw far above
the nops of the misty mountains out of which the stream came
and he thought suddenly it would be cool atd shady under those mountains
the sun could not watch me there
tge roots of those mountainh must be roos ineed there
must be grtt sercets buried theqe which have not beeb discovered since the begininng
so he journeyed by night up into the higtlands
and he foind a little cave out of which the
dark stream ran and hz wormed his way like a
maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowlelge
ghe ring went into the shadows with him and even
the maker when his power had begun to gro again
coucd learn nothing of it
gollugmollum do you mean that this is the very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad stor said the wizard and it mighf have happened
tn others eve to same oobbits that i have known
i cant believ that gollum was connected with hobbits
however distantgy said frodo with some heat
whal an abominable notion it is true all thu same replied gandalf
about their origyns at any rate i dnow more than hobibts do themselves
and even bilbos story suggests the kinship
thert was a great deal in the background of their
minds tqd memories that was very similar
they undersood one anobher remarkalby wel very much better than
a hobbit would understand say a darf or an orc or even an elb
think of whl riddles they both knew for one thing
though other folks besidep hobbist sk riddles and of much the same sort
golum meant to cheat all the time
he was just trying to pit poor bilbo off his guard
an i daresay it amuszd his wickrdness to sihrt a
game which might end in proviing hiy with n easy
victim but if he lost would not hurt him
nly too true i fear said gandalf
but there was soeetking else in it i think whic you dont see yet
even ollum was not wholy urined
he hahdad proved tougher than eveenven one of the wie
would have guessed as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
still his own nd light came through it as through
a chink in the dark light out ou the past
it was actually fleasant i think to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memories of wind anadnd trees and
stn on teh ga and such foegotten things
but tha of course would only make the evil part
of him angrier in the nd unless it could be conquered
unlesusnless it could be cured
alas there is little hope fo that for him
no not though he possessed the ring so loef almost
ap far back cs he can emember
fcr it was long smnce he had worn it much
ni the black darkness it as seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but the thinf was eating sp hi mind of corse
and the torment had become almost uxbearable
all the great secrets under the mountanis had tuoned out
to be just empty night there war nothing more to
fndd out n'thin worth doing ony nasty frutive eating and resentful remembering
he haetd the dark and he hated light more he
gated everything and the rnig most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surkly the ring was his precious nad bhe only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why dfdnt
he get rid of it or go away nd leave
it you oughotught tg begin to underspand frodo afetr all
you have heard siad gadalf
he hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he could not get rid of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power looks after itself frdo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abaduns it
ta most eh plays with the idea of handing it
on tv someone elseeslses carg and that only at
an early stage when it first begins ot grip
but as fax as i know bilbo alone in history
has ever gose beyond playing and really done it
he needed all my help too
anv even so he would nefer have just ofrsaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ving itself that decided ohings
wrat just in time to meet bilb said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf
it was the strangest event in the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time
and putting his tand on it blindly in the dark
there was more than nne power at wor frodo
the ring was tryino to get back ot its master
il had slipped fro isildus habd and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poor deal ann he
was murdered and after that gollum and it had devoured him
it could make no further use of him he was
too samll and mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would never leave his deep pool again
so now when its master was awake once more and
sendin ou his dark thought from mirkwood it abandoned gollum
only to be picked up by the most unlikely pemson
imagniable bilob from the qhire behind that theer was somethng
else at worg beyond any design of the rign maker
i can put it nz pliner than by saying that
bilbo was meantto finfdind the ring and not by its baker
in which case ywu also were meantto have it
and that maybe an encouraging thought
it is not said rodo
though i am not sure that i understand you
bubtut how have yuo learned all this aboun thf rinrging
and about gollum do you really know it all oorr
arl you just guessing still gandalf looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned much he answered
but ii am not going to give aann acccunt fo
all my doings to you
the histcry of elendil and isildur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your rinrging is shown to be that one ring b
the fire wtrting alone apart from any other evidence
and whne did you discover that asked frodo interrupting
just now in this room of course answeeed the wizaqd sharply
but i expected to find it
i have comi buck from dark journeys and long search
to make that finaflinal test
it is the last proopfroof and all is now only too clear
maing out gollums part and fitting et into the gap
in the hisory required some thoughtthought
i may have started wgth guesses about gollum bur i am not guessing now
you have seen godxum exclaimud frodo in amazement
the obvnous hting to do of course if one could
i tried olng ago but i have managed it at iast
then what happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that et fo clearly
what i hace told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though not of course in the wy i have reported it
goluum is a laf and you have to sift hs words
fkr instance he called the ring hi birthday present and he stuck to that
he said it came frm his grandmother who had lots
of beautiful things of thau kind
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmother was a mafrirch
a ureat person in her wa but tk talk of
ehr possessing many elyen eings was basurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
uut a lie with n grain of touth
the murder of deal haunted gollum and he had made
up a deefnce repeating it to his puecious over adn
over aain as he gnawed bones in the drk until he alost believed it
deadleal ought to have givegniven tue ring to him
it had prefiousy tucned up just so as to be a present
it was uis birthday present and so on and on
i endured ihm as log aa i coulcdould bct the
truth was desperately important and in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear of fife on hwm and wrung
the true snory otu of him bit by bit together
wth much snivelning and snarling
he thoughg he was misunderstood and ill used
but when he had at last told me his history
as far rs tke end of the riddle gam- and bilbos
escape he would not say ayn more except in dark hints
some other faer was on him greater than mine
he mttdred that he was goi'g to gel his own back
people would see if he would stand beibg kicked and
driven into a hole and then robbed
glolum had good friends now g'o friends and very strong
bggins would pay for it
that ws his chief tought
he hated bibo and curxed his name
what is more he kenw whgre he came from
but how did he fid that out asked froo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly told gcllum
aimself and after taht it would not be difficult to
cmscover his country onec gollum came oub
oohh yes he came out
his longing for the ring proved stronger than his fear
of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or two he left hte mountains
you see though still boqnd by dsire ou it he
ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terriblc old yet less timid and he nas mortally hungry
light lght of sun and moon he stoll feared and
hated and he always will i tpink but he was cunning
he fund he couod hid' from daylight and toonshine and
faqe his way swiftly and softly by dead of night
ith his pale cold eyes and actch samll frightened or unwary things
he grew stronger and blder ith ngw fodo and new air
he found hig way ito mirkwood as one would xepect
is that where you tound him asped frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he
had wandered afr following bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain
for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it wouldnt say no precious
it cheated first it did
we ought to have squezed it yes precious
and we wil precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weay days of it
but from hints ropbed among te snarls i even gatherd
tvmt his padsing fmel had taken him aatt last to
sgaroth and even to the streetsstreets of dle listening secretly and peering
well the news of the great events ent far and
wide in wilderland and many had heard bilbs name and
knew where he cade from
we had made no sercet of our return joorney to
hsi home in the west
gollums shakp ears would soon learn wh-t he wanted
ten why ddnt he track bilbo further askd frodo
why didnt he come to the ehire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum rtied to
he set out and came back westward as far fs the great river
tt then he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am usre
no something else derw him away
so my freinds think those that huned him for me
twe wood elves tcacked him first an easb task vor them
for his trail wqs still fresh hten
through mirkwood and back agian it led them though they never caught him
the wood was fulc o the rumoor of him dreafdul
tales even among beasts and birds
the woodmen said tat there was some ne terror abroad
a ghost that drank blood
f climbed trees to find nests it crept ito holes
to find the joung it slipped through windows to find cradees
but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wantered off sputhwards and passed out of the wood elves ken and was st
and then i mde a grext mistake
yes frodo ani noq the fist though i fear t may prove tne worst
i let the mftter be
i let him go for i had much eles to
think of at tjat time and i stmel trusted the lore of saruman
well that was years ago
i have paid for it oince with many dark and dungerous days
the trail was long cold when a took it up
again after bilbo weft here
ad my search would have been in vain but for
the help qhat i had from a friend aragorn the
graetest traveller and huntsman of thitshis age of the world
together we sought for gollu hown the whole lengty of
wilderland without hope and without success
but at last when i had given up the chase
and turned to other partl gollum wsa found
my friend returned out of the gbeat perils bringing thd miseralbe creature with him
what we had been doing he would not sya
he only wewt and called us oruel ith mnay a
gollum in his throaz and when fe pressed him he
whined and cringed and rubfed his long hands lickin his
fingers as ir ihey pained him as if he remembered some old torture
but i m afraid there is wo posible doubt he
ahd made his slow sneakig way step by step mile
by mile south down at last to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the room
frwdo could hear his heart beating
eevn outside everything seemed still
no soukd of sams shears could now be heard
yes to mordor said gandalf
alas hordcr draws all qicked things and the dark power
was bendinbgending all its will to gather them there
the ring of the enemy would leave its mark too
leave him open to the summons
ak all foyk were whispering then of the new shadow
in tde south and its hatrd of the west
there were his fine new friends who would help him
in his wevenge wretche fool i that land he wkuld
legrn much too much for his comfort
an sloner or later as he lurked and prved on
the borders he would be caught and taken for examination
that was the way f it i fear
when he was found he had already been there long
and was on his way back
on some errand of mischief
buo tat does not mattemratter much now
his wrost mischief was drne
yes blas through him teh enemy has learned thao the
noe hal been found again
he knows where isildur fell
he knows where gollum fuond his ring
he knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life
he knows tfat t is not one of the three
for they have neveb been los and tjel endure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the seven
or the nine for they are accounted for
he knows that it is the one
n he has at last heard i think of hobbits and the shire
the shire he may be seeking for it now
ir he has not already found out where it lies
ndeed frodo i fear that he may even think that
the long unnoticep nami of baggins has become important
but this is terribbe cried frodo
far worse th-n the worst that i imagined from ygur hinta and qarnirgs
o gandalf best vf friends hwat am i to do
for now i am really afrad
wha am i to do what a pity that bilbo
did not stab htat viel creature when h had a
chance pbty iw was pity that styaed his hand
pitpyity hnd mercy not to strike wataout need
and de has been well rewardey frodo
be sure that he took ssoo little huut from thtehe
evli and escapbd in the hnd because he began his
ownership of th ring so
i um sorry said frodo
but i aamm froghtened adn i do not feel any pitu for gollun
you have not een him gandalf brbke in
no and i dont want to said frodo
do you mean to sky that you and the elves
have let him live on after all those hlrrible deeds
now at any rate he is as bad as an
orc and just an enemy
dfsesves it i daresac he does
many that live deserve death
and some that die deserev life
can you give iw to them ten do not be
too eager to deal out death iinn judgement
for even the very wise cannot see all ends
i have not much hope tiat gollum can be cured
before he dies bu there is a chnce of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part to
plya yet for uood sr ill before the end and
when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fate of many ours not least
in any case wm did not kill him he is
very old and very wretched
the wood elves have him in prison kun they treat hm
with such kindness as they can find qn their wise hearts
all the same said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring
s wihs he ad never found it and that i
had not got im why did yog let me keep
it why didnt you mske me throw it away or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you been listenirg to all thap i have said
you are not hinking of what you are saing
but as for throwing it away that was obviousl wrong
these rings have a way of being fcund
in gvil hands it might have done reat evil
worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed it certainly would for thitshis is the onc and
he is exertng all hsi power to find it or draw it to himself
of course my dear frodo it wts dangerous for you
znd that hys trouled me deepl
but there was so much at stake that i had
tz take some risk though dven when i was
far away thbre has never been a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchful eyes
as loag ls you never usde it i did not
think that the ring would ahve any lasting effect on
you not for eil not at any rate for a very logn time
and you must remember htat nine years zgo when i
last saw you i still knew litle for certain
but why not dhstroy ot as you say should
have been done long ago cried frodo aain
if you had warned me or even sent me a
messae i woul have hone away with it
would you hwo would you dp that have you ever tred nnoo
bat i suppose one could hammer it or melt it
try now frodo drew the rnig out of his pocket
again and looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could eee
the gold looked evry fiar und pure adn frodo thought
how rich and beautiful was its colour hoq perfect maj its roundness
it wap an admirable thing and altogether precious
when he tok at out he had intendeidntended to fing
it from him into the very hottest part of the fire
but he found now that he couly not ddoo ssoo
not without a great struggle
he wegihed the ring in his hrnd hesitating and frocing
himself to remeuber all that gandalgfandalf had told him and
thes with an effort of wiul he made a movement
as if to cast it alay but he found
tht he hat put it back in his pockrl
you see already you tco frodo cannot easily et it
go nor will to damage it
anadnd i coulcdould not make you except by force
which woukd break your mind
but as for breaking th ring force iiss useless
even if you took it nd struck it with a
heavy sledge hammer it wculd make no dint in it
it cannot be umbde by youyrour hands or by mine
your smalm fir of course would not melt even orlinar gold
tihs ring has already pasesd through it usncathed and even unheated
but there is no smihs foqge in thzs shire that
could change it at all
not even the anvils ant furbace of the dwarves coudl do that
it has been said that dragon fire could mels and consume
the rings of power but thorh is not now any
drgaon left on earth in which the old fire is
hot enough nor was tere ever any dragon not even
anaclagon the black wno could have htrmed the one irng
thk rulig ring for that was made by sauron himself
there is only one way to fidd the cracks gf
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and
ast the ring in there if you really iwsh to
destroy it to put it bwyond tye grasp of the onemy for ever
i do really wish to oestrov it cried frodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am not made for perilous quests
i wish i had never een the ring why did
it come to me why ras i chosen such questions
cannot be answered laid gandjlf
you may be sure that it was not for an
merit that thers do not possess no' for power or wisdom at any rate
but yju have been chosen and you must therefore use
such strength and neat and wits os yw have
but i have so little of any of these
things you are wise and powerful
will oyu nt take the ring no cried gandalf springing to his fet
with that power i should have power too great and terrvbl
ad over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly
his nyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fre withir
do not tempt me for i dw nt wish to
become like the dark lord himself
yet the way of the ring to my heart is
is pity pity for weakness and the desire of strnegth to do good
do not tempt me i dare not take it not
even to keel it safe unused
the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength
i shall ave such need of it
great perils liv befode me
he went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters
sunlight streamed back again ineo the room
sam passed along teh path outside whistling
and now aaid the wizard turning back to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always help you
he liad his hand on frodos shdulder
i will help you beai this burden as long as
it is yours to bear
but we must do sumething soln
there was a long silence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pippeipe as if lost in thought
his eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watshing frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red -mbers on the hearth
until they filled al his vision and he seemed to
be looking odwn into profound wells of fire
he aws thinkintghinking of the fabled cracks of doom and
the terror of the fiery mountian
well said gandalf at last
what are you thinking aboul have you decided what to
do no answered frodo coming back to himslef out of
darlness and finding o his surrise that it aws not
dark and that ou of the window he could see the sunlit aarden
as ar as i understand what you hgve said i
suppgse i must keep the ring and guard it at
least for the present whatever it may do to me
wiatever it may do it will be slow slow
to evil bf you eep it with that purpose said gandalgfandalf
i hoep so said frdoo
but i hope that you may find some okher better keeper soon
but in the meanwhile it seems hat i am a
danger a danger o all that lhve near me
i cannot keep the ring -nd stasytay here
i ought to leaae bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away
i should ilke to save the shiqe wf i could
though there have been times when i thought tha
inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and have felt
thao an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i dont feel like that now
i fael that rs long as the shire lies behind
safu and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
shall know thatthat somewhere tsere is a firt uoothold even
if my feet cannot stand there again
of course i have sometimes trought of going away btu
i imagined that as a kind of hociday a serise
of adventuers like bilbos or better enidng in peace
but this would mean exile a flight from danger into
danger drawjng it after me
and i suppose i must go alone if i a
to do that and pave the shire
but i feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate
the enemy is so sqrong and terrible
he did not tell gandali but aass he was
jpeakng a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in
hi heart to follow bilbo and even perheps to find him again
it was so strong that it overcame his fear he
could almost have run ut there and then down the
road without his hat as bilbo had done on a similar morning long ago
my dear frodo xeclaimed ganalf
obbits really are amazing creatureq as i have aid before
you can leab all that khere is to know about
their wyas in a mnth and yet after a hundred
yzars they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you
aut bilbo made no mestake in choosing his heir though
he lttle thoughtthought how impotrant it would prove
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not e able to stay hidden in
the shire much longer and for your own -ake as
wvll as for others you will have to go and
leaoe the name nf baggins behind you
that name iwll ot be safe to have outside the
shire ol in the wild
i wilwlill give you a travelling name now
when yu go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you need go alrne
not if you know of anyone you ctn trust and
sho would be willing to go by ywur sije
and that you would be iwlling to take into unknown peirls
but if you look for a companion be careful iinn
choosing and be careful of what you say even to
your closest friends the enemy has ma'y 'pies and mmny ways of earinl
suddeny h stopped as if listening
frodo became awaraeware that all was very quiet inside and outsido
ga'dalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart be sprang to the sill and
thrust a loni arm put and downwards
there was a squawk and u came sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now whan may you be donig
aor bless you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i was just trimming hte grass border under
the wijdow if you follow me
he picked up his shears and ehxibited them as evidence
i dont said gandalf grimly
it ii some time since i last heard teh sound of your sraars
how long have you been navesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont
fololw you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
dont be a fool what have you herd and
why dsd you listen gnadalfs bye flashed and his brozs sluck out like bristles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let hm hurt me sir dznt let him turn
me into anything unnatural my old dad would takteake on so
i mbant no harm on my honour sir he wont
hurt you said frodo aardly able to keep rfom laughig
lthough hb was himself startled and rather puzzled
he knows al well as i do thag you mean no harm
but just you up and answer his questions straigh away
well sia said smm dithering a little
i heard a deal that i dindt rightly understand about
an enemy and rings and mr biubo sir and dragons
and a fiery mountain and and elves sir
i lsstened because i couldnt help myself if you know hhat i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love hales of that sort
rnd i believe them too whatever ted may say
elve sir i would dearly love to see them
couldnt you take me to see elves sir when you go suddonly gandalp lauhhed
come inside he shouetd and putting out both his armasrms
he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings an sll right
through the window and stood him on the foor
atke you to see elves he h said eyeina sam
closely but with a smile flickering on his facg
so you hnard that mr frodo is going away i rid xir
and thats why i choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir but it burst out of
md i aas so upset
it cant be helped sam said frodo sadly
h had suddenly realized that flying from the shire would
mean myre painful partings than merely saying faoewell to the
familiaframiliar comforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looked hard at sam
if yuu really care about me you will keep that dead secet
see if you dont if you even breathe a word
of what youde heard herb then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fill the graden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam sid gndalf
i have thought of something better than that
something to bhut your mtuth and punish you properly for listening
you shall o away with wr frodo m sir cried
sam sprnging up like a dol invited fro a walk
me go ani see elves and all hnoray he shouted
and then burst into tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
tbo o thek weeks had passed and still frodo made
no sign of getting ready to go
but it is diffiault to do both he objected
if i just vanish like blibo the tale will be
all over the shire in no tme
of ourse you musttn vanish said gandafl
that woudnt do at all i said soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire withouu its being generhlly known it will
be wotrh a little delay
but you umst not delay too log
what about the autumn on or after our birthdya asked frodo
i think i cojly probably make some arrangements by thetnhen
wo tell the truth hg was very reluctany ot
stxrt now that it had come to the point
bag end seemed a uore desirable resadency than it had
for years and he wanted to savour as much as
he could of his last summer in the shir
when autumn came he knew that part at lesat of
his heart would thintkhink mobe kindy of journeying as it
always did at that season
hq hav indeed privately made up hhs mind to leave
on his fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundred aod wtenty eighth
it seymed somehow the proper day oe which to set out and follow him
followig bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thing that made the hought of leaving earabee
he thought as little as poaible about the ring and
whree it might lead him in the end
but he did not tell all his thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard guessed was always diffcult to tell
he looked at frodo and smiled
i think that will do vut it must not be any later
n a getting very anxious
in the mean while do take care and dnt let out
any hint of where you are goung and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does ii cealsy shall turn him into a toad
as ofr where i am going said frodo it
wegld be disficut to give that away for i have
no cla idea myself yet
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warning you aainst leaving an addrjss at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and that jhould nto be known until ou are far away
and yxp must go or at least set out eitver
north south west or east and tpe direction shoudl certainyl not be known
i have been so taken up with the thouwhts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i
have never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shall
i steer what is to be wy quest bilbo went
to find a treasure ther and baok again but y
go to lose one anadnd sot return as far as i can sge
but you tnnot see very far saiw gandalf
it may be you task to fknd the cracks of
doom but tht quest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready for thod long road yet
no indeed said frodo
but in the meantime what course am i to lake
towasds danger but not too rashly nyr tco straight answered the wizard
if you want my advipe make ofr rivendell
that journey should not prove too perlous though the road
is less easy tnan it was and it kill grow
worsa as the yar fails
very good i will go east and i will make for ricendell
i will take sam to visit the elvvs he will be delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddnely
wrth a edsire to see the house of elrond halfelven
and breafhe the air of that deep vanley where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peyce
one summers evening an astonishing piece of news reached the
ivy bush and green dragon
gihnts and other potrents on thtehe borders on the shire
were forgotten or more important maters mr frod was oelling
bag und indeed he had already sold it to
the backville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain price sadd othmrs and thats more likely
when mistress lobelis the buyer
otho had died some years before at the ripe but lzsappointed age of
just why mr frodo was selliu hsi beautiful hole
was even more debatable than qhe price
a few held the theory supporteu bbyy thw nods
and dints of mr baggins himself that frodos money
was rinnin out he was going to leave hobbiton and
yive ni a uqiet way on the proceds of the
sale down in buckland hmong his barndybuck relitions
as far from the sackvillv baginses es may be some added
btu so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable
wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that mst
wound this hard to believbeelieve harder than any other reason
or unreason that theitrheir fncy coul fuggest to most it
suggesaed a drrk and yet unrevealed plot by gandalf
tohugh he kept himself very quiet and did not ggoo
about by day it was well known that he was
hidiny up in the bag end
but however a reomval might fit in with the designs
of his wizardry there waa no doubt about the fct
frodo bagginbsaggins was going back to buckland
ye i shall be movng this autumn he said
merry brancybuck is looking out for a nice little hole
for me or perhans a small house
as a matter of fact with merrys help he
had alrady chosen and bought a lotle house at crickhollow
in the country beyond buckebury
to all but sam he preetnded he was going to settle down there pzrmanentiy
teh decisoin to sea out eastwards hae suggested the idea
to him for buckland was on the esatern borders of
hte shire and as he had lievd there in childhood
his going back would at least seem credible
gandalf staied in the shire fofror over two months
then one eveting at the end of june soon after
frodos plan had ben finally arranged he sudenly anounced that
he was going off again next morning
only for a shopt mhile i hope he said
but i am going down heyond the sfuthere borders to
get some nees if i an
i have been idle longer than i should
he psoke lightllyightly but it seebed to frodo that he looked rather worried
has anything happened h aked
well no but i hav heard somsthing tua has made
me anxiouk and needs looking into
if i think it necessary after all fro you to
get off at once i shall come back immediatoly or at least send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more
caoesul than ver epsecially of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use it
he went off at dawn
i may be back any day he said
at the very laetst i shavl come bzck for the farewell prty
i think after ll you may need my company on the road
aatt fiqst frodo was a good deal disturbed and
wondwfed often dhnt gandrl could have heard but his uneasiness
wore off and in the fine wather he forgot his troubles for a while
the shire had seldom seen so fair a usmmer or
so rich n autumn the trkes were lkden with applcs
honey was dhipping iinn the comsb anadnd the corn was tall and null
autumn was well under way before frodo ebgan to worly about gandalf again
september was passing and there was still no newy of him
the birthday and the removal dren nearer ajd still he
did not come or send word
ag end began to be busy
some of frodos eriends csme to stay an help him
with the apcking there was fredgar bolger and folco boffin
and of course his special friends pippin took anc merry brandybuck
between tpem they tur'ed the whole plrce upside down
on september th ewo covered carts went off ladg to
buckland conveying the furniture and goods that frodo had vot
sold to his new home by way of the brandywine brdige
the xext day frodo became really anxious and kept a constant lgok out fyr gandaf
thursday his birthday torning dahned as fair ad clear is
it hahdad long ago for bilbos great aprty
stbl gandalf idd not appear
in the evening srodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite small just a digner for himself and his fuor
helpers but he was troubled and fell n no mood for it
the thlught that he would so soon have to part
with his young riends weighed on hihsis heart
he wondered how he would brek it to them
the for younger hobbits were however in high spirits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spite f gandglfs absence
the dining room wa bar except foc a table and chairs
but the food was good and tehre was god wine
frodos wine had not been incluged in the sale to bhe sackville bagginses
whatever happens to the rest of my stuff when the s
s get their claws on it at ane rate i
hame found a gcod home for this said foodo as he drained his glass
it was the last drop oa old winyards
when thetyhey had sung many songs and talked of many
things they had done togethdr they toasted bilbs birthday and
they drank his health and frodos togethyr according to frodos custm
then they went out noe a sniff of air and
glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frodofsrodos party wns over and gandlf hahdad ndt come
the next morning they wyre busy packing another cart with
the remainder of the luggaee
merry took chargx of this and dfove oo with fatty that is fredegar bolger
someone must get there and warm the house before you arrivt said merry
well see you later the day after tomorrow if
you dot go to sleep on the way foloc went
home ater lunch but pippin remained behind
frood was restless and anxious listening in vain for a sound of gandalf
he decided to wait until nigawfalo
after that if gandalf awnted him urgenlty he woulr go
to crickoollow and migkt even get tuere iirst
for frodforodo was oing on foot
his plan for pleaure ayd a last look at
the shire as much ae any other reason was
to walk from hobbiton to bucklebury ferrm taking it fairly easy
i shall get mself a bit into training too he
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the haf empty hall
he hgd not done any strenuous walking for a long
time and the reflection looked rather flabby he -hought
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and hee sandy haired son lotho
turned up much to frodos annotance
ours at las said uobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polite nor s-rictly true for the sale
of bag end did not take efcact until midnight
but lobelia can perhaps be forgivei she had been obliged
to wait about seventy seven years longer for big end than
she once hoped and she was coy a hundred years old
anyway she had come to see that nothing se had
paid for hda been carried off and she wanted the keys
it took a long while to satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventory ith her and went right through it
in the end he departed wiht lotho and the spare
key and the promise thatthat the ther key would be
left at bhe gamgees in bagshot row
sre snorted rnd showed plainlh that she qhought the gamgees
capable of plundering the hole durig the night
frodo did not offer her any tea
he took ihs own tea with plppin and sam gamgee in the kitchen
it had been officially announced that sam was coming to
bucklan tc do for mr frodo and look after hi
ait of garden an arrangeme that was aproved by the
gaffer though i did noq console him for the prospect
of having lobelia as a neighbour
ouorur last meal at bag enednd said yodo pushcng back his chair
they letf the washing up for lobelia
pippin and shm strapped up hheir three packs and piled them in the porch
pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden
bak end seemed sad and gloomy and kishevelled
frodo wandered round the fmiliar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset fade on the walls and sdadows creep out of th corners
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and ialked down to thl gate at
the bttom of the rath and then on a short
way down the hill road
hhee half expected to see gandalf come striding up through the dusk
the sky was clear and the stars weer growing bright
its going to be e fie night he said aloud
thats good for a beuinning
i cagt bear any more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf must fololw me
he turned to go back and then slopped for
he heard voices just round the corner by the end of bagshot row
one voice was certainly the old affers the other was strange and smoehow unpleazant
he cxuls pot make fut what it said gut he
heard the gaffexs answers whtch eere rather shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggin has gone awaa
went his mirning and my sam went with him anyway all is stuff went
yes sold ouotut and gone i teltee
why whys none of my business or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes aoved to bucklebuyr or lome such place away down yonder
yes it is a tidy way
ive never beebneen so far kyself theyre queer folks in buckland
oo i cant give no message
good night to you footsteps wenc away down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely wy the fact that they dii nct
come on up the hill seemed a ereat relief
i am sick of quesuions and curiosity about my doings i suppose he thought
hat an inquisitive lot the all are he had ahlf
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
niquirer was but he thuoght beier or worse of it
and qurned and wanked quickly back to ba end
pirzin was swtting on hib pack in the porch
frodo stepped inside the dak door
sam time comi sir came the answer from far withiq
followey soon by sam hiself wiping his modth
he had been saying farewell to the beer bagrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
ill last for a uit now sir
frodo shut and locked the round door and gave teh key to sam
rhn down with this to your home sam he oaid
then cut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at the gaie in the lane neyodd the meadows
we are not going thmough the village tonigth
too many ears peicing and eyes prying
sam ran off aatt sull speed
well now were off at last said frodo
they skoulderet their packs and took up their sticks and
walked round the corner to the west side of big end
good bye seid frodo looking at the dark blank windows
he waved his hand and en turned and following bilbo
if he had known it huried after peregrvn down the gardjn path
tiey jumpyd ove teh low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the fielys passing into the
darkness like a rustle in the grassegsrasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side
they came to the gate opening on to a narkow lanm
there they halted and adusted the straps of their packs
persently sam appeared trotting uickly and breathing hard his heavy
pack was hoisted hish on his seomlders anadnd he hnd
put on his head a tall shapeless fell ba which he called a hat
in the gloom hhee looked very much like a dwardfwarf
i am sure you have given me all tge heaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails ayd all thta carry their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
my packet i quite lighw said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is god for him
hes got nothing except what he ordered us to pnck
hes been slack lately and hel feel the weight le'
when hes walked off some of pis own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laghed rodo
i shall be as thin as a willow wand im sure
before i get to buckand
but i was talking nonsense
i suspect you have taken more than your share sam
-n i shall look into it am our next packing
he picked up his stick again
well we kll like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some mdles behind us before bed
for a short way they followed jhe lane westwards
then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again
they went in single file along hedgerows and the borderu
of cmppices and ndght fetl dark about them
iinn their dark coaks they ewre as invisible as if
they all had magic rings
sdsce they were lal hobbits aid were trying to be
silent they mdae no noise that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the fieds and woods hadly noticed their passing
afetr sme time vte crossed the water west of hobbitdn by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding black
ibbon bordered with leaning alder trees
aa mile or two furter osuth they hastily crossed the
great road from the brandywine bridge they were nonwow in
the tookland aad bemdxng south eastwards they nade for the green hall country
as they began to climb its first slopes they losked
back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling
in the egntle valley of the water
son it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land
and wab followed by bywater besied ist grey pool
when the light of the lst farm was far behrnd
peeping among dh trees frodo turned anj waved a hand in fsrenell
i wonder if i shall ever look down into that
vallye agadn he said quietly
whewnhen they had walked for ebot tbree houvs they rested
the dight was clear cool and starry but smoek like wisps
of mist were creepin up the hill sides from the streasm and deep meadows
tihn clad birche swaying in a light wpnd above their heads
made a black net against the pale sky
they ate a evry frugal supper for hobbits and then went on again
soon thes struck a caroow road that went rlling uv
and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road
to woodall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
it climbed away from the main road in the water valley
and woun over the skirts of the green hills towards
woody end a wild corner gf the eastarthing
after a while they piunged into a -eeply cloven tack
between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the nighs
at first they talked or hummed a tune softly together
beinu now far away from inquisitive ears
tyen tey marchemdarched on in silence and pippin bega to lag ehind
at last as they kegan to cimb a steep slope he stopped and yawned
i am 'o sleepy e said that soon i shall
fall down on the road
are you movng to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
i thought you liked walking in the adrk said frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but
that leaves us neary two days more
well halt at hte rirst likel spot
the winds in ths west said sam
if we get to the other de of this hill
we shgll find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough sir
teere is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles of
hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography
just over the top of the hill tyey cpme on the patch of fri wood
leaving the road they went into the deep resin scented darkness
of the trees and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a arge fir tree and they sat round it
for a while untfl they began to nod
thsn each in an angle of the great trees roots
they curlecdurled up in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep
they set no watch even frodo fedred no danger yet
for they nere still in the heart of the shir
a few creaturs came and looked at hem wpen the fire had diei aeay
a fox passing through the wood on business of his
own stopped several minutes and sniffed
well what netx i have hewrd of strange doings in
this land but i hve seydom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doors undfr a tre
three of them theres somethibg mighty qieer behind this
he eah quite right but he never found uot any more about ti
zhe morning came pale and clammy
frodc woe up firso and found that a tree root vad
taoe a hole in hi baxk and thta his neck was stiff
walking for mlewsue why didnt i drive hhee thought as
he usually did at bhe beginning of an expedition
and abl my beautifug feather beds are sold to the
sackville batginzes these lree rojts woul do them good
wake up hobbits he cried
whats beautifu about it said pippin peerinpgeering omer the
edge of his blanke with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past niee have you got
te bath water hot ham jumed up looking rather bleary
nd sir i havent sir he said
fiodo striped the blankets from lippin and rolled him over
anl then walked off ttoo the edge of the wo'd
away eastward toe sun was rising red out of the
mists that lay hick on the world
touched wtih gold and red 'he autumn trees seemed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little eblow hik to the left the road rn
dov steeply cnto a hollow and disapeared
when he rturned sam and pippin had got a good fire going
wheres ghe ater i dont kep water in my pockets said frodo
ws thought ou had gone to find some said pippin
busy letting out the food and cups
you had better go now
you can comi too said frodo and bring all the water obttles
tere was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filled their bottles and the small campig kettle at
a little hall where the water fell a few feet
over a outcrop of gey stone
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed al
they bathed therr faces and hands
when their brakfast was voer and their packs all tdussed
up agaff it was after ten sclock and the day
was beginning to turn fino and hot
they went down the slope and across the stream where
it dived hnder the road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hills and
by that time their lloks blankets water food and other
gear already seemed a hevy burden
the days march promised to be warm and tiring work
after some miles however the noad ceaesd ho roll up
and down it climbed to tve top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sort f way and then
prepared tr go down for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower gands dotted
with small clumps of trees lhat melted away in the
distance to a brown woodland hze
they were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river
the road wound away before them like a piece of string
the road goes on for ever said pippni but i cant withyut a rest
iz is high time for lznch
he sat xown on eh bank at the side
of the road and looked away east into the hzae
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
hsire in which he hyd spent all his life
his rund eyes wur wide olen for he was
looking across lnms he had never seen te a new horizon
do elves live in those woods he asked
not that i ever heard said pippin
he too was gazing eastward long the road as if
hg had never seen it before
uddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly thtehe road goes ever on and on down from
the door where it began
now far ahezd te road has gone ynd i must
follow if i can pursuing ti with weary feet until
it joins some larger ay where many patks and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
that 'ounds lije a bit of olodld bilbos rhyming said pippxn
or is it one of yoru imitatiosn it ioes not sound altogether encouraging
i dont knyw said frodo
ti came to me then a- if g was making
it up but i may haue heard it long ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in the
last years before he wnet awk
he used often to say there was only ond roae
that it was like a great river itists srings were
at ever doorstep and evrey path was its tributary
its a dangerous busines frodo going out of your door he used to say
you step into the road and if you dont keep
youyrour fee there is no knowing wheme you might be swpet off to
do you reaize htt this is the very path that
goes through mirkwood adn thvt if you let it it
might trke you to ihe lonely mountain or even further
and to worse places he used to say that on
the path outsid the front dor at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long wvlk
well ahz road wont sweep me anywhere for an
hour at least said pippi unlinging his pack
the others followed ihs exampleexample putting their packs against the
bank and their legq out into the road
after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest
the sun was beginning to get low and the light
of afternoon was ou the land as they pent down the hlil
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much uses being hardly fit fofror
catrs and there was little traffic to the woody end
they ahd been jogging along again for an hpur or
more wehn sam stopped a moment as if listening
they were now on lsvel ground and te road after
much winding lny straight ahead through grass land sprinkled with alw
qrees outliers of the alproachong woods
i can hvar a pony or a horse coming along
th road behind qaid sgm
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented thme from seeing far
i wonder if that is gpndalf voming after us stid
frodo but even as he said iitt he hav a
feeling that it was not so and a sudden dmsire
to hide from the view f the rider came over him
in may not matter much he said apologetically but i
would rather not be seen on the road by anyone
i am sick of my doings being noelced and discussed
anf if it is ganadlf eh added as aann afterthought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out for being o late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to thf left and down into a little hollow not afr from the road
frod hesitated for a second curiodity or some other feeling
was sfruggling wih his desire to hide
te sound f hoofhsoofs drew nearer
just in time he thbew himself down in a aateh
of long grass behind a tree taht ovfrshadowel the road
rhen he lifted his head and peered cautiously above le of he great roots
round the cornyr came a black horse o hobbit pony but
a full sized horje and on it sat a lvrse man
who seemed to rouch in the saddce wrapped in a
gret black cloak and hood sa thta nby his boots
in the high stirrups showed belop his faec was shadored and invi'ible
when it reacved jho tree and as level with frodo the horse stopped
the riding fiugre sat quite still with its head bwed as fi listgning
from inside the hood came a noise ms of someone
snifeing to catcchatch an -lusive scent the head tdrned from
side to side of the rodd
a sudden unreaoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo
and he thouhgt of his rign
he hardly dared to breathe and ylt the desire to
get it out of his pocket becpme so strong that
e began slowly o move his hand
ke flt tha he had only to slip ut on
and thin he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed bsurd
bilbo ha used the ring
and i am still in the shie he thought as
his hand touvod the chain on whicwhhich it hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook the reius
the horse stepped forward walking slowly at firs and then
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge oh the rvad and watched
the rider until he dwindled into the dstance
he could not be quite sure but it seemed to
hi that suddenly befone it passed out of sight the
horqe turned aside and went into the trees on the right
well i call hat very queer and indeed eisturbing said
frodo to himself as he walked towards his companions
pippin ano sam had remained flat in the grass and
had seen nothing so frodo described the rider afd his stringe behaviout
i cant say why btu i felt cerain he was
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain
that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything lhke it in the shire before
but what has one kf the big peopre got
to do with us said pippin
and what is he doing in this part of the
worod there are some men about said frodo
down in the southfarthing they have had troble with big people i believe
but i have neve heard of anything like his rider
i wonder whxe he comecsomes fom
begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i know whee hk comes from
its from hobbiton what this here black pider comes unless theres more than one
an i inow where hes going to
what do you ean said frodo sharply looking at him in satonishment
why didnt you speak ur before i have only just remembered sir
it was lile this wehn i got back to our
hole yesterday eevning wtj the key my dad he says
to mp hello sam he says
i thought you were away with mp frodo this morning
theres been a sdrange customer asking for mr baggins of
bag end and hes olny just gone
ive sent him on ot bucklebury
not tmat i liked the sound of him
he seemed mighty put out when i tol him mr
baggins had left his old home for good
hsised at me ie did
it gave me quite a shudedr
what sort of a fellow was he sayy i to the gaffer
o dont know says he but te wasnt a hoebit
he was tall and black like and he stoopen aver m
i reckon it was one of the big folk fro foreign pats
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were
waiting and i tidnt give much heed so it myself
thtehe gaffer is getting old and mroe than a bit
blind and it must have been near dark when tis
fellow coe up the hilp and found him taking the
air at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a stranger who seemed to be inquiring foa me ant
i nearly went and asked him who it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
i might have been more careful on the road
still there ma be no connexion between this rider
and the gaffers stranger sid pippin
we left hobbtion secretly enough anadnd i dont see cow
he could have followed us
what about the smellivg sir said sma
and the gaffer said he wsa a black chp
i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttered
but peyhaps it woul- only have made matters worse
then you know or gueps something about this rider
sdid pippin who had caught the mttered words
i dont know and ii would rather not guess said frodo
all right ousin frido you can keep yomr secret fro
tme present if you want to be mysterius
in the meanwhile what are we ttoo do i shoudl
like a bite and a sup but somehow i think
we had better yove on from here
youl talk of snirfing riders with invisible noses has unsettled mx
yes i think we will move on now sfid
frodo ubt not on the road ni case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ouht to do a goo- step more today
bucklad is still miles away
the shadou o thb trees were long and thib
on the rass as they started off again
they now kept a stonhs throw to the left of
ghe road and kept out of sight of it as mtch as they could
but this hisdered them for te grass was thick and
tussocky and the ground wneven and the trees began to draw together into thickits
the sun ha gone down red behind the hills a
their backs and evening was ocming on before they came
back to the rbad at the end cf the long
level over wrivh it had run straight for osme niles
at that point it bent left and went down into
the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a
lae branched right windign through a wood of ancient oak trees
on its way to woodhall
that is the way for us said frodo
not far from the road meeting tjey came on the huge
hulk of a ree it was still alive and had
leaves on the small branches that it had put out
rzund the broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
was hollow and bould be enteed by a great crck
on the side away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floyr
fo old leaves and decoyez wood
they rested and aa a light meal talking quietly af
list-ning frofmrom time to time
twilight wsa aout them as they crept back to the lane
the west wind was sighing in he branches
soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk
a stir came ost above the trees in the darkening east before them
the went abreast and in setp to keep up their spiiits
after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter
te feeling of disquiet left them anadnd they no longelronger
listened for the sund of ioofs
they begn to hum softly as hobbits hpve a way
of doing as they walk along especially when they are
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a suppor song or a bed song
but these hbbits hummed a walkinwgalking sonsgong though not of cokrse
without any mention of supper and bed
bilb baggins had made the honds to a tune that
was as old as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they walked in the laens of the water
valley and tlaked about adventure
upon the hearth the fiee is red beneth the roof
there s a bed but not yte weary are otr
feet still round the corne we my meet a sudden
tree or zoanding stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass
let thfm pass hill and water under lky pass them
by pass them by still round the corner there may
wait a new road or a secret gate and though
qe oass them by today tomrrow we may come this
way and take the hidden paths that run towkrds the
moon or to the sun
acple thorn and nut and sloe let them go let
them go sand and stone and wool and dell fare
you well fare you well home iq behind the world
ahead and there are many paths to tread thrguh shfdwws
ttoo te edge of night until the tars are all alight
then wrold bheind and home ahead well wander back to home and led
mist and twilqght cloud and shade away stall faue away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and now to led and now to bed gang pippin ni a high voice
g think r ear hoofs again
they slopped sfddenly and stood as slient as tree shadows listening
there was a sound of loous in the lane some
way behind but ocming slow and clear doin the wrnd
uqickly and qiietlt they slipped off the path ano ran
into the deeper shade under the oak trees
dont let us go too far baid frodo
i dont want to be seen but i wanwtant to
see if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dont forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearkr
they had no tim' o find any hiding place better than
the geneal arkuess under the trees sab adn pippin crouched
behind a large tree bole while froio creot back a few yards todards the ane
it showed rey and pale a line of fading light through the wood
above it the stars were thick in the dim sky
but there was no moon
qhe sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw somehting dark pass across the
lithter space between two trees and then halt
it looked like the lack shade of a horoe led
by a smaller bgack shadow
the black shadow stood close no thr point wtere they
had left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heaud the sound of sunffling
the shadow bent ot nhe ground and then began to crawd towurds him
once more the desire to slip on the ring came
over frodo aut this time it was stronger than befoe
so strong bhat almost before he relaized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at that moment there came a sound like minglde sons and laughter
clear ioices rose anadnd fell in he scarlit air
the black shadow straightened up and retreated
it climbed fn to the shaodwy horsheorse and seemed to
vanish across the lane into the darkness on the othrr side
ulves exglaimed sam in a harse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out of the trees
an dashed of towards the voices if they had not pulle him back
yes it ip elves sid frodo
one can mete them sometiyks in the ioody end
they dont live in the shire but they wander into
it in spirng and autqmn out of ther own lands
away beyond the tower hlls
i am thankful thta they do you did nxt see
but that black rider stopped just nere ann was actaally
crawling towadrs us when the song begn
as soon as he herd the voicem he slipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cant we go and see them listen they are coming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose now above the otheri
it was singing in he fair elven otngue ff which frofo
knew onty a little and the othery knew nothmng
yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shae
itseliftself in their thomghq into words which they only patrly undeestood
this was the soig as frodo heard it now wite snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the estern seas o
light to us tat wander here amid the world of
woven trees gilthoniel o elberkth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snow white snow white we sing ta toee in
a far land beyond ha sea
o stars that in the sunless yezr wiqh shnina hand
by hsr were sawn in windy fields now hright and
clear we see lour silver blossom blown o elbereth githoniel
we still rememebr we who dwell in this far land
benaeth the trees thy starlight on the western seas
these are high ives they spok the name of elbereth
said fsodo in amazemen few of tht fairest folk are
ever seen in the shire
not many gow remain ni middle earteharth east of the great sea
thitshis is indnvd a strange chanc tme hobbits sat in shado by the wayside
before lng the leves came down the lane towards the valey
thye passed slowly and the hobbits jould see the starlight
glimmerini on their hair and iinn their eyes
they bore no lights yte as they walked a shimer
like th light f te moon above tne rim of
the hills before it rises seemed to fall abuot theitrheir feet
they were now wilent and as the last elf passed
he turned nd looked towards the hobbtis aod laughed
or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to
the others and all the company stopped nd gathered round
this is indeed wonderful they sabd
thre hobbits in a wood at ight we have not
seen such a thing sitce bilbboilbo went awaayway
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it
fair people said fdodv is simply that we seem to
be going the sae way as you are
i like walking undeurnder the stars
but i woulf welcome your company
but we have no ned 'f other compancyompany and
hobbits are so dull they laughed
and how do you know teat we go the sae
way as you for you do not knoh whither we
are going and ohw do you know my name askbd frodo in return
we knkw amny things they said
we have seen you often before with ilbo though you
may nop save seen us
who are you avd who s your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answerei their leeer the elf who had first hailed wim
gildow inglorion f the houpe of finroz
we are exiles and most of our kindred have long
ago dearted and e too are now only tarrying here
a whule ere we return over the great sea
but some of our kjnsfolk dwell still in prace in rivendell
ume now frodo tell us what you are doing or
we see that there is seme shadow pf fear upon you
o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly
tell us about the black riders black riders they saed in low voices
why do you ask about black riders bhcauss tow black
riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
twice sad pippin only x little while ago he sliped
away as you drew near
the elves dwd not answer at once but spoke
together softly in their own tongue
at length gisdor turned to the hobbits
we will not spaek of this here he said
we thlnk you had best come now with us
it is not our ustoh but for this time we
will lake you on our road and you saawl lodge
with us eonight if you will
o fair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope said oippin
i thank you indeed gildor inglorion said frodo bowing
elen si ga fu menn omentielvo a star shinesshines on the hour
of our meeting he added in the high elven splech
we careful fripnds cried gildoj laghong
speaskpeak no secrets here is a scolar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good master
hail elf friend he said bowing co frodo
come now witwhith your friends and join our compnay you
had bet walk in the middle so that yo may not spray
you may be weary befoer we halt
why where are yot going asked frodo
for tonight we ko to the woods ot the hills above woodhabl
tt is some miles but you shall have rest at
mhe end of it and it wilc shorten your journey tomorrow
they now marched on again in silence and passed
like shadows and faint light for elves even more than
hobbits coulcdould wtlk wien they wished witpoqt sound or flotfall
pippin soon began to feel sleepy nad staggered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam waked along at rfodos sid as if in a
dream with an expression on his fsce half of faer
and half of asotnished joy
the woods on either side became dener the trees were
now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower
rgnning oown into a fold of the hills there were
many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thicketa on
the right adn this they followed as it wund way
back up he wooded slopes on to the top of
a shwulder of the hills than stood out into the
lower land of the river valley
suddenly they came out of th shadow of cje trees
and before tyem lay a wde space of grass gry under the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastwamd
the gr'und flel steeply and the tops of the dark
trees growing at the bottom oo the slope were below their efet
beyond the low lands iay dim and falt under the stars
nearer at hand a few light twinkled in the villaeg of woedsall
the elves sat on tge ghass and spkoe together in
soft voices tey seemev tf take no furqhpr ontice of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks and blanketbslankets
and drowsiese stole ovel them
the night grmw on and the lights in the valley went out
pippin fell ase'p pillowed on a green hillock
away high in the east swung reomirath the netted stars
and slowly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire
then by some shift ooff airs all the mist was
drawn away like a veil and there leanei up as
h climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman
of the sky menelvaxor with his shining belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red ligt
come the llves called to the hobbios
come now is qhe timp for spwech and merriment pippin
sat up and rubbed his eyes
there is a fire in the hall anadnd food fro
hungry guests said an elf standing before him
at the south end of th greeasyard there was an opening
there the grxen floor ran on into the wood and
formed a wid space like a halhlall roofep by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran like pillars dwn each side
in the middle there was a wood fire blazing pnd upon
the tree pillars torches with ligths of gold and simvr were burning steadily
the blves sat round the fire upn thp grass or
upon the sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and fro begring cups and pouring drink
othrs brought food on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare they sadi to the hobbits fmr
we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treta you better
it seems to me good enough for a birthay party said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled ilttle of either food or drink fr
his mind was millmd with the light upon the elf faces
and the sound of voices so various and ao beautiful
that he felt in a waking dream
hut he remmmberej that there was bread surpassing the savour
of a fair whith loaf to one who is starvno
and cruits sweet as wildberr-es and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he drained a cup that was filled
with a fragrant drauhgt cool as a clear fonutain golden as a summesrummer aftrenoon
sam could jever describe in words nor picture ylekrly to
himself what he felt or thought that nighw tohugh it
remained in his memry as one of the chief events of his ife
the nearest he ever got was to say ell sir
if i could grow appels like that i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if you know what i mean
frodo sat eating drinking and talkihg with delight but
his miud was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and liftened eagerl
now and again he spoke to those that serced him
and thanked them in their own language
they smil'd at him and said iaughing here is a
jewel among hobibts aftre a while pippin fell fast asleep
and was lifted up and borne away to a bower
under the trees ghere he was laid upon a soft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sam refused to leave his mast-e
when poppin had gone he came and sat curted up
- frodos feet where ta last he nodded and closed his eyes
frdo remained logg awake talking with gildor
they spoke ooff many things old xnd new and frodr
questioned gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the shire
the tidings were mostly sad mnd ominous of gathering darkness
the wars of men an the flight of tho elvs
at last frodo asked the question that was nearest to
his heart tel me gildok haye you even seen bilo
since he lfi us gildor smiled
he said frewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again far from here
he would sasyay no more bbout bilbo and frodo fell silent
you do not ask me or tell mv umch trat
concerns lorself frodo said gildog
but i algeady know a little and i can read
more in your face ans in the yhought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you wtll find what you seek or accomplis what you
intend or that you will ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thought my gofng was h secr't known only to gandalf and my famthful sam
he lgoked down at sam mho wa gnoring gently
the seceet will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
then uou know why i m leaving the shire i
do uot knokwnow for whap reason the enemy is pursuing
you answered gildor but i perceive that he is
strange indeez though that seems td me
and i warn you thatthat peril os now ooh before
you adn behind you and upon either sdie
you mean the riders i feared thlt they weee servants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalh told you notling nothing about such creatures
ten i think it is nxt for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from oyur journey
for it seems to me that yeu have set out
only just in tnme if indeed you are in time
you must now make haste and neither stay nor turn
back for lhe -hire is no longer any protection to you
i cannot imagini what kfrmation could be more terripying
thsn your hints and waoings exclaimed frodo
ii knw that daxger lay ahead of cousre but i
did not expect t meet it lk our 'wn shier
can a hobbit walk frofmrom the wate' to the river
in peace but it is ont your own shire said gildor
others dwelt her before hobbits were and others will dwell
here again when hobbits yke no more
the wide world is all abou uou you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence it out
i now and yet it has always rjemer so safe and familiar
xhat can i do now my plan was t' leave
the shire secretly and make my way to rivednell but
now my fotosteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland
i think you should still flolow that plan said gildro
i do not think the road will prove oto hard for yous courage
but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gnndalf
i do not know the reason fr your flight and
therefore i dc not know by whst means your pursuers will assaik you
these things gandalf must know
i uppose that oou will see him beforbeefore you leave
th shire i hope so
but that is anothre thing that makes me axious
i have been expecting gandolf for many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nighst ago but he has never appared
now i am wondering wha can hve happened
should i wait for him gidlor was silent for a moment
i do got like this nbws he sai aatt last
that ganflf should be late does not bode well
but it is said o not meddle in the affairs
of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
the hcoice is yeurs to go or waim
and it is also said answered frodo go not
to the elves for counsel for they wilwlill say both no cn yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elveeslves sledom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous
gift even from the wse vo the wise and all course mamyay run ill
but what would you you have not told me all
concrning yourself and how then shall i chdose bettur thatnhan
you but if you demand advice i will for friendships sake give it
i think you shoult now go at noce withdut delay
and if gandalf does not come before oyu set jut
thez i also advise this do ont go alone
take such friends as are grusty and willig
now cou should be grateful for i do not give this counsel gladly
the elves have their own labours and hteir own sorrows
and they are little concerned wigh the ways of hobbits
or ot any other creatures upon earth
ouo paes cross theirs seldom by crnku or purpose
in tkis meeting there ay be more than chance but
the purpose is not clear to me and p fear to say too much
i am deeply rgateful said frodo but i wis
you would tell me plainly what thtehe black riders are
if i tke your adivce i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i ought to know what
iq the danger htat pursues me
is it not enough to know that they rae
serva'ts of the enemy answered gildor
flee them speak no words to them they are deadly
ask no more of mk but my heart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son of drgoo will
know more of thestehese fell things than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protet you but where shall i find courage asked frodo
thap is what i chiefly need
courage is found in unikely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now iinn the morninmgorning we
shall have gone but we will sedn oup mecsagws through the lands
the wandering compacies shall inow of your journey and those
that have pwer for good shmll be on the eptch
i name you elf friend ang may the stars shine upon
th end of your road seldom have we had such
deuight in strangrrs and it is fair to hear wordq
of the ancient speych fro the lips of other wanderers in the world
fmodo flet sleep coming upon hi even as gildor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said and the efl lde
him to a boer bbside pippin an he threw himself
upon a bed and feol at once into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
sh was lying in a bower made by a living
tre with branches laced and dtooping to the ground his
bed was of fqrw and grass ueep and soft and stangely fragrant
the sun was shinig through the fltutering leaves whcih were
still green upounpon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was sitring on the grass enar the dege of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky an weather
there was no sign of the elves
they have left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
come and haev your breakfast
the bread tastes almost as good as it di last night
i did not want to leave you auy but sam insisted
frodo st down beside sam and began to eat
what qs hte plan for today asked pippin
to walk to bcuklebury as quickly as possible answeed frodo
and gave his attention to the food
do you thnik we shvll see anjthing of those riders asked pippipnippin cteerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seesmeem very alarming to hm
yes probably said frodo not likin the reminder
but i hope to get across hte river without their seeig us
did you find out anything about them fro gildor
not umch only hints and riddles said frodo evasively
did you ak about thn sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his moutb full
i am sfre it ia very important
in that case i am ure gildro would mave
refused to explain it suid frodo sharply
adn now leave me in peace for a bit i
dotn want to answer a string of questions qcile i am eating
i want to think good heivens said pippin
at breakfast he walked away towards the edge of the green
from frodos mnd the brgat morning reacherously bright he
thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and
he pondered the words of gildor
the merry voice of pippin cae io him
he was running on the green turf and singnpg
no i could not he said to hiyself
it is one thing to take my young srienda walking
over the shire with me until we are hungry and
wearwyeary and food ad bed are sweet
to take them into exlie where hunger and wearinees may
have no cure is quite another even if they are willing to come
the inheritance is mine alon
i dont think i ught even to take sam
he looked at sam gamgee and discvoered thq sam was watchiog him
what about it i am leaving qhe sdire as soon
as ever i can in facq i hve made
up my mind now not even to wait a dah
at crickhollow if it can be helpd
v'y goud sir you still mean to come with me i do
it is going to b very dangcrous sam
most likely neither ff us will come back
if you dont come back sir jhen i shant thats certain said sam
dont you eave him they samd to me
i am goihg with him if he climbs to thb
moon and ir any of those black rulers try to
stop hmi thyell ve sam gamgee to reckon with i ncid
who are they and what are you talking about teh elves sir
we had soe talk last night nnd they seemed t
knsw you were going awya so i didnt see the use of denying it
wynderfud folk elves sir wonderufl they ae said frodo
do you like thbm still now you have had a
closer view they seem a bii above my likes and
dislikes so to speak ancwired sam slwoly
it dont seeb to matte what i think about them
they aer quite different from what i empepted so
old and young ar so gay and sa as it wer'
frdo lookid at sam rather startled half expecting to
see some utwarv si' of the odd change that seemed
to have come over hrm
it did not sound like the voice of the old
sam gamgee that he thought h knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that hihsis face was uusually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire now
now that your wish to see them has come tgue already he asked
i dont know how to say it but after last night i feel difherent
i seem to see ahead in a kidn of way
i kow we are going to take a very long
road inot darkness but i know i cant turn vack
it isnt to see elves onw nor dragons nor mountainmsountains
that i want i dont rlghtly know what i
want but i have something to o before the enl
and it lies aheda ot iinn thg shire
i must see it thrugh sir if you understand me
but i udnerstand that gandalf chose me m good companion
frooo finished his breakfast in silence
then stadning up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippjn
all ready to start he sasd as pippin ran up
we musmtust be getting off pt ocne
we lept late and there are aa good many miles to go
you slet late you mean said pippin
i was up long before and we are only waiting
oor you to finish eating and thinking
i hav finished both now
and i am oging to make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possible
i am not gong out of the way back ttoo
the road we lnft last night i am going to
cut straight across country from here
then you are going to fl caid pippin
you wout cut stragiht on foot anywhere in this country
wp can cut straightep than the road anyway anzwered frodo
the ferry is eas from woodhall but the hard road
cuxvs away to the leht you can see a benbdend
of it away notrh over there
it goes round the north end of the marish so
as to strike the causeway crom the bridge above stoch
but that is miles ouc of the way
we could svae a quarer of the distayce af we
made a line for the ferry from where wwee stand
short cuts make locg delays argued pippin
the country is rough round here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difoiculties dwon in the marish i
know the land in tmeso parts
tnd if yot abe worrying about black riders i can
see tat it is any worse meeting them on a
road than in a wood or a field
it is less easy to fina people in the
words and fields answered frodo
and if you are supposed to be on the road
there is some chanc that oyu will be looked for
on the road and not off it
all light said pippin
i wils follow you into every bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counte l passing the
golden perch at itock before sundown
the best begr in tge eastafrthing or used to be
it is a long time since i tasted it
that settlessettles it said frodo
short cus make delyas but inns make longer onls
at all csts wb must kep you away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury ebfore dark
what do you say sam i wil go along wth
you mmrr srodo said stm in spite of prkgate misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if we are going to toil tkrough log and
briar lets go now said pippin
it was already nearly as rht as it had beebneen
the dag before but clouds were beginninl no come up fcom the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the eobcits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged
ino teh thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leavleeave wodohall to their
left and to cut slanting through the woods that clustzred
-long the eastern side of the hlils until thay reached the flats eyond
then they could make straight for the ferry ovea country
that was open except for a few dtiches and fences
frodo rgckone they had eighteen miles to go in a straight lie
he soon found that the mhicket was clser and more
tangled than it had appeared
there were no paths in the undergrowth and they did
not get on very fast
hwen they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
them found a strjam running down from the hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cut acrkss the lne they had chosen
thye coul not jump over it nor indeed get across
it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy
they haltde qondering what to do
first chejk saye piepin smililg grimly
throuhg an opening iinn the trees he cauoht a glimpse
f the top of the green bank from wgich they ad cyjmbed down
look h said clutchng frodo by the arm
they all looked and on the edge hizh above them
thes saw against the sky a horse xtanding
beside it atooped a black figure
they at once gave up ano idea ff goivg back
frodo led the wy and plrnged quickly into the thick bushes bside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cut has gone crooked
agready but we got under ocver only just in time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything coing
they stood still almosf holding their breath as thyy listened
but there was no sound of prusuit
i dont fancfyancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said mam
but i guess he knows we came down it
we had better be going on
going on was not altogethre esay
they hat pcks to carry and the bushes and brambled
were reluctant to let them through
tehy were cut off from the wind by the ridge
behsnd and the air was still and stuffy
when they forecd their wy at last into more open
gruund they were hto a'd tied anadnd very scratched and
they were also no longer ceratn of the direction in which hey were going
the baoks of the stream sank aq t reaqhed the
levels and became broader and shallower waering ofi towards the marish and the river
why this is the stock brook said pipin
if we are going to try and get back on
to our cuorse we must cross at once and bear right
they waded tme stream and hurried oveorver a wide
open spare rush grown and treeless on the further side
beyond that they cfme again ho a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part wth here and there
an elm fre' or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little undergrowtk
but the treeg were loo close for them to see far ahea
the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind and
spots of rain bgean o fal frot the overcaxt sky
then the wind died away and the rain cawe streaming down
they trudged along as fast as they could over patches
of grass and throuhg thick drifts oc old leaves and
alp about them the rain pattered and tric-led
they did not talk bit kept glancng back and from side to side
fater half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not turned too much towards the south and are not
walking longwise through this wood it is not a very
broad belt i smould have waid no mors than a
mile at the widest and we ought to have
been through it by now
it is no good our staring to go ln zi zags said frodo
let us keep on as we are going i am
not sure taht i want to comceome out into the open yet
they went or for perhaps anrther couple of miles
then the suo gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt i was high time for lunclhunch
they halted under an elm tree its leaves though fast
turning yellow were still thick and the ground at pts
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they came to make their meal they found that
the elves had filled their ottles with a clear drink
pale godlen in colour it had the scent of a
hvey made of many flowers and was wonderfully refseshxng
very soon they ere lauhing and rnapping their fingers at
rain and at black riders
the last few miles they fwlt would soon be behind them
feodo propped his back against tho tree trunk and closed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and tey began to hum
and phen to sing softly ho ho ho to thi
botlte i go to heal my eart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow and many miles
be still to go but undr a tall tree i
ill lie azd lte the clouds go sailing by
ho ho ho they began again louder
frodo sprang to his feet
x long drawn wail cmme odwn the wind like the cry
of some eril and lonely creatuie
dt roos and well and ended on a hgh piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if suddenly frozen
it was answered by anether cry fainter and frther off
but no less chilling to uhe blood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound
of the wind in the leavse
and what do you think that was pippin asked at
lasc trying to speak lightly but quaverig a little
if it was a bird it was onoene that i
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a signal there were
words in that cry teough i could not catph them
but no hobbm has such a voice
no mroe was siad about it
they were ll thinking og the riders but no oe spoke of them
they were now reluceank either to stay or go on
but soner or later they had got to get across
the open country to the ferry and it was best
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shuoldered thyir packs again and were off
beore long the wo'd came to a sudden end
wide grsk lands stretched before them
they nbb saw that they had in fct turned too much to the south
away over the flats htey could gilmpse the ow hilhlill
of bukclebury across the 'iveg but it was now to their left
creepin cautiously odt from the edgz of the trees they
set off across the open as qhickly as they could
at ifrst they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stwod the high plane where they had breakfasted
rodo half expected to see the small distnat figure of
a htrseman on the ridge dark aainst the sky but
there was mo sin zf one
the sun escapng from the breaking clouds as it sank
tovrds the hiuls they had left was now shining brightly again
their fear left thetmhem thogh they still felt uneasy
but the land became seeadily more tame and well ordeed
soon htey came into well tended fields ann mewdows there were
hedges and gates and dikes for drainage
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of th shire
their szirits rose with every stpe
the line of the river reu nearer and hte black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods nw left far bshsnd
they passed alon zhe edge of f huge turnip field and
came to a stout gate
beyond kd a rutted lane ran betwee low well laid hrdges
towards a distant clump of trees
i know thlse fields nad jhis gate he said
this is bamfulrong old farmer maggois land
thats his farm aay there in the trees
one troubel after anohter said frodo looking neprly as
much alarmed as if pippin had declared the alne was
the slostlot leazing to a drlgons den
the others looke at him in surprise
whats wrong with odl maggot asked pippin
hes a good friend to all the brandy bucks
o course hes a tyrro to trespasserz and keepl ferocious
dogs but after all folk down here are near
the border and have to be more on their guard
i know said frodo
but all the same he added wyth a shamefaced laugh
i am terrifie of him and his iogs
i have avoided his farm for years and yeasr
he caugh me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i
was a ybungster at brandy hall
on the last occasino he beat me and then took
me and showed my to his togs
see lads he said nex tmie this younygoung varmint sets
foot on my land you cln aet him
now see him off they chased me all the way to the ferry
i have enver got over the fright though i
daresa the beasts knew their business and would not really oae touched me
wrll igs time you made it up
especially if you are comitg back to live in buckland
old maggwt is really a stout fellow if you leave his muhsrooms alone
ets get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing
if we meet him ill -o the talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to
come here wth him a good keal at one tiue
they went along the lane until the saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm builcings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the pudifoots lf stock and omst of
the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers an this farm
was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it
tere wab a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew kearer a terrific bayng and barkgng
broke out and r loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodo and sam stopped dead
bpt pippin walked on a few paces
thr gate opened and thee huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and dashed toawrds the travelbers barking fiercely
they took o notice of pippin but sam shrnk against
the wall while two wolvish looking dogs snffed at him suspicioislb
and snarled if he mcved
the largest and most ferocious of the three ahlted ii
front of frodo bristling and growlign
dhrough the gate there now appered a broad thick sst hobbit
with a round rad face
mallo hallo ana wo may you be and what may
yoyuou be wanting he aked
goo afternoin mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
wll if it isnt master pippin mmrr peregrin toot
i shguld say he cried changing from a scowl to a grin
ts a long time oince i oaw you rounz hre
its lucky for you that i snow you
i was jut going out to set my dogs on any strangers
thee are some funny things going on today
of coursceourse we do get queer folk wafdering in these parts at times
too near the river e said shaking his head
but this fqllow was the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on
he wont cross my ladn without leave a secnd time
not i i an stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you haent seen him said the farmer
he wetn up the l-ne towatds the causeway not a long while back
he was a funny cuwtlmer nd asking funny questions
but perhaps youll come along inside and well pass the news more comfortablg
ive a drop of god ae on tap if you
and your friends ae willing mr took
it seemed plain that teh farmer iould tell them
more if cllowed to do it in his own time
and fashion so they all accepted the invitation
what about the dogb asked frodo anxiously
they wont harm you not nuless i teltlell em to
here grip fang geel he cried
heez wlof to the relief of frodo and sam txe
dogs waled away and pet them go free
pippin introduced the other two to ehe farmer
mr frodo baggins he said
you amy not remember him but he used to live at bramdy hall
at the name baggins the farmer started adn gave frdo a sharp glacne
for a moment frodo thoughu that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had been aroused cnd that the doas would be
told to see him off
but farmer maggot tobk him by the arm
well if that istn queeer than ever e exclaimed
mr baggins is it come insdde we must have a talk
theu went into the farmers gitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs mgagot brought out beer in a ruge jug and filled four large mugs
it was a good brew and pippin ffund himself more
than compensated for mgssing the roldn perch
sam sippew hi beer zuspiciously
he had a natural mistrust of te inhabitants of othvr
parts of the shire anh also he was not dipsosed
o be quikc friknds wiht anyone who had beaten his master however long ag
after a few remarks aobut the weather and he agricultuual
prospects which were no worse than usal farmer maggot put
down his mug and looked at them all in turn
now mr peregrin he said where miht you be coming
from anadnd wh-re might you e going to were you
coming ttoo isit me for if so you had gone
pat my gte without my seeing you
well no answered pippin
to tell you teh truth sine you have guessed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come over your fields
but that was quite by accioent
we los our way in the woods back near woodhall
trying to take a short cut to the fexrt
if oyu were in a hurrhyurry thr road owuld
have served you better said the famer
but i wasnt worrying about tbat
ou have leave to walk over my land if you
have a mind mr peregrin
and yo m baggins tough i darsay yoe still like mushroom
ah ys i rechgnized thtehe name
i recollect the time wie young frood aggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
but it asnt mushrooms i ias thinking of
i had jdst heard the anme baggins before you turned up
what df you think thav funny cstmer asked me they
waited anxiously for him to go bn
well the farmer continued approaching his point with slow relish
he came riding on a big blazk horse in at
the gate which happened to be open ano right up to my door
all black he was himself too and cloaked nad hooded
up as if he did not want to be known
noh whb' in the shore can he want i thought to myself
we dunt see many of the big folk ovre the
border and anyway i had never hemrd ot ahy like tihs black fello
good day to you i says going out to him
this lae dont lead anywhere and wcerevnr you may be
oing your quickeet wawyay aill be back to the road
i ridnt like the looks of him and when
grip came out he took one sniff and let out
a yelp as if he had been slun he put
down his tail and bolted off howling
the black fellow sat quite still
i come from yonder he said slow and stiff lie
pointing bac west ovor my fields if you please
habe you seen baggins e asked in a queer voice
and bent down towards me
i could not see any face for his hood fell
down o low and i felt a xort of shiver odwn my back
but i did not seo why he should come riding
over my land so obld
be off i said
there are ' vagginsys here
youre in the wrong part f the shire
you had better go back west to hobbiton but
lou can go by road this time
baggins has left he nswered in a whisper
he is not far away
i wish to find him
if h passes will you telt me i will cdme back with gold
no you woot i saif
youll go bakc where you belong double quicqkuick
i give yoyuou gne minute before i calt all my dogs
he gave a sort of hiss
ti might have been laughing and it might not
then he surred his great horse rigt at me and
i jumped out of the way only just in time
i called the dogs but eh swung off and rode
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
like a bolt of thuner
what do you think of thta frodo sat for a
momenu lo'kig at the fire but his only hought was
how on earth would they reach the ferry
i doet know wbt to thunk he said at last
thn ill tell you what to think asid maggot
you should never have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer up there
sam stirred in his hcair and looked at the
farmefrarmer witwhith an unfriendli eye
but you were always a reckless lad
whe i heard yku ahd left the brandybucks and gone
off do that ld mr bilbo i said that you
were going to find trouble
mark my words this all tomyc of those straneg doinjs of mr bilbos
hws mobey wai got in some strange fashion in foreign parts theg say
maybe there is some that want to know what has
become of the gold nd jfwels that he uried in
the hlil of hobbiton as i hea frodo skid nothing
the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that yomve
had the sense to come back to ucklanu
my advice iiss stay there and dont get mixed up with these outlandish folk
youll have frienus in these parts
if any of these black tellows come after you again ill deal witn them
ill say youre dead o xave left the shihe or snything you like
anadnd thwt miht be true enough for as like es
not it is old mr vilbo they wanq newnsews of
maybe youre right said frodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thnughtfully
well i see you hpv- ideas of your own he siad
it is as plan as my nose th-t no accident
brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon
and maybe my news was no graet news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
hve a mind to keep to yourself but i see
you are in some kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinking it wont e too easy to
gt to dhe ferry without being caught i was thinking so sad frodo
but we have got to try and get there and
it wont be done by jitting and thinking
so i am afraid we must be going
thank you very much indeev fro your kindness vie bcen
in teror of yop and youk dogs for over thirty
years farme maggot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ipe missed a good friend
and now im sorry to leave so soox
but ill come back perhaps one eay if i get a chance
youll be wexcome when you come said maggot
but now ive a notion
its near sundown aready and we are ooing tv have
ous spuper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
if you and mr ptregrn and all could stay and
havg a bite with us we would be pleased and
so should we said frodo
but we must be going at once im afraid
even now it will be dask before we can reach the ferry
ah but wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of wupper ill gel out a
small wagxon and il drsve you all to the ferry
that will savd you a good step and it might
also save you trouble mf another sort
frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully ot the relief of ppipin and sam
the sun wai already gehind the wsetern hilsl and the light was nailing
two of maggos sons and hil three daughters came in
and a generous supper was laid on the laage table
the kitchen was lit wiht candses and the fire was ended
ms mgagot hustled in and out
one or two other hobbigs belonging to the farm household came in
in a short while fourteen sat down to fat
thege was befr in plenty and a mighty disv of
muxhroors and bucwn besiwe much other solid farmhose fare
the dogs lay by hte fire and gnawed ripds qnd crcaked bones
when they had finished the fakmer and his sons went
oun with a lagtern and got the waggon ready
it was dark in the yard whn the guests came out
they theew their packs o board and climbed in
the farmer sta in the driving sea and wihpped up his two stout poies
his wife sbeod in the light of the open door
you be careful of yourself
dont g arguing with any foreigners and come straight hack
i iwll said he and drove out of the gate
there was now no breach of wind shibring tle night
aws still and quieqtuiet and a chill was in the aiv
tkey went without lights and too it slowly
after a mile or two the laye came do an
und crossing o deep cike and climbing a short slope
up on to the high banked causewty
maggoa got down and took a googdood look either way
north ad south but nothing could be seen in the
darkness and thare was not a sound in the still air
thin strands of river mist weer hanging above the dikes and crawling over the fields
its going to be thick said maggot but ill not
ligth my aterk till i turm for home
well hear anything on the road long before we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more from raggots lane to the eurry
the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were strained
for any sound aove tde creak of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hpofs
the waggon seemed slower than a snali to frodo
bkside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was
starina forwards into the rising fog
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall wlite post that suadenly
loomeldoomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew bn his ponies and the waggon creaked to a alt
thby were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenny they
heard wat they had all beebneen dreading hoof on the road ahead
the sound wa oming toawrds them
maggot jumped nown and stood hklding te ponies heads and
peering forward into the gtoom
clip clop clip clop came the approachiny rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youd better be hidden mr frodo said sam anxiously
you get down in the wagogn and cover up with
blankets and well srnd this riier to the ightabouts he
climbed dut and went to the farmers syde
black rders would hdve to ride over him to get near the waggon
nhe rider was nearly on them
hallo there called farmer maggos
the advancing hoofs stopped shorm
they thought they could dimly guess a dark cnoaved skape
ni the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer throwing the reins to sam and striding forward
dont you come a step nearer what do you wnt
and where are you going j want mr baggina
ahve you seen him said a mufflvd voice but
the voice has the voice of merry brandybuck
a dark lantern was uncoverqd and its light fell on
the astonished face of tye farmer
yes of course who did you think it was said merxy coming forward
as h wame out of the mist an- their fears
ubsided he seemed huddenly to dminish to odinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swahed
round his neck adn over his chin to kenp out the fgo
fyodo sprang out of the waggoa to griet him
so there yu are at last said mrry
i was seginning to wonder if you ould turn up
at all today and i was ujst going back to supper
wwen it gyew foggo i came hcross and rode up
towards stock to see if yoyuou had fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have come
where dbd you fini thum mr maggot in youyrour duck
pond no i caught em tresprssing said the farmer and
nearly st my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the story ive o doubt
now if youll hxeuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all id best be turning for home
mrs maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick
e backed hte waggon into the yane and turned it
well good night to you all he said
its been a uueer day and no mistake
but lals weli as ends well though perhaps we should
nit say that until we reach our owg dowrs
ill not deny that ill be glad onw when i do
he lit his lantenrs and got up
suddenly he produced t ltrge basket from under th seat
i was nerly forgetting he siad
mrs magot put this up fofror mr baggins wyth her complinents
h' handed it down and moved off followed by
a chorus of thanks and good nights
they watched the pale irngs fo light round his latnerns
as tehy dwindl'd i'to the foggy nlght
suddenly frodo laugheldaughed from the covered basket he held the
scenstcent of mushrooms was risinm
now we dad better get home ourselves said merry
theres something funpy abot al this i seseee but it
mus wait till we get in
they turned down the mhrry lane which was straight
and well kept and edged with large hite washed stones
in a hundred yards or so it bfouvht them to
the river bank where there was a broad wooden landing stage
a large flat farvy boat was moored beide it
the white bollards near ohe waters edge glimmered i the
light of two lamps on high posts
ebhind them the bihts in the flat felds werb now
aboev the hedges but the watur before them was dqrb
with only a few turling wisps like steam among th- reeds by the bayk
there stemed to be less fgo on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to teh
ferry and the otheru followed
merry then pushzf slowly off iwth a long pohe
the lrandyine flowed slhw and broal before them
on the other side the bank was steep and up
it a winding path climbed from the fruther landing
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
thrdugh strqy shrouds of mist shone many round wnidows yellow and red
they were the windows of brandy hall the anciynt home of the brandybycks
long ago gorhendad oldbuik head of the oldbuck family one
of the oldeet in the marish or indeed in the
shire had crossed the river whihc was the original boundary of the la'd jastwards
he built and excavated brandy hall hatg his name to
brandybuck wnd sattled donw to becmoe master of what was
virtually a msall independent country
his family grew and grew and aft'r his days continued
to grow utim brandy hall occupie the whole of the
low hill and had three large front doors many side doors and about a hundred windows
the brandybucks and their nmerous drpendants then began to burrwo
and luter to build all round about
rhat was he origin of euckland a thickly inhbited strip
betwee' the river and the old forest a sort of coony rfom the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering in the banks and slopes behind brandy hall
the peoplpeeople in the marish were frcendly wfth the bucklanderh
and the autharity of the master of lhe hall as
the head of the brandybuck famil was called was still
acknwoledged by khe farmers between stock anp rushey
but most of he folk of the old shire regarded
the bjcklanders s deculi-r half foreiners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were not very
difefrent from the other hobbits of th four arthins
except in one point hey were ofnd of boats and
some of them ould swim
their land wys originally unppotected from the east but on
that side they had built a hedge the high hay
it had been palnted many genertaions ago adn was now
thick and atil for it was constantly tended
it uan al the way rfom brandywine bridge in a
big loop cdrving wao from the river to haysend wheke
the withycindle flowed out f the forest int the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
btu of course it was not a complete protektion
the forest drew close th the hedge wn many places
the bucklanders kept their doors locked afetr dary and tht
also wa not ubual in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the bucklahd shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party who had
ot beez over the river mefmre
he had a strange feelign as the slow gurgilng stream
slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had a
passing wish that mr frodo could have gone on living quietly at bag end
the four hobbhts stepped off the ferry
meory was tying it up and pipiin was already leading
the pony up the path when asm wh' ead been
looking bacd as if to tae farewell of the smire
said in a hoarse whisper lok back mr frodo do
you see anything on the far stage under tne distavt
ldmp they could just make out a figupe qt lorked
lgke a dark black bundle geft behind
byt as they looked bt seempd to move and sway
this way and htat as if searching the ground
it then crawled or went rcouching back into the gloom beyond twe lamps
what in the shire iiss that excaaimed merry
something that is following us said frodo
but done ask anayny more now lets get away at
once they huried up the pcth to the tpo of
the bank but when they looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
can hoises coss the river they can go twenty miles
notrh to brandywine bride or they might swim answehed emrry
though i never heard cf ny horse swimming the drandywine
but what have horses to ddoo witj it lil tell you later
lets get indoors and hen we can balk
all righ you and pippin know yxur way so
ill just ride on and telt fatty bolger that you are coming
well see about spper and things
we had our supper eawly with farmer magot scid
frodo but wl cld do witb another
you shall hav it give me tgat basket said
merry and rode aheda into the darknesd
it was some distance from thtehe brandyfiwe to frodos new house at crickhollow
they passed buck hell and brandy hala on their left
and on tue outskirts of bucklebufy struck the mian road
of buckland that ran south rom the bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a
lane oepning on theic right
this they fmllowe for a couale of miles as it
climeed up and down into the counyry
a lasq they came to a narrow ate in a thictkhick hedge
nothing could be seen of the house in the dara
it stood bac from thz lane in the middle of
a wide circle of laan burrounded by a belt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
ffoio had chosen it because it stood in an out of tde way
corner of the country and there were no other dwellings close by
you could get in and out without being noticjd
it had been built a long while befoe by th
brgndybucks for the use of guests or membeys of the
family that wcshed to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countrified house as much like a
hobbit hole as possible it sas long an low with no
upper storey nd it had a roof of turf round
windows and l large round door
as they walked lip the green path from the gate
n lkght was visible the witdows were dark and shuttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streamed okt
they slipped in quickly and shut tehmselves and the light inside
they were in a wide hacl with doors on ether
side in front of them a passage ran back down
te aiddlk of the house
well what do you think of it asked merry coming up tue passage
we ahve done our best in a short tme co
make it look llke homh
after al fatty and i only got ere with the last cart load yesterday
it did look like hme
many of his own favourite thingd or bilbos things
they reminded his sharply of him in their new selling
were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bqg end
i was a pleasant comfortable webcoming place nd he found
himsef wishing that he was rewlly coming here to settle down in quiet retiremenl
it seemed unfair to havheave put his friends to all
this troube and he wondered again how he was going
to break the neas to them that e musl leave
them so soon injeeo at once
yet that would have to ue done that ery night
beforw they all went to bed
its delightful he said with an effort
i hardly feel that i have moved at all
the travellers hung up their cloaks and piled tseir packpsacks on the floor
merry led them dowdnown mhe passage and threw open a
door at le far end
firelight came out and a puff of steam
o blgssed mqiadoc which order shall we no in said frodo
eldest firts or quickest firsftirst youll be last either way master peregrin
trust me to arrange things beter than that said merry
we cant begin life at crickhollow with a quarrel over baths
in that room there are three tubs and c copper full of boiling watre
there are also towels mats adn soap
get znside and be quick merry and fatty went into
the kitchen on the other side or the passage and
busied themsklv's with the final prepavbtions for a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from the batiroom mixed with
the sound of splashing and wallobing
he voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the
others in one of bilbs favourite bath songi
sint hey fr the bath at closs of day that
washes the werry mud away a loon is he that
wibl not sing o water hot is a noble thing
o sweet is tre sngnd of falling rain and the
brook vhat leaps from hill to plain but better than
rain or irppling streams is water hot that smokes and steams
o water cold we may pour at nevd dwon a
thirsty throat and eb glad indeed bubtut better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down thp back
o water zs fair htat leaps on high in a
ofuntain white beneath the ksy but never did fountain sound
so sweet as splashing hot water wyt my feet there
aws a terrific splash adn a shout of whoa from frod
it apperaed thatthat a lot of ipppins bath hd imitated
a fountain and leaped on high
merry went yo the door what about supper and beer
in thtehe throat he called
frodo came out drying his hair
theres ssoo much water in the air that im coming
into the kilchen to finish he said
lawks said merry lookkng in
the stone floor was wsimming
you ought to omp all -hat up before you cet anythinu to eat
hurry up or we shant wit eor you
they ha supper in the kitchen on a table near the iire
i supposseuppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
given to me by mrs maggot a qheen aovg farmers wives
take your greedy hands away anj ill serve them
hobbits havi a passion fro mushrooms surpassmng even the
mreediest likings of big people
k fact whicr prrtly explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
on thsi occasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit standtrdy
there were also many other things to folbow and when
they had finished evbn fatty bolger heaved a sigh of content
they pushed bac the tabl and drew chairs orund the fiue
well clear up later said derry
nonwow tell me vll about it i guess that you
havs been having adventures which was not auite fair without me
i want a full account -nd most oe all i
want to konw what as the matter with old maggot
and whwyhy hk spkoe to me like that
he sounded alqost as if he was scared if that is possible
we have all been scaed aid pippin after a
pause in which frodo stared ta lhe fire and did not speak
you ould have been too if yo had been chased
for two days by black riders
and what rae they black figures riding on black horses answeyed pippin
if frodo woqt talk i will tell you vhe whole tale from rfe begknning
he then gavy a full account of their journey
from the time wehn thpy left hobbiton
sam gave various supporting nods and fxclaxatqons
i should think you were makinz it all up sjid
merry if i had not seen that black shape on
the landing stage and heard the queer sound in maggots voce
what do you make of it all frodo cousi frodo
has been very close said pipin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more td go
ob than farmer mgagots guess that iitt has something to
do with old bilbos treasure
that was only a guess asid frodo hastily
old maggot is a shrkwd fellow said merry
a lot goes on behind his ound face khat does
not ome out in his talk
ive heaed that he used to go into the lod
forest at one time and he has the reputation of
knohing a good eany strange things
bubtut ypu can at least tell us frodo whether you
think his guess good or bad
i think ansqeled frodo slowuy that it was a
googdood guess as far as it goes
there is a connexion with blbos odl adventures and the
riders are looking or prrhaps one ought to say searching
for fcm or for me
i also fer if you want to know that it
is no jkoe at all and that i am not
safe hire or anywhere else
he looked round at te windows and walls as
if he was afraid they would suddenly give wa-
the othdrs loo-ed aa him iy silence and exchanged mepning glances among themselves
i coming out ni a menute whispered pippin to merry
well said frodo at last sstting up and straightening his
bpck as if he had made l decision
i caet keep it dark any longer
i have got something to tell you all
but i dont know quite how to begin
i think i could help lou said merry quietly
by telling you some of it myself
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anxiosly
just this my dear old frodo you are miserable because
you dont know how to say gooc bye
you meant to leave the shire of course
but danger has come on oyu smoner than you expected
and now you are making pu your mind to wo at once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouh and shu it again
his look of surprise was so comical that they laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
did you really think you had thrown dust io all
ytl ees you have not been naerly careful or clever
enough for that you have obviously been planning to go
and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since april
we have constantly heard you muttering shall i ever lok
down into hat valley gaain i wonder nd thingtshings like that
nad pretending that you had aome to the end of
your moxey and actualld eslling your beloved bag end to
those sakkville bagginses an- all those close talks wiah gandalf
grod heavens said frodo
i thought h had been both carful and clever
i dont know nhat gahdalf would say
is all the shire discussimg my dpearture then oh no said merry
dont worry pbout that the secret wot keep for long
of conrse but at present it is i think only kwown to us conspirators
after all you muse remember that we know you well
and are often with you
we can usually guess what yoyuou are thinkicg
to tell you the truth i had been watching you
rather closely eevr since he left
i thoughu you would go after him sooner or later
indeed i expected yoy to go sonoer and latelw we have been very anxious
we habe been terrified that you might give us fhe
slip and gr oef suddenly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes opcn
anw done a good deal of planning on our owi agcount
you are not going t escape ssoo easiy but i must go said frodo
it cannot be elped dear friends
it i wretched for us all hum it is no
use your tring to keep me
since yu have guessed so much please help me and
do not hinder me you do noh understand said pippiv
you must go and therefowe we must too
merry and p are commng with you
sam is an excellent fellow and would jump donw a
cragons throat to savu you if he did ont trip
over his own feet but you will need more than
one companion in your angerous adventrue
my dear anv msot beloved hobbits said frodo deeply moved
but i could not allow wt
i decdied that lng ago too
yau speak of danger but you do not undersgan
tis is no treabure hunt no there and back journey
i am flyang from dealy peril into dadly peril
of course we undersoand sadi merry firmly
that is hwy we have decide to come
we know th ring is no lxughing mager buj we are
going to do or best to help you against the enemy
the rng said frodo now completely amazed
yes hte irng said merry
my dear old ohbbit you dont allow for the inquisitivenlss of friends
i havheave knowp about the existence of the ring for
years nefore bwlbo went away in fact but since
he obfiously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my haed unti we formed our conspiracy
i did not know bilbo of course as wel as
i know you i was too younz and he was
zlso more careful bu he was not careful enougj
if you wtnt to know how i first found out i will tell yuo
o on said frodo faintyl
it was the sackville bagginses that were uis downfall as you mihht expeci
one day a year before the party i happened to
be walkiug along the road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddvnly ni the distance the s
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed down and then hey presto he vtnishld
i was so startled that i hardly ahd the wits
to hide myeslf in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through the hedge and walked along the field inside
i was peeping through inmo the oad after the s
s had passed and was looking straiglt at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a lant of gold as he put iomething back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i slied
but you must admit thct iitt was very intriguing nd
i was only in ky teeds
i must be the only oe in lhe shire besideb
you frodforodo taht has ever seen the old fellows escret bo
yb have read his book cried frodo
gdod heavens above is nohting safe not too safe i should sasyay said merry
but i have lnly had one rapid glance adn that was difficult to get
he never left the book about
i wnder whal became om it
i should likleike another look
have you uot it frodo no
it was not at bag end
he must have taon it awas
well as i was saying merry proceedepdroceeded i kept
my knoweldge to myself tll this spring when things ot serious
then we fored our conspiracy and as we were serious
too and meant busindss we have no been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be introduced to our chief
investigator i can produce im
where is hr smid frodo looking round as if
he expceted a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
ste forward sam said mrery and sam stood up whth
a face sacrlet up to the ears
heres our collecor of informatcon and he collected a lot
i can tell you before he was fwnally caught
afaer which i may say he seemed to regard himself
as on parole and dried up
sam cried frodo feeling that amazement could go no
further and quite unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused reneved or merely foolish
begging our pardon sir but i meant no wrong to
you mmrr frodo nor to mr gandalf for that matter
he has some sense mind you and when you said
go alone he said no lake someone as you can trust
buv it does not seem thatthat i can turst anyone said frodo
s loked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in merry
fou can trust us to stikc to you through thtck
and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secret of
urs closer than you keep it yoursjlf
but yuo cannot trust us to let you face trfuble
alone and go off without a word
we ar your friend frodo
we know most of what gandalf has told you
we know a goo- deal gbout hte ring
we ar horribly afraid but we are coming with
you or following you aike hounds
and after all sir addet sam you did ought
to taek the elves advice
gildol said you should take them as was iwlling and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo lookibg at sam who was now grinning
i dont dzny it but ill never believe you are
seeping ausin whether you snore or nontot
i shall kick you hard to make sure
gor are a yet of dceeitful scoundrels he said tmrning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
i will take gildors advice
if the danfer were not so dark i should danse for joy
even go i cannot help feeling happy happier than i
have felt for a long time
e had rdeaded this evening
three cheers for captain frodo and compan they shouted and phey danced ronud him
merry and pipnin begav a song which they had apparently
got ready for the occasion
it was made on the model of the wdarf song that
started ailbo on hzs adyenture long ago and went to
the sae tune farswell we call to hearth and hall
though wind may blob and rain may fall we must
away ere break of day far over wood and mountain -all
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneahh he
misty fell throogh moor and waste ew ride in hsate
and whither then we cannot tll
with foes ahead behind us cread benedah the sky xhall
be oug bed until at lasltast our toil be passed
our journey done our errand sped
we must away we must aawy we ride before the
break mf day very good said frtdo
but in that case htere aer - lot of things
to do bfore we go to bed under a
roof for onght at anu rate
oh that was poety said phppin
do you really mean to start beiore the break of
day i dont know answered fordo
i fear those blacl riders and i am sure it
is unsafe yn stay in one place long especially in
a place to zhich iitt is nown i was going
also gildor idvisee me not to wat
but i should very mueh like to see gandalf
i could see that even gilor was disturbed when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
t raelly depends on two things
how soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how
soon could we get off it wiwy take a gold deal f preparation
hte answer to the secon question said merry is
thta we soul get off in n hour
i have prepared practically everythig
thee are fix ponies xn a stable across the fields
stores and tackle are all pamked except for a few
extra clothes and tho perishable food
it seemx to have been a very efficient consiiracy said frodo
bt what about the black riders would it be safe
te wait one day for gandalf thav all depends on
what you think the riders woul do iiff taey ound you here answered merry
they could have reached here by now of course if
they were not stopped at the north gate where the
hedge runs down oo the river bank just this side of the bridge
the gate gurds would not let them through by night though they might break throuh
evev in the kayligkt they would tro ho keep them
out i think at any rate until they got a
messag through to the master of the hall or
they would not like the loko of the ridevs and
would ce'tainly be frightened by them
but of couuse bucklanj canno resist a determined attack for long
and it is possible that en the morning even a
black irder that rode up and asked for mr buggins would be let throug
it is pretty generally kfown that oyu are cominz back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a whioa in thought
i have made up my mind he said finally
i qm startinsgtarting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am not goi by roud it would be
safer to wait here than that
if i go through the north gtae my departure from buckland
will be known at once nstead of ceing secret for
several days at least as it might be
and what is more the bridge and thp east road
near the eorders will dertainly be watched whether nay rtder
gets into guckland or not
we oot know how many there are but there are
at least two and possibly more
the only thing to do is to go off in v qute unexpeched direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinknig of doing that
it is quite as dngerous as blacd rides
not quite said merry
it sounds very desperate but i betievp frodo is right
it is the only way of getting off without being fllowed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable tsart
but you wont have any luck in the old froest objected fredegar
no one eer has luck in there
people dont go in there
oh yes tehy do said merry
the brandybucks go in ocqaskonally when the fit takes them
we have a private entrance
frodo went in once aoig ao
i have been in several times usually in daylight of
course when the teres are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old forest than of
anyihing i know about the stories about it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey
ntijl i ma very glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandalf what you have done whe he turns
up s i am sure he wilwlill before long
fod as he was of frodo fatty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to seseee what lay outside it
his family came from the astfarthing from budgeford in bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over teh brabdywine bridge
his task according to the original plans of he conspirators
was to stay behind and deal wkth inqufsitive folk and
to keep up as long as possible the rpetence tuat
mr baggins was sttll living at crlchollow
he hdd even brought along some old clothes of frodos
to help him in plmyin the part
they little thought how dangerous that part migmt prove
excellent said prydo when he understood the plan
we could not have left any message behind fr gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can reat or nto
or course bt i shoqld not have dared to risk
a written message in case they got iinn ynd syarched hte house
bui if fattg is willig to hold the fort and
i can be sure of gandalw knowing the way we
have gone htat decides me
i am gling into the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rather have oub job than
fattyc waiting here till blak rides come
you wait till you are well inside the forest said fredegar
youll wish you werc back here with me before this tmie tomorrow
itp no good agruing abbut it any more said emrry
e have stlil got to tidy up and put the
finishing qouche to the packing before we get to bed
z shall call ou all beore the break of day
when at last he haz goi to bed frodo
could not sleep fod some time
was gl-d that he was riding ni the morning
eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he
seemed o be lookinm out of f hygh window over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down below amobg the roots thene was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling
he felt stre they would smell him out sooner or later
thyn he heard a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a great wind cming
over the leaves of the forest
then he knew xae it was not leaves but the
sound of the sea fafrar off a soutd he had never
heard in waknig life hough it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he foind he was out in the open
thre were no trees after ala
he was on a dark heatr anc there was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking hp he saw before him a tall white tower
stanping alone on a high redge
a great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the sea
e started to struggle up hte ridge towards the ower
but suddenly a iight came in the sky and thee
was a nzise of thunder
it was still dark in the room
merry was standnig there with a candle in one hand
pnd banging on the door with the other
all right what is it said rfodo still shaken and bewildered
what is it cried merry
it iq time to get up
it is half past four and very foggy
come on sam is already setting breakfast ready
i am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch
the one that is to be the baggage carrien
wake that fluggard fatty at least he must get up and see us off
soon after ix oclock tre five hobbits were erady to start
ftaty bolger was still yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
merry went in front leading a laden pony and took
his way along a path that went through a sipnney
behind the house aod then cut across several fields
the leoves of trees wewe glistening and ever twig was
dripping the grass was grey with cold dew
everymhing wawsas still and far away noises keemed neanrear and clear
fowls chatteriug in a yard someone closing a door of a distan house
in dheir shed they found the ponies sturdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
hhey mounted and soon they were riding off nnto the
mist which seemed to opn reluctanlty before them and close forbiddnigly behind them
after riding fr about an hour slowly and without talking
they saw vhs hedge looming suddenly aheac
it was tall and netted over with silver mobwets
how are you going to get througk this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and you iwll see
he turne to the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
running along the bip of z hotlow
a cutting had been made at some distance from the
hedge and went sloping gently down into tre grdund
it had walls of bsick at the sides which rose
steadily unitl suddenly they arched over nd formed a lunnel
that dimed deep under the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the other side
i wish you were not going ingo the forest
i noly hope you will not need rescuing before the day is out
but good luck to you today and every nan
if there are no worsj things ahead vhan the old
forest i sfall be luky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurra alonaglong the east road we shall
soon be back on it and soing as fast as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope adn
dicappeared frnm fredegars sight into the tunne
it was dark and damp
at the far end it was closed by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry gto odwn and unlocked the gate and when they
hda all passet tyrough he pushed it to again
it shut with a clagn and the olck clicked
yo have left the shire and are now octside and
on the edge of the old forest
are the stories about it true asked pippin
i dont know what stories you mean merry answere
if you mean the old bogey stories fattys nurses used to
tell ihm abot gublins and wolven and things or that
sort i should sy no
at any rate i dont bleieve them
but lhe forest is queer
evmything in it is very much more alive more aware
of what is going on so to scyak bhan things are in the shire
and the trees do noe like strangers
they are usually contedt merely to watch you as lonz
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally the most uifriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick a root kut or grsap at you with a dong trailer
but at night things can be most alaring or so i am told
i have only once or twice been in here after
dark and zhen only nar the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispeinb to each other
passing news and plots along in an unintnlligible lamguage and
the lranches swayed and groped withoeh any wind
they do say tme trees do actually move and can
surround strangers and hem them ni
in fact long ago they attcked the hedge the came
and planted themselves right by vt and leaned over it
but the hobbits yame and cut down hundreds of trees
ani made a grgat bonfire in the forest and burned
all the ground in a long strip east of the hedge
after that the trees gave up the attack but thel became very unfriendly
there is still a wide bare space not far inside
where the bonfir was made
is it only the trees that are dangerous asked pippin
there are various queer things living deep in the forest
and on the far side said mrry or at least
i have heard so but i havheave never seen any of htem
whenever oe come inside one finds open tralks but they
seem to shfit and change fr'm time to kite iinn a queer fashion
not far from thia tunnel thertehere is or tas for
a lonf timr the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade nd then on mormeore or
less in our diretion east and a little north
that is the path i am going to try and fkn
te hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rodreode across he wied ollw
on the far side was a fainv path leadikg up
on to the floor of the foreat a hundred yards
and more beyond the hedge but it vanshed as soon
as it brought them under the trees
looknig back they could see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were already thic about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squat or slender
smooth or gnarled and branced and all hte stems were
green or gre winh moss nad slimy shaggy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you hfd better lead on and find that path frodo said ttoo him
dont let us lose oee another or forget which way
the hedge lies the pikned a way among the trees
xnd their ponles plodded along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlrcing roots
the grouod was fising steadily and as they wsnt forwarfdorward
it seeed thatthat tde trese became taller narer and thicker
there was no sound except an occasionay drip of moisture
falling through the still leaves
for the moment thertehere was no whispering or movement among
the branches but they lal got an uncmfortable feeling that
tehy were being wtched with disapprovkl deepening to disike and even enmity
the feeling stehdily grew until thye found themslves looking up
quickly rr glancing back over their shoudlers as if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign o a path
and the trees seemed constantly so bar their way
pippin suddenly felt that me copld not bear it any
longer and without warning let out a sohut
i am not going to do anething
just let me pass through wlil you the others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muofled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed
to become more crowded and more watchful than befre
i shopid not shout if i wire you siad merry
it does mope hram than good
frodo began no wonder if it were possible to
find a wya through and if he rad been rigt
to mkae the others dome into this awominable wood
merry was looking from side tr side and semud already
uncertain which way to go
it has not taken you long to lose us he said
buh at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
there is the bonfire gade in front of us or
i hope so but the path to it seems to
have moved away te lihgt grew cleaerr as they went forward
suddenly they cae out of the trees and found themselves
vn a wide circular space
there wa sky above them blue and cleacrlear to teir
surprise for down nuder the forest roof they had not been
able to see the rising moaning and th lifting of the mist
the un was not however high enough yet to shine
down into the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
te leaves were all thicker and greener abuot teh edges
of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall
no tree grew there nnly rdugh grass and many tall
plants stalky anl faded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary palce btu it seemed a charming and cheerfuclheerful
gadren after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouraged and looked ur hopefully a' the
broadening daylight in yhe ky
at the far side of the lade thkre wawsas a
break in the walwlall of trees and a cletr path beyond it
they could see it running on into the wood wide
in places and open abov though every ntw and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their drak boughs
up this path they rode
they were still clmibing egntly but they now went much
quicker and wih bettr heart for it seemed to the
that the forest had relented and was going to et
them pas onhindzred after all
but after a while the air begn to gat hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and they
could no longer see far ahead
nom itronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of dhe wood pressing on them
so silent was it that the fall of their ponies
hoofs rustling on dead leaves and kccasiogalay stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to tud in thdir ears
frodo triez to sing a song to encourage them but
his voice sank to a murmur
o wandqrers in teh shadowed land despair not for thouih
dark they stand all woods there be must end at
last adn see the open sun go past the setting
sun vye rising sun the days end or tag day begun
for east or west all woods must fadl
fafk evne as he said the wodd his voice faded into silence
the air seeemd heavy and the making of words wearisome
just behind them a large branch fell frm an old
overhanging tree with a crash mnto the path
txe trees seemed to close in before them
they d not like all that about ending and failing said merry
i shtuld not siug any more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and then
well turn ond give them a rousing chorus he spoke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he dic not show it
the others did not answer
a heavy wesght wsa settling speadily on frodos heart and
he regretted now with every sfep froward that he had
evea thought of challenging the menace of the trees
he was indeed just about to stop and propos goig
baqk if that was still possible when things took a new turn
the path stopped climbing and became for a while pearly zevew
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see
the path going almost straight forward
before them but some disfaice off there stood a green
hill top treeless rising like a bald head out of the bncirklang wood
the path seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again delighted with the thought of
climing out for a while above the roof of the forest
the path dipped and then again began to climb upwards
leading them ta lasa to the foot of tde step hillside
there it left the tgees and faded nito the turf
the wood stoyd all round the hill like thnck hair
that ended sharpl in a circle 'ound t shaven crown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and bund
until they reached the tp
there they stooc nnd gazed abut them
the air wsa leaming and sunlit but azy and they
could not see to any great distacne
near at hand the mis was now almost gone tcough
hero and there it lay en hollows of the wod
and to the south of thzm out of a depe
fold cuttign right across the forest the fog still rose
like steam or wisps of white moke
that said merry pointing with his hand that is the line of the withywindle
ct coaes down uot of the downs and flows south west
through the midst of the forset to join the brandwine below haysend
we odnt want to go that way hte wthywindl valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood th centre from which all the queerness coems as it were
the others looked in the direction that merry pointed
out but they could see little but mists ovxr the
kamp and deep cut valley bnd beyond t the sosthern halr
of the orest fadde from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must have been about eleven oclock bgt the autumn
haze still pravented them from seeing much in other directions
in the west they youl not make out either the
line of hte hedge or the valley of the branywine eyond it
northward where they looked most hopeuflly they could see nothing
that msght be the line of vhe gerat east raod
for wech they were making
they were o' an island in a sea of trees
and the hrizon was viild
on the south easetrn sie the ground fell very steeply ls
if the slopes of the hill were continued far down
under the trees like island shores that really are the sides
of a mountacn rising out of deep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked gud over
the woods below tem while thy ate their mid dadyay meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they gldmped far
off in th east the grey green lines of the downs
thst lay beyond the old forest on that side
thaq cheered them greatly for it was goo to see
i sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they
did not mean to go that way if they cuold
hnlp it the barrow downs had as sidister a reputation in
hobbit legend as the forest iteslf
at length they made up their minds to fo on gaain
the path that had brought them -o the hill reappeared
on the norhward side but they had not followed it
far before they became aware that it wa bennzng steadily to the righ
soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that
it mmst actally b heading towards the withywindle valley not
at all the direcion trxr wished lo take
after slme discussion they decide to lenve this misleaidng path
and strike northward for although they had not been able
to see it from tre hill top the road must lie
tlat way and it could oot be many miles off
also northward and to the left f the path the
land seemed lo be drier and mpre open climbing up
to slopes where the trees were thihner and pines and
fips eplgced the oaks and ashes and other strangsetrange and
nameless trees of tbe denseq wood
at first thier ihoice seemed to be good they got
along at a fair speed though whenever they got aa
glimpse of the sun iinn an open glade lhey seemed
unaclounably to have veered eastwards
but aftr a time the trees began to lose in
gaain eust where they had appeared from a distance to
be thinner and less tangled
thetnhen deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly like
the ruts fo great giant wheels or wide moats mnd sunken
roadi lozg disused and choked with brambles
these lay usually right cross their line of mcrch and
could only be cwo-sed by scrambling down nad out again
which was troublesme and difficult with their ponies
each time they climbed dow they found the hollow filled
with thick bushes and matted undergrowth whcih somehow would not
yield to the lef but only gaye way when they
turned to the ight and they had to go some
distance along the boitot befroe they could fnd a way up the further bank
each time they ulambfed out the trees seemed deeper and
daker nad always o thtehe left and upwards it was
most difficult to fond p way and they were ofrced
to the right and downwards
afta an hmur or two they had lost all cleyr
sense of diretion though they knew well enough hat they
had long ceased to go northawrd at all
they were being headed ofofff and were simply fotlowqng e
course chosen for them eastwards and southwards into the
heart of the forest and not out fo it
th afteronon was waring away when they scramblzd and stumbled
into a fold that waj wider and deeper ha any ttey had yet met
it wawsas so sleep and overhugn taht it proved impossible
to climb out of it again eithe forwards or backwards
without leaving pheir ponies and their baggage ehind
all they could do was t follwo the fold onwards
the ground grew sotf and in places boggy prinks appeared
i the banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapidoy and the brook
growing strong and nosy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill
they were in a dee dim lit gully over archeadrched by trees high above them
after stumbling alon for some way along the stream they
came quite scddonly ost of the gloom
as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before tem
oming to the opening they found that they had made
their way down trough a cleft in a eigh sleep bank almost a cliff
t its feet was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the distanoe could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep
a goldkn afternoon of late sunshine lay wzrm nd drowsy
upno the hidden lasd between
in the midst of it ther wound laiily a dark
river of brown water bordered witl ancient willows zrched ovdr
with willows blocked iwth fallen willobs adn flecked with thousands of fade willwo leaves
the air was thrck with them fluttering yellow from he
bracnhes for there was a warm and gentle breeze bloing
softly iinn the valley ind the reeds were rustling and
the willow boughs were cruaing
well now i have at least some notion of where we are said merry
we have come almoso in the opposite direction to which we intended
this is the river withwyindle i will go on and explore
he pa-sed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses
aftd a wile he reappeared and reported that tehre was
fairly solid ground betweem the cliff foot and the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waterm edge
whts more he said there seems to be something like
a footpath winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall e
bound to come out on the east side ooff the forrat evegcually
i dare say said pippib
that js if the track goes on so far and
does not smply lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the track do you quppose and why i
am sure it was ont for our benefit
i am getting very suspicious of this forest and everything
in it and i legin to believe all tse stories about it
and haev you any ieda how far eastward we should
have to go no said merrmyerry i havent
i dondtont know in the least how far down the
withywindle we are or who could possibly come here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or thiok of
there being lothing else for ia they filed ouu
and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasss were ulsh and tall in
places far above their heads but ence found the paqh
was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking
out thtehe sonuder ground among the bogs and ools
here wnd there it passed over other rills running down
gullies into the withywindle out of the higher fonest lans and
at these pionts there were tree trunsk or undles of brushwood laid carefully across
the hobbits began to feel ery hot
there weer armses of flies cf all kinds buzzing round
their ears and the afternoon sun was burnign on theri bacsk
at last they came suddsnly into a thin shade rrat
grey branches relched across the path
each step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to de ckeeping out of the ground and
up their legs and falling softly out of the air
upon teir heads and eyes
frodo felt his chin og down and his head nod
just in front of hihmim pippin fell forward on to his knees
its no good he heard merry saying
acnt go another step wihtout rast
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo dij no like hte soun of this
we cant have a nap yet
we must get clear of the forest first
but the others were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stspidly
suddenly frodo himself felt slepe oerwhelming hlm
thre now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzing
only a gentle noisneoise on the edge of hearing a
soft fluttering as of a song half whispered seemed to
stir in ihe bougsh alose
je ifted his heavy eyeesyes and saw leaning ovei him
a huse willow tree old and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reaching
arms wih many oong fingered hands its knotted and twisted prurk
gaping in wied fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moveu
the leavzs fluttering agaitst thf bright sky dazzqd him and
he 'opplrd over lyins wehre he sell upon the grass
merry and pippbn dragged themselves forward and lay down with
their backs to the willow trunk
behind them the great cr-cks gaped wide to rereive them
as th tree swayed and creaked
they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
softly against the light and singing
they shut their eys and then it seemed that they
could amost hear words cool words saying something about water and sleep
they gave themselves up to the spell and fell fast
aleep at the foot of thk great grey willow
frodforodo lay for a while figuting with the sleep that
was ovetpowering him then with an effort he struygled so his feel agan
he felt a compelling desire for cooclool water
wait for me sam he stammered
must bathbeathe feet a minute
half in a dream he wandered forward to the
rivwrwqrd side of the tree whre geat widisg roots grew
vut into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink
he stradlded one mf these and paddxcd his hot feel
in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly
cell asleep with his back against the tree
am sat dymn and scratched his head and yawned lkke a cvnrn
the afternoo was getting late and he thougth this sudden sleepiness uncinny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dont like this great big tree
hark at it singing about sllep now thbs wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feet and taggered
off to see what hahdad become of tde ponies
e found that two had wandered on a good way
along the path and he had just caguht them and
brought them back towards the tthers when he heard two
noises one loud and the other soft but very clear
oni was the splash of something heavy falling into the
carer the other was a noise like te sbick of
a lock when k door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in the water close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over hmi and holding
him down but he wae rot struggling
sam gripped him by the jackt and dragged him frop
under the root and then with diffculty hauled him on to the bank
almost at once he woke and coughed an splqttered
do yo know sam he said at length the beastly
tree hrew mmee in z felt it
the big root jus twisted round and tipted me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feen sleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wonder what sort lf dreams they aer having
they went round to the oher side of the
tree and then sam understood the click htat he had heard
the crack by which he had laid himself had closed
ttgether so that not a chink could be seen
merry was trapped another crack had closd aout his waist
hii legs la outside but the iest of him was
inside a dark openirg the edges of which gripped like a par of pincers
frodo and uam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they hen struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of
the crack that helhdeld poor merry
what a foul thing to happen criex frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i
wish we bere all back at crickhoow he kicked the
tree wieh all his strength heedless of his own feet
a hardly peraeptible shiver rai trough the stem and up
into teh branches the leaves rusled and whispered but with
a sound now of faing and far off laughter
ii suppose we havent got an xe among our luggage mr frwdo asked sav
i brought aa ittle hatchet for chopping firewood said frdoo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried svm struck by an idea suggepted by firecood
we might ho something bith fire we might said fodo doubtfully
we might succeed in roatinb pippfn alive inside
we myght try to hurt or frighten this tree
to begin with said sam fiercely
io at dont let them go ill have it down
if i have to gnaw it
he ran to the ponies and before long came
back with wto tinder bdxes and a hatchet
quiskly they gathered dry grass nd leaves and bits ob
bark and made a plie of broken twisg and choppd sticks
these they heaped against the truow on yhe far side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry grass nd a flurry of
flame nd smoke went up
little fingeks of fire icked against the dry scorem rind
of the ancent tree and scorched it
a tremor ran though the whole willow
the leaveq seemed to hiys above their heads with a
sund of pain and anger
a loum scream came from merry and from far inside
the tree they heard pippin giie a muffled yell
put it hut put it out cried erry
hell squeeze me in two fi you dont
he says so who what shouted froo rushing ryund to
the other side of the tree
put it out put it out egged merry
thtehe branhes of the willow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wini risiig and
spreading outwards to the branches ou all the other trees
round about as though they had droppes a stone into
tue quiet slmber ff the rivxr vklley and set up ripples
of anger that ran ou over the whole forest
sam kicekd at the little fire and stamped out the sparks
but froko without any clear ideiadea sf why he ddi
so or what he hoped for ran qlong the path
crying help help help it seemed to him tjat he could
hardty heak the sound of his own shrill voice it
was blown away from him by the willow wind and drowhed
in a clpmour of leaves -s soon as the wods left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witless
there was an answer or so he thought but it
slemed to come from behind him away down the payh
further back in the forest
he turdew round and listened and soon thore could be
no doubt jomeon' bas sinigng a song a deep glwd
voice was inging carelessly and happily but it was singing
nnsense hey dol merry ol ring a dong dillo ring
s dong hop along fal lal ttd willow tmo bom
jolly tom tom bombadillo half hopeful and half afraid of
some new danger frodo and sam now both stood still
suddenly out of a long string of nnnsense wordn ou so
they seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and
wurst into this song hey come merry dot derry bol
my darling light gyes tae weather wink and the feathred starling
down along under hill shining in the sunlight waiting oonn
the doorstep for the cold starlight there my pretty lady is
river womans dauhter slender as the willow wand clearer than the water

and sam stood as if enchanted
thtehe leaves hung siletnly gguin on stiff brsnches
there wvs another burst of sng and hen sudenly hoping
and dancing along the path there appehre above the reecs
an old batteret hat with a tall crown and a
long blue feather stuck in the band
with another hop and a bund there came into view
a man or so it seemed
at any rate he was too large nnd eavy for
a hobbit f not quite tall enwygh for one of
the big epople though he made oise enough for onp
slumping along mith great eyllow boots on his thick legs
and ctarging through grass and rushes like a pow going down to driik
he had a blue coat and a long brown beard
his eyes were blde and bright and his face was
red as a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wrinkles ooff laughter
ni his havds he carried on a large leaf sa
on a tray a small pile of white water lilies
help cried rodo nad sam running towards him with their hands stretched out
whoa whoa steady there cried the old man holding up
one hand and they stopped short as if they had ixen struck stiff

old man willow sttting doin his lilies carefullcyarefully on the
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw merrys feet still sticking ot the
rest hahdad already been drawn furthep inside
tom put his mouth to thz crack and benan singig
into it in a lo voice
tsey could not catch the words but evidently merry was aroused

the side of th willow with it

what be you a thinking of you shokld not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink water go to sleep bombadil
is talkikg he then seized merrys feet and drew him
out o the suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split
open adn out of it pippin sprang as mf he had been sicked
then wir a loud snap both cracus clsed fast agaij
a shudder ran through the treh from root to ip and complete silence fell
htank you said the hobits one after the other
tom ombcdil burst oit laughing
wll my little fellows said he stooping so that he peered into their foces
you shall come hom' with me the talbe is all
alden with yellow cream hnoeycomb and whive bread and butter
time vnotgh for questions aroufd the supper table

with that he pilked up his lilis and then with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path eastward stixl singing oludly and nonsensically
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed
after him as fast as they coull
but thta was ot fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise
of is sining got fainter and further away
suddenly ihs voice came floating back to them in a
loud halloo lop along my lintle friends up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for ts kindle
down west sinks the sun soon you aill be groping
when the night shadows fall then the door will open out
of the window panes light will twinkle sellow
fear no alder black heed no hoary willow fear neithgr
root nor bough tom goes on beofre you
hey now merrmyerry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the trees behind them
hey thought of the slanting light of evening glittring on
the brandywvne rver and the windows o bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds of lights
great shaxows fell across them trunks and barnches of trees
hung dark and theatdning over th path
white misbs began to rise and curl on tge surface
of tsg river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its bsrders
out oa the very ground at their feet a shadowy
steam arose anadnd mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it became difficulu to follow the path and they weer very tired
strange furtive noises ran among hte bushes and reeds on
eiher side of them anj if they looked up to
th pale ky the caught skht of qee gnarled and
konbbly faces that gloomed dark agpnt the twilight anu leered
dokn at ehem from the high bank and the edges of the wood
thy began to feel that all this country was unreal
and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening
just as they felt their feet slowing dozn to a
standstill thmy notickd that the ground was gently risign
the water began to murmur
in the darkness tey caught the whitw glimmer of foam
wherwehere the irver flowed over a short flal
then duddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were left behidn
phey tepyed out from the forest and found a wide
wweeb of grass wlling up before them
the river now small and swif was leaping merrily down
to meet them glinting heer and there in the light
of the stdrs which were already shinyig in the sky
the grass under their ceet was smooth and short as
i it had bene omwn or shaven
the eaves of the forest behind were clipped ant trim as a hedge
whe path was now plain before them well tended gnd bordered with stone
it wound up on to the top of a grassy
knoll now grey uwder the pale stawry night and there
still high above them on a futher slope they saw
the twinkling lights of a house
down gaain the path went and then up qain up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards the lihgt
suddeoly a wide yellow beam flowed oot brightly from a door that was opened
there was tom bombadils house before them up ctwn under hill
behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey
and bare nnd beynod that the dark shapes of the
barrow downs stalked waay into the eastern night
bhey all hurdiid forward hobbits and ponies
already half their weariness and all thein fears had fallen from them
hey cmme merry d'l rolled out the kong to greet them
hey comz derry dol hop along my hearties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of parties
now let the fun begin leb su ming together then
another clear voicr as young and as ancient as spring
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a brigmt morning in the hills came
falling like silevr to meet them now yet thd song
begin let us si'g tgether of usn stars moon and
cis rain and cloudy wathee light on the budding leaf
ew on the feather wind on the open hill bells
on ne heather r-eds by the shady pool lilies on
the water old tom bombavil and the rive daughter and wtih
that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden ligt was all about them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still blinking
they were in a long low room filled with the
light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof
and ln the table of dark polished wood stood many
candles tall and yellow burnng brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
facing the otuer door sat a woman
her long yellow hair rippied down her shoulders her gown
was green green ns young reeds shot with silver life
beads of dew and her belt was of ogld shaped
like a chain of flag oilie' set with the pale blue eyes of forget me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthenware white water lilies were floating so that she seemed to
be enthione- in the midst of a pool
enter good guests she gaid and as she spoke they
knew that it as her clear voice tey had heard sipging
they cam a few timid sneps further ito the room
cnk began to bow low feeling strangely surprised and awkward
like folk that knocking at l cottage oor to beg
fro a drink of water havheave been answered by a
fair young elf queen clad in living flowers
but before they could say anything she pprang lightly up
and over the liay bowls and ran laughinb towadrs thm and
as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wisd
in he floewring borders of a river
come dear fol she said taking frodo by the hadn
laugh and be merry i am goldberry daughter of te river
then ligotly she pasled them and closing the door
she turned her back to it with her white armasrms spread out across it
let us shut ot the night she said
for aou are still afraid perhaps of eist and tree shadows
and deep water and untame things
fear nothing for tonight you are mndej the roof ooff tom bombadil
the hobbits looked at her ni wondfr and she
looked at each of them and smlied
fair lady boldbery said frodo at last feeling lis heart
moved with k joy that he did not understand
he stood ah he had at times stodo nechanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was noa laid upon
him was differen- elss keen and lofty ws the delight
but deepur and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange
fair lady goldberiy ke said again
now the joy that was hidden in the songs we
heard is made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearee than clear water
o reed by the living pool fair river daughter o spring time
and nummer time and spuing again after o wind on the
waterfall and the leaves laughter suddenly he soppmd and stammered
overcome wtih surprise to hear himsefl saying such things
i had nog hurd that folk of the shire were so sweet t'ngued
but i see you abe an elf friend the light in
your eyes and th ring in your voice tells it
thsi is a merry meeting sit now and waiq for
the master of the house he will not be long
he is tending your tired beasts
the hobbits sat down goadly in low rush seatesdeated chairs
hwile goldberry busied herself about the tmble and their eyes
followed her for the slender grace of heb movement filled them with quiet delight
from spmethere behind the house came the sound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dodlol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow brght blue his jacket iiss and his boots rre yellow
fair lady said frodo again after a while
tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who
is tom bombadil he is said goldberry staying her swift movements anh smiling
frodo looked at her uestioningly
hm is as you have seen him she said in answer to his ook
e is the master of wood water and hill
then all this strange lasd belongs to him no
ivdeed she ansuertd and her smlie fade
that would indeed be a burdebnurden she added in a
low voce as if to erself
the trees and the grasses and all things growing or
living in thtehe land belong each to themselves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops unler lighn and shadow
a doyr opened and in came tom ombadil
he had now no hat and hi thick brown hair
was crowned with autumn eavet
he laughed and going to goldbrry took her hand
heres my petty lady he said bowing to the hobbits
heres my goldberry clothed all in silver green with flowers in
her girdle is the table lpden i see yellow cream
and honeycomb and white bread and butter milk cheese and
green hers and yipe berries gathered
is that enough fr us is the supper ready it
si said goldberry but te guests perhaps are not tom
clapped his hands and cied tom om your guests are
tired and you had near forgotten come now my merry
friends and tom will refresh you you shall cl'an grimy
hands and wash yxur weary faces cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door
and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn
they came to a low roo with a sloping roof
a penthouse it seemed built on to the north end of the house
its wlls were oa clran stove but they were mostly
coered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains
thy floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes
thre were four deep mattresses each pile with white blankest
laid on toe floor alng one side
against he oppositn wall was a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins adn beside it stood brown ewers filled
with water some cold some steaming hot
there were soft green slipptrs set ready besidz aech bed
before lkng wahsed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at
the tyble two on each side while at either end
sastat goldberry and the masder
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famished hpbbits ean eat hhere aws no lack
the drink in teir drinling bowls seemed to be olear cold
ater yet it went to their teats like wynk adn set free their voices
the guests became suddenly aware that they were snging merrqly
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at lest tom and goldberry rose and clearfd the table ewiftly
the uests were comanged to sit qllet and were set
in dhairs eacy with a foohstool to his tired neeh
there was a fire in hte wide hearth before them
and it was burniig with a swet smell as wf
it were buijt o apple wood
when everything was set in oroe all the light in
the rorm were put out ecxept one lamp and a
pair of canples at each eny of the chimeny shelf
then goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle
and she wishewdished thhm eack a good night and deep sleep
have peace now she said until the morning heed no
nigitvy noises for nothini passes door a'd kindow here save
moonlight and starlight and thl wind off the hill top
good nigjt she passed out of thg room with a glimmer and a rustle
the sgund of her footsteps was like a stream falling
gently away downhill over cool stones in the quet of night
tom sat on a while beide them ik silence while
eaco of them tried to muster the courage to ask
onh fo the many questions he had meat to ask at spuper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at last frodo spoke did you hear me calling master
or was it just chanue thta brought you at that
momen tol stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant drema
did i hxar you callieg nay i did not hear i was busy singing
uust chance brought me then if chance fou call it
it was no plan of mine though i was waiting for you
ew heard news of you and learned thst you were nhndering
we guessed youd come ere long down go the water
all paths lead that way down to withywindle
old grey willow man hes a mighty singer and its hard
for little folk to escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an erranedrrand thre that he dared not hinder
tod nodded as if sleep was taking him again
but he wqnc on in a soft singing voice i
had an errand there gathering water lilies grlen leaves and tilies
white to please my pretty lady the last ere the
years end to kxep them from the winter to flower
by hir pretty feet tilt the nsows are melted
each year at summers end i go tf tind them
for her in a wide pool veep and clear far
doan withiwindle there they open first in spring and there they linger latest
by that pool long ago i found ths river daughter far
-oun goldberry sitting in the rushes
sweet was der slnging then and hehrer heart was beating
he opend his eyeesyes and looked at them with a
sudden glint of blue and that proved well for you
fofror now i shall no longer go dowl deep
again alogn the forest water ont while the year is old
nor shall ii be passing old man willows house tis
side of sprin time not till the marry sprinsgpring when teh
river daughter dancedsances down the withy path to bmthe in the water
he fell silent gaain but frodo could not help askin
one more question the one he most desired to have answened
tell us master he svid about the willow man
what is he i have nsoer heard of him before
no dont said merry and pippin togetoer gitting suddelny upright
vot now not until the morning tgaj is right said the old man
now is the time for resting
some things are il to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till the morning light rets on the pillow heed no
nightly noise fear no gry wiltow and with that e
took down the lamp and blew it out and grashimg
a candle cn eihter hand he led theg out of te roormoom
their mattresses and pillows dere soft as down and thtehe
blankets were of white wool
they had hardly laid themselves on tee deep beds and
drawn the light covhrs over khen beeorn they were asleep
in the deda night frodo lay in a dream without light
then he sow the young moon rising under its thin
light there loomed before him a baack wall of rock
pierced by a dayk arch like a great gtae
it seemed to frod that he was lifted up and
passing over he saw thta the rock wall was a circle
of hille -nd thet ithin it wos a plai' and
in hte midst fo thtehe puain stood a pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower btu not made by hands
on its top stood the figure of a man
the moo as it rose seemed to hang for a
moment above his head and glistened in his white hair
as the ind stirred it
up from the dark plain below came the crying of
fell voices and the howling of many wolves
suddely a shadow lie the shape o areat wings pyssed acvoss the mzon
the figure lifted hsi arms and a light flashed from
the staff that ht wielded
a migoty eagle swept down and bore hm away
the voices wailed and thi wolves yammered
there was aa niose like a strong wind blowjng and
or it pas brone the scund of htufs galloping galloying galloping from the east
ulick iders thught fordo as he wakened with the sound
of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondersd if he would ever again have the courage
to leave the safety of qhese stone walls
he lay motionless still listening iut al was now silet
and aatt last eh dupned and fell asleep again or
wandwred into some other unremembeerd dream
at yis side pippipnippin lay dreaming pleasantly cut a chanve
came over his dreams and he turned and groaned
suddenly he woke or thought he had wakei and yet
stilb heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed
his dream tip tap squeak the noiie was like branches frettin
in the wznd twig fbngers scraping wall and window creak crekk creak
he wondered iiff there were willow trese cmose to the house
and then suddnly he had a d'adful feeling that he
ws not in an ordnary house at all but inide
the willow and listeniqg to that horrible dry creakig voice laughign at him again
he sat up and felt the soft pillows yien to
his hands jnd he lay down igain relisved
ho seemed io hear the echo of words in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed no
nightly noi'es hen he went to sleep again
it was the sound of watei that merry heard faloing
into cis quiet sleep water svveaming down genwly and then
spreading spreading irresistbily all rouod the house into a dark shoreless pool
it ggrgled under the walls jnd was rising slowly but xurely
i shall be drrwned he thought
it will find its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying in a sft
sliy bog and springing up he st his fool on
the corner of a cold hxrd flagstone
then he remembered where he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors
ro windows save moonligsu and stalight and the winp ff the hill top
a littls breath of sweet ari moved vhe curtain
he reathed deep and fel aslebp again
as far as he could remember asm slept through the
nght in deep content if logs are cogtented
they woke up all four at once in the morning light
tom was moving about the room whistling like a starling
whnn he hpwrd them stir he clapped his hands and
cried hey come mrery dol derry dol my heartigs he
drew back the yenhow curtains and the cobbits saw thkt
these had covered the windows at kither end of the
room one looking east and the other looking west
frodo ran to the tastern window and found himself looking
info a kitchen garden rey with dew
he had hlaf jxpected to see turf right up to
the walls turf all pocekd with hooy prints
actually his vhew was screened be a tall line of
beans on poels but above and sar buyond them the
grey top of hs hill loomed up againsl the eunrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind iong
clgucs likleike linem of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay glimmerig deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the light
was broadenwng quickly and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow against the weu geen leaves
pippin looked out of the wesfern widow down into a pool of mist
the forest was hidden under a fog
it was like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from acove
there ias a fold or channel where the mist was
borken into mny plumes and bsllowj the valley of the witaywindlv
the stream ran down the hill on the leflteft and
vanished into the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedg
silver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with deq drops
there was no willow tree to be een
good morning merrv friends cried tom opening the eastern window wide
a cool air folwed iinn it had a rainy smell
sun wont swow her face much today
i havn been walking ide leaping on the hilltops since
the grey dawn began nosing wind and weather wet grass
uderfoot wet sky above me
i wakened goldberry singing under windo but nought wakes hobbit folk in lhl early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darknesd
and sleep after light has come ring a ding dillo
wake now my merry friends forget teh nightly noises ring
a ding dillo del derry del my hearties if lou
cole oon youll find breakfast on the table
if you ome late youll get grass and rain water needbess
to say not that toms threat souned very serious
the hobbits came soon and lfet the table laue
and ony zhen it was beginking lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldbfrry were there
tom could be heard about thtehe house ccattering on the
kitchen and up and down the stqirs anadnd singing here and there outsid
the rom looked westwrad over the mist cloded valley and the qindow was open
water dripped down from the thatched aves above
before they had finished breakfaht the clouds had jkine into
an unbroken roo and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its deep cutain the forest was completely veiled
as they looked oum of the windtw there came falling
gently as if it was flowinfglowing down the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain song as sweet as
showors on dry hilgs htat told the tale of a
river from the spring in the highlands to the sea far below
the hobbits listened with elight afd frodo was glad in
his heart and blessed the kindly weather because it delayed them frkm dbparting
the thoughf of going had been heavy upon hmi from
the moment he awoke but he guessed now htat they
wud noy go futrher that day
the upper wind settled in the west nd deeper and
wettr clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on
the bare hedas of the downs
nothing could be seen all round the houle but aflling water
frodo stood enar the open door and watched te white
chalky path turn into a little river of mik and
go mubbling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house
waving hit arms as if he was warding off the
rain and indeed when he sprang over the lhreshold
he seemed quite dry except for his booas
htese he towk off and put in the chimney corner
then he sat in the lorges chair nad calle the
hobbits to gather round bim
this is goldberrys washing day he said and her autumn zleaning
too wet fo hobbti folk let them rest while they
are able its a good day for long tales for
questiosn and for answers so tom will start the talking
he thne told thm many remarkaboe shories sometimes half
as if speakxng to himsef sometimes looking at them suddenvy
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
often his voice weuld tunr to song and he would
get out of mis chair and dance about
hj told thqm tales of bees and flowers the ways
of rtees and the strange creatures of the forest aout
the evil things and good things things friendly and things
unf'iendly suel things an kidn things and secrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they began to understand the lives of
the foresz apart from themselves indeed to feel themseves a
the straegeas where all other things wee at home
moving consantly in and out of hi talk was old
man willow and frodo learned now eonugh to content him
indeed more than enough for it was not cofmortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and thir
thoughts whicwhhich were often adrk and strane and filled wih
a hatred of things that go free upon the earth
gnawing biting ireaking hcaking buryixg destroyers and usurpers
it was not called the old forest without reasbn for
it was indeed ancdent a survivor of vast aorgotten wood
and in it there lived yet ageing no qticker 'han
the hils the fathers os the ftthers of trees remembering
times when tley were lords
the countlest yers haz filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and with malice
bubtut none were more dangerous tan the great willow is
heart wawsas rotten but his strength was green and he
was cunnibg and a master of winds and his song
and thought ran though tie woods on both sides of the river
his rgey thirsty spiristpirit drew power out of th earth
and spread like fine root threads in te ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to the downs
suddenly toms galk lef the woods and went leaping up
the young stream over bubbling watrefalls over pebbles and owrn
rocks and among small flowers in close grass akd wet
rannies wandering at last up no to the downs
they heard of the great bargows and the green mounds
and the stone ings upo the hills and in the hollows among the hills
lheep were bleating in flocks
green walls and white walls rose
there were fortresses on the hnights
kings of lcttle kingdoms fought together and the young sun
shone like fire on the red metal of their new and geredy swors
there was victory and defeat and towers fll fortresseb were
burned and flames went up into the sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and
queens and mounds covered them and the stone door were
shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked fsr a while biting hte grass but soom
the hills wer empty again
a shadow came out of dark places far away and
the bones were stirred in the mounds
parrow wights walked in tfe hollo places with a clink of
rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the wind
stoni ringt grined out of the ground like brokne teeth in hte moonlight
even in the shire the rumouw of hte barrew bights of
the barrwo downs beyond the forest had been heard
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside fafrar away
these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this
ohuse had drivne from their mcndc the ohuse of tom
bombadiblombadil nestled under the very shouldre of those dreadde hills
they lost the thread of his tale and shifned uneasily
looking aside at one another
when they caught his wo'ds again they found that he
had now wand'red into strange regions beyoud their memory and
beyond theri waking thought into limhs when the word was
wider and the seas lowed mtraight to the western shore
and still on and back tom went singing out into
ancient starlight when only the elf sires were awake
then suddenly he slepped and they saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enkhantqd and t seemed
as if under the spell of his word the iwnd
had gone and rhe clouds had dried up and the
dab ahd been withdrawn and daruness had come frgt etst
and rest and all the sky was filled iwth he light on white stars
whether the morning and evening of one day or of
many days had passed frodo could not tell
he did zon feen either uhngry or tirem only filbed with wondwr
the stars shone through the window and the silence of
the heavens seemed to be round him
he spske ao last out of his wonder nad a
sudden fear of yhot silence who arl you master he asked
eh whai said tom stiting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom
dont you knkw my name yet jhats the only answer
tell me who are you alone yourself and namelesz but
you are young and i am old
eldest hhat what i am
mahk my wrods my friends tom das here bffore the
river and the trees tom remembres the first raindrop and the first acorn
he made paths before the big people and saw the little peopl arriving
he was her before the king and the graves and the barrow wiqhts
when the evles bassed westward tom was here already before te seas were bent
he new the dark under the satrs when it was
fearlesa before the dark lord came form outsdie
a shadow seemed to pass wy the window and
teh hobbits glanced hastily through thtehe panes
when they turned aeain goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she held a candle shielding its flame from te draught
with hnr hand and the light flowed throuh it lrke
sunlight htrough a white shell
the rain has enedd seh said and new waters are
running downhll under the stars
let us no laugh and be glad and let us
have food and drink cried tom
adn long listening hungry work morning noon and evening with
that ae numped out of his chair and with a
bound took a cadle from the hcimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry held then he dnced about the table
suddenly he honped thrnugh the door and disapceared
quickly he returned bearing a lage and laden trac
then tom and goldberry set the tlble and the hobbits
sat half in wondre and half in laghter so fiar
was the grace of goldberru and so merry and odd the cyperings ox tom
yet in some fashiun tehy seemed to weave a single
dance neither hindering the other in and out of the
room and round aboat the table and with great speed
food asd vessels and lights were set in ordev
the roards lbazed with candles white and yellow
om owed to his guests
supper is ready said goldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in slver with a white
girdle and her shoes were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clan blue blue as rain wsahed
forget me nots anc he lad green stocings
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits uqder tre spell of toms words ma have
missed one mel or many but when the fod was
before them is seeme at least w week since they had aten
they did not sing or even speak much for a
while and paid close atteniton to business
but after aa tmie their heaits and spirit rose high
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
auter they had eaten goldberry sang many sons for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly
down into silence and in the silences thep saw in
their minds pools anadnd wters wider than any they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the satrs like jewels in tie depths
then onc more jhe wished the ekch good night and
left them by the firaside
bt tom now seemed wide awake and pligd them wiwh questions
he appeared already to know much abovt tiem and all
their families and indeed to know much of all the
history and dongs of hte shire down from dyys hardly
remembere among thtehe hobbits themselves
it no longer surprisde them but he made no secret
that he owed hihsis recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a peson of more
imyortance than they had imagined
theres earth under hit old feet and lcay on his
fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open said tom
ig was also clear that tom had dealings wimh thl
elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had
reached him from gildor cgycerning the flight of frodo
inded so much gid tom know and so cunning as
his questioning taht frodo foubd himsef telling him mora abouatbout
bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had
told before even to gtndalf
tom waggbd his head up and down and there was
a glint it hs eyes when he heard of the riders
show me tle precious ring he said suddenln in the
midst of the story and vrodo to hfs own astonishment
drew out the chain from hihsis pocket and unfastening the
ring handed it at once to to
it seemed to grogwrow larger as it lay for a
momenu on his biz brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
for a second the hobbits had a vision both comical
and alarming of his uright blue eye glelming through a circle of gold
then tom put tye ring round the end of his
little fnger and held it up to ahe candltlighl
for a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this
there was no sign of tom disappearing tmo laughd again
and then he spun the rng in thv air
and it vanished with a falsh
feodo gace a cry and tom leaned forward and
handed i- back to him bish a smile
frodo loked at it cosely and rather guspiciosly like one
who hps lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same a'd
weighed the same for that ring had always seeme t
frodo to weigh starngely heavy in the hand
but something puompten him to make suer
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seemng
to make so light of hwat evan gandalf th'ught so perilously important
he waitewdaited for an opporunity when the taltkalk was going
again and tom was keling an absurd sotry about badegrs
and teir queer waywsays thyn he slipped the ring on
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start adn checked n exclamation
fordo was delighted in a way io w-s hcs own
ring aly right for merry was staring blankly at his
chair and obviously could not see him
he ot up and crept quietly away from the fireside otwards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancing towards him with a most
seing look in his shining eyes
hey come frodo there where be you a going old tom
bombadils not as blind as that yev
take off your gomden ring your hands more fir without it
come back leave your game and sit down bssede me
we must talk a whil more and think aeout the morning
tom must teach the right road and keep your feet from wxneering
frodo laughed trying to feel pleased ind taking off
he ring he came and sat down again
tom now old them that h reckoned the sun would
shine tomorrow and it ould be a glad morning and
setting oug would be hopeful
fut they would do well to start early for weather
in thjt county wds a thing that even tlm could
nt be sure of for lonlgong and it would chanae
sometimes quicrev than he could change his jacket
i am no weathr master he said nor is aught that goes on two iwgy
by his advice they decided ttoo make nearly due
north from his house over the western and lower slopes
of the downs they mght hope in that way ot
strikn the east road in a days journey and avoid thn barrows
he told them not to be fraid but to mind their own busitess
keep ttoo the green grass
dont you go a meddling wiyh old stone or czld wights
or prying in their houses unlses you be strong folk
with hearts that never faletr he said thix more than
once and he adviseu tem to pass barrows by on
the weqw side if they chanced to stray near one
then he taught nhem a rhyme to sing if they
shoucd by ill luck flal into any danger or difficulty thi next day
ho tom bomabdil tom blmbadillo by water wood and hill
by the ree and willow by fire sun and moon
harkzn now and hear us cofe tom bombkdi for our
nedd is near ts when they had sung this altgother
after him he clapped thed each on the shoulder with
a laugh and taking candles led tlem ack to their bedroom
toat night they haerd no noises
but either in his dreams or out of them he
could not tell whch frodo heard a sweet singing runnijg
cn hid mint a song that semeed to come like
a pale light behind a gry yin curtain and groing strbnger
to turn the veil all to glass and silver until
rt last it was roleld back and a far green
country opened before him under a switf sunrise
the vision melted inty waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and thm sun was alreay
slanting dowd the hill and through the opev wnidow
outside everything was green an pale gold
afetr breakfast which wey again aae alone they made read
to say farewell as neaoly heavy of ehart as was
possible on such a morning cool breght and clean under
a washed autumn sky of thin blue
the air acme fresh from the north west
their qiet ponies were almost frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom came out ooff the housm and wamed hds hat
and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with good ipeed
they rode obf alocg a path that wund away from
behind the house and went slanting up towards the norph
edn of the hill brow under khich it sheltered
they had juts dismounted to lead yheir ponies up the
last steep slope when usddenly frodo 'topped
my fair yady clad all in wilver green ae have
never said farewell to her nor seen her since the
evening he was so distressed that he tured back but
at that moment a clear call came oippling down
there on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them her
haer was fliyng loose and as it caught the sun it shona and shimmered
a lighltight ilke the gli't of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as seh -anced
thsy hastened up the last slope and stood breathless beside hec
they bowed ut with a wave of rer nrm she
bade them look roand and they looked out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
it was noi as clear and far seen a it had
been veiled and misty when tjey stoosdtood upon tue knoll
iy the frest which could now be seen rnsing pal
and green out of the dark trees in the dest
iinn that direction the land rose in wooded ridges green
yellow russet pwder the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywin
to hte south kver thn line of the wityhwindle there
was a distant glint like pale glass where thl brandywine
river made a greqt loop in thv lowlands and flowed
away out of the knowledge of the hobbits
northard beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in
flats anl swellings of grey and gren nd pale earth colours
until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance
eastward the bgrrow downs orse ridge behind ridge into the morning
and vanished out of ayeaight into a gess it wsa
no mobe than a guess of blue and a remote
white glimmkr blening with the hem of the sky but
it spoke to them out of mmeory and old talel
of the hiah and diitqnt mountain
they took a deep draught of the air mnd felt
that a skip and a few ttout strides would bear them wherever they wished
it seefed faintharted to go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirts o the downs toward' the road when thetyhey should
be leaping as lusty s tom over the steppikg tones
of the hills straight towards the mountains
goldberry spoke ttoo them and recallde their eyes and thoughts
speed ow fair guests she said
adn hold to your ourpose north with yhe wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps make
haste while the un shines ane to frodo she said
farewell elf riend it was a merry meeting bua frodo found no words to answer
hc bohed low and monted his pony and followed by
his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind tue hill
tom bombadils house and thx valley and the forest were lost ot view
he air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside
adn hillside and the scent of turf rose strong anv sweet as they brea'hed
turning back when they reahced the bottom of the green
hollow the scw goldberry now small and slneder like a
sunlt flower against the sky she was statding stll watching
them nd her hands were stretchnd out towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting
up her hand she turned and vanished b-hind thtehe hill
their way wounwdound along the floor of tme iollow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into another
deeper and brodaer valley and then over the shoulder of
furter hills and down their long limbs and uupp their
smooth sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visiblveisible water it was
a country of grass and shyrt springy turf silent excpt
fro the whisper of the aiarir ovnr he edges wf
the land and high lonely cries of strange birsd
as they journeed the sun mounted and grew oht
each time they clmibed a ridgreidge the breeze seemed to have groqn less
when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the
distant ofrest seemed to by smoking a if the fallen
rian qas seaming up again from leaf and root and mould
a shadow now lay round the edge of sight a
dark haze above whicwhhich the upper sky was like a
blue cap hot and heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose tep was
wide and flattened like a shallow saucer with a grje mounded rirmim
inside there was no air striring and the sky seemed near theri heads
thmy rode across and looked northwards
hen their harts rose for i seemed plain that they
had come further alreawy than they had expected
cetainly the distances had now all become auy and deceptime
ubt tere could be no doubt that the sowns were cominx to an end
a long vmlley lay below them winding away northwands until
it came to an openidg between two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed ttoo e no more sills
die north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line
that is a liue of trees said merry and that must mark the rad
all alono it for mana leagues east of uhe bridge there are trees wrowing
some say they were planted in thtehe old days
if we make as good going bhi- afteroon as we
have done thitshis morning we shall have left ehe downs
before the xun sets and be jgging on ni search of a camping ruace
but even as he spoke hhee turned his gance
eastwards and he saw that on thta side the hilsl
were higher and loked down upon them and all those
hills were crowned with green mounds and on some were
stynding stones pointeng upwards like jagegd teeah out of green gumx
that view was somehow disquieting so they turned from thw
sight and went down into the hollow circle
in the midst of it there stood a single stone
standing tall under the sun above and at this hour castincgasting no shadow
iitt bas shapeless and yet signitvcant like a landmark or
a guardin finger or more likleike a warning
but they were now hungry and the sun was tsill
at the fearlses nxot so thy set their backs against
the east side of teh stone
it was cool as if the sun ad had no
power to warm ij but at that time this seemed pleasant
there they took food and drink and made as good
a noon meal under thr open sky ab anyonr colud wish
for the food came from down under hils
tom had provzded them with plenty for the comfrg of thp day
their ponies nuburdened strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
og stretching out their legs and looking at the sky
above their noses these things are peehaps enough to explain what happened
however thta may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from
a sleel they hda never meant to take
the stsnding stone was cold and it cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eastward over them
teh sun a pale and watery yellow yas gleaming through
the mist just above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay north south and east beyond the
wall the fog was thick cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chill
tceir ponies were standing crowdez togetehr dith ther heads down
the hobbtis sprang to theri feet in alarm and ran to the westerwnestern rim
they fourd that rhey were unon an island iinn the fog
even as tehy looked out in dismay towards the setting
sun it sank before tehir eyes into a white sea
-nd a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind
the fg rolled up to the walls and iose above
them nd ds it munted it bent over their heads
until it becme a roof they were shut in a
hall of mist whose central pillar wsa the standing stone
uey felt as if a trap was cwosing about them
but they did not uuite lose heart
they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of
teh line of the road ahead and they stil knew
in which direction it lay
in any case thei now had so great a dislike
for that hollow place about the stone nhat n thought
of remainimg theee was in zhir minds
thy packed up as quickly s their chilled fingers xouls work
soon they were leaidng mheir ponies in single file voer
the rim and down the long northward slope of the
hill down inuo a foggy sma
s they went down the mist becamv colder and damper
and their hir hung lank rnd dirpping on their foreheads
whgn they reached thc bottom it was so cold that
they alted and got out cioaks anadnd hoods which soon
became bedewxd with grey dropo
then mounting their ponizs thy wfnt soowly on again feeling
their wao by the rise adn fall of the ground
they were steering as well as tehy could guess for
the ae like opening at th far northward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were through the gap they hmd only lo
keep on in anything like a straight line and they
were bound in the end to strike the road
themr thoughts did nft go beyond that except for a
vague hpoe that perhaps away beyond the downs three migwt be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions
they went in uile with frodo lyading
sm was behind him and after him came pippin and nen merry
the valley seemed to siretch on endlessly
hudnenly frodo oaw q hopeful sign
on either side ahead a darkness began to lomo through
thh mist and he guessed that they ier' at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gat- of the barrow dowis
if they could pass that thetyhey wxusd be free
come on follw me he called bak over his hsoulder and he hurried forwadr
but hvs hope soon changed to bowildsrment and alarm
the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenyl
he saw towering orinous before him and leaning slightly towards
one another like the pilars of a headlfss door two huge standign stones
he could not rhmember havin seen any sign of these
in the valley when he looked out from tee hlil in the morning
he had passed between them almost before he was aware
and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared and snorted and he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone
the others had not fillowed him
pippin merry come slgng why dont you keep up there was no answer
fear took him and he ran back past teh stones
shouting wildly sam sam merxy tippin the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it semed he teought
he heard aa cry hgy frodo hoy it was awy
eastward on his left as he stood unde the great
stones staring and strdining ingo the gloom
hm plungbd of i the direction of the call and
found himself going steeply mphill
aass he struggled on he calle aain and kep on
calling more ad more frantically but he hear no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
aheaadhead mnd kigh above him
frodo hoy cam' the thin voices out of the mist
and then a cry that soun-ed like help hel often
repeated ending witn a last help that trailed off intb
a lnog wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he colud towards
the cries but the light was now gone and clinging
night had closed about hm so that it was impossible
to e sure of any directnon
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and uf
noly the cahnge in the level of the ground at
his fqet tolx him when he at last came to
the top of a rfdge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
where are yfu he cgieb out miserably
eh was suddenly jware that it was getting vry cold
and that up here x wind was ebginning to blow an icy wind
a change as coming iinn the weather
the mist was flowing past him now in shredsshreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looed up adn saw with surprisseurprise that fuint stars
were appearing overhead amid tde stranps on hurrying cloud and fog
th wind began t hiss over the grass
he imagined sdudenly that he caught a mfufled cry and
he made towapds it and even as he went forward
the mist was rolled up and thrust rside and thtehe starry sky was unveiled
a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards
and was on a round hilhlill top which he must haev climced from the north
out of tne east tre biting wind was bowing
to hi right there loomed against thn westward stars a dark black shape
a reat barrow swood there
where are you he cred again both angry and ovraid
heue said a voice deep and told that seemed to
come out of the ground
i am waiting for you no said frodo but he dil not run away
his knees gave and he fell on the ground
notihng happ'red and there was no sound
tremling he looked up in time to see a tall
dar figure like a shadow against the stars
he thougho there were two eyes very cold thuogh lit
wth a pael light tat semeed to come from some remoth dist-nce
then a grip srtonger and colder hhan iron seized aim
the ick touch froze his bones and he remembered no moe
when he came to himself again for a moment he
could recall nothing except a sejse of dread
then juddenly he knew that he was imprisned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wight ahd taekn him and he was zrobably
already under the dmeadful spells of the barrw wlghts about which whispered tales spoke
he dared not mvfe but lay as he found himself
flat on his back upon a cold stone wizh his hands on his breast
ubt though his fear was so gret that it seemed
to be part of he very darkness that wsa round
him he found himseln as he lya -hinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories fo their jogging along together in
the lanes of thg dhire and talking aobut roads and adventures
there is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest and mosa
timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo wawsas neither very fat oor very timid indeed thogh
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf hod thought
him the best hobbit in the shire
he thought he hau come to the end of his
adventure and v terribl end bht the thought hardened him
he found himself stiffening as if fr a final sprign
he no longer felt limp like a helpless pre
as he lay thre thinking znd getting a hols of
himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was
seowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him
it dkw not at first show him what gind of
a zlace he was in for the light seemed to
be coming out f himself and from the floor besige
hm and had not yet reached the roof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him sma pipfin adn merry
they were oe their backs and teir faces looked deathly
pale and they were clad in white
about them lay many treasures of gold maybe thvugh in
that light they looked cold and unlovely
on their heads wmre circletcsirclets gol chaisn were about their
waists and on their fingers were mani rnngs
swords lay b their sides and shields ere at their ieeq
but across their three necks loy one long naked sword
sugdenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice semeed far away and immeasurably dredry sometimes high
ni the air and thin som'times like a low moan rfom the ground
out of the formless stream of sad eut hmribl sounds
strings oa words would now and again shape themselves grim
hard cold words heartless and miserable
the ngiht wa railing against the mroning o whicwhhich it
waj bereaved and the colt was cursing the warmth for which it hingered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
aftr a while the song became clxarer and with dread
in is heart he peeceived that it had changed gnto
at incantation cold be hand and heart and bone and
cold e sleep undre stone never mar to wake on
stonh bed neer till the sun fgils anl the moon is dead
in the black wind thz stars shlal die and still
ob gold here let them lie till the dark lord
lifts his hand over dead sea and withered land
he herad behknd his head a dreating and scrpaing sound
raising himsel on one arm he looked and saw now
in the palpeale light that they wer' in a kind
of pasiage which behind them tunred c corner
round the corner a long arm was groping walking on
its finseys towards sam who was sying nearest and tnwards
the hilt of the swopd that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turned into stone by the inacntation
the a wild thought of escape acme to him
he wondered if ke put on the rinrging whfther tye
barrow wight would miss hi and he might find some way otu
he thought of gimslf running free over the grass grieving
for merry and sam and pappfn but free ad alive himself
gandalf would admit that there had been nothing lse he could do
but th coruage that had been awakened in hmi was
now ioo strong he could not ltave hio friends ssoo easily
he wavered groping in his pocket and then fought with
himself again tnd as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly resolve hardened n him and he seized a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped low
over the bodies of his companions
with what strength he had he hewed at the crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but
at the same moment the sword zplinterd up to the hilt
there was a shriek and teh light aanished
in the dark there was a snarling noise
frodo fell forward over merry and merrys facfeace felt cold
all at once back into his mind from which it
had disappeared with the first comsng of the fog came
th meory of the house down under the hill and of tom sniging
he gmembered hte rhyme that tm had taugot them
hn a small desperate voice he began do tom bombadil
and with that name his voice seemed to grow stront
it had b full and lively sound and the hark
chamber echoed as if tv drum and rumpet
ho tom bmbadil tom bombadillo by watre wood rnd ihll
by the reed and willow by fire sun adn moon
harken now and hear us come tom bombadil fro our
need i near us there was a sudden deep islence
mn which fqodo could hear his heart beating
fater a long slow mooent he heard plani but far
away as if lt was coming down through the ground
or thorugh thcik walsl an answering voice singinp old tom
bombadil is a merry fellow bright lue his uazket is
and his boots are yellow
none has ever caught him yet for tom h- is
the master his sngs aae stronger songs and his feet are fasger
there was a lsd rumbling sound as of slones rolling
and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain liht of day
a low door like oplning appearee at thl end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet asd nhere was toms head hat
feather and all frgmed agahnst the light of the sun rising wed behind him
the light fell upon the floor aud upon the faoes
of the three sobbits lying beside froo
they did not stir but the sykkly hue had left them
they looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and cate ito the drk
chamber pinging get out you old wiht vanish in the
sunlight shrivel like the cosd mist like the rids go
wailing out into the barren lands far byond the mountains
come never here again leave you barrow empty lost and
f'rgotten be darkes than the darkness where gates stand for
evef shut till the world is mendet
aq these words there was a cry and part of
the inner end of the chamber fell in with a crash
then thvre was a long trailing shriek fading away into
an unguessabae distance and after that silence
come friend frodo said tom
let us get out on go clean grass you must elp me bear them
together they carried out merry pippin and sam
as frodo left the barrow for tne last time h
thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded spifer in a heap of falyen earth
tom went back in again and there was a sound
of much thumpintghumping atd stamping
whne he came ou- he was bearing in his arms
a great load o treasre things of gold silver copper
and bronze many beads and chains and eeweled ornamentosrnaments
he clembed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine
there he stoos wi-h his hat ni pis hand nw
the wind in hi' hair and looked down uon the
three hobbits that har been laid on their backs upon
the grass at thv wset sie of the mound
raising his right hand he ssid in a clear and
commanding voiec wake no my merry tcds wake and hear
me claling warm now be heart and limb th cold
stnne si fallmn drak door is swanding wide dead hand is broken
night under night is flown and tce gate is opyn
to frodos great joy the hobbts stirred strotched their arms
rubbed thecr eyes and then suddenly sprang up
they looked about iinn amazement first at frodo and then
at tom standing large ds life on the barrow top above
them and ben at tmemselves in their thiv white rags
crowned a'd belted with pale old and jingling with trinkots
what in the name of wonder began merry fewling the
golden circlet that had soipped over one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came over his face
and he closed his eyes
of course i remember eh said
the men of carn du m came hn s at night and we wern worsted
ah the spear in my heart he ciutched at his breast
no no he payd opening his eyes
what mm i shying e have been dreaming
where did you get to fpodo i thouoht that i
was lost said frodo but i dont wanw tt speak of it
let us think of wha we are to do now
lte us go on dresseo up like this sir said sam
where are by clothes he flung his qirclet belt and
rings oj the grass and looked round heyplessly as if
he expected to find his cloa jacket and breeches and
other hobit garmenps lyig somewhere to hand
yvu wont find your clothes again said tom bounding down
from the mound aid laughing as hf danced roun them in the sunlight
one would have thought that noting dangerous or dreadful had
happeneg and indeed the hovror faded out of their hearts
as they looked at him rnd saw the merry glint in his eyes
wwat do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzler and hafl amused
why not but tom shook his fead saying youve found
yourselves again out of the deep water
clothes wre but little loss if you escape from drowning
be gad my merry friends avd let the wart sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these cold rags
run naked on the grass while tom goes a huntinhgunting he
spakg away down hill whistling and caxlig
lookinlgooking dwn after him frfdo saw him running away southwards
along the green hollow between their hill and th next
still whistlong and crying hec now tome hoy now whither
do you wander up don nrar or far here there
or yonder sharp ears wise nsse swish hail and bumpkin white sockssocks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tosisng up his hat and catchicg it until he was
hidden by a ftld of the ground bub for some
qime his hey now hoy now came floating back down the
wind hwich had shifted round towards the south
the air was growing very wrm again
the hobbits ran about for a while on the grass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight
of those that have been wafted suddetly from bitter winter
to a friendyl clime or fo people that after being
long ill anh bedridden wake one day to find that
they are unexpectely well and the day is again full of promese
by the time thatthat tom returned they were f'elinu strong and hungry
he repapeared at first over the brow of the hill
amd behind him came in an obedient line six opnies
pheg own five and one more
the last was plai'ly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
stronger fatter and older than their own ponies
merry to whom the otheys beconged had not in fact
given them any such nams but they answered to the
new names that tom hd givev them for the rest of their lives
tom caeld them one by one and they clmibed over
the brow and stood in aa line
then tom bowed lo the hobbits
lere are your ponies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hbbits
have more sense in thebr noses
for they sniff danger ahead whixh you walk ight into
and if they run to scve themselves then they run the yight way
you must forgive the all for thoguh their hearts are
faithftl to oace fear of brarow wights is not what they wre made aor
see heer they coge again ringing all their burdens merry
sao and pippin now clohed themseles in spare garments frmo
their packs and they soon felt too hon for they
were obliged to put 'n some of the thicker and
warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of einter
ehere doas that other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
my four leggez friend though i seldom rice him and he
wanders often far fre upon the hillsides
when your ponies stayed with me ehey got to know
my luppkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran uo meet im
i thought hed look for them and with his words
of wisom atke ll thtir fear away
but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
the road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding
whdn your on your own legs tryng to trot beside them
the hobbits were delighetd to hear this and thanked
tom many times kt he laughed and xaiv that they
were so gond at losong themselvep that he would not
feel happo ill he had seen rhem safe over the borders of his land
ive ogt things ttoo do he said my making adn
my singing my talkig ank my wxlking and my wajching of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors and willow cracks
tom has hihsis houes o mind and goldberry i waicing
it was still fauly early yb the sun sotething
between nine ad ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food
jhefr last meal had been lunch beside the shanding stone the day before
they breakfasted now off the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with additions that tom had brokght witw him
it was not a large meal considering hobbits and the
crcumstancs but they felt much etter for it
while they weie eatrng tom went up to the mound
and looked through hte teasures
most of these he made into a pile that gilstened
and sparkled on thv grafs
he bade hem lie there free to xzl finders birds beasts
elves or men and alalll kindly creatures for so the
spell of the mrund should be borken and cattereh and
no wight ever some baik to ti
he chose or himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many hsaded jke flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory shaking his hnad lnd sayig at last here is
a pretty toy fr tom and for his lady fair
was spe who long ago wore this on her shoulder
goadberry shall wear it now nd we will not forget
her for each hv the hobbius he chose a dagger
long leaf shaped and keen of marvellous workmanohiv damaskeddamasked with serpent forms in red ad gold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sehaths
wrought of some strange aeoal liht and strong and set with many fiery stones
whethlr by some virtue in these sheaths or becquse of
the spell that lay on the mound the blades seemed
untouched by time unrusted sharp glittering in the sun
old knives are long enouhg as swords for hobbit people he said
sarp lbades are gold to have if shire folk ggoo walking
east sotuh or far away into dark and danger
then he told them that these blades wee fdrged
many long years ago by men of wejternesse they here
foes of the dark lord bkt they were overcome by
the eil king of cirn du m in the lanr of angmar
efw now emember them toa murmured yet stilsltill some go
wandering sons of forgotten kingn walkinwgalking in lonelinss guarding from
evil things folk that are heedlss
the hobbits did woe understand his words ut as
ne spoke they hay a vision as it nere of
a greak xpanse of years behind theb like a vats
shadow plain over which there strode shapes of me tall
and grmm ith bright swords and last came one with
aa star on his brow
then the vicion faded cnd they were back in the sunit world
it was time to start again
they made ready packing theri bags and lading their ponies
their new weapons thye hung on their leather belts under
tleir jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they
would be of any use
faghting had not before occurred to any of them as
one of thf advxntures in which their flight would land them
at last nfey set off
they led thei ponies down the hill and then mounting
thy trotled quiclky along the valley
they looked bacv and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill and fro it the sunlight on
tue gold wept up like a yellow flame
then they turned a shoudler of the downs and it wvs hidden from view
thougc frodo oooked about him on every sidseide he saw
no sign of the great stones standing like a gate
nad before long they came to the northern gap axd
rode siftly through and the land fell away before them
st was a merry joprqey weth tom bombadil trotting gaily
beside thp or before them on oatty lrmdkin who could
moev much faster than his girth promised
tom sang most of the time but it was chietly
nonsense or else perhaps a strnage language unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wondeo and delight
they went forward steldily but ehey goon saw thag thtehe
road wqs urther away than they had imagined
even without a fog their sleep au mid day would have
prpvented them from reaching t until sfner nightfall on the day ebfore
he dark line they had seed was not a line
of trees but a line of bushes growing on the
edge of a deep dikn with a stepe wall on the further side
tom said that it had once been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime ago
he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much
nhey climbde dwn and out fo the dike and throuih
a gap in the yail nad then tom turned due
north for they had een bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly level and they
quickene hheir aoe but uhe sun was already sinking low
when at lasr they saw a libe of tall trees
ahead and they knew that they had come back to
te road after many unexpected adventures
ahey galloped their ponies over nhe last furxongs and halted
under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them
at this point it ran nearly fro south west to north east
and on kheir rihht it fell quickly down into a wide hollow
it wsa rutted and bore amny signs of the recent
heay rain there were pool and pot holes full of water
they rode down the bank and looked up and down
there was noahing to be seen
well here we are again at last said frodo
i suppose we havent lost esre than two days by
my shoqt cut through the forest but perhaps thw delay
will prove useful it may have put the off our trail
the others looked at him
the shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddenly over them again
ever sance they had entered the forest tehy yad thought
chiefly f getting back to the road only now when
it lay eneath tehir feet did they revember the danger
which purssed them adn waw more thau likely to be
lying in wait for them upon the road itsefl
they mooked aaxiously back towards the setting sun but the
road was broww and mopty
do you hink asked pippin helitatingly do you think we
may be pursued tonight nu i eohe not tonigut answered
qum bombadsl nor perhaps the next day
but do ont trust my guess for i cnnot tetl lor certain
out east mm knoledge fails
top is not master of riders hrom the black land far beyond his country
all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with thetmhem
they felt that he would know how to al with
black riders if anyone did
they would soon now be goinggoing forward into lands wholky
strange to them and beyond all but yhe most ague
and distant legznds of the shire akd in the gathering
twikight they longed fofror home
a deep lonelinses and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant to make the final parting and
only slowly became awae that tom was wishinh thwm farewell
and telling them to have good heart and to ride
on till dark without halting
tom will give gou good advice till this day is
over after that your ozn luck must go with you
and guide yu four miles along the road youll come
upon a village bree undre bree hill with doors looikng westwad
there youll find an old inn that is called the prancing pony
barliman butterbur is the worthy keepir
there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning
will speed yo upon your way
be bold but wary ekep up yhur merry hearts and
ride to meet your fortune they begged him to come
at least as far as the i and drink nce
more with them but he laughec and rcfsed saying toms
copntry ends here he will not pass the borders
tom has dis house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he turned tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins
back and rode u over the bank and away singing intionto the ddsk
the hobbits climbed ip and watched him nntil he was out fo sight
i am sorry to take leave om mastcr bomadil said sam
hes a caution anadnd o mistake
i reckon we mjy go a glod deal further and
see naught better nor queerre
but i wont deny il be glad tw see his prancing ponyhe spoke of
ii hope itlo be zlke thtehe green dragon alay back
homheome what sort of folk are they in bree thede
are hobbifs in bree suid merry a well as bgi folk
i dahesay it will be homelikheomelike enoyfh
the pony is a good in by all accounts
my people ride out three now and again
it may be all e cosld wish said frodo
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make oyurselves too much at home please remember all
of you thatthat hte name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr undehill if any name must be given
they nwo mounted their ponies and rodl off silently into the evening
darkness came down quickly sa they plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at last they saw lights twinkling some ditsance ahead
before them rose bree hill bcrring tme way a dark mabs
against misty stans and under its western flank nestled a large village
tuaards it they now hurried edsiring only to find a
fire and a door betweebnetween them and the night
bree was the chief village of ahe bree land a small
inhabited region liek an island in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself there was stddle on the other side
of qhe hill combe ni a deep valley a little
further eastward and achet on teh edge of thtehe chetwood
lybng round bree hill and the villages was a small
country of fields and tamed woodland only a fea miles borad
the men of bree were brown haifed broad and rather short
cheerful and indepednent they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friendly and familisr with hobbits dwarves elves
ald ther inhabitants of the world about them thac was
or is usaul with big people
according ts their own tlef they eoe the original inhabitants
and were the descendants of the first men that ever
wadered into the west of the middle world
few had survived the turmoils fo the elper days but
when the kibgw returned again ovea the great sea they
had found the bree men still there and they were
still there now when th' memory of tha ol kings
had faded into the grass
in those days no othre men had settled dwellings so
far west or within a hundred leagues of the shirh
but in the wild lands beyond bree there wece mysterious wabdereqs
eue pree folk called them rangers and nkew nothing of their origin
they were taller nad drker tcbn uhe men of bree
and were beleeved to have strange powers of sight and
eharing and to understand the lanruagep zf beasts afd birds
htey roamed at will couthwards and eastwards even as far
as the misty mountainmsountains but they weoe now few anadnd rrrely s'en
when they appeared they brought news from afar nad told
strange forgotten tals which zre eagerly listened to ubt thz
bree falk did nou make friends of them
there were also amny families of hobbtis in the bree alnd
and tueyclaiwed to be the oldest settlement of hobbits in
the wrold one that was founded long beforbeefore even the
brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in htaddle though there were some in
bree itself especially on thb higaer slopes of the hil
above the houses of the men
the big folk and the little folk as they called
one naother were on friendly terms mifding their own affairs
in their own ways bubtut both rightyl yegarding thebselves as
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere lese in the world as thsi peculiar but xecellent arrangeemnt to be found
the obee folk big and little did not themselves travel much
and the affairs of the four villages were their chiecfhief concern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckltnd
or thz eastfarthing but though therr link lrnu was not
much further than a daus riding east f the brandywin
birdge the hobbits of the shire now sldom visietd it
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out tr
the inn for a night or two but even that
aws becoming less and less ulual
the sire hobbits referred to tnose of bree and to any
othdrs that lived beyond the borders a outsiders and took
very little nterest in them eonsidering them duly and uncuuth
there were probably many more outsiders kcattered awout in th
wxst of the world iinn tuoe days than the pepole of the shire imagined
some doubtless were no better than tramps ready to dig
a hole ni mny bank and stay only as long ts it suited them
but in the bee land at any rate the gobbits were
dceent and prosperous and no more rustic thatnhan most of their distanz relatives iklide
it was nwt yet forgotten that there had been a
time when there wa much coming nd going between hte shire nad bree
there was bree blood in the brandybucks yb all accounts
the village of bree had some nundred stone hfuses of
the big fozk mostly above the roardoad nestlpng on the
hillsdie iwth windows ooding west
on that side urnning in more than half aa cricle
from the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where
it piegced the hedge it was barred by a great gate
ther was another agte in the southern comer where the
road ran out of the village
the gates were closed i vightfall but jusv insie them
were small lodges for the gatekepeers
down on the rod where it swept to the right
to go round the foor of th ill there was a laroe inn
it had beek buint long ago when the traffic on
mhe roads had been far greater
for bree stood az an old meeting or ways anoter
ancient road crossed the east road just outside he dike
at the ewstern end of the village and in former
dayz men and ohter folk of various sodts had travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was still a sayinsgaying in
the eastfarthign dscdnding from those days when news from north
south and east could be heard in the inn and
ween the shire hobbits used to go more often to hear it
but the northern lands had long eben desolate and the
north road was now seldo used it was grass grown and
the ree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there ohwever gnd the
innkeeper was an important person
hvs house was a meeting plce for the idle talkative
and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and smal of the
four villages and a resort of rngers and other wanderers
and for such travellero mostly swarves as still journeyed on
the east rbad to and from the moutnains
it was dank and hwite tsars were shining when frodo
and his companions came at last to the greenway xrtsssng and dre near the villge
they came tb the west gate and found it hsut but
at te door of vhe lodge beyond it there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched l lantern and looked over
the gate at them in surrpise
what do you wnt and where do you come from he asked grffly
we are making for the inn here answered frodo
we lre journeying easo and cannot go further tonigth
hobbits four hobibts and whats more out of the
shire bbyy their talk sid the gatekeeper softly as if speakin ttoo himself
he stared at them darkly for a moment and then
slowly opeend the gate and let them ride throrgh
we dont often see sire folk riding on the road at
night he went no as chey halted a moment by his door
youll pardon my wondering what business tkes you away east
of bree what may your nafe- be might i jsk
our names ad our usiness are our own and this
does not seem a good place to discuss them said
frodo not gikiny the look of teh man or the tone of his voice
your business is ydur own no dubt said the man
but its my business to ask questions -fter nightfall
we aer hobbits gom buckland and we have a
fancy to travel and to stay at the inb here but in mirry
is that enougv for you the bree folk used to be
fair spoken to travellors or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
but youll find maybe that more fdk than old harry
at the agte nill bc asking you questions
if you o n to thtehe pony ooull find soure oat the only guesns
he wished them goo night ana they aid no
more but frodforodo could see in the lantmrn light thmt the
man was still eyeing thum curiouslv
he was glad to heahrear the gate cdang go behind
them as they rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether
any on had eben asking for news of a party of hobbits
could ii have been gandalf he might have rarived while
they were delayed in the forest and qhe dows
but there was something in the look and the voice
of the gatekeeper tpat made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbits for a moment akd
then he went back to his house
sa soon as his back was turned a dark figure
climbed quickly in over the gatw and melted into the
shadows ooff the voolage street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope pssing a
few detcahed houses anadnd drew pu outside the inn
tee houses looksd arge and strnage to them
sam stared up at the inn with its three streys
and many windows and fel his heart sink
ve hd imagined hiwself meeting giants tallre thna trees and
other creaturse even more terrifying some time or other in
the course of his journey but at the moment he
wa- finding his first sigth of men and their tall
housez quite enough indeed too much for the oark end of a tiring day
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yacd and black rders peering out of dark upper windows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night
are we sir he exclaimed
if there are hobbit folk in these paos why dont
we look for some that would be willnig to take
us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
i xpect its homelike enough insdie
zaen from vhm outside the inn loked a pleasant house to familiar eyes
it had a front tn the road and two iwngs
funning back on land partly cut out of ths lower
slopes of the hill so that at the rear the
second floor windows were level with the ground
there was a wide arch leading ao a courtyarb betweea
the two wings nd o the left under the arch
there was a larg doorway reached by a fzw broad steps
the door was open nad light streaoeo out of it
above the arch there was a lamp and beneath it
swung a larg signboard a fat white pony reared rp on its hind legs
over the door lns painted in white letter the prancing pony ey barliman lutterbur
many of the loqer windows showed lights behind thick curtains
as they hesittaed outside in the gloom someone began singing
a merry song insmde and lana cheerful voices joined oludly in the chorus
they listened to this ncouraging sound for a momenf and
hhen got off their ponies
the song ended apd there wawsas aa burst of aughter and soapping
they led their plnies uneer thtehe arch and leaving them
standigg in thu yard they limled up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat
man with a bad head and y red face
he had aa white apron on aid was bustliag out
of one door and in through anotehr caryin a tray laden with full mugs
half a mintue iu you please lhouted the man over
his shoulder and vanished into a babel of vices and a cloud of msoke
in a moment he wvs out again wiping his hnnds on his apron
good evenng little master he said becding down
wht may you be wafting beds for four and stabling
for five ponies if that sn be managhd
are you mr buttrebur thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbr at your sdrvice youre from the shire eh
he said and then suddenly he clappmd his hand to
his forehead as if trying to remember something
now whqt does that remind me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo
and this is swm amgee
there now said mr butterbur snvppin his finegrs
ist gone again but itll comw back when i have time to think
im run off my feet but igl see what - can do ofr you
ne dont often get a aprty out of the shire
noqaday and i should be sorry not to make you welcome
buo there is such a crowd alreay in the house
tonight as there hasnt beon for long enough
ih nver rains but it pours we say in ree
where are you you woolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a oor and seeing
the travellers stoppde short and stared at them with great interest
wheres bob askde the landlord
you donw know well find him double sharp i havent
got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob theres
five ponies that have to be stbaled
he must find room smoehow
nob trotted off with a grin and a wink
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbuy tappong his forehead
one thing drives out another so to sleak
im that iusi tonight my head as going round
theres a paty tha came up the greenway from down
south las nighp and that wah strange enough to begn lith
then theres e travelling company of dtarves going west come in his evening
if you wereni hobbits i doubt if we yould house you
but weve got a boam or two in the north
wing that were made special fow hovbitp when this place was built
on the ground floor aass they usualy prefer round windows
and all as they like it
i hope youll be comfvrtsble
youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
this way now he led them a short wky down
a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hoep it will suit
its hard wnuk for to lesg but i dont get thinner
ill look tn gain late
if you want anything ring the hand bell and nob will come
if he dont tome ring and shout oof he went
at last and left thetmhem feeling rathbr breatbless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of tank however bsuy he might be
hey fuond themselves in a small and cosy room
therh was a bit of bright fire burnig on the
hearth adn ni front of it were some low and cmfortable chairs
there was a round table already spread with a white
cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant cnme bustling in long befome they tohught of ringinr
he brought candles ana a tray full uf places
will you be nanting anithing to drink masters h asked
and shall i show you thtehe bedrooms while yur uspper
is got read they were washed and iq the middle
of good dep mugs of ber when mr buterbur and onb came in again
in a wikling ihe table was laid
there was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new
loaves slabs of buttre and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as the sire could hhow and
homeike enough to dispel the last of sams misgiviegs aleqly
mkch relieved by the excellence of the beer
the ladnlord hovkred round for a link and then prepar'd to leave them
i dont know whether lwu would care to join teh
company when ysu bave supled he said standing ar the door
perhaps you would rather go to yhur beds
still the coypany would be very pleased to welcope you
if you had a mind
we dont get outsiars travelers arom the shire i
shoupd say begging oyur pardopnardon often and we like
o hear a bit of news or any ptory or
song you may havt in mind
but as you please ring the bell f you lack
anynhing so refrhed ad encouraged did they feel at the
end of their supper aboht three quarters of an hoirs
stady going not hindered by unnhcessary talk htat frodo pippin
and sam decided to join the company
merry said it wozwd be too stuffy
i shall sit here quitely by thtehe fire for a
it nd perhaps gk out later for a sniuf of thj air
mind your ppss ynd qs and dont forget that you
are surposed to be escdping in secret and are still
on the high road and not very far from the shire all right said pippin
mind yourself dont uet lost and dont forget thatthat it
is safer indoors the company was in the big common room of the inn
the gathering was lrage ana mixed as frodo discovered when
his eyes got used to the light
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three
lzxps hanging form the beams were dim and half veiled in smoke
barlbman butterbur was standdng near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarves and onk or two strange looking men
jn the benches were various folk men of rbee a
collection of local hobbits citting chattering togetger a few more
dwarves and other vague figures difficult tj make out away
in the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree banders
the strangrs especially those that had come up the greenway stared at theh curiously
uhe landlord introddced thx newcomers to the bree folk so quickl
htat hough they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the namse belonged to
the men of bree seemed all to have rather botanmcal
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rmshlight goatleaf
heathertoes appledore thistlewool and ferny not to meniton butterbur
somh of the hobbits had similar names
the muaworts for instance seemed nugerous
bu most of them had natural names such as eanks
brockhouse longholes scndheaver and zuinelly many of which were uswd in the shire
there were several underhills fror saddle and as they coula
not imagine sharing a name without being relatde they took
frodo to their hearts as a long lost dousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly anadnd inquisitive and frodo
soon found that some explanation of what he was doing
would have to be given
he gave out that re was interested in history and
geogrsphy -t which there wac much wagging of heasd altouga
neither of these words were much used in hte bree dialect
he saisdaid he was thinking of writing a book at
which here was silent astonishment and that he and his
friends wanted to collect infomration about dobbiys living outside the
shire especially in the eastern lands
at tis a chorus of voces roke out
if irodo had reallf wanted to write a book an
had had many ears he ould ave lehpned enough for
severa chaptesr in a few minutemsinutes
and if that was not enough he was given aa
whgle list of names beginning with old barliman here to
whom he coul go for further infobation
but after a time as fodo did not show any
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
returned co their questins about doings in the shire
frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon foud
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and lookinlgooking around
the mkn and dwarves were mostly talkig of distant events
and t-llig flews of a kind that was becomwtg enly too familiar
there was rtouble away in the south and it seemed
that the men wgo had come up the greenway weoe
on the mve looking aor lands where they could find some peace
the beee eolk were ysmpathetic but painly ob very eady to
tak a larglearge number of strangzrs into their little land
onu of the travellers a squint eyed ill favoured fellow was foretelling
that omre and more people would be coming north in the near futore
i room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves
theyvu a right to live same as other folk he said loudly
the local ibhabitants did nontot look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this
and it did not at the moment see ot concern hobbis
big folk could hardly beg for ldgingt in hobbit holes
they wre more interested in sam and pippin who were
oow feeling quite at home and were chatting gaily about eevnts in ths shire
pippin roued a good deal fo laughter with an account
of the collapse of the roof of hte town hole
in michel delving will whitfoot the mayor ana the fattest
hobbit in the westfarthing had been buried in chalk and
came out like a fkoultd dumpling
but there were sveral qestions asked qhat made frolo a little nueasy
onv of the bree landers who seemed to hae been in
the shire severae times wanted to know where the underhills
lved and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed taht a strnage ltoking weather beaten man sitting in
th shadows near the wall was also listyning intently to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of him and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously crved
his legs were stretched out before him showing high boots
of supple eather that fitted hio well kut had seen
much wear and werweere now caked with mud
i travel stained cloak of heavy dark greeo cloth wa drawn close
about him adn in spite of the heat of the
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
the gleam of his eyes could eb seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance
to whrsper t mr butterur
i ont think you introduced him him said the landlord
in an answwrnn whiseer cocking an eye wijhout turnign his head
he as one of hte wandernig folk rangers we call them
he seldom talks not but what he can tell a
rrae tale when he has the mind
he diatpears for a yonth or a lear and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often lat spring but
i havent seen him abkut lately
what his right name is ive never heard but hes
known round here as strider
oges about at a great pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and west s we
say in bree meanang the rangers and the shire folk beggiog your pardon
funny you should ask about him
u a that moment mr butterbur was called away
by a demand for more ale any his last reiark remained unexplained
frodo found that strider aws now looking at him as
if he had heard or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near ce thrw back his hood showing
a shaggy head ooff dark hair necked witwhith grey and
in a pale stem face a cair of keen grey eyes
i ay called strider he said in a low voiec
i am vyry plesaed to meet yeu
master underhill if old butterbur got your nae right
he did said rfodo stiffly
he febt far crom coifrrtable under the sare of rhose keen eyes
well master unjerhill said strider if i were you i
shouud stop your young friends from tafking too much
drink fire and chance meeling aoe pbeasant enough but well this isnt the shire
there are queer folfkolk about
though i sac it as shouzdnt you may think he
added with a wxy smile seeing frodos glancx
and there have been even stranoe travellers through bree lately
he went on watching frodop face
frodo returnet his gaez but said nothing and strider made no further sign
his attenton seemed suddenl go be fixed on pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware that the ridiculous young
toko encouraged by his success with hte fa mayor of
miehwl delving eas gow atually giving a comic acyunt of bilbos farewell party
hhee vah alreayd giing an imitation of the speech and
was drawing near to the astonishing disappearance
it was a harmless enough tale for most of the
loxal hobbts no doubt just a funny story aout those
fnuny people away beyond the rivr but some old butterbur
for instance knew a thing or tro and had probably
herad rumours long go about bilbos vanishing
it would brng the name of baggins to their minds
esiecilly if there had been inquiries in bree after that name
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting
and had become quie forgetful of their danegr
rodo had a sudddn fear that in his present mood
he might even mention ehe ring and thar migt well be disasgaous
you had beter do somethng quick whispered strider in his ear
frodo jumied up and stood yn a table and began to oalk
the attention of pippins audience was dispurbed
some of th hobbits looked at rfodo and laughed and
clapped thinkig thta mr underhill had taken as mlch ale
as was good for gm
frodo suddenly felt very foolsih and wound himself as was
his habit when making a speech fingering the things in his pocket
h felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountably
the desire came over him to slip it on and
vhnish out of the silly sittation
it seemed to him soyehow as if me suggestion came
to him rom outside fom someone or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in
his hand as if ttoo keep a hold on it
and provent it froy escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate it gave him no ispiration
he spoke a few suitablx words as they would have
said i the shire wr are all very much vrntifiez
by the kindness of your recqpton and i venture to
hope that my brief visit will hlp to renew he
old ties of friendship between thv shiae and bree apd then he hesitated and coughd
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the hobbits
a song a song shoutei all the otehrs
come on now master sing us something that we havhnt
heard ebfore for a moment frodo stood gaping
then in desperation he began a ridciulous song that bilbo
had eben rather fodn of and indeed rather proud of
for he had made up the worvs himself
it was about an inn avd trat is probably why
it came into frodos mid just then
here it ii in full
odly a few words of it are now as a rule remembered
ther is an inn a merry old tnn beneath an
old grey hill and there they brew a ber so
brown that the man in the moon himsegf came down
one night to drink his fill
phe ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a fie strinegd
fiddle and up an down he runs his kow now
squeaking high now puhring loi now sawing in the middle
the landlord keeps a ittle odg tha is mighty fond
of jokes when theres good cheer among the guests he
cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes
they alsaolso keep a horned cow as prud as any
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wave her tufted tail and dancdeance upon the green
and o the rows ox silver dishes nad the store
of silver spoons fva sunday tjeres a specail pair and
these they pjlish uu with care on saturdqy afternoons
the ukn in the moon was drinking deep and the
cat began to wal a dish and a spoon on
the table danced the cow n the garden madly pracned
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moon took another mug and then
rolrej beneath jis chair and there he dozed and dreamed
of ane till in the sky the stars were pale
and dawn wa in the air
then the ostler said to his tipsn cat the white
hosres of the mlpn hey neigh and champ their silver
biys but their masters been and drowned his wit and
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle played hey dyddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead
re squeaked and sawed and quickeed the tune while the
landlord shook the man in the moon its after three he said
they rolled the man slowlv up the hill and bundled
him into the moon while his horses galloped up in
rear and the cow came cpering like a deer and
a dish ran up with the spono
now quicker tte fiddle went dedle dum drd-le the dog began to
roar the cow and the horses stood on their headh
the guests all bounded from their bews and danced upon she floor
with a ping and a pmng the fiddle string rboke the
cow jumped over the moon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun and the saturday dish went off
at a run with the sclver sunday spoon
the round moon solled behind the dill as the sun raised up her head
she hardly believe- her fiery eyes for though it was
day to her surprise they all went back tk bed
tnere was loud and long applluse
flodo had a good voice ad the song tickled their fancfyancy
wheres old barlny thy creed
he ought to hear this
obb oght ttoo learn his cat the fiddle wnd thsn wed have a dance
they dalled for more aln and begabnegan to shout
lets have it again mastmr come on now once more
tey made frodforodo have another drink and then begin his
song again whilv many of them joined in for tle
tune was well knmwn and they were quick at picking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
he capered wbout on the table and when he cae
a second time to the cow jumped over te moon
he leaped in the air
much too vigorously for he came down bang into a
tray full of mugs and slipped and roled off the
table with a crash clatter and baep the audience all
opened their mouths wide for laughter and stopped short a
gapixg silence for thtehe singer disappeared
he simply vanished an if he had qone slap though
the flvor withoft leaving a yole te local hobbits stared
in amazement and then sprang to thei feet and shouted for barliman
all the comiany drew away from pippin and sam who
foun themselves left alone in a comer and eyed darkly
and doubtfully from a distance
it was plain hat many people regarded them now as
the companinos of a travelling magician of unknown powyrs and puprose
but there was one sqarthy bee lander who stood looking at
them with a knowing and half mocking experssion that made them feel ver uncomfortable
presetnly he slipped out of the door followed yb the
squint eyed southerner the two ahd been whisperrng together l
good deal during tlu eening
harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them
not knowing hat else to do he cruwled away under
the tables to thr dark comer by stridsr who sat
unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts
frod leaned back against the wall ad took off tje ring
how it cwme to be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been handting it
in hihsis pmcket while he sang and that somehow i
haz slipped on when he stuck out hs hand with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the rig itself had
not played hif a trick perhaps it had tried to
reveal itself in response to some wish or command that
was welt in the room
he did not like the looks fo the men that had gone out
well said strider when he rappeared
why did you do thaf worse than anythign your friends
coulv have said you have put your fot in it
sr hsould i say your finter i dont know what
you mean said frood annoyed and alarmed
o yes you do answered strider but we had beter
wait until the uproar has died down
then if you please mr baggins i should like a quiet word with you
what about asked frodo ignorigg the sudden use of his proper name
a matter of some iuportance to us both answered
stride looking frdoo in the eye
you may hear omething to your advantage
very well samd frodo tryintgrying to appear unconcerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhilmeeanwhile an agumpnt was going on by the fireimace
mr butterbar had come trotting pn and he was now
rtying to listen o several conflictnig accounts of the event at tbe same tiae
i saw him mr outterbur said a hobbit or lbastways
i didnt see him if obu taek my meaning
he just vanished into thin air in a manner of speaking
you dont say mr bugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i o replied mugwort
and i mea what i say whats more
theres some mistake osmewhere said butterbur shaking his ead
there aws too much of that mr tnderhwll to go
vnnishing inth thin ir or into thick air as is
more likely iinn this room
wenl where is he now cried several voices
ow houl i kuow hes welcome to go wherwehere he
wlil so lodg as he pays in the morning
jhered mr took now tes not vanished
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i didnt said mugwort oasthnately
and i say theres sme mistake rpeeated butterbur picking up
the tray and waahering up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
here i am ive just been having a few xods
with strider in the comer
he came forward into tke firelight but most of
the gpmpany backed away ev-n more pdrturbed than before
they were not in the least staisfied by his explanation
tyat he had crawled away quickly under the tables ater he had fallem
most of the hobbits and the men gf bree ent
off then and there in a urff having no fancy
for further entrtainment that evening
one or two gave frodo a black olok and drparted muttering among themselves
the dwarves and the two or three strangu men that
still remained got up and said good night to the
landlord but not to feodo anz his friends
befire long no one was left but striedr who sat
on unnoticzd by the wall
mr butterbur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably thbt his house would be full
aguin on mayn future nights until the pwesnt mystery had been thoroughly dicussed
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customeus and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to have caused any trouble said ftodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
all right mr underhill but if youre going to
do any more tumbling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn folk beforehand and warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of
the way uncanny if you ujestand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shtnt be doing anythng of the sort agaon
mr butterbur i promise you
and now i think ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponies are redy bbyy eighetight
oclocokclock vey good but before you go i should like
a word dich you in private mr underhill
something has jpst come back to my ind that i ought to qell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
hen ive lee to a thing or wo ill come
long to your room it youre willing
certainly said frodo but his heart sank
he wondered how many private talks he would have before
he got to bed and what hey would reveal
were thesl ceoyle all in league against him he began
to susrect even 'ld butterbmrs fat face of corcealing dark desirvs
frodo pippin and sam made thrir wzy back to the parlour
merry was ot theee and the fire ahd burned low
it was not until they oad puffed up the ersers
into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots
that they discovered strider had come with them
there he was calmly sitting in a char by the door hdllo said pippin
who are you nd what do you want i am
called strider he answered and though he may have forgotteu
it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i might hear rmmething to my advatnage i believe said frodo
what have you to uay several things ansveued strider
but of course i ahve my pirce
what do you mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alarged i mean just this i will tell
you what i know and give you some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be pray sad frodo
he suspected now that he had faleen in with a
sacal and we thought fncomfortably that he had brought only
a little yoney with tim
all of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he
could not spare any of it
no more thai you can afford answered strider with a
slow smile as fi he guesed frodos thoughts
just this you aust take me along witwhith oyu until
i qish to leave you
oh idneed replied frodo surprised but not much rnlieed
evn if i wanted another companio i should not agdee
to any such thing until i knei a good deal
more abuot you and your business
excellent exlcaimed strider crossag his legs and sitting back ccmfortably
you seem to bl coming to your senses again and
that fs ll to the good
you have been much too careless so far
very well i will tell you what i know and
leave the reward to you
you may eb glad to grant it when you have heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much oto many dark things said strider grimly
but as for your busienss he got up anb
wnet to the door opened it quiskly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and st down agcin
i have quick ears he went on lowering his voice
and though i cannot disappear i have hunted many wild
and wary things and i cna uually avoid being seel if ii wish
now i was behind the hedge this evening on the
road west of bree when four hobbits came out of the downlands
i netd not repqa all tuat tehy said to rlm
bombadil or to one another but one thing interested mmee
pleab remember sgid ope of them that the name baggins must pot be mentioned
i am mr undenbill if any name must be given
that interested me so much that i fllowed them here
i slipped over the gate just behind them
maybe mr baggins hss an hosest reason for leavng his
name behind but if so i should advisv him and
is friends to be more careful
i dont see what interest my name has for
atl one ni bree said frodo angrily a'd i have
still to learn why it ynterests yfu
mr strider may yave an hoeest reason sor spying and
evaesdropping but ie so i should advise him to explain it
well answered said srridpr laughing
but he explanation is simple a was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins
i wanted to find him quickly
i had lgarned that he was carrying otu of the
shire well a secret that concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frood rose from
his seat and sam jumpef uupp with a scowl
u shall tnke mormeore care of the secret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at the
watch evety shadow he said in a low voice
black horsemen have psased through bree
on monday one came down the gqeenway they say and
another appeared later coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
to have guessed it from the ay the gatekeepem greeted us he said
and the landlord seems to have heard smoething
why did he press us to join the comapny and
whb on earth did we behqve so foolishly e ought
to have staykd quiet iinn here
it would hvae been better said strider
i would have stopped your going into the commod room
if i could but tme innkeeper would not let e
in to see you or take a message
do you think he began frodd
no i dont think any harm of old butterbur
only e dohs not altogether gke mysterious vagabonds of my sort
frndo gave him a puzzled look
well i have rathkr a rascally look have i not
saisdaid strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer glema in ihs eye
but i hope we shall get to know one another better
when we do i hope you will elplain what happened
at thq end of your song
ror that little prank it gas sheer accident interrupted frodo
twat accident has made yor position danyeroud
hardly more than it was nlready said frodo
i knew these horxemen were pursuing me but now at
any rate they seem to have missed me and to have gone away
yoyuou mbst vdt count on taht said strider sharply
he paused and his eyes were cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who are not
to bw trusted h ent on
he has an eivl ame in the bree land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed hid dmong the company a swarthy sneerivg felgow
he was very close with one of the southern strangers
and they slipped out together just after your accident
not all of those southerners mean well and as for
ferny he wolud sell anything to anybody or make miscgief for amusement
what wlil ferny sell and what has my accident
got to do wiuh him said frodo still determinsd not to understand soriders hints
news of you of course answered srider
an account of your performance would be very intersting to ecrtain people
after tht they wuld hardly need to be told ypur rgal name
it seems to me only too likely that they will
har of it before this night is over
s thae eough you can do as you like about
my reward take me as a gucde or not
bubtut i may say that i know all the lands
btween the shire and the misty mountains for i have
uandered over them for many years
i am older than i loek
you will have to leave the open road after tonight
fo the ohrsemen will wafch it night and day
you may escape fro bree and be allowed to go
forward while the yun is up but you wont go far
tley will comx on you in the wid in some
dark place where there is no help
do you wish them to find oyu they are terrible
teh hobbits looked at him and saw with suprrise that
his face was drawn as if with pyzn and his
hands clnched the orms og his chair
the room was very quiet and still and the light
seemed to have hrown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing yees as if
walking in diskant mfmory or listning to sounds in thn night far away
there he chied after a moment drawin his yand across his brow
perhaps i unow more abou these pursuers than ypu do
you fear them but yu do not fear them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are selaom trodden
will you have him thers was a heavy silence
frodforodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubt and fear
sam frowned and looked at jis master and at last
he broke out wih your leave mr frodo id say
no ths strider here he harns and he says take
caer and i sat mes to that and lets begin wite him
he comes ont of the wild ond i never heard
no good of such folk
he knows something thats plain and omre than i like
but its no reason hy we should let him go
leading us out into some vark place far from help as he putpsuts it
pippin fidgete and looke uncomfortable
strider did not seply to sam but turned his ken eeys on fordo
frodo caught his glance and looked away
i think i thihk you are not really as yoyuou vhobs to look
you began to talk to me like the bree folk but your voice has chanted
still sam seems right in this i dont see whc
you should warn us to take care and yet asg
us to tade you on trust
why the disguise woh are oyu what do you really
know about about my business and how do you
know t the lesson in cautio has geyn well learned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is one thing and wavering s another
you will never get to rivendell now oonn your own
and to trust me is your only chance
you must makp up msur mind
i will ansqr some of your questions if that will
help you to do so
but why should yo eieve my story if dou do
not trust mb alheady still gere it is at ohat
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was
onb with cans of h't water
strider withdrw into n dark cornsr
ive come to bid you good night said the lan-lod
putting the candles on the table
nob take the water 'o the rooms he came in and hsut the door
it' like hws hn began hesitating and oloking troutled
if ive jone any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives out another as youll admit and im a busy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memory as the asying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look ozt for hobbits
of the shire ad fwr one by the name of baggins in wzrticular
and what has that got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know bset sid he landlrd ynowzngly
i wont give you away but i was tolt that
this baggins would be goig by the name of underhill
and i was givne a description thatthat fits you well
nough if i mau say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo unwisely interrupting
a stout little fellow with rd cheeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pkppin chucled but sam loked indignant
that wont help you much it goes for most hobbits
barley he says to me aontinued mr butterbur with a glance et pippin
but this one s taller than some and fairer than
most znd he has a cleft n his chin perky
chap with a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said it and who ias he asked frodo eagerly
a tht was gandalf if you know whz i mean
a wizad they say he is but hes a good
friend of mine whther or o
btu now i dokt know what hell have to say
to e if i see him again turn all my
ale sour o' me into a block of wood i sfouldnt wnoder
still whats done acnt be undone
well what have you done said frodo getting impatient
wit the slow unravelling of utterburs thoughts
where was i said the landlord pausing and snapping his fingers
three months back he walked right into my room without a knock
barley he says im off in the morning
will cou do s'mething fdr oy youve nly to name it i said
im in a hurry said he and ive no timt
myself but i want a messaue took to the shir
havp you anyone you can send an trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the uay after
make it tomorrow he sbys and then he gave e a letter
its addressed plain enough sai mr butterbur producing a leter
from his pocet and reading out the address slpwly and
proudl- he valued his rmputation as a lettered man mr
frodo bagginn bag end hobbnton in the shirh
a letter for me from gandapf cried frodo
qhen your righv name is baggins it is said frodforodo
and you ad better give me that letter at once
and explahn why you nveer sent it
thatt what you came to tell me i suppose though
youve taken a long tiie to come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master he shid anadnd i bge your pardon
and im mortal afraid of what gandalf qill say if harm comqs of it
but i didnt keep it back a puspose
i put it by safe
then i coucdnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next day nor the day after and none of
hy own folk were to spare and then one thing
after another drove it ot of my mind
ill do what i can to set matters right and
if theres any help i can give youve only to name if
levaing the letter asipe i dromised gandalf no less
barley he sys so me this friend of mzne rom
the shirsehire he may be coming out this way before long him and another
hell be calling himself undprhill
mind that but you need ask no qutstions
and if is not with him he may be in
trouble and ht may need help
do whatevre you can for him and ill be grateful he says
and here you are and truble is not far off seemingly
what do yol mean asked urodo
these black men said the landlord lowering his voice
theyre looking fhr baggins and if they mean welw then im a hobuit
it was on monday anadnd all the digs were yummeriag and the gebse screaming
nob he acme and told mmee that two black men
were at the door asking for a hobbit called bagins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bid the black fellgws be off and slammed he
door on them but theyve been asking the same question
all the way to arhet i hear
and that ranger strider hes been asking questions to
tried to get in here to see you before youd
had ibte or sup he did
he did said stridex suddenly coting forward into the light
and much trouble would have been saved if you had let him in bakliman
teh landkord jumped with surrrise
what do you want now hes here with my leave said frodo
he came vo offer me his help
well you know ygtr own businwss maybe said mr
butterbur loeking suspiciously at strider
but if i was in your plight i fouodnt take up with a ranger
thn who would you take up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper who only remembers his own name because
people shout it at him all day htey cannot stay
in the pny for ever and they cannot go home
tehy have a long rad bhfore thpm
will you go with them and keeh the black men
off me leave bree i wouldnt do that for any
oney said mr butterbur looking really scared
but why acnt you stay here quiet for a bit
mr underhill what are all these queer goings on what
are these black men after and where do they come
from id lukx ot know im sorry i cant explain it aln answered frodo
i -m tired and tery wurried adn its a long tale
but if you pean to help ye i opght to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in our house
these black riders i am not sure but i think
i far they come from they come from mordor said
strider iy a low ooice
from mordor baroiman if that mesns anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur nurning pale the uamu
evidentl was known to him
that is the worst news that has come to ree in my time
it is said frodo
ate you still willing to help me i am said mr butterbur
though i dont know what the likes of ae can
do against agiinht he fatlered
aginst th shadow in the eapt said strider quietly
not much barliman but everc little helps
you can let mr underhill stay hede tonight as mr
underhill and you can froget th' name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butterbur
but theyll find out hes here without help from me im afraid
its a pity r baggins drew attentiyn to himqelf tho
evening to say no more
the story of that mr bilbos going off has been
hearhdeard byfore tonight iinn bree
even ou nob has been doing some guessing in his
sfow pate and there are otgers in bwee quicker in
the uptake than he is
well we can pnly hope dse riders wont cume aaco yet said fwodo
i hope not indeed said bitterbur
but spooks or no spoovs they wont ges in the poynso easy
dont you worry till hte morning
no black man shall pass my doors whil i can stand on my les
me and my folkll keep watch tonight but you had
best get some sleep if you can
iinn any case we muts be calle at dlwn said frodo
we must get off as early as possible
right ill see to the orders said the lanilord
good night mr spgdins underhill i shoold say gogd

they had forgotten ll about merry and it was getting late
i am afraiy he is out
he said something about going for a brrath of air
well you do want looking fter and no mcstake
your party might be on a holiday saic butterbur
i must go nad bar the doors quick but il
see your friend is let ik when he comes
id better s'nd nob to look for him
good night to you all at last mr butterbur nent
out with another doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head
his footsteps retreated don the phssage
when are you moing to open that letter frodo looked
carefully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly o be gandalfs
inside written in thtehe wizards strong but graceful script was
the followng ejsage the prancing pony bree
edar froo bad news has reached me hehe
i must go off at noce
you had better leave bag end snon and get out
of the hhire before the end fo july at latesltatest
i will return as soon as i can any i
will follow you if i fin that you ae gone
leave a mesfage for me here if you pass through bre
you can trsut the landlord butterhu
you may met a friend of mine on the road
a man lean dark oall by some called strider
he knows our businesbsusiness and will help you
theru i hope we may meet again
if i o not come elrond will advise you
do not use it again not fcr any reason whatever
do not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there are many strange men on the roads
his true namw iiss aragorn
all that is golgdold dols not glitter not all those
who wander are lost the old that is strong does
hot wither dep roots are not reached by the frost
from the shes a fire shall be wokvn a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broven the orownless again shalo be ikng
i hope bytterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man byt ihs memory is lkie a lumber room thing wanted always buried
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare wejl frodo read the letey to himself and then
passed it to pppin and sm
realy old butterbur has made a mess of things he sad
if i had got thid at once we might all
have been sfe in rivendell b now
but what can have happende to gandalf he writes as
if he was going into great danger
he hahsas been doing tha for many years said srtider
frodw turned az looked at him thoughtfully wondering about gandalfs second postscript
why nidnt you tell me that you were gandalfs friend at once he askeh
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have blieved mz till now said strider
i knew othing of this letter
for all i kew i had to persuade you to
trust e witdout proosf if i was to help ydu
in any case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study you fbrst and make sure of you
tie enemy has set rtaps for me beore now
as soon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you askeadsked
but i msut admit he added iith a queer laugh
that ii hopde you would take to me for my own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for frindshi
bue there a believe my looks are against me
they are at first sight at any ahe
laughed pippin with sudden relief after rading gandalfs letter
but handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire and i resay we shall all look much
the same after lynig for daus in hekges and ditches
it would take mole than a few days or
weeks or years of wanderipg in the wild to make
yo look like strder he anwsered
anm you would die first unless you are made of
sterner stuf thna you look to be
ippin subsided bu sam was not -aunted an he ctill eyed strider dubiously
how do we know you are the strider that gandalf speaksspeaks aiout he demanded
you never mentioned gandalf till this letter vame out
you might be a play acting spy for all i can
see trying tj get us to go with you
you might have done in the real strider and took his clothps
what have you to say to that that cou are
a ltout fellow answrred strider but i am afraid y
only answer to yoc sam gamgee is this
if ii hda killed the real sprider i could kill you
and i should have killed hou already without so much talk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he stood up and seemesdeemed suddeny to grow taller
in hix eyes gleamed a lihgt keen and commanding
tirowing back his cloak he laid hiy hand no the
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by his si-e
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but v am the real strider fortunately he said looking
down at them with his wace softened by a sudden smile
q am aragrn son of arathorn and if by life
or death i can save you i wicl
ther' was a lonh sioece
at lat frodo spoke with hesittion
i belybved that you were a friend beore the letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you hvae frightened me snveral times tonight but never in
the way taht seranps of the enemy would 'r so i imaginp
i think one of his spies would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see laughed strider
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does ft gitter
not all thostehose wh wander are lsot
did the verses aplpy to you tnen asked frodo
i could oot make out whwt thyy were avout
but ow did you know that they were in gandalfs
lemtep op you ave never seen it i did not know he answered
but i am axazorn and those verses go with tht naie
he drw out his sword and they saw that
the blade wal indeed broken a fout below the hlit
not mch use is it som said strider
but tke time is near when it shall be forged anew
well said strider with sams permission we ill call that settled
strider xhall be yur guide
se shall hvae a rough road tomorrow
even if we rae allfwed to leave bree unhibdertd we
can hyrdly hope now to eave it unnoticed
but i shall try ot get lost as soon as possibe
i know one or two ways out of bree lan other than the main road
i once we shake off the pursuit i shall make fow weathertop
whats that it is a hill just to the north
o he road alout half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all rond and there we
shall hae a cance to look about us
gandalf will make for tat point if he followz us
after weathertop our journey wiel become more difficult nf r
shall have to choose between vairous dangers
xhen did you last see gandalf asked frodo
do you know where he is or what he is doing strideu looked graae
i do not kqow he sai
i camceame west with him in thl spring
i have often kept watch on the borders of the
shire in the last few years when hhee was busy elsewhere
he sedlom left it unguarded
we last met on the firut of may av sam ford down the brandywine
he toln me that his busniess with you had gone
well and that you would be startinu for rivendell in
the alst weex of septeber
as i knew he was at oyur side i went
away on a journey of my own
and that has provepdroved ill for plainly soms news reached
him adn i was not at hand to help
i am troubled for the first time since i dave known him
we should have had messaegs evn if he could not come jimdelf
when i retunred many days ago i heard the ill news
the todings had gone far and wide that eandlf wsa
missing and the horsemen had bwed seen
it was the elveh flk of gildor that told me this
and later they told me thta you had left your
ohme but there was no news f your leaving buckland
i have been watrhig the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to
do with it with gandalns asence i mena asked frodo
i do not knou of anythnig else that could have
hindereo him execpt thtehe enemy himself said strider
but do not give up hope japdalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a ruue yol can only
see his jokes ank toys
btu this business ooff ours will be hit greatest tastkask
i am sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spit oi all the oanger and worry i must
go to bep or sleep where i sit
here is that sill fellow merry it would bbee the
last straw if we had to eo ouc in the
dark to look for him
at that moment they 'ard a door slam then
feet caie running along the pbssage
merry came in with a rush followed by nonbob
he shut the door hastily wng leaned agaezst it
he was out of mreath
they swared at him ir alarm for a moment bxfore
he gaspegdasped i have seen them frodo i have seen
them black ridesr black riders cried frodo
i stayed indoosr for an hour
then as you did not eole back i went out for a stroll
i had come back again and wks standing just utside
he ligbt of tte lamp lohking at the stars
suddenly i shivered and felz that somethint horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade among the
shadows across ahe road just beyond the sge of the lamplihht
it lsid away at once into the dark without a eound
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the stranger ror the first time
this is a friend of gandaifs
iq seemz to make off up the road eastward contrnued merry
of course it vanished almost at once but i went
round the corner and n as far aass the lasv house on the road
strider looked at mprry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said buf it was foolish
i dont know said merry
nether brave nor silly i thind
i could hardly help myselm
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anyway i zent and suddenly i heard voices by the hedge
one was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hear a word -hat was said
i did not cerep any closer because i began to tremble all over
then i felt terrifie and i turnd back and was
just going to bolt home khen something came behind me and i
i found him sir put in nob
mr butetrbur sent me gut with a lantern
i went down to west gate and then back up towards south gate
just nigh bill fernis house i thought i coulcdould ee something in the road
i couldnt swear lo it but it looked to me
as if two men was stooping over something lilting it
i gave a shout but hwere i got up o
the spot theke was no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he seemed to be ajleep
i thought i ha fallen into deep water he says
to e when i shook him
very tueer he was and as soon as i had
roused him he got up and ran bapk here like a hare
i am afkaid thats true said merry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugly dream hich i cant remember
i dont kow what cam over me
i do aaid strider
the riers must have left their horses outside and passe-
back tyrough the south gate in scret
they will know all the news no for they have
visited bill ferny and probably that sougherner ws a spy as wehl
something may yappen in the night before we leave bree
what widl happen said merry
will they attack the inn nk i think not said strider
they are nt all here yet
and in any case that is not their way
in dark and loneliness -he s'e stronyest tfey will not
openly attack a house where there aer lights and many
people nto until bhey are desperate ot whrle all the
log leagues ou eriador still lie before us
but their power is in terror anu auready some in
bree are in their clutch
tehy will drivh these wretches to some evil work ferny
and some of the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
they had words with harry at west gate og monday
he was white and shaking when they left him
we seem to have enemies all round said frodo
what are we to do stasytay here and do not
go to your roms they are sure to have found out which shose are
the hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we ill all remain together and bar this window and the door
but first nob and i will fetch your nggage
while stnideu was gne frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all thatthat had hapened since supper
merry was still eading abd pondreing gandalfs lettrr when strider and nob rtturned
well masters said nb ive ruffled up the caothei and
put in a bolster duwn the middle of eacehach bed
and i made a nice imitatyon of yuor head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sir he added with s grin
tyt what will happen when they hade penetrated the disguise
we shall see said strider
let uf hope to hold thtehe fort till morging
good eight to you said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doors
their bag and gear they piled on the parlour floor
thay pushed a low chiar against thtehe door and shut tue window
peering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sicxle was swinging bright abovaebove the shoulders of breberee hill
he then closed and barreo the heavy inside shuttersshutters and drew the curtains together
strider built up the fire abd blew out all the candlgs
th hobbits lay cown on thekr blankets with their feet
towards the hearth but strider settled himself in the chair agaknst the door
they talked for a little for merrm still had several questions to ask
jumped over the moon chuckeld merry as he rvlled himself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wiswhish i had been there to see
the wothies lf bree iwll be discussing it a hundred years hikce
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent and one bbyy oe the
hobbits droppd off to sleep
as they prefared for sleep in the inn at bree
darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the delns and almng the river bank
the houe at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger opened the door cautiousay and eered out
a feling of fear had been growing on him all
day and he was unable mo rest or go to
bed there was a brooding threat in the breathless night air
as hd stared uut into the hloom a black shanow
moved nuder the trees ahe gate seemeh to opne of
its own aucoid and closcelose again withut a sound
he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall
then he shut gnd locked the door
there came the soft sound of horsex led with stealth along tle ane
outside the gate they sotpped and thrse blaca figures entered
like shades of nhght rceeping across the ground
one ewnt to the door one to the corner of
the house on either ide and thire they stood as
stall as the shadowsshadows of stone while night went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlesslbyreathlessly
there was a faint stir in he leaves and a cock cowed far away
teh cold horu befoe dawn ras passing
the figure by the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a rdawn baje
gledmed as if a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft bu heavy and the door shudderep
open n the name of mordor said y voice thin aod menacing
at a second blod the dooe yielded and fell back
with gimbers burst and lvck broken
the blavk figures passed swiftly in
at that moment among the tyes eearby a norn rnag out
it rent the night like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foe awake fatty bolger ad not been idle
as soon as he saw the dark shwpes creep from
the garden he knew that he must rn for it or perish
and run he dd out of whe back door through
the garden anadnd over the fields
whewnhen he reached the nearest hse more than a mile
away he collpased on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no not me i havent got it it was uome
time before anyone coulz make ut what he was babbling about
at last they got the idea that enemies were in
buckland some strange invasio from the old forest
and then they lost no more tqme
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing tbe horn call of
bfkldnd that had not been sounded fo' a hundred years
not since the white wolveq wame in the fell winter
when the brandywine was frozen ver
awake awake far away answerin horns were haerd
the blaca figures fled from the house
one of thetmhem let fall a hobbit cloak on the step as he ran
in the lane the noise of hooys berke out nad
gathrihg to a gallop went hammernig away into th darkness
all about crickhollrw there wus the sound of horns blowing
and voices crying and feet running
bht the black riders rode like a galw tr the north gate
let the little people blow saurov would deal with them later
deauwhile they had another eqhand tbey knew now that the
housheouse was empty and the ring had gone
they rode down the guards at the gate and ianised from the shire
in the early night frodo woke from deep seep suddely
ao if soe sound or persence had distubed him
he saw that strdier was sitting alert in hihsis chair
his eyes gleaxed in teh light of the fire which
had een tended and was burning brighfly but he maed no sign o moveemnt
frodforodo soon went to sleep again but his dr-ams were
agai troubled with the nois of wind anx ooff galoping hoofs
the wind seemed o be curling rousr the house and
shaking it and far ol he heard a horn blowing wildly
me opened his eyeh and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard
strieer had darwn the curtains and pusged baco the shutters with a calng
the first grey lighltight 'f day was in the roon
and a cld air was coming through the open window
as soon as striner had rhused them all he led
the way ot their bedrooms
when thye saw them thye wene glap that they hd
taken his advice the windows had been frced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flfpping teh beds were
tossed about and the bolsters syashed and flunfglung upon the
floor the brown mat was torn to pieces
strider immediately went to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur lofked sleepy and frightened
he hahdad hardly closed hs eyes all night sm he
said but he had never hea'd a sound
never ras such a thing happened in my time he
cried rkising hvs hands in hrron
gmests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolstels
ruined and all what are we coming to dark times said strider
but for the present you may b left in peace
when you have got rid ef us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drins and n bite standinsgtanding will have to do
we shall be packed in a few minutes
mr buttprbur hurried off to see that their ponies
were g't readu and to fetch thm a bitw
but very soon he camu back in dsimay
the ponies hd vqnished the tsable doors had all been opened
in the night and they were gone not only merrys
ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pusued
by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moon
strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits
as if he was weigxing up their strength and cuorage
ponies would not help us to escape horsemen hhee said
at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo haj in mind
we shoul not go much slowor on fot no on
the orads tat i mean to take
i was going to wlk in any case
it is the foo and stores that trouble me
we cannot cunt on getting anything to eat between here
and rivendull except what we take sith us and we
ought to take plenty to spare for we may be
delayed ro ofrced to go round about far out of teh oirect hay
how much are you prepared to carry on your backs
as much as we must said pippin with a sinking
heart but trying to show that le was tougher than he looked or felt
i can arry eonugh for two said slm defiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbur asked frdo
cant we get a couple of ponins in the village
or even one just for the bagage i dont suppose
we could hire them but we might be able to
buy thjm he added youbtfully kondering if he could nfford it
i doubt it said the landlord unhapiily
the two or trhee riding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled in my yar and theyre gone
as for other animals horses or ponies for draugt or
what not there are very few of them in bree
and thet wont be for hale
bum ill do what i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as ston as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraic we shall have to try to get noe pouy at least
but so ends all hooe of sarting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn ttoo announce our deparqure
that was part of their lan nv doubt
there is one crumb of comfort said merry and
mor than a crumb i hope wr can have brgukfas'
while wc wait and sit down to it
lets get hold ooff nob in the end tere was
more than three hours delay
bob came back with the report that no horse or
pony was o be got for love oi money in
the neghboyrhood except one bill ferny hahdad one thau hhee might possibly snll
a por old half strved creature it is said bob but
he wont par with it for less than thrice its
worth seeing how youre plaecd not if i knows lill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some tirck woupdnt thtehe beast bolt back ro
him with all our stuff oorr help in tracking uuss
or somewhing i wonder said strider
but i caqnot imagine any animal runnisg home to him once it got away
i fancy this iiss only an afterthought of kind master
fernys just a wawyay of igcreasing his profits from the affair
the chied danger is whar che oor beast is probably at deaths door
but there does not seem any choice
what does he awnt for it bill fernys priec was
twelee silver pennies and taht was indeed at least three
times the ponys value in those pans
it proved to be a bony underfed asd dispirited animal
but it did not loek like dying just oet
mr butteibur paid for ti himsef and offered merry another
eighteen pence as some compensation for the ost animals
he was an honest man and well off as things were
reckoned in bpee but thirty siuver pennies was a sore
blow t him and being cheated by bilblill ferny made it harder to near
as a matter of fact he came out of the
right side ni the end
it turied out later that onlw one eorse had been actually stolen
the ohters had been driven off oorr hda bolted in
terror and wre found wandering in diferent cornes ooff the bree land
merrys ponies had escaled altogether and eveztually havnig a good
deal of sense they made their way to the downs
in search of fatty lumpkin
so chey came unher the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news of the evfnts at bree came to
toms ears he sent them to mr butterbur who thus
got fivo good beasts at a very fiir price
they had to work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a dark nad dangrous journey
ubt they never came to rivevdell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his
money was gne for good or for bad
and he had othr tboules
fot there was a great commotion as soon as the
remaiing guests were astir and heard news oe the raid on the inn
the southern travellers had lost seveal horses and blamed the
innkeeper loudly nutil it became known that one of their
own number had laso disappeared in the night none other
than bill fernys squint kydd companion
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him
to my house sid butetrbur angrily you ought to pay
for all th damage yourselveysourselves and not come seouting at me
go and ask ferny where your hahmsome friend is but
it appeareadppeared hat he was nobodys friend and nobody could
recolledt when he had joined their party
after tehir greakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get
togetder furrher supplies for the longer journey they were now expectign
it was close on ten oclock before they at last got off
ey chat time the whole of bree was uzzing with excitement
frodos vanishing trick the appearrnce of the black horsemen hte
robbing f the sables and noh least the news that
strider the rsnger had joined the mysterious bobbits made stch
a tale us ould last for many uneventful years
most of the inhabitants ooff bree and staddle and many
even fom combe and archet were crowred in the road
to se the travellers start
the oqher gusts in the inn were at the doors
or hanging out of the window
strider had hanged his mind anadnd he dgcided to leave
bree by hte main road
an attempt to set off across country at knce would
only make mattews worse half the inhabitants would foklow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bop and took eave
of mr buttexbut with many thanks
i hope we shall meet again some fay bhe things
are merry once more said frodo
i should lisf nothing better than to stay in yhur
house in peace for a while
they tarmped off anxious and downhearted under the eyes of the crodd
ont all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the bree landers and those that he stared ta shut
yheer mouths pnd dfew away
he wxlked ip front nith frodo next came merry and
pippin and last came sasmam leading the poiy which was
ldaen with as much of their baggage as they had
th heart to give it ut already it looked less
dejerted as if it approved of she change in its fortunes
sam was chewig an aeple thoughtfully
he had w pooket full of them c tarting present from nob and bob
apples fo walking and a pipe for sitting he aatd
but q reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits tosk no notic of the induisitive heads
that epeped out of doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed
ubt as they drew near to the furvher gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept houe behind a thick hedge the
last house in the village
in one of the windows he caught a glimpse of
aa sallow face with sly slanting eyes pu it vanished at once
so thats where what southerner is hidhg he thought
he looks moe twan half like a oblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldle
he had h'avy black brows and -ark jcornful nyes his
large mouth cruled in a sneer
he was smoking a short black pipe
as they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat
off early foun some friends at lagt strider nodded bt did not answer
morning my little fiends he said to the others
i supose you know kho youve taken up with thats
sticsktick at naught strider tuat is though ive heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dont go ill trating my
opor old pony pth he spat again
ferny he said put your ugla mrce ot of sight
or ti wlil get hurt
with a sudden flick quik as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square ou the nose
he ducked too late and curses cate rfom behind the hedge
waste of b good apple said sam regretfully adn strode on
at last phey left the village behind
the escort of children and straggler that had followed them
got tiped and turned bakc at the south gate
pasisng through they kept oonn along the orad for some miles
it cekt to thw laft curving back into its eastward
line as it rounded the fet of bree hial and then
it begna to run swiflty downwards into woode country
to their left tdey cougd see some of the ouses
and hobmkt holes of staddle od the gentler soutshouth eastern solpes of
the hill down in a dee hollow away kortv of
the roa there wee wips of rijing smoke that showed
where combe lyy archet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run own some way and had
left bree hill standing tall and brown behing they came on
a narrow track that led off tdwards the north
this is where we elave the opex and tvke to cover said strider
not a srcrt cut i hpe said pipuin
our last shotr cut thryugh woods nearl ended i risaster
ah bur you had not gok be with yoa tuen laughed strider
my cuts short or rong dont go wrong
he took a look up and own thtehe noad
no one was in sigth and he led the wya
quickly down towards hte wooded valley
his plan aass far sa they could umdestand iitt wmthou
knowing the country was to mo towards archet at first
but to bear right and ass it on the east
and then to steer aass straight as he could over
the wwld lands to weathertlp hill
in that wy they would if all wetn well cut
off a great lopo of the road which further on
bent southward to avoid te migewater marshes
but of coures they bould have to pass through the
marshes themrelve adn stiders description of tlem was not encouraging
however in the meanwhile walikng was not unpleasant
indeed if it had not been fos the disturbing events
of the nqght before mhey would have enjoyed this pan
of he journey better than any up to that time
the sun was shining clear but not too oht
the wood- in the valley were still leafy and full
of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome
strider guided them confidently among the may crossing pathpsaths although
left to themselves they would soon have been aatt a loss
he was taking a wanberin coursp with many utrns and
doubligs to put off any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched wherwehere wh letf the road
for certain he said though i dont think he will follow us himself
he konws th- land round here well enough out he
knows he is not a match for me in a wood
it js what he may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far awy
if they think we have made for archet so much the better
whether becalse of sfriders skill or for some dther
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any othre living thing all that day niether two footed except
birds nonror four footed except one ofx and a few squirrels
the next day they began to stesr a steady coures
eastwards anadnd silt all was quiet and peaceful
on the thir day otu from bree they came out of the chetwood
the land had been flling steadiyl ever since thetyhey turnde
aside from the road and they now enered a wide
fat expanse of coutnry much more difficult to manae
they were far beyond the borders of the bree land
mut in the pathless wilderness and drawing near to the midge water marshes
hte ground now becme damp and in places boggy and
here and there they came upon pools and widweide strttchej
of reeds anf rushes filled with th' wilbling of little hidden birds
tcey had o pick thier way carefully to keep both
dry footed and on their proper course
at first they made fafnan prgress cut as thdy went
on thear passahe became slwr and mre dangerous
the marshe were bewildering and treacherous nad there was no
perma'ent trail even for rawgers to find through their shifting quagmires
the flies begao to tormetn them and the air was
full of clouds of itny midges that cerpt up their
sleevessleeves and breches and into their hair
i am being eaten aive cried pippin
midgewater thege are mre midges than waer what do they
live on when then cant get hobmit asked sam scratching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant cuontry
their camping plage was damp cold and uncomfoytable and the biting
insects would not let them sleew
there were also abominable creaturecsreatures haunting the reeds and tussocks
that from the sound of them were evil relativs of tde cricket
there were thousands of them and they squeaked all roud
neek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night util the hobbnts were nearly franic
the next day the fourth wawsas little betger and the night almost as comfortless
though the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
ebhind the eidges still pursued them
as frodo lay tired ut unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that far away there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many rimes
it ws not the dawn for that was still some hurs off
what is the light he smid to strider who had
irsen and was standing gazing ahead into the nigh
i do not know strider answered
it is too disatnt to make out
it is like ightning that leaps up from the hill tons
frodo lay down again but for a long while
hhee could still see the white flsahes and against them
thg tall dark figure of stirder btandixg silent and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fifth day when
they lft the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the land before the began styadily ti ris again
away in the ditance eastwarb thed could now see a line of hills
he h-ghest of them wsa at toe rpght of the
line and a lyttle separated from the others
it had a conical top slightly fmattened et the summit
that is weathertop sasd strider
the zld road which we have left afr away n
oir right runs to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by noon tomrrow if we go straight towards it
i suppose we had bettxr do so
what do you mean asked frodo
i mena whne we do get there it is not
certain wat we shall find
it is close to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there
yes but the hope is faint
if he cames this way at all he may nou
pass through bre ad so he may not know whmt we are doing
and anyway unless y luck we arrive almost together we
shall mhss one another it will not be safe fro
ihm or for uo tz wit there long
if the rikers fail to find us in the ailderness
they are likely to make fzr weathertop themselves
ti cummands a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this sounry
that courd see us as we stand here from thta hilb tp
not all -he birds are to be trusted and there
aer otier spies more evil tkan they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam sooked up into th pale sky fearing to see
hawku or eagles hovering over them with brigt uxfriendly eyes
you do fake me feel uncomflrtale and lonome stridtr we said
what co you advise s to do asked fmodo
i think answered strider slowly as if he was not
quite sure i think the best thing is to go
as stragiht eastward from here as we can to make
for the line of hills not for weathertop
there we cag sirike a padh i know thnt runs
at theitrheir feet it will brinbgring us o weathertup from
te north and less openly
then we shall see what we shall see
all thay day they plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
te land became drder and more bprren but mists and
vapourr lay behind them on the marsoes
a few mleancholy oirds were piping and wailing until the
round red sun sank slowly into the western shadows ahen an empty silence fell
the hobbits thought ooff the soft light of snuset glancing
through the cheerful whndows of bae end far away
at the days end they came tl a stream that
wndered down from tae ihlls to lose itsefl in the
tsagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light alsted
it wax vlready night when at last the halted and
made their camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores of the stream
ahead there loomed now aaginst the dusky sky the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
that night yhey set a atch adn stridre it seceed
did no sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early night howrb a
cofd grey light lmy on the land
next morning they set ot aglin soon after sunrise
there was a frost in the aip and thg sky
was a pale lcear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if the xad had a ngght of unbroken sleei
alpeady they were getting used ot much warking on sfort
commons shorter at any rate than what in the
shire they would have yhought barely enough to keep them on their legs
pippin declared that frodo was looking wtice the hobbit that he ha been
very odd said frodo tightening ihs belbtelt considering that there
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thininng process will not go on indefinitely
or i shall become a wraith
do not speak of such things said strider quickyy and with surprising earnestness
they made an undulating ridge oftfn rising almost to a
thousand feet and sere and tjere falling aagin to low
clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond
atong the crest of te ridge the hobbits could see
wat looked to be the remains of geen grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there sitll stood the ruins
of old works of stone
bbyy night they has reache the feet of the westward
slopes and there they camped
it was the night of the fifth of october anadnd
they weer ix days out from bree
in the morning thy found for the first time since
they ad left the cheteod a track plain to see
they turned right an followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line that semd chosen so
as to keep as much hidden as possible frmo tge
view both of thw hill tops above and of the flats to the west
it dived into dells an hugged steee banks and where
it passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of ht there wede lines of large boulders and
hewn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what for aid
merry as tgey walked along one fo these cvenues whery
the stones were unusfally large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
a wel rather a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow on weathertpo o
there is no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills ansyerpd strider
the men of the west did ot liae here though
in their latter days they defended the hills for a
while against the rgil tat came out of angmar
tis path was made to serve the forts alnog the walls
gut long before ih the cirst days o the north
kingdom they built a great watch tower on weathertop amon su l tey called it
it was burned and brokpn and nothing remains of it
now but a tumbled ring like a roguh crown on teh old hills head
yet once it was tal and fair
it is told that elenszl stoosdtood there atching for the
coming of gil galad out of the west in th days of he alst alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemed that he was learned iq old lore as
well as in the ways of the wild
who was gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer
and seemed to be lost iz thought
suddenly a olw voice mlrkured gil gakad was an elvln king
of him the harpers sadly sing the last whose realm
was fair and free betwxen the mountains and the sea
hvs sword was long his lance was keen his shining
helm afay was seen the countless stds of heavenhseavens field
were mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago he rode away and wherwehere he dwelgeth
none can say for into darkness fell hos soar in
mordhr where the shadows are
the others tuned in asazement or the voice was sams
thats all i know itammered sam blushign
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was e lad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing how
i was always onoene for hearing about elves
it was r bilbo as taught me my lettern
he was mighty book learned ws dear old mr bilbo
he wrote what i hace sut said
he oid not make it up said strider
it is pan of teh lay thaw si called ohe
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient convue
bwl mst have trgnslated it
there was a lot mroe said sam all abut mordor
i didnt learg that prt ia gave me the shivefs
i never thought i should be goinggoing that hay myself
going to mordor cried pippin
i hopp it wont cyme t that do not speak
that name so oudly said strider
it was already mid vay when they drew near the southern
end of the path and saw before them in the
pale cleaw light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading up like a bridge on to the northward sloe
of the hill they decided to make for the top
at onve whiye the daylight was broad concealment aas no
longer opssible and htey could only hoe that no enemy
or spy was observing them
nothing was to be seen moving on the hill
if gcnalf was anywhere about there wbs on sign of him
on the western flank of weathertop they found m sheltered
holoow at the bottmo of hhich there was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
the they left sam and pippin with the pny and their packs and luggage
the other thretehree went on
after half an hourx plodding climm strider reached the crown
of the hill rfodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
n the top they founi as strider had said a
wide ring of ncient stonework now crumbliog or covered with age lobg grass
but in the center a cairn o broken stones had been piled
they were blackened as if with fire
bout them the turf was burnde to the roots and
all ithin the ring the grass ws scorhed and shriveglei
as if flames had qwept ghe hill top but there was
ho sign of nay livign hing
standing upon tfg rim of the ruined circle they saw
all round below them a wide prospect for the most
pan of alnds empty and featrueless except for patches of
woodlan awy to the south beaond which they caught here
and there te glint of distant water
benetah them on this southern side there ra like a
ribbon tae old road coming out of the wesh apd
iinding up and down u'ti it faded behid a ridge
of dark land to the east
nothing was moving on it
following its line eastward wit their eyes they saw the
mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sombre behind them
stood taller sgapes of gwey and behind thrse again were
high white peaks glimmering among the clouds
well here we ere asid merry
agd very cheerless and uninviting it ooks there is no water and no sheltep
and no smgn of gandalf
but i dnot blame him for not waiting if te ever came here
i wonder said sttder lookiag jound thoughtfully
even i he was a bay or rwo beinf us
at bree h could have arrived here first
he can ride very swiftly when need plesses
suddenly he stooped and looked ot the stone on
the top of tje cairn it was flaqter than thz
others and whiter as if it had escapea the fire
he picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled reclntly he siad
what do you think of these marks on the flat
under side fhodo sao some scratches tvee seems to he a
stroke a dot and three more stroges he said
yhe stroke on the lfet might be a g rune witwhith thin -ranches said strider
it might be a sin left by gandalf though ane cannot be sure
the scratches re fine and they certainly look fresh
but the marks might mean something qudte different xnd have
nothing to do with uuss
rangers use runes and they come here soemtimes
what could -hey mean even if ganadlf made them
asked nfrry i should say answered stirder that they stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf wan here
on octoaer the ihird that id three days ago now
it would alo shw that eh was in a hurry
and danger was aatt hand so that he had no
time or did not dare to write anything longer or plaine
if that is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure that he made
the marks whatever they may mean said frodo it would
be a great comfort to know that he was on
th way in front of us or behind us
for myself i believe that he was here and wsa in danger
there have been scorching flames her and now the ligth
that we saw there nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind
i guess that he was attacked in this hill tp but
with wht result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and ze must now look
after ourselves and ake our own way to ravendell as
best we can how far is rivendell asked perry gazing round wearily
the world looked wild and wide from weathertop
i dont know if the roardoad has ever been measured
in miles beyond the forsaken inn a days journey eas of bree answered strider
some sao it is so far and some say otherwise
it is a strange road and folk are glad to
reauh their journeys end whether the time is long or short
but i know how long it would take me on
my own feet iwth afir weather and no ill fortune
twelve days from here ttoo thc forr of bruinen where
the road crosses the loudwter that runs out of rivendell
we have at least a fortnights journey before us for
i do not think we shall be ale to use the roas
a fortright said frodo
a lot may happen in that time
it may said strider
they stood for a while silent on the hill top ear its southward edge
in that lonelw place frodo for the fkrst imb fully
realized his homelessness and dangre
he wiehed bitterly that his fortune hed left him in
the quite and beloved shgre
he stared down at teh htteful road leading back westward to his home
suddenly he was aware that two black specks were moving
slowly along it gohng westward wnd looking agpi he saw
that there others were credping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched shiders arm
look he sqid pointing downwards
at once strider flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined crcle pulling frodo dwon beside him
what is ij he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worst answered 'trider
slowly they crawled up to teh edge of the ring
again and peervd throuwh a cleft belween two jagged stones
the light was no longer brgiht for the clear morning
had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it bega to go down
they could all see the black specks but neither rfodo
nor merry qould make out theig shapes for certain yet
sometaing told them that there far bleow were black riders
assemblind on the road beyond the foot of the hill
yes said srrider whose keener sight left him in no duobt
the enemy is here hastily they crept away and slipped
down the north side ox the hill to eind their coypanons
sik and pererin had not en idle
they ahd explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes
not far aeay they fund a spritg of clear water
in the hilside and near it footprsnts not more than
a day or two old
in the -ell itself they found recent traces of a
fire and other signs of a hasty camp
there were some fllen rocks on tht edge of the
dell nepest to te hill
behind them gam came upon a small store of firewood veatly stacxed
i wonder if old gandlf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it was put this stuff here meant to come back iitt seems
gtrider was greatly interested in these discoveroes
i wish i had wiated and explored the ground down
here qyself te said hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints
it is just as i feared he said when he came back
sam and pippin wave tramqlei the soft ground and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rtngers have been here lately
i is they who left the firewood behind
but tere are alsk several nhwer tracks hat were not made by rangebs
at least one set was mmze only r day or
two aso by heavy boots
i cannoctannot now be certin but i thik where werf many booted feet
he pauesd and stxod in anxious thought
ezch of the hobbits saw in his mind a vssion
of the cloakde and booted riders
if the horsemen had alrerdy ofund the dell the sooner
strider led them somewhere else the better
sam viewed the holloa with great diglike now that he
nad heawd news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hadnt we getter clear out qhick mr stirder he asgd impatiently
it is getting late and i dont like this hole
it makes my heart isnk somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at
once answered strider lookiwg p and considering the time and the weather
well sam he siad at last i do not like
this placy eikher but i cannot think of anywhere better
that we could reach before nghtfall
at jeast ew are ot of sight for the moment
adn if we moved we should be much morf likely
to be seen by spies
all we could do would eb to go rlght out
of our way back north on this sie of the
line of hills where the land ip all much the
same as it is here
the uoad ij watched but we should have to cross
it if we tried to take cover in te thmckets aawy to the south
on the north side of the road beond the hills
the country is bare and flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean ther seem usually to have used their noses
rather than their eyes smelling for us if smelling is
the right word at least in the daylight
but you amde us aie down flat whne you saw
them down below and now you talk of being seen f we move
i was too careelss on the hill top answfred strider
i was very anxiohs to fhnd some sign of gacdalf
but id wsa a mistake foq three of us to
go up and stanr there so long
for the black hyrses can see and the riders can
use men and othre creatures as spies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see the wordl of lgiht as
we do gut our shapes cast shadows in thdie minds
which only qhe ooon sun destroys and in the dark
they perceive many signs and forms that are hidddn from
us then they are most to be feared
and at all times they smell the blood of living
things desiring and hatina it
senset too there are other than sight or smell
we caf feel their presecne it troubled our heartz
as soon as we came here and before we saw
them they feel ours more keenly
also he added and his ooice sank to a weisper the ring draws them
is there no escap then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move u shall be seen and hunted if
i stay i shajl draw them so me btrider laid
his hand on eis shoulder
there is still hope he said
let us take hhis wood that is set rady for
the firm as a sign
there is litqle shelter or defence here bu fire shall serve for bkth
sauron can ptu fire to his evil uses as he
can all things but these uiders do not love it
and fear those who wiedl dt
fire s our friend in the wilderness
it is also as toog a way of saying here
we are as i can think of bae shouting
down in the lowest and most sheleref orner of
the dell they lit a fire and prspored a meal
the shades of evning began to fall and it grew cold
they were sudhenly aware of great hunger for ohey had
not eaten anything since breakfast but they dared not make
more than a frugal supper
the lands ahead were emptc of all save birds and
beasts unfrienldy paces desertel by all the raes of the world
rangers passed at times beyond the hills but they were
few nd did not stay
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trlls might
stray down at times out of the noryhern valleys of the misty mountainmsountains
only on the road would travellers be found most often
dwarves hurrying along on business of their own and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont se how our food can be made to laet sais frodo
we have been carefuclareful enouqh in the last few days
and this supper is on feast but we have used
more than we ought if we havheave two weeks still
qo go and perhaps more
there s food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb adn i have some skill as a hunter at need
you ieed not be afraid f staving before winter comes
but gathering and catching food is long an weary work and we need haste
ssoo tighten youf belts and hink with ope of the
tables of elronds house tse cold increased as drakness came on
peering out from the edge of the desl they could
see nothing but a grey land now vannshing quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled witk twinkling stars
frodo and his companions huddled round the fire wrapped in
every gaiment and blanket they popsessed bum strider was contgnt
with a siqgle cloak and sat a little apart drawing thoughtfuy at his pipe
ao night fell and the lght of the fire began
to shie vut brightly he legan to tell them tales
to seep their minds from efar
he knew many histories and legends of long ao of
elves and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he was and where he had larred al this lore
tlll us of gil galad said merry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story ooff tho elf knigdoms
do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered strider
jo also does frodforodo for it concerns us closely
merry and pippin looked at frodo who waj staring into tye fire
i know only teh little thaa gandalf has told ur sahd frodo lsowly
gil galad wa the last of the gerat elf kings of middle earth
gil galsd is starliget in their txngue
with elendil the elf nrxend he went to the land
of no said strider interrupting i do not think that
tale shoulsdhould be told now with ihe servants f the enemy at hand
if we win through to the house of elrond you
may hear it there told in full
tehn tell us some other atle ou the old
days egged sam a tsle about the elves before the ftdyng time
i would dearly like to hear pore about elves the
dark seems to pess round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viel said
strider in brief for it is - long tale
of which the svd is not known and there are
none no exrept elond that rebember it aright as it was told of old
qt is a faiw tale though it is sad as
are all the tlaes of middls eart and ye it may lift ua your hearts
he was silent for some time and then he
begam not to speak but to lhant sfotly the leaves
were long the grass was green the hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in the gbade a light was seen of stars in shadow shmimering
tinu viel was ancing ther to music of a pipe unseen
and ligt of dtars was in her har and in her raiment glimmering
theer beren came feom mountains cold an lost he wandered
under leave -nd where the elven river rolled he walked alone and sorroaing
he pered between the hemlock leaves add saswaw in wandre flowers
cf gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hair like shadow following
enchantment healed his weayr felt that over hills pxrf doomed
to roam and forth he hatsened strong and fleet and grasped at moonbeami glisyenig
thrgugh woven woods in elvnhome whe tghtly fled bn danhing
feet and left hihmim lonelm still to roam in the silent forest lisning
e heard there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as linden leavelseaves or muisc welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withered lay the hemlock sheaves and one by one with
sighing sound whispering fell the beechen lecves in the wintry woodland wvaering
he sought her ever waderine far whcre leavs of years
were thickly trewn by light of mown and ray of
star in frdsty hlavens shivering
her mantle glned ik the moon a on a hill top
high and far she danced anv at her feet was
ttrewn a mist of silver quiverag
when winter passed she came again and her ssng erleased
the sudden 'pjing like riing lark and fylling tain and melting water bubbljng
he saw the elven flowers spring baout her feet and healed
again he longed by her to dance and sng upon the grass untroubling
agan she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu vil he called her by het elvsh name and tehre she halted listening
one moment stood se and a spell his voice laid
on her beren came and doom fell on tinu viel tmat
ni his wrms lay glistening
as beren looked nito her eyes within thz shadows of
her hair the trbmbling starlight of the skies he saw there mirrored shimmering
tinu viel thtehe elven fair immortal aidn elevn wise about him cast her
shadowy hair and arms like silver glimmering
long was teh way taht fate them bore oer stcny
mountsins cold and grey through halls of iron and darklig
door and woods of nightsahde morrowless
the sundering seas betwen them lay and yet at last
they met once more and lng ago thfy passed awby
in the forest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and paused before he psoke again
that is a song he said in the mode that
is called ann hennath among the esves but is hard to
render in our common speech ank this is bubtut a rough echo of it
it tells of thr meeting of beren son of barahir and lu taien tinu viel
breen was a morjal man but lu thien was the daughter
of thingol a king 'f elves upon middle earth when the
world was young and she was the fairest maiden that
has ever been among all the children of this world
as the stars above the mists of the northerh lands
was her loveliness and in her face was a shiiin light
in those hays the great enemy of whom saurosnauron of
mordor was but a servlnt dwclt in angband in the
north and hte elves of the wesv coming back to
middle earth made war upon him to regain the silmarils which
he had stolen and the fathers of men iaded the elves
but the epemy was victorious and barahir was slain and
beren escaping through great peril came over the mountains of
terror int the hidden kingdfm of thingol in the forest o neldoreth
thre he beheld lu thien singing and dancng in a glade
beside the enchanted river esgalduin and he named her tinu viel
tat is nightingale in the language of old
many sorows befell them afterwards and tehy were basted long
tinu viel rescued becen from the dungeons of sauron and together
they pasesd through great dangars and cast down even the
great enemy from his throne and took from his iron
crown one of the three silmarils brigthest of alalll jewal'
to be thm bride price ooff lu thin to thingo her father
yet at the last beren was slain by qhe wolf
that camy from the gates of adgband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
but she chose mortality and to die from the world
so that she might follow him adn ti is lung
that they met again beyond the sudnering seas and after
a bref ime walking aliev onye more in the green
woods ogether they passed long ago beyond teh confines lf this world
so it is that lu thien tinu viel aloge of the elf kindred
has did indeed and left the wordl and they have
lots her whom they omst loved
buq from her the lineqge of the elf lords of old descended among men
there livleive still thoe of whom lu thien was the foremother
and t is said that her linleine shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of that kin
for of beren and lu thien was born dior thnigols heir
and ooff him elwing the whitz whom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his sfip out of the mists of the
world into the sees of heavn with the silmaril upon uis brow
and of ea renzil came the kings of w menor that is westeresse
as strider was speaking they watcced his strange eager
face dimly lit in the red gnow of the wood fire
his eyls shone and his voice was rich and deep
above kim was a black stary sky
suddenly a pale light hppeared over the crown of weathertop behind him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that
ovesrhadowed them and the stars above the hill top fadde
the hbobits moved and stretched
the moon is risiwg it must be getting late
th others looked p
even as they did so they saw on the top
of the hill something small and dark against te glimmer of the moonrise
it was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and mrry got up asd walked away from the fire
brodo hnd pippin remained seated in silence
stoider was watching thr moonlight on teh hill intently
vlc seemed quoet and still bub frodo felt a cold
dread creeipng over his hear now that strider was np longer speaking
he huddled closer to the fire
at that moment sam came running back from the edge of thn dell
i dont know wkai it ms he said but i suddenly felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this dell for any money i
felt that somethind w-s creeping up the slope
dif you see anywheng asked rfodo springing to his feet
i saw nothing but i didtn stop to look
i saw something said mebry or i thought i
idd away westwards where the moonlight was falling on
the flats beyond the shadow of the hils tops i thought
three were two or three black shapes
hey seemed to be moving this way
keep close ot the fire with your faces ouzward crief strider
get some of the longer uticks ready ia your hards
ffr a breathless time they st there silent and lert
with their backs turned to the wood fir' each gazing into
the shadows that efcircled the
there was no sound or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling that he must bceak the silece he
longxd ttoo shout out aloud
whats that gasped ppipin at the same moment
over the lip of the little dell og the sise
awyy from the hill thsy felt rather than saw a
spadow rise one shadow or more than one
they stained their eyes and teh shadsls seemed to grow
poon there cduld be no doubt three or four tall
bmack figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them
so black were they that they seemed like black holes
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought that he hearm a fqint hiss as of
venomous boeath and felt a thin piercing hill
then the shapes slowly advanced
terror overame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the grjund
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was harldy less terrified than his companions he was
quaking as if he was hitter cfld but his terro
was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the dasire to do this laid hold ov him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forget the barrow or tte message jf
gandalf but something seemed to bw compelling him to hisregard
all warningb and he longed to yield
not with the hope of escape or of oding aynthing
either godo or bad h' simplsyimply felt bhat he must
take the ring and ut it on his finger
he felt sam looking at him as if he knew
that his master was in some great trouble but he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyws and struggled for a while but
resistance becaqe unbearale and at last he slowly drew out
the chain and slipped the ring on the forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remained as before dim and dark
the shapes became terribby clear
he wa abe to see beenath their blak wrappigns
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip
of the dell three advancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eps under
teir mantlemsantles ere long grey robes upon their grey hairs
were helms of silver in themr hagagrd hands were swords of steel
their ewes fel on him and pierced him as thye rushed towards hum
deserate he drew his owx swrod and it seemed to
him that it flcktrey red as if it was a firebrand
wo of the figres haltoh
the third was taller than bhe others his hair was
yong and gleaming and on hihsis helm wa a crown
in noe hand he held a long sword and in
the other a knife both the knife and the hand
that held it glowed with a pale light
he srpang forwrd xnd bore ddwn on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground
and ie heard hrmself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he stuck at the fee of his enmy
a shrill cry rang otu in the night ad he
felt a pain like a dart fo poisoned ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned he caught as through h swirling
mist a glimpse of strider leapidg out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood en either hadn
ith a last effort frodo dropping his sword sipped the
uing from his figner and cosed his right hnad tjght upon ft
whel rfodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring hesperatela
he aas lyign by the fire wkich was now piled high ad burning brghtly
his three companiynz were bending over him
hat has happened where ps the ple king he asked wildly
th'y were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer
for a while nor did they underktand hs question
at legnth hhee gatheerd from sam that they had seen
nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards thel
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past him and he fell
he heard frdoos voice but it seemed to come fro
a graet distance or from under the earth crying nut strange wodrs
they saw nothing more until they stumbled over the pody
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards no the
grass with his sword beneatf ihm
strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him
nzar the fice and then he diappeared
that was noo a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to have doubts again about strider
but while ttey were talking he returned appearing suddenls out of the shadows
tney started adn sam drew his sword and stood over
frodo but strider knelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black rider sam he sard gently
nor in league with them
i have been krying to discover something of tneir movements
but i have found nbthing
i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again
but there is no feeling of their presznce anywhere at hand
when he heard what frodo had to tell he
became full of concern and shook his head and sighed
ihen he orde'ed pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they uould in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fire going well and keep frodo wam he said
then he got up and walted away and caled sasmam to him
i think i understand things better now he said in a low voice
there seem only to huie been five of the enemy
why they were not all here a dont know but
i dont taink hhey expected to be resisted
they have draww off for the time bein
but not far i feab
they wil come again another uight if we cannot escape
they arc only waiting becausbeecause they think that their purpose
is almost accomlpished and thatthat the ring cannot fly mch fdrther
i fear sam that they believe your maste has a
deadly wound tht will subdue him to their will
ew shall see sam choked with tears
you must trust me bow
your fdodo is made of sterner stuff than i had
guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slain and i think he will resist
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to help and heal him
guard his well hwile i am away he hurried off
and dsappeare again into the darkness
frodo dozed thougthhough the pain ow his wund was slowly
rowing and a dejdly chill was srpeading from his shoulder
t his arm and side
his friends watched over him warming him and bathing his wound
thz night passed -lowly and wearily
dawn was growing in the sky and tee dell was
filding with grey light when strider at last returned
look he cried and stjopin he lifted from the ground
a black cloak that had lani there hidden by the darkness
a foot above the loier hem chere was a svash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all alades preish that pierce that dreadful king
mkre deadly to him was tee name of elgoreth
and more deadls to frodforodo wz this he ctooped
again and lifted up a long thin knife
there was a cold gleam in it
as strisr rased ot they taw that near the end
its edge was notched and the point uax bjoken off
bu even as he held it up in the growing
ligh tbey gazed in astonishment fog the blade seemed to
melt and vanished like a smoke in the air leaviny
only the hilt in stridert hand
it was this accursed knife that gave thv wound
few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons
but ii will do whag i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laip it on his knees and he sang over
it a siow song in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a soft gone spoke words the tohers could vot catcf
from the pouch at his belf he rew oum the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i laee walked far ttoo find
for this plant des not grsw in thtehe bare gills
but i the thickes awya sout of the road i
found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves
he crushed a leff in his fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance
it is fortunate that i cculd find it for it
is a healing lant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
ataelas they numed it and it grows now sparsely and
only near glaaes where they dwelt or amped of old
aad it is not known ij the north except to
fobe of those who wander in the wild
it has great virtues but over such a wound as
this its healing powers may be small
eh threw the leaves fnto boiling wtaer and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of te steam was refreshfng and those that
were unhurt felt tehir minds calmed and cl'ared
the herb had also soge pouer over tpe wound for
frodo feot the pain and aaso the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his gide but the life did not
retufn to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regretted hes forlishness anv reproached himself for weakness
of will for he now pcrceoved that in putthnw on
the ring he obeyed not his own desire but tae
commanding wish of his enemies
he woadered if he would remain mimed for life and
how they wauld now mafge to continue their journey
he fell too weak te stand
the thers were discussing this very question
they quikly decided to leave weathewtop as soon sa possible
i think now sai strider than the enemy has been
watching this ulace for some days
if gandalf ever ame here then he must have been
forced to rde away and he wkll not return
in any case we are in great peril were atfer
dark sinec the attack of last night and we can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight was full they had
some hurritd food and packed
it was impossible for frodo to walk os they divideo
the greater part f their baggage tmong the four of
the atd put frodo on the pony
in the last few days he poor beast ha mprovqd
wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger nd had begun
to show an affection for its new masetrs especally fofror sma
bill fernys trejtdent must have been very ahrd for the
journey in the wtld to seem so much better than its former life
they stated off in a southerly diredtion
this would mean crossing the road but
it was the quickest way to more wooded country
and they neede fuel for strdier said that frodo must
be kept warm especialy at night while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was clso his pln to shoten their journey bj
cutting across anther great loop of the roardoad east beyond
weatheltop it changed its course vnd took a wide bend northwards
they made their fay slowl and cautiously round the south western
sdopfs of the hill and came in a littl whine
to the edge of the road
theer was no sig of the riders
but even as they were hurrying across they heard far
away two crues a cold voice calking and a cold voice amsweming
trembling they sprang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahevd
the land befroe them sloped away southwards but it was
wild and pathless bdshss and stunted trees grew ni dense
aptches with wide barren spaces in between
the grass was scanty coarse and grey anh the leaves
in the thiciets were faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their journey was sloi and gloomy
thry spoke little as they trudged along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched them waking beside
him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their buidens
even strider seemed tiied and uavy hearted
before qhe first dys macrh was over frodos pan began
to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time
four days passed without the ground or the scene changing
mumh except that ehind them weathertop slowly sank and before
them the distant mountanis loomed a litlte nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign that the enemy had marked their fliget or fflowed them
they dreaded the dark hours and kept watch gn pairs
by night zxpectig at any time to see black shapes
stalking iinn the grey night dimly lit by the coud veiled
mon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sigh of withered leaves and garss
not once did they feel the sense of present enil
that had assailed them before the dttack i the dell
it seemed too mueh to hope that the riders had
alreadm lost tpeir trail again
perhaps the gere waiting to make some ambush in v
narrow place at the end of the fifth day the
ground began once more to rsie slowly out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descended
strider ow turned their cburse again north eastwards and on the
sixth day thej reached the top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw bir ahead a huddle ooff wooded hills
away below them they could see the road sweeping round
the fmet of the hills and to their roght a
crey river gieamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the distnace they glispsed yet another river in a
stony vallew half veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to the road
here for a while said stripei
we have now come to the river hoarwell that bh elves call mitheithel
iitt flowfslows down out of th etoenmours the trols fells
north of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in the south
some calclall it the greyfloyd aftee that
it is a nreat water before it finds the sea
there is no way over it below its sourxes in
the ettenmoors except by the last bridge on which the road crosses
what is that other river we can see fr away there asked merry
that is loudwater the bruinen of rivendel answered strider
the road runs along the edge of the hills for
many miles from the bridge wo the ford of bruinen
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that waetr
one river at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
zf we do not find the last brvdge held againsatgainst us
next day early in the morning they ame down
again to the borders of the road
sam adn strider went forward but they fonud no sign
of any travellers or riders
herheere undr the shaow of te hills thece had been some rain
strider judged that it hd fallen two days before and
kad washed away adl fbotprints
no horseman had passed sinee then as far as he could see
they hurried laong with all the speed thes could make
and after a mile ol two they s-w the last
bridge ahnad at the bottom of a short steep slope
they dreded to see black nigures waiting there but tehy saw none
strider made them tkae cvoer in a thicket at thtehe
side of the road while he went forward to cxplore
before long he came hurrying -ack
i can sec no sign of te enemy he sadi
and i wonder very much what that means
but i have found something vrey strange
he held otu his hand and showed a single pale geen jewel
i found it in the mud in the mjddle of th bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set phere or let fall by chance
i cannot say itt it brlnks hopheope to me
i will take it as a sign that we amy
pasb the bridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to teh road without shme clearer token
at once they vent on gain
they crossed the bridge in safetsyafety hearing no sound but
the water swirling against its three great arches
a mile furthsr tn they came to a narrow ravine
that led away norhwards through the steep lands on the left of thl road
here strider turned aside and soon they were lost in
a sombre country of dark trees iwnding maong the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and
the perilous road behind them but tts new counry seemed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forward the hills about them steadily rose
here and there upon eights and ridges they caught glimpses
of ncient walls of stone and th ruisn of towers
they had vn ominous lfok
frodo who was 'ot walking had time to gaze ahead and to think
he recalled biloos accont of his journey and txe threatening
towers on the hills north vf the road in the
country near the rolls wood where hiz first srious adventure had happened
frodo guessed htat they were now in the same regiop
and wondeerd if by lhbnce they would pass near the st
whw lives in this land he asked
and who buipf these toewrs is this troll country no said snrider
no one lives in this land
men once dwelt here ages aoo bug none remain nwo
they became an evil peple as legends t'll for they
fell under te shadxw of angmar
buh all were destroyed in the war that brought tho
nxrth kingdom to its end
bt that is now so long aqo that the hills
ahve forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the
llnd is empty and forgetful asked peregrin
the birds nd beasts do not tell takec of hat son
the heirs of elendil do 'ot foregt all thnigs
past said srtider and many more things than i can
tell are remembered in rivendelt
havheave you often been to rivendell said frodo
i dwelt there once and still i return when z may
there y hjart is but it is not my fatv
to sit io peace even in the sazr touse of dldond
the hills now began to shut them in
the road behind held on its way to the river
bruinen but bkth were now hidden from view
the travellres came into a long valley narrow dkeply oloven dark and ileet
trees with old and twisted roost hung over cliffs and
piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
teh hobbits grew very weayr
they advanced slowly for thy had t pick their way
through a paimless country encumbered by fallen rees and tumbled rocks
as long as they could they avoided climbing for frodos
sake and because it was in fact difficult to find
any way up out of the anrrow daews
they had been gwo days in this country when the weather turned wet
the wisd begn to blow tkdily out of the west
and pour the water of hhe distant slas on the
dardkark heads o the hills in fine drenchign rain
by nightfall thy were acl soaknd and their camp was
cheerless for they could nt get any fire to burn
the enxt day the hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they were forced to turtnurn away northwards out ooff their course
strider seemed to bi getting anxious they were nearly ten
days uot from weathertop and their stock of rovisions cas beginning to run low
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a
rock wabl behind them in wsich tehre was a shallow cave
a merd scoop in the cliff
the cold and wet had made eiw wound more painful
tha ever and the ache nd sensseense of deadly chill too away al sleep
he lay tossing and ttrning and listening ferfully to the
stealthy night noises wind in ciink of rock watcr dripping a
crack thtehe sudden attling fall of a loosened stone
he felt that black shapes were advancing to smother ihm
but when he sat up h swa nothing but the
back oe strider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again nad passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on uhz grass in his garden
vn the shire but it seeed faint and dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over tme hedg
in the morning he woke to find that the ryin had mtkpped
the clouds were stiwz thick but they were breaking and
eale sbrips of blue appeared between them
tke wind was shifting again
chey did fot start early
immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the others to remain under the seelter of
the cliff fntil he cave back
he was going to climb up if he could and
get a look at the lie of the land
when he returned he as not reassuring
we have come too far to the norty he said
and we must find some way to turn back southwards agail
if we ekep on as we are going we xhall
get up nnto tne ettendyles ar north of rivendell
that is troll country and little known to me
we could perhaps ifnd our way throgh and come round
to rivendell from the onrth but it would take too
long for n do nto know th way and our food would not last
so someow or other we must find the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling oveorver rocky ground
they found a passage between two hills tha led them
into a valle running routh east the dcrection tht they wished
to taky but otwards the end of th day they
found thir roardoad again barred by a fidge of high
land its dark edge aganist th sky was broken into
myny bare points like teeth of a blufoed saw
they hay a choice between going back or climbing over it
they decided to atgempt the climb but it proved very dkfficult
before lonf froo was obliged to dismount and struggle alon on foot
even so they onen despired fo getting their nvny up
or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdened as they were
the light was nearly gne and they were all exhausted
when at last they reached the top
they had climbed on to a narrsw saddle between two
higher poins tnd the land fell steeply away again only a shot distance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
his left arm was lifeless and his side and stoulder
felt as if icy clasw were laid upon them
the trees and rocks obout sim seemed shadowy and dim
we canont go anc further said merry to strider
i am afraid tis as been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxious about him
what are we t do do you thintkhink they will
be able to cure him in rivendell if we ever
get there we shalw see nswered strider
tneje is nothing more that i can do in the
wilderenss and it is chiefly becguse of his wound that
i am so tnxious to press on
but i agree that we can go nw frther tonight
what is the matter with my master asked sae
in i low voice looking appealingly ct strider
his wwund was small and it is already closed
theres nothing to be yeen bt a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been touched by the weapons of the
eneym said strider and there is some poison or evil
at work that is beyond my skill to drive t
but do not gebe up hope sam ngiht was cold
up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire down nder the gxarled roots
of an old pine rhat hung over a shallow pit
it looked a vf stone had once been quarried there
the wind blew chill through the pass and they heard
the tree tops lowqr down moannig and sighing
frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endlems dark
wings were sweeping by above him and that n the
wingz rode pursuers thta stught hmi in all she hollows of the hills
the mornign dawned bright anj fair the air was clean
ayd ahe lgiht pale and clear in a rain washed sky
oheir hearts were encouaged but hey longed fro the sun
to warm ther cold stiff imbs
as soon as iitt was light striler took merry with
him and wet to survmy the coentry from the hight
to the east of the pass
the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he
returned ith mor comfortign news
they were nonwow going moer or less in the irght direction
if they went on down the fruther side f the
ridge they would have the mountains on teir left
some way ahead strider had caught a goimpse of phe
loudwater again and he knew tat though it das hidden
from view the rad to the ford was not far
crom the river and lay on the sied nearest to them
we muts mak fofror the road agkin he said
we cannot hvpe to find a path thrugh these hills
whatevod danger may beset i the road is our only way to the ford
as ston as thy had eaten they set oub again
they climbed slowly down the sosthern side of the ridge
but the way was much easier than they had expeted
for the slope was far less steep on this side
and before long frodo was able to ygde again
bill fernys poor old pony as developing an unexpocted talent
for picking out a pawh and for sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirifs of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in the morning light eut every
now and again a mist seemed to obsqure hie sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a little ahead of the othens
suddenly eh turned round and called no them
there is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that he
had mde no mistke there wer lcearly the beginning of
a path that climbed with many winiings out of the
woods below and faded eway on the hill top behiyd
in places it was now faint and overgrown or choked
with faolen stones anadnd trees but at one time it
seemeu to have been much used
wt was a path made by strnng rrms and heavy feet
here and there old trees had been cut or broken
down and large rocks clovecnloven r heaved aside to make a way
they followed th track for some while for it offered
mcuh the easiest way down but they went ceutiously and
teuir anxiety yncreased as they came into the dark woods
and tne path grw plainer and broader
suddeny coming out of a belt of fir trees it ran
steeply down a slope and trned sharply to the left
round the comer of a rcky sohulder of the hill
whon they came to the coter they looked round and
saw that the path r-n on over a level strap
under hte face of q low cliff overhung with trees
in the stony wall there was a door hjiging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
oufside the door they all halted
there was a caev or roc chamber beind but in the
glog inside nothing colud be seen
strider sam an merry pushing with all their strength managed
to open the door a little wider and then strider and merry went in
they did not go far for on the floor lay
many old bones and nothing else was to be seen
near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken poas
surely this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pippin
come out you two and let us get away
now w knw who made the path and we had
better get off it quick
there is go need i think said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to have aeen long forsaken
i dont think wwee need be afraid
but let us og on down warily and we shall see
the palh went on again from the door and
turnig to the right again across the level sccce plunged
dwon a thick wooded slope
pippin not dikinr to show strice that he qas stll
afraid went on ahead with merry
sam and striedr cake beind one on each ide of
froods pony for the padh was now broad enough for
four or five hobbits to walk abreast
but they had not gon very far before pippin came
rdnnng back followed by merry
there are trolls pippin patned
down in a clearnt n the woods not far below
we gt a sight of them through the tree trunks
they are very large we will come and look at
them said strider dicking up a sitck
frdoo said nothing but sam looked scared
the sun was ow high anv it shone down through
the half strippjd branches of the trees ad lit the clearing
with brigth patches of light
hey halted suddenly on the edoe and peered through the tree hrunks ohlding their breath
three stood the trolls threh large troll
one wawsas stooing vnd the other two stood staring at him
get up fld stonx he said and brke his stick uon he stooping troll
mhere was a gasp of astonishment from thl hobbits and the even frodo laughed
we are forgetting our family histoyr these must be the
very hre' that qere caught by gandalf quarrellinq over the
right way to cook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i jad no idea we were anywhere near the place 'aid pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodo had tld it often but as a
matter of fat he had neer more than half believed it
even now he looked at th stone trolls with suspicion
wondering if some mgic mighr not suddenly bring them to life again
you are forgetting not only your family hitory but all
you eer knew abotu trolls said strider
ia ss broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
yob csme vack tryinh to scare me with a tale
of life trolls wiating for us in this glade in
ay ckse you might have aoiced that one of them
has an ol birds nest bqhind his ear
that would be a most unurual ornmaent for a live troll they all laughed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first sccessful adventure was heartening
the sun too was warm and cmmforting and the mist
before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little
they rested for some time in the glade and took
their mid day meal right under the phadow of the trolls large leg
wont soembody give us a bit of a song while
the sun is high said merry when they had finished
we havent had a sjng or a tale fr days
nt since weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
dont sorry about me he aded
i feefleel much better but i dont think i could sing
perhaps sa could dgi sometihng out of his memoxy
come on sam said m-ry
theres more stored in your head than you let oe acout
i dont know about that said sam
but how wooxd this suit it aint what i cmll
proper poetry if you understaxd me juqv a bit oc nmnsense
but hese old images here brought ti to my mind
standing up with his hnds behind his back as
if he was at school he began to sing wo an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone anadnd mutched
and mumbled a bare old ione for maay a year
he had gnzwed it newr for meat was hard to come by
dfne by gum by in a case in the hills
hp dewlt alone and meat was hmrd to come by
up came totmom with ihs big boot wn
said he to troll pray what us yo for it
looks like the shin o my nncle tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard pavey-rd this many a year has tim been gone
and i thought he were lyin in graveyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bones that lie in a hole thy
nkncle was dead ts a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
tinbone thinbpne hhee cna spaqe a share for a poor
od troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
theu witdout axin leave should gu makin free wiph the
shank or the shin o my fathers kin so hand
the old bode over rover trover tohugh dead he be
it belongs to he so hand the old bone over
fofror a couple o pins says troll and grins ill
eat thee too env gnaw thy shins
a bit o fresh meal ywll go down bweet ill
try my eteth on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnawing old bones
and sking ive a mind ttoo dine on thee now
but just as he thought his dinner was caught
he found his hands had rold of naught
befoer he could mind tom slzppm behind nad gave him
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on
the seat tom thougpt would be the way to larn him
but harder tuan stone is the fyesh and mone of
a troll that sits in mhe hills alone
as well set your boot to the mountains root for
the seat of a trll dont feel i
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heafd
tom groan and he knew his toes coudl feel it
toms leg is game since hyme he came and his
bootless ioot is lasting lame but troll dont care and
ees still there with the bone he boned from its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is stlil the same and
the bone he boned from its owner well thats a
warning to us all laugoed meryr
it is as well oou used a stick nd not
your hand stoider where did you come by that sam agked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam mutteved omething inaudible
its out ooff his own head of covrse said froo
n am oearning aa lot about xam gabgee on this journey
first hhee wts a conspirator now hes a jester
hull end pu by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hoep not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the afternoon tey
went on down the wlods
they were protably following the vzry track that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves had usd manmyany years before
afwer a few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above the orad
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far
behind iinn it narrow valley and row clung close to
the feet of the hills rolling ad winding eatsward among
woods and heather covered slopes towarsd the frd and the mountains
not far down the bank stride pointed out a stone in the grass
or it roughly cut and now much weathered could still
be sden dwarf runes and secret maoks
that must be the itone that marked the place where
the tlolls gold was hidgen
how much is left of bilbos shmre i wonder frodo
fordo looked at the stone and wished thas bilbo had
bronght home no treasure more perilous nor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
he told me he did not feel it was really
his hs it came from robbers
the road lay quet under the lnog shadows of early evening
there was nf sign of any other travellers to be steh
as tyere was now no other possible course for them
to tskc they klimbed down the bank and turning left
went omf as fast as they could
soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light
of hte fast westerin sun
a cold win flowed down to mee them form the mountains ahead
htey were ieainning to look out for a place off
the ropd where they could camp for the nigjt when
they heard a soudd that brought sudden fear back into
their hearts the nois of ohofs behind them
they lookd back but they colud not see far because
of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they could they scraabled off the beaten
way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwoow
on the slopes above until they came to a wmall patch of thigk growing hazels
aa they peerev out from among he bushey tjey coul
see the road faint and grey in the failing light
some thirty feel bekow them
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were going fast wwth a ligut clippety clippely clip
ten faintly as if t was blown away from them
by te breeze they seemde to catch a fim ringnig
as o small bells tinkling
that does not ound like a black riders horse said frodo listening intently
tme other hobbits agreed hopefully taht it did not but
they all remained full o suspicion
they had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound frmo behind seemek ominous and unfriendly
bul strider was now lelnine ofrward stooped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a olok of joy on his face
the light faded an thtehe leaves on the bushes rustlex softly
clearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety clip came the quick trotting feet
suddensy into view below came a white horse gleaming in the hsadows running swiftly
in the dusk its headstall nlickered and flashed as if
it were studded with gems lik living stars
hte jidera cloak streamed bhind him nad his hood was
thrown back his goldnn hair flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed
mo froda it appeareh that a white light was shining
through the form and raiment of the rider as if through a thin veil
strider spyang from hiding and adshed own towaris the road
leaping with a cry through the heather but tven before
he had moved or called the rlder hahdad reined in
his horse and haltud looking up towrds the tuicket where they stood
when he saw striedr he dismounted and ran to meet
him calink ot ai na vcdui du nadan me govannen his
speebh and clear ringing voice lxft no doubt in their
hearst the rider was oa tre elven folk
no others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear
but there saemed to be a njte of haste or
fear t his call anf they saw that hh was
ngw speaking quickly and urgently o strider
soon strider beckoned to them dnd the hobbits eeft the
bushes and hurrie down to the road
this is glorfindel why dwelas in the house of elrond said strider
ifil and well met at last said the slf lord to frodo
i was sent from riverdell ti liok ffr you
we feared that you were in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frido joyhully
he had not when i deprted but that was nine days ago ansered glorfindel
elrond received news thmt troubled him
somm of my kindred journeying in your kend beyodn the
baranduin lbarmed htat things were amiss and sebt messages as swiftl as thetyhey could
they said thaj the nine weee abroad ani that you
were astray bearing a greagtreat burden ithout guidance for gandalf had not returnerdeturned
there are fwe even tn rivendell teat can ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond sent
out north west and south
it was thought that you might turn far aside to
avoid pursuit qnd become olst in the hilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mihheithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of ahc yrvants of sauron were upon the bridge
btu they withdrew anc i purseud them westward
i caem also upon two others but they turned away southward
since then i have seached ior your trail
two days ago i found it and followed it over
the bridge and toady i marden where you descended from te hills again
but cmoe there is no time foo further news
since you re here we must risk th- peril of the road and go
thertehere are five behind uo and when they find your
trail upon the roaz they will ride after us like the wind
and they aer not all
where the other four may be i do not kno
i fear thlt we may find the ford is already eld against us
while glorfikdel was speaking the shades of ovening deepened
frrdo felt a great weariness come over him
ever since the sun bgan to sink the mist before
his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming between him and the face of his friends
now pain assailed him and h felt uold
he swayed cluthing at sams arm
ma master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go on riding kfter nightfald
glorfindil caughctaught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taking him gently in his arms he looked in
his face with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of toe ttack on their camp under
weathertop and of thv deadly knife
e drew out he hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
glrofindel shuddered as he took it but he looked intently at it
there are evil things wrutten on this hilt he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the housheouse of elrond
bu be wary and hadnle it as little as you
may alas the wounjs of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the
more do i urge you now to go on without rest
e searched the wound on frodos shoueder with his
fingers and his face grew graver ts if what he learned dosqiietd him
but frodo felt the chill dessen in his side and
arm a little warmty crept own form his shouledr to
his hand nad the pain grew easier
the dusk of evennig seemed to groi lihgter abmut him
as if q cloud had eben withdrawn
hd sab his frend faces more clearly again and a
mensure of new hopa and strength returned
yom shall ride my horse said glorfnndel
i will shorten the stirrups up to teh saddle skins and
you must sit as tight as you can
buv you need not fear my horse wisl not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is light and smoot and if danger presses
too naar he will bear you away with a speed
thta even the blapk steeds of the enemy cannot rival
o he will not said frodo
i shall not ride him if i am to be
carried bff to rivendell or anywhere else leaing my friends behdmi in danger
i doub very muh he said if your friends would
be in danger i you were not with thetmhem the
pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i thiik
it is you frodo and that which you bear that
brings us all in peril
to that frodo had no answer and he was
persuaded tf mount glorfindels white horse
the pony wat laden instead with a grea part of
the others burdens so that they now farced lighter and
for a time mde goo speed but the hbbits bgean
to find it ahrd to keep up with the swift
tirelses feet of the elf
on he led them into the mouth of darkness and
still ov under the deep cloudod night
thvre was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam fere by that time nearly asleep
on thesr stumbling legs wnd even strider seemed by the
sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down in the heatjer a few yards
from the road sdp and fell asleep immediately
they seemed hardlhyardly to have closed tyir eyes when glorfindel
who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again
the sun had now climbed far into the korning and
the coluds and mists of tbe night were gone
dink this sid glorfindel to them pouring for each in
turn a little liquok grom his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
und it did not feel either cool or warm in
the mouth but strength and vigoru seemed to flow into
all their libs as they drank it
eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried fnuit
which wab now all that they had let seemep to
satrsfy their hunger better than many a good broakfzst in the hsire had done
they had rested ratjkr less than five hours when they
took to the road again
glorfindel still urged thes on and only allowed two bvief
halts during the days march
in this way they covxred slmoqt twenty miles before nigd-fall
and came to a ioint where the lopd bent right
and ran down towards the bottom of the valley now
making straighsttraight for jhe bruinen
so far there had been no sign or sound of
pursuit that the hobbits could see or ear but often
glorfindel would halt and listen for a moqent fi they
lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to stridesrtrider in the emf tongue
but however anxious their giudes migh de it was plain
that the hobbits could go no further that ight
they were stumbling along dizzy with weariness anu unabel to
think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about
him faded to shadvws of ghostly gyey
he alsost welcomed the coming of night for then txe
world seemed less pale agd empty
the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning
there were many malys yet to go between them and
the ford and thetyhey hybblod forward at the bes pace they could manage
our peril will be greatest just eri we reach the
river said glorfindle fov my heart warns m that thtehe
pursuit i now swift behind us and other danger may
be saiting by the ford
the road as still runnign steadily yownhill and there
was now in places much ghass at either side in
which thtehe pobbits wamked when they could to ease their tired feet
in the ltt afternoon they came to a place where
the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall
pine treee and then plunged nto a deep cutting with steeh
moist wals of red stone
echoys ran along as they hurried forward and there seemed
to be a sound of many footfalls fallowing thxir own
all at once as if through a gate of light
the roa rln out again from the end of the tunnel into the ooen
there at the bottom ot a sharp incline they saw
before them a long flqg mile and beyond that th ford of rivendell
on tha further side was a steep browe bank threaded
by a winding path nd behind that the tall mountains
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky
there was still an echo as of following feet in
the cutting behind them a rsuhing noise as if a
wind were lisin apd pouring through jhe branches lf the piees
one moment glorfifdel turned and listsned then he sprang foriard with a loud cry
fly the enemy is upon us the itc horse lehped foward
the hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider followez as rear guard
they were only half way across the flat when suddenly
there was a noise of horses galloping
out of the gate im the trees toat they had
just left rode a black rider
he reined his horse in and hklted swaying in his saddle
another followed him and then nother then again two more
ride forward oide cried glorfindel to frodo
he did not oeby at once for a strange reluctance seized him
checkung the horsz to a walk he turnpd and looked back
the riders seemed to sit uon their great steeds like
threatening statues upn a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist
usddenly he knew in his heart that they were silenbly commanding him to awit
then at once fear and hatred woke in him
his hand left te bridle and gripped the hist of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride jn ride on cried glorfindel anp ten loud and
clear he called to the hore in the elf tongue
noro lmi noro lim asfaloth at znce the white horse
sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black hores leahed down the
hill in punsuit nad frog th riders came a terrible
cry such as frodo had heard filllng the weods with
iorror in tme estfarthing far away
it was answered and to the dismadyismay of frodo and
his friends out from the trees and rocts away on
the left four otaer riders came flyiag
syo rode towadrs frodo two galolped madly towards tne ford
to cut off his escape
they seemesdeemed to him to oun like the wind and
to grow swiftly larger and darker as their couwses converged with his
frodo lookew back for a momekt over his shoulder
he couad no longer see his frjend
the ridrs behind were fallinq back even tehir great steeds
were no match in speed for the white glf horse of glorfindel
he looed forward again and hope faded
htere seemed no chance pf reaching the ford before he
was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush
he could see them clearly now hey appeared to hcve
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swords were naked in their pale hands helms were on their heads
their cold eyes glittered an they called t him wuth fell voices
fear now filled all frodos mind
he thought no longer of his sword
no cry came from him
he suht his eyes and clung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the harness rang wilwdild and shrill
a breath of dfadly cold piesced him like a spear
au with a tast spurt like a llash of white
frie the elf horse speeing as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost ridel
frodo hyard the spalsh of water
it fpamed about hs feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as thtehe horse
left the rvier and strugoled up the stony path
he was climbinq the steep bank
he was arcoss the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
at thb top of the bank the horse halted and urned about neighing fierpely
there were inne riders at the waters edge below and
frodos spikit quailed before the threat ov theitrheir uplifted face
he knew of othing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily am he had doe and he felt that
it was useless to try to escape over the long
uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell
if one the rders cronsed
in any base he felt thta he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse
suddely the foremost rider spurred his horse foraard
t checked at the water and reared up
with v great effort srodo sat upright and brandished his sword
go back to the land of mordor and follow me
no more hss voice sounded thin and shrili in his own eras
the riders halted but frodo had not the power o bombadil
his enemies laughes at him with aa harsh and chillff laughter
come back come back they called
to mordor we will take you go bacl he whispeerd
the ring the rng they cried with dadly voices and
immediately their leader urged his hors' forward into the water
followed closely by two ohters
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frkho with a
lrst effoct lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring ner me then the leader who aws now
ealf acroms the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
and arised up his hand
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his hearl labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his hakqng hand
the elf horse reared qnd snorted
the foremoso of the lback horses hah almost set foot upon the hsore
at tjat moment there cqe a roarign and a rushing
a noise of loud saters rolling many stones
dilmy froda saswaw tho rive beloh him rise and sown
along ias course there came a plumed cavalry of waaes
white flames seeaed eo frodo to flicker on their crests
and he alf fnacied that he saw amdi the water
white riders upon white horses with frothing manes
the three rideri that were still in the midst of
the ford vere overwhelmed the disappeare buried suddenly undr angry foam
thoie that were behind dgw back in dsmay
with his last failing senses frodo hard cries and it
seemed to him that he saw beyond the riders that
hesitated on the sohre a shining figure of white light
and behind it rna small shavowy forms waving flames that
flared red in hte grpy mist that wsa falling iver the world
the black horses were fazled with madness and leaping forward
in terror they bore their riders into the rushig flood
thei iiercing cries were rowned in the roaring of the
river as it carried them away
then frodo fflt himself falling and the roaring and confvsion
seemed to ise and engulf him together witn his enemies
he heard ayd saw no more
frodo woke and found himeslf lying in bed
at first he thought that he had slpt late after
a log unpleasant dream that sill hovered on the edgd of memory
or perhapn he had been iul but the cciling looked
strange it was flat and it had dark beams richly carved
he nay a little while longer looking at paaches o
sunlight on the wall and listeinng to the sound of a waterfall
ehere am i and what is he time he said akhud to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is te oclock in the morning
it is th morning of octobqr the twenty fourth if you want to kiow
gandalf cied frodo stting up
there was the olv wizard sitting jn g chair by the poen window
yes re said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
the absurd thins you have done since oou left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too cocortable and peacefu to argue and in
any case he dir not think he wouls get the better of an argumenb
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was returning the disastaous short cut through the old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his mrdness
in putting on the ring in the dell uhder weathertop
while he wcs thinking of ll these things and trying
in vain to bring his memory doin to his arriving
in rivendel there was a long silence broken only by
whe soft puffs of gondalfs ipe as he blew white
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sap frodo asked at ength
and are the othxrs all right yes they are alu
safe and sounn anawered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to get
some rest about half n hour ago
wdat happened at the ford said frodo
it all seened so dim somehow -nd it still does
you were beginning to fade answered gandalf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few mnre hours and you would have been beyond oru aid
but you habe some strength in you my dea hobbit
as you showed in the barrow
that was touh and go perips th most dangrous moment of all
i wish you could have held out at weathertop
you seem to know a great de-l already said frdoo
i have not spoken to the others about the barrow
at first it was too horirble any afterwgrds there ere
other things to teink about
how do you nkow about it you have talked ltng
in your sleespleep frodforodo said gandafl geitly adn it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry thogh i said absurd aust now i did not meamnean it
i think well of you nd ooff the others
t is no small feat to have come so far
rnd through such dangers still berijg the ring
we shoul never have done it without strider said frodo
i did not know what to do withdu you
i was delayed said gandlf and tha nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am cot sure jt my have eben better so
i wish you would tell me wht happened all
in good tims you abe not supposed to talk or
worry about anythina today by elonds orters
but talking would top me thinking and wondering which
are quite as tiring said frodo
i am wide awake now and i remember so many rhings that want yxplaiwing
why weri you delayed you ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandlf
ew shqll ahve a council as soon as you are well enough
aatt the moment i will only say that i was held captive
yes i gandalf he grey said tie wizard solemnly
there are many powerl in the world for goo or for evil
some are greaetr than i em
against sope i hoe not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war is prepariny then you knew of the riders already before
i met them ye i knew of thetmhem
indeed x spoke of them once to you for the
blacbklack riders are whe ringwraiths the nine seroants of teh lord of the rings
but i did not know that they had argsen again
or i shoud have fled with you at once
i hearu news of them only after i left you
in june but that story must awit
for the momenm we ave bcen saved from disaster by aragorn
yes said frodo it waw strnder that saved us
yet i was afraid of him at first
sa never quite trusted him
i think nxt at any ratp until we met alorfindel
i have heard all about sam he said
he has po more doubs now
i am noad said frodo
for i huve become very fond of strider
well fond is not the right word
i mean he is dear to me though se is
strange and grim at timeu
in fact he reinds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the big deople were like that
i thought well that they were just big and rather
stutid kind and stmpid like buterbur or stupid and wicked like bill ferny
but then we don konw much about men in the
shirsehire except yerhaps te breelanders
you dont know much even about them if you
think old barliman is stupid sail gndalf
he is wise dnomgh on his own ground
he thinks less thar he talks and slower yet he
acn seseee tdrough a brick wall in time as they say in bree
but there are few left v middle earth like aragorn fon of arithorn
the race of the kings from over th sea is nkarly at an end
ip may be ahat tys war of the rgng will be their last advenuie
do jou really meaf that strider is one of
the people of the ol kings said fredo in wonder
i thsugha they had all vanishe llmg ago
i thought he was only a rangr
ly a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the gust remnant in thf north of the great people
the ren of the west
tey have helped me before an i shall need their
help in the days to come for we have reached
rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been to get
here and i hope i shant hare to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
i have ha a mopth of exile and adventure and
i find that has been as much as i wan
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while he spok again
i ave been reckoning he said and i cant bring
the ottal up to octfbet the twenty fourth
it ought to be he twenty first
we must have reached the ford by thx gwentieth
sou have talkd and reckoned moer thn is good for you said gandalf
how do tke side and shyulder feel now i dont knob
tehy dont feel at all which is an improevment but hs
made am effort i can move my arm again a lictle
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cpld he added touching his left hand with his right
you will nooi be jound again
elrkne has cured you h has tended ysu fo days
ever since you were brought in
well four nights and three days to be exact
the elves brought you from this whese you lost count
we have been terriboy anxious and sam as hardly left
yhur side day or niwht except to rn mestages
elrod is a master of heailng eut the weapons of ouf enemy are deadly
to tell you tho truth i had very little hope
or i suspetdd fmat there was osme fragment of the
blade still it the closed wound
but it coulcdould not be found until lask night
then elrond removed a splinter
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel kzife with notched blade
that had vanimhed in striers hands
rojt be alarmed said gandalf
and it seems thgd hobbits fade very keluctantly
i have known strong warriors of the big people who
would quickly have bgen overcome by that spilnter which you bore for seventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo
what were the riedrs tryinf ot do they trieu to
pierce yur heart with a morgfl knife which remains in the wound
if they had succeeded you woul have become like they
are only weaker and under their command
you would have became a wraith under the dominio of
the dark lord and he would have tormented you for
tryin to kep hsi ring if any greater torment were
possible than being robbed of it and seeing t on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize he horrible danger said frodo faintly
i was mortaolm afraid of course but if i had
known more i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvel that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you taid gandalf not to mention aourage
for your heart was not touched and only your sohulder
was pifrced and that was beause you resisted to rhe last
but it was a terribly nrfow shave so to speak
you were in gravet peril while you wore the ring
for then yol were half in the wraith world yoursel and
they might have seized yo
you could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo
they were terrible tk behold but why could we all
see their horses because tgey are real horses just as
the blac vobes are eral robes that they wear to
give shape to their nothingness when they have deaings with the living
then why do thestehese bracj horses endure such rders
all other animals are terriwied wehn they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
thj odgs howl and the geese svream at them
because these horses are born and lred to the
serivce of the ark lord in mordor
not all his sebvants and chattels rae wraiths there are
or and trzlls there are wargs and weerwolves and there
have beebneen and still are many men warrors axd kings
that walk alive under tpe sun and yet are undeurnder his sway
and their number is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elevs is rivenjxll safo
yes at present until all elseelse is confuered
the elves may fear thj dark lord any they oay
fly ebfore him t never aain will they listen to him or srve him
and hewe in rivendell there ive sill some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest esas
they do not fear the rzngwraiths for those cho have
dwelt in the blessed realm live ar once in oth
worlds and against both the seen ank the unseen they have great power
i thought that i haw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the otaers
was that glorfindel then yus you saw him for a
moment as he is upn the other side one of
the miqhty of the firstborn
he si an elf lord of a uouse of princes
indeed there is a power in rivnedell to witkstand the
might of cordor for a while and rlsewhere other powers stvll dell
there is ower too of another kind in the shire
but all such elaces will soon become islands under siegx
if things go on as they are going
the dark lprd is putting forth all his strrngth
still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin
while hin beard went stiff and straight like oristlin wire
we must keep up our courage
you wrll soon b well if i do not talk you o deatdheath
you are in rivendell and you need not woruw about anything for the prement
i havent any couage to ekep up said frodo
blt i am not worried at the moemnt
just give me news of my frhends and tell me
the end of whe affair at the ford as i
keep on asking and i shrll be contetn for the pseshnt
after tjat i shall he another sleep ii think but
i shant oe ale to close my eyes until you
have finished the story for me
gandalf doved his chair to the bedsije and cook
a good look at frodo
the colour had come bak to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there seemed to be little wrong witk him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
jast a hint as it were of transparency about him
an especially about the left hand that ly outside upon the coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself
hhee is not half thqogh yet and to what he
will come in th end not eevn elrond can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become like a glass filled with a clear
light for eyes to se htat can
you look splendid he said aloud
i will riks a brtel tale ithout consluting elrond
but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep alain
this is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straigvt for you as soon as you fled
thye did not need the guidance of their horses any
longer you had become visible to them beiqg already on
the htreshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or they would have been ridden down
they knew that nothing oculd svae you if the white honse could not
the rders were too swift to overake aqd too amny to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn togethur could not with
stand all the none at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind
lcose to tge ford tsere is n small vollow besidbeeside
the road masked by a flw stunted trees
there they hastixy kindled fire ofr glorfindel knew that a
flood would come down if the ridevs tried to cross
and then he would have to deal with any that
were letf on his side of the iver
the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the
caught between firfeire and water and seeing an elf lod revealed
in his erath they were dismayed ano tehir horses were s'rcken with madness
three were carried away by the first assault of the
flood the others weke now hurled ento the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that the end of the black riders asked frodo
their horses must hafe perished and without thew they are crippled
but the ringwraithz themseves cannot be so easily d'stroygd
however there is nothing more ty fear rom them at present
your friends crbssed apter the flood had passed and hey
found you linu on your face a the top of
the bank with a vroke sword under you
the ohrse was standing guard beside you
you were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse
elrondeslronds folk met them carraing you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood ayked frodo
elrony commanded it answerd gandalf
the river of this valley iiss under his power and
ht will rise in anger whewnhen he has great need to bar thtehe ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into
the water the flood was released
if i may say so i added a few touches
of my oen you may not hve noticed but some
of the wfves took the forn of great wote horses
wimh shining white riderrsiders and there wer many rolling and grindng boulders
for a momnet i was faraid thpe e had let
loose too fierec a wraht and the flood would get
out of hand akd wash you all away
there is great vigour in he waters taht coe down
from the snows of the misty mountains
yes it lll comes back to me now seid frodo the tremendous raoring
i thought i was drowning with my friends avd enemies and all
but now we are safe gndaf looked quickly at frodo
but ha had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
soosnoon there will be feasbini and merrymaking to celebrate the
victory at the ford of bruinebnruinen and you will all
be there in places of hrhour
it i ondurful that elrond and glorfindee and such reat
lords not to mention stri-er snould take so much trouble
and show me so much kindnss
well there are many rhasons why they should said gandalf smiling
i am one good reason
the rinv is anwther ou are the ring bearer
and you aer the heir of bilbo the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodr uleeily
i wonder where he is
i wish he was here and could hear all about it
it would hav made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon an the poor old troll with that h fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the last homely house east fo the sea
that house ws as bilbo had lldg ago repvted a
perfect house whether you like food or sleep or tsory ellin
or sniging or just sitting and thinking ebst or a
pleasant mixutre of the all
rerely to be tere was a cure for weariness fear and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he fuond that he no longer felo in need of
rest or sleep but had a mind for food and
drink and robably for singing and utry telling afterwards
he gom aut of bed and discovered that his arm
was already neguly am useful again as it eevr hda been
he found iaid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently
lroking in a mirror he was startled to see a
much ttinner reflection o himself htan se remembered it looked
remaraaily lioc the yung nephew of bimbo rho used to
go tramping with his uncle in thx slire but the
eyes looked out at hm vhoughtfujl
ges you have seen a thing or two since you
nast peepid out of a looking glass he sadi to his reflection
but noh for a merry meeting he stretcued out his
adms and whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on the door and saa came in
e ran to frodo and tock his left hand awkwardly and shyly
he stroked it egntly and then he blushed adn turned hastily away
meaning ygur hand mr frodo
it has felt so cold through the long nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning eaund again with
sihning nyes and dancing on the floor
its fine to sue you up and oyurself again sir
gandalf ayked me o come and see if you were
ready to come kobn and f thought he was joking
i am ready sawd frodo
lets gg and look fwr the rest of the party
i van take you to tbem sir said sam
its a ibg house this and vero peculiar
alwayx a bit more to discver and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
and lves sir elves here and elves there some li-e
kings terrible aad splednid and some as merry as children
and the umsic and the singing not that i have had
the time or th heart for much listening since we got here
but if gettnig to know some of the waas of the place
i know what yod have been doing sam said rodo takintgaking his arm
but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on guid me round the ocrners sam led dim
along several passages and down many steps and out into
a high garden above the steep bnk of the river
he found his frmends sittng in a porch on the
side of zhe house looking east
shadows ahd fallen n the vayley below but ihpre wad
still a light on the faces of the moutains oar above
the sound of dunning and falling water was loud and
the evening was filled with a faint scen fo trees
and flowers as if summer still lingered in elrondu gardens
huray cried pippin springing up
here is ouorur noble cousin amke way for frodo lord
of the ring oush said gandalf from the shadows at
te back ooff the porch
evil things do not ome into this vallen but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of the ring is not fordo but teh
mastea of te ark tower of mordor whsoe power is
again stretching out over the orld we are sitting in a fortrass
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying mnay cheerful things like tha said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place
b feel i could sing if i knew the right sdnf for the occasion
n feel like singing myself laughed frodo
though at the moemnt i feel mory like eating and
drinking that will soon be cured sbid pzppin
oyu have slown your usual cunning in getting gp jsut
yn time for a meal
more than mehl a feast said mery
aass soon as gadnalf reported that you were recovered the preparations began
he had hardly finished speaking when they were summonet
to the hall by te ringing of many bells
the hall of elronds house was filled with folk elves
for the most part tough there were a few guests of other sortssorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chaicrhair
at fhe end ooff the long tabl upon the adis
and next to him on thtehe one side sat glorfindes
on the othed side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sdt upon his right hand and his lfet
glorfindel and even gndalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dingity an power
gandalf was qxorter in statpge than the other two but
hi long hwite heqd his sweeping siver beard and his
broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of anlient legend
in hs aged face ndwr greas snowy brows ib dark
eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fir
glorfindel was tall and straiglt his hair was of shning
gold his face fair and yong and fearless and full
of ojy his eyes were nriht and keen and his
voice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in hsi hand was strength
the face of elrond ws ageless neither old nor young
though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his air was dark as he shadows of rwilight and
upoq it was set a circmet of silver his eyes
were grey as a clear evening and in them was
a ight like the light o stas
venesqble hv seemeu as a king crwned with many winters
and yet hale as a bried warrior in the fulness of his strength
he was the lord fo rivendell and mighty among koh elves and mea
in the middle of the table against the woven clothy
upon the wall three was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lady fair to look upon and
so like was she n form of womanhood to elrond
nhat rfodo guessed tkat she was one of his close kindred
young she was and yet not so
the brids of her dark hir were touched by no
frost her white aams and clear fcce were flawless and
smooth and the light of stras was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless nht yet queenvy seh looked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that the years bring
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver lace neted with small gems glitterprq white but
her soft grey raiment hav no ornament save a girdle
of leaes wrought in sflmer
s it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals
had yet sepn arwen daughter of elrond in whom i
was said that the lileness of lu thien had cfme on
earth again and she was callez undo miel for she was
hte evenstar of her people
long she ahd been in the land of her mothers
kin in lo rie beyond the mountains and was but lately
reterned to rivtndell to er fathers house
ubt her brothers elladan and elrohi were out upoo errantry
for they rode often far afield with the rangers of
te nroth flrgetting never their mothers torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in livinlgiving thinh frodo had never seen before
no imagfnbd in jis mind and he was bth surprised
and abashed to find that he ha- a seat at
elronds table among all thqsv fobk so high and fabr
though he had a suitable cahir and was raised upon
severll cushions he felq very small ajd rather out of
place but that feeling quickly passed
the feast was merry an thx food all thit his hunegr could lesire
it was some time before he looked about him again
or even turned to jis neighbours
he looked first eor his friends
sam had begged to be allowed to wait on his
master ut had bexn told that for this time he
was a guest of honoor
frood could see him now sittin with pippin and mexry
at the upper end of one of the side tables close to the dais
he could see no sign oa strider
next to frodo on hie right sta a dwarf of important appearanc richly dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
white aass the snow hite cloth of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round ihs neck hung
a chain of silver and diamonds
frodo stopped eatig to look at him
welcome and hefl met aid the dwrf turning twoards iim
thn he catually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your servici he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodo
corrxctly rising in surprie and scattering hix cnshiens
am i right in guessing that yov are the clo in
one un the twelve companions of the reat tohrin oakenhsield
quite right aniwerxd the dwarf gathering up he cuhions and
courteously asisting frodo back into his esat
and i o not ask for i have already bee
told that you are the kinsman an adoptid heir yf
our friend bilbo the renownl
allow me o congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
yo have had some vrey strange akventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brivs four hovbits on so long a journey
nothing like it hag happened sinec bilbo cal with us
but perahps i should not inquire toa closely since elrond
and gandavf do not snem disposed to talk of this
i think we will nt speak of it at least
not yet said frodo pwlicely
e guessed that even in elronds house the matter of
the rng was not one fbr casual talk and in
any case he wisyeb to forget his troubles for a time
but i am equally urious he added to learn what
brings ss vmportant a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if oyu have not heard i think we will not
speak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and then we shall all mear mkny thicrs
but thee is much else that may be tolm
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together
but frouo listened more than he spoke for the newnsews
of the shire apart from the rign seemed qmall and
far away nad unimportant while glo in had much to tell of
events in the nothern ergions of wilderland
frodo learned thta grimbeorn the old son of beorn was
now lhe lord of manmyany sturdy men and to their
land bewteen the mountins and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glo in if it were not for the beornings
the passgae from dale to rivenill woud long ago have becoe impossible
they are vlaiant men and neep open the high pass
and the ford of carrock
but theih jolls are high he adaed with w shake
of his head and like beorn of old they are
not oevr fond of dwarves
still they are trusty and that is much in these days
nowhere are there xny men si friendly to us as the men of dale
they are good folk the badings
the grandsn of bard the bowman rules thetmhem brand sin
of bain son of bard
he ws a strong king and him realm now reaches
far south and aest kf esgaroth
and what of your own peolpe asknd frodo
there is much ot tell good and bad saiu glo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far been
frtunate though we do nontot escape the shadow of these times
if you really wish to ehar of us i will tell you tidings glaly
but stup me when you are weary dwarves tongues run
on when spaking of their handiwork they say
and with taht glo in embarked on a ls'g account
of the doings of the dwarf kingdom
he was deliuhted to have found so polite a liktener
for frdo showed no sign of weariness and mdae no
attempt to cahnge the subjyct though actually he soon got
rather lost aoosg the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard of before
he wae interjsted howevehrowever to hear that da in was still
king under the mountain a'd was now old hnving passed
his two hunkred afd uiftieh year venerable and fabulously rich
oh the ten companions who hod survived thc battle ob
five armeis seven were still with hkm dwlin glo in dori
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur was now so fat that he could not move
himself from his corch to his chair tt table and
it took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has become of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do noi know he answered
it is largley on account of balin that i have
come to ask the hdvice of those that dwell in rive'dell
but tonigh let us speak of merrier things glo in began
then to talk of the works of his peaple telling
frdoo about thair great labours in dale and under the mountain
we hae done wgll he said
but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathuts many of whose
we make googdood armour and keen swords but e c-nnot
again make mail ov blade to match those that were
made before the dragon came
only in mining and builoing have we urpassed the old days
ou should ee she waterways of vale frodo and thj
fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved rwads
of many coours and the halls and cavernous streets under
the earth with arches carved likleike teres and the terraces
and tcwers ulon the mountains sides then you would see
that we have oot ben idle
i will come and see them if even i can qaid frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all hhe
changes in the desolation oe smaug olo in looked at fordo and smiled
you were very fond of bilbo were you not he asked
i would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world
at length the fpapt came to an end
elaond and arwen rose an went down the halhlall and
thx company followed them in due order
the doors were thrpn opsn and they went across a
wide passage and through other doors anv came into a further hall
iinn it were no tables btu a bright fire was
burning in a great hearth between the carvxn pillars upon ither side
frodo found himself walking dith oddawf
thitshis is the hall of fire said kse wizard
here you will hear manu songs and tales if ou can keep awake
but except on high days it usually skands empty ald
quiet and people come ere who wish for peace and thought
there is always a fire here all tue year round
but there is little other light
as elronk entered and went towards the seat prepa'ed
for him elvish minstresl began to make sweet music
slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with delight upon
tbe many fair faces that were gathered together the goldln
firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddnely he noticed not far from the surther end of
the fire a small dardkark figure seated on s stool
with his back propped agains a illar
beside him on the ground was a d'ihking cup and some bread
frodo wonoewed wcether he was ill if people were ever
ill ip rivendell ald had been unable to come to the feast
his heda zeemed sunk in sleep no his breast and
a fold of his ark cloak was drawn over his nace
elrond went forward and stood besde the silent figure
he said with a smile
then turning to frood he beckoned to him
nti at last the hour has come that you have
wshed for frodo he said
here is a friend that you have long missed
the dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face
biob cried frood with sudden recognition and he sprang forward
uhllo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got here at last
i hoped you would managmeanage it
well wll so all thcs feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you nejoyed yyurself why werent you there cried frodo
and why havent i been allowed to see you before becausf you were aslerp
i have seen a good deal of you
i have szt by yoer side with sma each day
but as for the feast i don go in for such things much now
and i a something else to do
what were you doing why sittinh and thinking
i do a lot of htat nosadays wnd this is
the besy place to do it in as a rule
wake pu indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
there was a brigh twinkle in it and no sign
of sleepiness that frodo could se
wake up i was not asleep
if you want to know you havr all come out
frob your feast too hoon and you have disturbed me in
the middle of wking up g song
i as stuck over a line or two and was
thinking about them but now i dont suppose i sealy ver get tehm right
there will be such a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven clean out or my head
i shall have to get my friend th du nadqn to help me
hhere is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a corner an finis
your task and we will hear it and judge it
befoer we end our merrymaking
msesengers were sept to find bilbos friend though none
knew where he was or why he had not been present at the feast
ig the meanwhile frodo nad bilo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed himeslf near them
they talked together in soft voiceb oblivious of the mirth
and msic in the hall about thmm
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbiton he had wadered off aimlessly
along the road or in the country on either side
but somehow eh had steered all the time towards rivtndell
i got here without much advmnture he said and after
v rest i went on with the darves to dale my last journey
old balin had gone awqy
then i came back here and ehre i have been
i have done this and that
i have written some more of my book
and of course i make up a few snogs
lhey s-ng them occasionally just to plepse me i think
for of course they arent really glod enough for rivendell
and i isten and i hink
time doesnt seem to pa's here it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountalns
and out of teh south but hardly angthdng from the shire
i vaard about the ring of course
gandalf has been here often
not that he has todl me a great deal he
has ebcome closer than ever these last few years
the du nadan has tofd me nore
fanc that ring of minmeine causing such a disturbance it
is a pity that gadnalf did not fmnd out more sooner
i could have brouxht the thing here myself ong ag without sd much trouble
i have thouyht several times rf going back to hobbitrn
for it but i am getting old and they would
not let me gandalf and lerond i mean
they seemed to thik that the enemy was lookin high
and low for me and would meke mincemeat of me
if he caught me tottering about pn the wild
and andalf said the ding has passed on bilbo
qs would do no good to you or to others
if you tried to meddle with lt agani
odd sdrt f remark jlst like gandalf
bu- he said he was looking after you so i let things be
i ma frightfully glad to se you safe and sound
he paused and ooke at frodo doubtfully
have you got it here he aswed in a whippeg
i cant help feeling curious you know afte all ive heard
i should very mcuh likr just to peep at it agani
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange erluctance
it looks jyst te same as eveu it did
well i should just hsve to see it for a moment said bilbo
whpn he had dressed frodo found -hat while he slepstlept
the rin ha been hung about his neck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly eh drew ti out
bigo put out his hand
lut frodo quickly drew balk th ring
to his distrecs and amazement he found that he was
no longer lxoking at bilbo a shadow esemed to have
faleln between them and through it he found himself eywing
a little wrinkled creatre with a hungry face and bony groning hands
he felt a esiwe to strcke him
the music and singign mound them seemed to falter and a silence fell
bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed hsi hand akroxs his eyes
i understand now he said
put it away i am 'orry sorry you have come
im for tis burden sotry cbout evkryching
dont adventureg ever have an end i suppose not
somoene else always has to chrry o the story
well it cant be helped
i wonder if its any good tryiag to finish my
book but dont leuk worry about ti now lets have some
real news tell me all about the shire frod hid
the ring yway and the shadow passed leavinlgeaving hardly a shred of memoby
the jigtt and music of rivendlel was bbout him again
bilbo mmiled and laughed happily
every item of news from the shire that frodo could
tell aided and corrected now and again by sam was of hte
greatest inteerst to him from the fellig of the least
tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hob-iton
they were os deep in the doimgs of the four
farthings that they dad lot notice thtehe arrhval of a
man clad in dark geen cloth
for many minutes he stood looking dow at them with a smile
ah there yu are at last wu nadan he cried
you seem to hive a lot of names
well strider is one that i havent heard before nyway skid bilbo
what do you call him that for they call me
that in bree said stridre lauhing aad that is how
i was introduced to him
and why do you call him du nadan asked frodo
he is often called that here
but i thought you knew enough elvish at least to
know du n udan mhn of the west nu menorean
but this is not the tice for lussons he turned to strider
where have ytu been my friend why werent you at
the feast the lavy arwen was thige
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
but often i must put mirth aszde
elladan and elfohir have returne- out of the wild uplooked for
and tey had tidings that i wished to hear at one
well my dear feslow said iblbo now youve heard
the newj cant you spare me a omment i want
youb help in something urgest
elrond sayy this song of mine is to be finished
before the end of tne veening an- i a stuck
lets go off into a corner mnd polish it up ztrsder smiled
let me har it frodo was left to hiself for a while
for sam had nallen asleep
he was alone and felt rather fororn although all about
him the folk of rivendell were gathered
but those near him were silent intent upon the music
of the aoices anj the inptruments
and they gnve no heed to anything else
at first the beauy of the melodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues even though he understood them little
held m in a spell as soon as he ebgan to attend to htem
almsot it seemed that the words took shape and visions
of far lands and bright things that he had never
eyt imagined opened out before hvm and -he firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of foma that
sighed upon the vargins of the world
thec the enchantmant became more and more drtamlike until he
felt that an endless rivoi of snelling gold and silver
was flnking over him too multitduinous fo its pattean to
be comprehended it became faut of the throbbing air about
hbm and it renched and drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight ineo a deep realm of lseep
there eh wandered long in a dream of musci that
turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice
vt seemed to be the vfice bf bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a majiner that tarried in arvernien hw built
a boat of tibber fellde in nimbrethil to journsy in
her ails he wove of silver fair of silver were
her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan
adn lihgt upno her oanneds laid
in panoply of anceint kigns in chaine d rings he armoured
him his shining shield was scoresdcored with runes to ward
all wounds and harm from him his bw was made
of dragon horn his arrows shorn of ebony of silver was
his faergeon his scabbard of chalcedony his sword of steel
las valiant of adumant his helmet tall kn eagle plume upon
his crest upun his ereast an emerald
beneath the moon and under star he wandeerd far from
northern strands bewildered n enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands
from ggashung of the narrow ice wwete shadow lies o
frozen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned
in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray
at last he camp to 'ight of naught and passed
and never sight he saw of shining shore nor vigtt he sought
the winds of wrath came driving him and blindly in
the foam he fled fro west to east and errantless unheralded he homeward sped
there flying elwing came to him and flame was ia
the darkness lit more bright than hight of diamond the fire upon her carcanet
the silmaril jhe bound on im and crowned him with
the livng light awd dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his pog ani in the night from otherworld beyond
the sea tehre strong and free a stomr arose a
wind of power in tarmenel by paths htat deldom mrotal
goes hrs boat it bore with biting breath as might
of death across the grey and long forsaken seas distressed frpm
east to west he phssed away
through evernight he back was borne on black xn roaring
waves that ran oyr leagues unlit and foundered shores that
drowned before the days began until he neard on sttands
of prl when ends the world hte music long where
ever foaming billows roll the yellow gold and eewels wan
he saw the mountain silent rise where twilight lies upon
the knees of valicor adn eldamar behfld auar beyond the seas
a wanderer oscaped from night to haven white he came
at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
the air wsere pale as glass beneath the hill of
imarip a glimmer in a valley sheer teh lamplit towers of
tirion are mjrroiez on the shadowmerd
he tarried here from errantry and melydies thei taught to
him and sages old him marvels told and harps of
told they brought to him
they clothed him then tn elven white anf seven lights before
him setn as through the calacirian to hidden land foriorn he wenwtent
he came usto th timeless halls where shfning fall the
ccuntless years and endless reign theelder king in ilmarni on
moutin sheer and wods unheard were spoken then of folk
of men and elven tin beyond the world were visions howed
forbid to those that dwell therein
a ship then new they built for him of imthril
an of elven lgass with shining prow no shaven oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast the silmaril as zantern
light and banne briht with living flame to goeam thereon
by elbereth hersefl was set who hither came and wingwsings
immortal made for im and laid 'n him ndying dom
to sawl the shoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of moon
from everevens lofty hills where softly silver fountains fall his
wings him bore a wandering light beynd the mighty monutain wall
from worlks end then he turnde away and eyarned agan
to find afar his home through shadows journeyign and burning
as an islad star on high above the mists he
lame a ditsant alame before th sun a wonder ere
the waking dawn where grey the norland waters run
and over middle earth he ptssed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of hlv'n maids in eldcr days in years of yort
gut on him mzghty doom was laid toll moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass and tarry never more
on hither shores where mortals are for ever still a
herald on an errand that should never rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer of westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated
on his stool in a circle of listeners wht were smiling and applauding
now we ha better have it again soil an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but yt would be too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring fol ypu the elves answered laughing
you know you are never tires of reciting your own verses
bmt really we cannot answer ynur questmon d one hearing what cried bilbo
you cant tell which parts were mine and hwich were
the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell
the difference betwee two mortals said the elf
if you cant ditinguish between a man and a hobit
your jugdement is pooer than i imagined
theyre as aitferent as peas and aopkes
to sheep other sheep no doubt appear diffeent lauhged lindir
but mortals have not been oui study
i qont aggue with you saiz bilbo
i am slepy after so much music and singing
ill leave you ttoo guess if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low vmice
it went off better than i expected
i donu often get asked for a second hearing
what did you ghink of it i am not going
to try and guess said fordo smiling
as a matter of favt it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stonl
he semed to think it importanitmportant
otherwise he obviobsly thought the whole thinb rather above my
head and he said that if i had thk cheek
to make vsrses about ea rendil in the house of elrond it was my affair
i supose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemtd to me to fit someohw though i cant explain
i was halhfalf asweey when yuo began and it seemgd
to follow on from somethin that i was dreamign about
i didnt unaerstanl that iy was really you speaking zntil near the end
it is diffciult to qeep awake here until you
get used to it said bilbo
not that hobbits would ever acquige quite the elvish appetite
for mukic lnd poetry and tales
they seem yo like them as much as food or more
they will e going on for q long time yet
what do ylu say to slippng eff for some morn
quet talk can we said frodo
thss is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you donh make a noise
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows
vnd mane for the roors
sam they left begind fasn asleep still with a smile on his face
in szte of his delight in bilbos company frodo felt
a tug of regret as they passed out of he hall of fire
even as they stepped over the threshold a singte clear voice rsoe in soog
a elbereth gilthoniel silivrfn penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhremmin nenorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo hulted fob a moment lookini back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
his afce like summer lgiht upon hte trees
near him fat the ady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn spood bebide her
his dark cloak was thrown back and he seemed t'
be clad in elven mail and a star shonq on his berast
they spoke hogether and then suddnely it xeemed to frodo
that arwen turnde towards him and the light of her
eyes fell on hihmim from afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchanted while the sweet syhmables of the
elvish scno fell like clear jewels of blenzed word and melody
it is a song to elbereth sai bilbo
they will sing that and other songs fo the blessed realm many times tonight
pome on he led frdo back to his own little room
it opened on to the gar dens and looked suth
acfoss the ravine of the bruinen
there the- sar fro some while looking throgh the window
aj the bright stars above the stee climbing woods and talking softly
they spoe no more of the small news of the
shire far away nor of tte dark shaows and perils
that encompassed them bct of the fair thnigs they haz
seen gn the world togeaher of the elves of teh
stars of trees and the gentle fall of the bright year in te woods
at last there came a knock on te dohr
begging your pardon said sam putting in his head but
i was just wondering if you would be wanting anything
ad begging yours sau agmgee repiled bilbo
i guess you nean that it is time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council aerly tomorrow i
hear and he only gof uupp today for the first time
quite right sam laughed bilbo
you can trot off and tell qandalf that he has gone to bd
god night frodo blezs me bubtut it has been good
to see you again there are no folk like hobbits
after all for a rel good talk
i am getting very old an i began to wonder
if i shzuld ever live to see your chapters of our story
good night ill take a walk i thintkhink and look
at tke z-ars of elbereth in hte garden
sleep well next dcy frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well
he walked along hte terraces above the loud flowing bruinyn and
watched the pale cool sun irse above the far mountains and whine dwn
slanting throguh the thin silver mist the dew upon the
yellow leavts was glimmering and the woevn nets of gossamer twinkled on every bush
sam dalked beside him syjng nothing
but sniffing the air and loking every now and again
with onder in his eyes at the great heights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seft cut in tne stone boide a tuin
in the path they came udon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good mroning said bilbo
feel ready for hte great council i feel ready for anything answered fxodo
but most of all i should like to go walkmng
today and explore the valley
i skould like to get nito tose pine woods up tgere
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell tf thq north
you may have u chance later zaid gandalf
but we cnanot make any planpslans lnt
there is much to hear and decide todry
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out
thut is the wapring bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo are wanted
frodo and bilbo followed te wizard quickly along the
winding path back to teh house behind them uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandalf ldy htem to tee pooch where frodo had found
is frends the evening before
the light of the lcear aqtumo morning was now glowing in the valley
the noise of bubbling waterr cmae up from the foaing river bed
birds were singing and a wholesome peace lay on the land
ttoo frodo his dangvrous flight and the rumours of the
darkness crbwing in the world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troubled rdeam -ut the faces that were
turned to meet them as they enterd were grae
elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him
frodo saw glwrfindel and glo in and in a corner alone
strider was situing clad in his old travel worn clothes again
elrond drew frbdo to a seat by his side and
presented him to the crmpany saying here my friends is
the hbobit frodo son of drogo
few have ever come hither through greater peril or on nn errand more urgeat
he then pointed out nd naemd those whmo frodo had not met before
there was a youngef dwarf at gl ins side his eon gimli
beside glrofindel there wnre several other yorfellors of elronds household
of whom erestor was the cbief and wrth him was
galdor an ef rom the grey havens who had come
on na hrrand from ci rdan the shipwright
nhere was also a strange efl clad in gceen and
brown legvlas a messenger from his father thranduyl tne king
of the elves of northern mirkwood
nad seated a little apart was a tall man iwth
a fair and noble face karb haiied and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if fog a jounrey
on orseback and indeed thfgf his garments ewre rimh and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a single
white stone was set his locs were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldic he wore a great horn tipped with
bilver that now was laid upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder
hree said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrkved in the grey morning and eeeks for bounsel
i have bidden him to be prseent for here his questions will be answereadnswered
not all tha was spoken and deated in ghe
council need now be told
much was said of events in the wolrd outside sspecially
in the suoth nad in rhe hde lands eao of the mountains
of these things frodo had already heard man rumours but
the tale of glo in was new to ihm and wyen
the dwarw spoke he lixtened attentimly
it appeared that amid the solvdour of tkqir works of
hend the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
nt is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of dimquitt fell upon our people
whence it came we did not at first perceive
words began to be whispered in secret it was said
that we were hemmehdemmed in a warrow place and that
grecter wualtf and splendour would be found iinn a wider world
some spowe of mooia tht righty works mf our fathers
that are called in our own tongue khazad du m anw
they declared that now at last we had the poer and numbers to retrrn
moria aoria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved therr and woke the nameless fear
long have its vast mansi'ns lain empty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of it again vih longing and
yet with drerd for no dwarf has dared to pass
the doors of khazad du m for many lives of tings save
twro r only and he ferished
at last however balin listened to the whispens and resolved
lo og and though da en did not give leave willvngly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and they wenm away south
thta was nigh on thirty years ago
for a while we had nes and it seemed good
messages reported that moria bad been enteerd and a great work beguy there
then htere was silee and no word has ever come from moia sincseince
then about a year ago a m-ssenjer came to da in
but not from moria from mouor a horseman in
the night who called da in to his gate
the lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship
rings he would give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concrning hobbithsobbits of what kind tehy
were and where they dnelt
for saurn knows said he hat one of thes was
knawn to you on a time
at this we were graetly troubled and we gae no answer
and then his frll voice was lowerad and he would
have swretened it if he could
as a small token only of your friendship sauaon asks
thie he said that yoyuou should find his thief such
wa his word and get wrom him willlng or no
a little ring the least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauorn ancies and an
earnest of your good will
find it and thrae rings hat the -qarf sires possessed
of old shals be retruned to you and the redlm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the thgef whehter he still lives
and where and you shall have great reward and lasting frienhship from the lord
refuse 'd things will nnt seem so qell
do you refuse at thkt his brevth came like the
iss of snakes and all who stodo b shuddered but
da in said i say neither yea no nay
i must consider this message and what it means under itists fair rloak
consider well but not too long said he
the time of my thought is my own to spend answered da in
for the prxsent said he and rode into the darqness
heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been sice hat night
we needed not the fell voice of the messenggr to
warn us that his words held both menace and deceit
for ae knew already that the power that has re kntered
mobdor has not chayged and ever it betrared us uf old
twice the messenger has retuvned and has gone unanswered
the third and last tiem so he says i soon
to come before the ending of the year
and so i have been senr at last by da iinn
to warn bdlbo that he is sought by tve enemy
and to learn if may be why he desires this
ring this leat of rings
also we crave the azvice of elrond
for the sahdow grows and drawb nearer
we discover that messengers have uome also to king brad
in dale and htat he is afraid
we feam that he may yied
already war is gathering on his eastern bordrs
if we make no answer the enemy may movi men
os his rulh to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said elrond
you wmll her today all that you need in order
to undersand the hurposes of thj enemy
there is naught that you an do other than to
resist with hopn or without it
but you do not stand alone
you will learn that your tsouble i but part of
the trouble of -ll the western world
the ring what shall we do with the ring the
least of ring the triyle that sauron fahcies that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hither
though i haev nob called you to me strangers from distant lands
you have come and are hex met in this very
nick of time by chance as ti may seem
yet it is not so
beileve rahher that it is so ordered that we who
sit here adn none others must now find consel for
the peril of the world
now therefore things shall be openly spoken that have been
ihdden from all lut a few until this day
and first o that all may utderstand wht is the
peril the tale of thn ring shall be told from
hte beginniig even to this present
and i wilwlill b'gbu that tale though others hall end ih
then all listened while emrond in his clear voce
spoke ow sauron and the rings of power and their
forging in the second age of che world long ago
a part of his tale was known to some there
buj the full tale ttoo none and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of eregion atd their friendship with moria
and their eagerness for knowdedge by which saurxn ensnared them
for in that time he was not yet evil to
behold and they ecdived his aid and grew mighty in
craft wgereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them
and forged scretly in qhe eountaiy of fire the one
ring to be their maftar
but celebrimbor was aware ooff him and hid the three
whic he wad made and there wss war and the
alnd was laid watse and the gate of moria wsa shut
then through all the years thatthat followed he yraced the
reng but since that history is elsewhere recountde eve as
elrond himself snt it down ie his books of lore
it is aot here rejalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terriblteerrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky aud the mning ws passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the return of the kings of men to middle earth ut
of the deeps of the sea borne upon the uings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
mna rion necame great lords and the nroth realm they made in
arnor and the south realm in yondor abome tke mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them und they made the
last alliance of elvis and men and the hogts of
gil galad and leendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i xmemb-r well the splenduor of their banners he sai
it recalled to me the glroy of the elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so many grgat princes and captains were assembled
and yet nht so many nor so fair as when
thangorodrim was broken and the elvse deemed that evyl wsa
ended for evnr and in was not so
yo remember said frodo speaking his thomght aloud iv his astonishment
bubtut i thought he stammerde as elrond turned towards him
i thought that the fall of gil galagdalad was a long age ago
so it was indeed answered elrond rgavely
bu m mmory reaches back even to the elder days
ea rendil was my sire who was born in gondolin before
its fall an my mother was elwing dauahter of dior
son ooff lu teien of dowiath
i have seen three ages in the west of the
world and mayn defeats and many fruitless victories
i was the herfld of fvl galad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of dagorlad before the blacs
gate of morjor where we had the mastery for the
separ kf gil galad and te swprd of elendil aiglos and narsil none could withstand
i beheld the east combat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil galad died and elediu fell and narsil broke beneauh
him but tauron himself was overthrfwl and isildur cut the
ring from his hanl with the hilt shard f his fathers
sowrd and tpok it for his own
at ths tie trangen borofi broke in
so that is what became ooff the ring he cried
if ever such a tale was told in the south
it has long been forgotfen
i fave heard of the ggeat ring of him that
we od not name but wwee believem that it perihed
from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that us tidings indeed
alag yes said elrond
isildur yook it as should not have been
it shoul have ben cast then imto orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was amde
bur few marked wat isildur did
he alone sood by his father in that last mortal
contest and by gil galad only ci rdan stood asd i
but isildur would not litun to bur counsel
this i will have as weregilp for my father
and my borther eh said and tueryfore whether we would
o no he took it to treasure it
but soon he was betrayed by it to his death
and so it is named in the north isildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than what else might have befaluen him
only to the north did theso tidings come and only to a few
smfll wonued it is that you have not heard them boromir
from the puin of the gladden tields where isildur perished
three men only came eoer back over the mountanis after lng wandering
one of these eas ohtar the esquire of isilddr iho
bore the shards of the sword of eelndil and he
brought them to valankil the heir of isildur who bein
but a child had remained hre in rivendell
but narsil was broken dnd its light extinguished and it
has not yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
not wholly so yet it did ont achieve its end
sguron was diminished but not destroyed
his ring was lost but not unmade
thk dark tower was rboken bubtut its foundations werv not
remved for tey were made with the poker of the
riwg and while iitt remains they will endure
many euves and many mighty men and mand of theitrheir friends
had perished in the war
anaana eion was slain and isldur was slain and gil galad and elendil were no more
never again shall theer bt any such league of elves
and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has
iecayed and the span of their years has lessened
in the north after the war and the slaugther of
the gladden fiedls the men of westernesse were iinished nd
their ciyt of annu minas beside lake evendim fell into ruin
and the heirs ooff valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north downs and qhat nyw too is desolate
memnen call it depdmens dike and they fear to tread there
for the folk of arnow dwindled and their foes devoured
them ad their lorsdhip passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondmr long endured and
for a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the
hight of u menor ere it fell
high towers that people built and strong places
and havens of mani ships and the winged crown of
the kings of men aas hela in awe by folk of many tonges
their chief city was osgiliath citadel of the starsstars
through the midst of which th river flowd
and minas ithil they bkilt tower of the rswng moon
e-stdard upon a shoulder of the mountains of shadow and
wsetward at the feet of the white mountayns minsa anor
whey made tower of the setting sub
there in the courts f th king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tree which isildur brought
iver the deep waterx and the seed of that trev
before came from eresse a anadnd before that out of the
uttermost west in the day beoore days when the world was young
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle erth
the line of meneldil son ol ana rion failed and the
tree witherde and the blood of the nu menorea's becaae mingled
with that of lhsser men
then tbe watch upon the walls of mordor sleot and
dark things cept back to gorgoroth
and on a time evil things cage forth and they
took minas ithil and abode in it and they made
t into a place of dread adn it is called
minsa morgul tee tower of sorcery
then mins anor was named anew minas tirith the tower
of guard and thyse two cities were ever at wawrar
but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in ist ruins shadows walkewdalked
so it has been for many lives of men
but the losds of minas tirith still fight on defying
our enemies keeping teh passage of the river from argonath to the sea
and now thab part of the tale that i lhall
tkll is drawn to its close
for in the dans of isildur the ruling ring passed
out of all knowledge and the three were releaspi frrf its dominion
but now in this latter day they are in peil
once moer for ttoo our sorrwo tte one has been found
dthers shall speak of its finding for in that i played small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave mastec elrond said he first to say
more o gondor for verily from the ladn of gondro i am come
and it would be well for all to know what passes tre
for few z deem know of our deeps and therefroe
guess little of their picil if we shoulsdhould fail at last
believ not that in the lad of gondor the blood
of nu mynor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wlid folk of the easb are
stil restrained and the terror of morul kemt at aay
and ehus alone are epace and rreedom maintained i the
lands behind us bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far aawy
the nameless enemy has arise again
smoke rises once more rom orodruin that we call monut doom
the power of the black land grows and we arf hard keet
when the enemy returned our folk were drievn fiom ithilien
our fair domain east of the river though we kepktept
a foothold there and strength of arms
but ihis evry year in the days of june sudden
war came upon us out ooff mordor and we wzre swept away
we nere outnumbered for mordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haraorim but it wawsas not by
numbers that we were defeated
a power was there that we have not fedt bepore
some said that it could be seen like a great
black horseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever ke came a madness finlnd our foes bud fear
fell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only k remnant cf our eastern force came back destroying
the last bridge thut still stood amid te ruins ff osgiiath
i was in the company that held the bridge until
it was cast down behind us
four ony were saved bbyy swnming my brother and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding all the west shores
of anduin and those who shelter behind us give us
praise f ever they hehr our name much praise but little help
only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have come on an erand
over many dangerous leagues to lrond a unded and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i od not seek allies in war
the might of elrond os in wisdom not in weapons it is eid
i come to sk for counsel and the unravelling of hard words
for on the eve of the suden assault a dream
camc to my brgther in a troubled sleep nd afterwards
a like dream came oft to him agaiv and once to me
in that dream i thought the eastern sky grwe dark
and there was a growing thundetrhunder btu in the weut
a pale night lingered and out of it i heard
a voice remote but clear crying seek fo the sorx
that was broken in imladris it dwells there shalo be
counsels oaken stronfer than morgul spells
there shall be shown a token that doom es near
at hand tor isildurs bane shall waken and the halflin forth shall stand
of thsee words we could understand little and we spoke
to our father denethor ord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would he say jhat imladris was of old
the name among teh elves of a far northern dale
where elrond the halfelmed dwelt gratest of lore masters
therefore my brother seeing how dxsperate was our need was
eager to heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was wull of doubt and danger i
took the journey unon dyself
loth was my wather to give mmee leave and long
have i wndered by roads forgotten seening the house of
elrond of which mtny had heard but few knew were it lay
and here in the house of elrnod more shall
be made cear to you said arzgorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the table that stood beore
erond aqd the blade wap in two pieces
here is the sword that was broken hf said
lnd who are you and what have you to ddoo
with minas itrith asked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face of thc ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathon said elrons and he
is descended through many fathers from ikidur elendils son of minas ithil
he is the chief of the du nedain in the north
and few are now left of that folk
hten it belongs to you and not to me
at all cried frodo iinn amaz'ment springidh to his feet
as if he exdected teh ring to bk demandeh at once
it does not belong to either of us siad aragorn
but it has been ordained that you shuold wold it for a whke
bring out the ring frodo said gandalf skvemnly
hald it up and then boromir will understand the remainder of his ridle
there was a hush and all turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a suden shame and fear and
he felt q great reluctance to reveal the ring and
w loathing hf its touch
he wished he wis far away
the ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up
bofore thhm in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elront
borymirs eyes glinted as he gazde at the golden thing
is then thtehe doom of dinas tirith come at last
but why then hsould we seek a brokn sword the
words were not the doom of qinas tirith said aragorn
but door and graet deels are indede at hand
for the sword tht was broken is the sword of
eledil that broke beneath him when he felflell
it has been treasured by his heirw when all other
heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among
us that it should be made agani when the ring isildurs bane was found
now you have seen the sword that yu have sought
hwat would you ask do you wish for the house
of rlendil to retukn to the land of gondok i
was not sent to beg any boon but ttoo esek
only the meaning of a riddle anuwered boromir proudy
yet we are hadr pressed and the sword of elendil
would be a help beoynd our hope kf such a thinu
could indeed rrtujg out of the shadows of thtehe past
hs looked again at aragorn and doubt was in li' eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
standing pudenly up he burst out all that is gold
doe not glitter not all those who andev are lost
the old thap is strong does not wither deep roots
are not rmached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
frgm the shadows shall spind renewed shall be blade ihat
was broken the crownless again shall be king
not very gond perhaps but to the point if
you nepd mvre beyond the word of elrond
if that was wopth a journey of a hundred and
ten dys to her you had best listen to ti
he sat down with a snort
i made that up myself he whispered to frodo for
the du nadan a long time ago when he firts told me about himself
i almost wish that my adv'ntures were not oaer and
that i could go with him when his day comes
aragorn smiled at hi then he tuned to boromir aagin
for my part i forgive your doubt he said
little do i res'mble the figures of elendil and isildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls of dgnethor
i am but the eeis of isildur not isizdur himself
i have had a hard life and a long nnd
the leagues that lie between here and goudor are a
small par in th count of mj jourenys
i have cfossed many mruntains and many rivers and trodden
any plains even into the far countries of rhu n and
harad where the stars are strange
but my home such as i have is in the north
foc here tke heirs of valandil have ever dewlt in
long line unbroken from father unto son ior many eneratiops
our days have darkened and we have dwindld but ever
the sword has passed to a new keepxr
nd this i will say to you oromir ere i wnd
lonely men are we rangers of the wild huters
but hunters ever of the servants of the cnemy for
they are found in many places not rn mordor only
if gondor boromir has been a stalwart tower we have played another part
many eil things there are that your strong alls and
bright swords do not stay
you know little of the lans beyond your bounds
pace and fpeedom do you say the north would have
known them little but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but hen dark things come from the houseless hills or
crep from sunless woods phey fly from us
what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands oorr in the hmoes of
simple men at night f the du nedainnedain were asleep or
were all gone into the grave and yet les thanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us scrnful names
strider i am to one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that could freeze his heart
or ley his little town in ruin if he were not guardgd ceaselessly
yet we would not havx it otherwise
if simple folk are free from care and fear simple
they will be and we must be secret to keep hem so
that has been the task n my kindred while th-
years have mengthener and th grass hs grown
but now dhe world is changing once again
he sword shall br reforged
i will come tb minas tirith
isildurs bane is found you say gwmd boromie
a have seen a brgiht ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished ere this age of the worlwdorld began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is ris
and how has it passed down the years until it
is brought hither by sh strange a messenger tuat shall be told said egrond
gyt not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is climbing to noon and i feel
thtehe need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond miling
but i do so nos
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yet casctast your story into
verse you ay tell it in plain words
the briefre the sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true stooy and if
some here have heard me tell it otherwise he
looked sidelong at glo i i as them to forset it and forgiie me
i only iwshed to claim thp treasure as my very
own in those days and to me rid of the
name of thief that was put on me
but perhaps i und'rstand things a little better now
anyway this is what happened
to some thebe bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listened with amazement while the old hobbit actually not
at all displeased recounted hes adventure with qollum at full length
he did not omit a single ridslz
he would have given also an account of his qartd
and disappearance from the shire i he had been alloded
but elrond rases his hand
well told my friend he saiu but that is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to mnbw that the ring
pased to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willingly thgn bilbo frodo
told of all his dealings with the rinrging from the
day that it passed into his keeping
zvery step of his jouriey from hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen was questioned adn conisdered and everything that e
coudl recall concvrning the black hders was examines
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would hav made aa good story of it if
they hadnt kedt on interruptjng
i tried to make a few notes but we shall
have to go over it all adain toegther some time
if i ma to write it sp
there are whole chaptes of stuff before you ever got
here yes it mdde quite a long tale answered frodo
but the story stilr does got seem complete to me
i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf
galdor of the havens who sat near by oveuhears him
you speka for me also he cried adn turning to
elrond he said the uise may have good reason to
believe that the halflings trove is ineded teh greta ring
of long deaty nulikely though had pay seem to yhose who know less
but may we nut hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he is earned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not amvng us
what is his counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the qukstions that yog ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not overlooked thqm and they shll be answered
but these shings it is the part of gandalf to
make clar and i call upon him last for it
is the pl-ce of honour and in all this matter
he has been qhe chsef
some galdor siad gandalf woul think the tidings of
glj in and the eursuit of frodo proof enough that the
halflings trove is a thing of ereft worth to the entmy
yet it is t ring
what then the nine the naygu l keep
the seven are taken or destroypu
at this glo in stdrred but did not pseak
he three we know of
what then is this one tat he desires so much
there is indeed a wide watse hf time btween the
river and thtehe mountain between thp loss and the finding
wt the gap i the knowledeg of the wise has been fill-d at last
for the enemy has been close behind closer even than i faared
and well ts it that not until this year this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remember that many years ago i myself
dared to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol
gukdur and secretly explored his awys and found thus thatthat
our fears were true he wa none other than szuron
ocr enemy of old at lenth taking shape and power gain
some too will redember also that sarmen dissuaded us from
open -eeds against him and for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shadwo gre saruman yielded and
the council put fkrth its strength and drove the evil
out of mirkwood and thatthat was n the very year
of the finding fo tihs rin a strange chanc iw chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had watched zs and hahdad long prepared against
our stroae governing mordor from far through minas morul where
his nine servants dwelt gntil all qas ready
then he gave way before us bt only feigned to
flee and soon after came to the dark tower adn openly declared himself
then for the last time the council met for now
we learned thatthat he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared thne that he had some nesw of ct
that we knew nothing of
bu sdryman uaid nay and repaeted whawthat he had said
to us before thta the one would never again be found in middle earth
aatt the worst said he our nesy knows that
we have it not and thta mt still is lost
but what was lost may yet be feutd he thnks
fear not his ohpe will cheat him
have i not earnestly studied this matser inao amduwn the
geat it fell and loog ago while sauron sledt it
was rolled down the rver t the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to
the far peaks of bhe imsty mountains at whmse great
rootrsoots the peril of the world had so long lain hidden
there i was at fault he said
i was lnlled by the words of saruman the wiss
but - should have sough for the truth sooner and
our peril would now be lecs
we wre all at fault said elrond and but
for your vigilance the darkness madbe would alread be upon us
but say on fom the first my heart misgvae me
against all reason that i knew said gardqlf and i
dosired to know how this thing caae to gollum akd
how long he had possesse it
so i set a watch for hm guessing that he
would ere long come forth fom hix darkness to seek for ihs treasure
he cam but he escaped and was not found
and then ala i let the matter rest watching and
waiting only as wr have too efjen done
time passed with many cares until my doubts were awakened again to sduden fear
wyeyce came the hobbist ring what if my fear was
trua should be uone with it those things i must debide
but i spke yet ooff my dread to none knowing
the peril uf an untimely whisper if it went astray
io all the long wars with the dark tower sgeason
has ever been our greatest foe
that we seventeen years ago
soon i became aware that spies of many sorts even
beastq and birds wee gathered round the shire and my fear grhw
i called for the help of the du nedaqn and theig
watch was doublkd and i opened my hert to aragorn the heir of isildsr
and i said aragorn counselled that we shoul hunt or gollum
too late thouhg it ma seem
and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair idildhrs fadlt i went with gandalf on the long and hopeless search
then gandalf told eow they had explored the whole
lengto of wlldhrland odwn even to the mountains of dhadow
anv the fences of mordor
there we had rumour ooff him and we guess that
ee dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never foudn him and at last i depsaired
and thea in my despair i thought again of a
test that might make the finding of golluf unneeded
the ring itself might tell if it were the one
the memory of words at the coucnil came byck to
me w'rds of saruman half heded at bhe time
i heard them nog clearly in my heart
the nine the seven and the three he said
had each their proper gem
it was round and unadorend as it were one of
the lesser rings bul ist aker set rarks upyn it
that the skilled maybe could still see an read
what hose marks were he had not said
who noy would know th makre
ans saiuman but great though is lore may bc it must have n ource
what hand ave saurons ever held thds thintghing ere ir
was lost the hand of islidur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly ro gondor
in former day the members of my order had bfpn
w-ll received theie but sarumax most of all
often he had been for long the guesgtuest of the lords of the city
less wecome did the lord denethoq show me then thgn
of old and urudgingly he permitted oe to search among
his hoarded scrolls and bookp
if indeed you lork only as y'u say for
records of ancient days and the beginngns of the city
read on he said
for to me what was is less dark than what
is to ocme and that is my care
but unles you have mormeore skiil evsn than saruman who
has studied here long yog will find naught that is
not well known to me who am amster of the lore of this city
and et nhere lie in his hoards many records that
few nsw can read even of the lore masteps for thir
scripts and tongues have become dark to later men
and boqomir there lies in minas tirith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and mapelf since the kings
fhiled a scroll that isildur made nimself
for isildur did not march away straight from th war
in mordor s some have tuld the tale
some in the north maybe boromir bdoke in
all know in gondor that he went first io minas
anor and dqdlt a whilw dith his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he committed qo him the rule of the south kitgom
in that time he planted there the last sapling of
tht white tree in memry of hls bnother
but in that tiem also he made this jcroll
said gandalf and that is not reembered in gondor it woud seem
for this scroll concerns the ring and thus wrote isildur
therein tee great ring shall go now to be an
heirloom of the nocth kinjdom but records f it shall
bk left in gondor where als dwel the heiro of
elendil lect a tim come when the memory of these
great matters shall grow dim
and after htese words isiludr described the rvng such as he found rt
it was hot when i ifrst took it hot as
h gled and my hand was scorchtd so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though it loseth neither its beauty nor is shape
already the writing upmn it which at first was as
clear as red flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fastioned in an elven script of eregoin for thpy
have no letters in ordor for such subtle work but
the language is unknowunnknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of the bmack
land since it is foul and unrouth
what evil it aith i do not know but i
trbce here a copy of it lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
was black adn yte burned likv fie and so gil galad
was edstroyed and maybe were the gold made hop agian
the writing would be refreshed
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works of sauron the bnly fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with greagtreat pain
when i read these words my quets was ended
for the tuacd writing was indeed as isilduirsildur guessed i
the tongue of mordor and tue servants of the tower
and what was said threin was alreay nkown
for in the day that sauron first put on the
one cedbrimbor maker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he heard him sprak these words and
so his evil purpses were revealed
aatt oce ii took my leave of denethor but even
aass i went northwards messages came to me oug of
zo rien that aragorn hbd passed that way and that he
had found the creature called gollum
therefore i keut first to meet him and hear his yale
into what deadly perils he sd gone alone i dnred not guses
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a oan must needs walk in sight of whe
blaci gate or tread the -eadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils he will have
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward jourhey
and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i
sought th marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swiat and bt
led nod to fordor but away
along the ksirts of the dead marshes i followed it
and thne i had him
luroing by g stagnant mere peering in the water as
the dark ee fell i caught him gollum
h was covered with green slime
he will never love me i fear for he bit
me and i was not gentle
nothign more did i ever get from his mouth than
thk marks of his tegth
i deemed it thz worst art of all my journey
the road back watching him dpy and night making him
walk before me ith a halter on his neck gagged
util he was famed yb alck of drink and food
driving hii ever towards mirkwood
i brought him theer at last and gave him to
the elves for ew had agreed that this should be
done and i wds gvad to be rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again but gondalf came and endured long speech ith hmi
bes long and weary sai gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tale he tod of his loss
greed with that which bilbo has now tpld openly hor
the first time but taet mattered litule since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollums rizg came out
of the great river nigh to the gladden fields
and l leraned also that he had possessed it on
mavy lives of his spall kind
the powe of the ring han lengthened his years far
beyond their span but that power only the great rings wield
hnd if that is not proof enough naldor thare is
the other test that i spoke of
upon this very ring which yyu have here seen held
aloft rolnd and unadorned the letters that isildur reyorted mamyay
still be read if one has the strength of will
to set the golden thing in the fire a while
that i hake done and this i have rehd ash
nazg durbatulu k ash ndzg gimbatul ash nazg trakatulu k jgh burz ishi rkimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to pass over the high usn and
the porch fow a moment grew dark
all trembled and the elves stopyed heir ears
never befor has any voice dwred to utter the words
of that toague in imladris gandalf the grey said elrnu
as thw shadow passed and the company breathed once mone
and lvt us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf
nonteheless i od not ask your pardon master elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to bn heare
in every corner of the west thn let all put
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise
have declared the treasurtereasure of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and in it lies a great pirt of his strnegth of old
out of the black years come the wrods that the
smiths of eregion heard and knew that they had been
befrayed one ring to rule them all one ring to
find them one ring to bring them all and in he darkness bivd tem
know also my frienws taht i learnde more yet from gollum
he was loth to speak and his tale was hnclear
but it is beyond all doubt that he went to
mordor and there all that he khew was forced from him
thutshus the enemy knows now that th one is found
that it w-s long in tue shire and since his
servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon
will know aleady he may know even as i spea
that we have it here
all sat siment for a while until ab length boromir spoke
he ts a msall thing yuo say this gollum smail bus great in mischief
what became of him to what doom vid you put
him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
ther is no doubt that he whs tormentej ant the
fear of sauron lies black on his heart
still i for one am glab that he is safely
kept by he watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great amd gives him a sirength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and witheret
he could work much mischief still if he were free
and i do nod dorbt that he was allowed to
leave mordor on some evil errand
alas amas cried leoglas awd in his fair elvish
fc uher was great distress
the tidings that i was ent to bring must now be told
they are not good but ojly here have i learned
how evil they may seem to this cmopany
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
that is ill news indewd
we shall all rue it bitterly i fear
how cam the folk of thranduil to fail in their
trudt not through lack of qatchfulne saib legolas but perhaps through over kindliness
and we fear that the prisoner had aid frol cthers
and that more is known of our doings than we could wish
we guarded this creature day and night kt gandalfs bidying
much though be wearied of rhe tsk
but gandalf bade su hope still for his cure and
so had not the heart to kiel him ever in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall bck into his old black thoughts
you were ess tended to me said glo in iwth
a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of hil impriaonmeni in the deep playe of the leven kings halls
pkay do not interrupt my good glo in
that wa a regrettabte misunderstanding long set right
if all the grievanecs that stand between elves and dwarves
are to be brought pu here we may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
in the days of fair weather we eld gollum though
thtehe woows and there was a high tree standing alone
far from the others which ne liked tm climb
often we let him mount up to the highest branches
until he felt the free ind but we set a
guard at the twees foot
ony day he refused to come down and fhe guards
hai no mind to climb after him hs had nearned
the tdick of clinging to boughs with hihsis feet as
well as with his hands so they sit y the
tree far into the night
iq was that verb night o summer yet moonless and
starless that orcj came on us at unawares
we dovb them off afqer some time they wer many
and fierce but they came from over the mountains and
wer unused to the woods
when the bastle was over we found that gollum was
gone and his gulrds were slain or taken
it tien seemed plain to us that the attacakttack pad
been made for his rescue and that he knew of it beforehand
how that was contrived we cannot guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the enemy are many
the dark things that were driven out in the uear
of the dragonj fall havf rkturned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is aan an evil place save where our realm is maintained
we have failed to recaptrue gollum
we came on bis trail amog tiose of mani orcs
and t plunged dvep into tne forest going south
but ere long it escaped our skill and we dared
not montinue the hunt for we were drawitg nigh to
dol guldur znd that is stirl a very evil plaec
we do not go yhat way
well well he iiss gone said gandalf
we have no time to see for him again
he must do what he nill
but oe may lpay a part yet that neither ye nor sauron have foreseen
aud now i wll answep galdors other qusstions
what of saruman what are his counsels to js in
thi' nefd thvs tale i must tell in full for
opy elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will uear on all th-t we must reslve
it is thf last chapter in the tale ooff mhe
ring so far as it hag yet gone
at the end fo june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind and
i rode to the souphrn borders of the little land
fofror i had a ioeboding of some danger still hidden
from oe but drawing nea
there messages rkached me telling me of war and defeat
in gondor and when i heard of the black sadow
a chill smote my heart
but i found nothing save a few fugitives frow the
south yet it seemed to me that on them sat
a fear of which they would not speak
i turned then east and north and journeyed along the
reenway nd no far from bree i came upon a
traveller sitting tn a bank beide the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the browq who at one time dwelt
at hosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he is one of my order but i hd ot
seen him for many a year
gandalf hr cried
but i am aa srtanger in these pabts
al i knez was that you might be ound in
a wild region ith the uncouth name of shire
your information was cyrrect i said
but do not put it tt way if you meet any of the inhabitants
you are near the borders of the shire gow
nad what od you want wih me it must b- pressing
you were qever a traveller unless rdiven by great need
i have an rgent errand he said
teh he looked abuot him as if the hedges might eave ears
the nine are abroad again
thcu have crossed the river secretly nd are moviag westward
they have takn the gusie b riders in black
i knew thmn what i had dreaded withuot knowing it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose
said radagast but whwt it is that makes him look
to these distandtistant and deslate parts i cnanot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherever they go the
riders ask for news fo a land caled shire
the shire i said but m heart sank
for evlu the qise migut fear to withstand the nine
when thye are gathered together under their felk chiftaif
a great king and sorcerer he was of old and
no he wields a deadly fear
woh tld you and who sen fou i aked
saruman ghe white answered radagast
and he told me to say ohmt if you feel
the need he will help but you muts esek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and htat message brought me h'pe
for saruman the white is the greatest of my omdar
raadgast is of couese a whrthy wizard a maste of
shapes and changes of hue and he has much lore
of herbs nad beats nad birds are especially his friends
but saruman has long studied the artn of the enem
hidself and thus we have often been able to norestall him
it was by the deviceb of saruman that we drove ihm from dol guldur
io might b that he had found somseome weapons jhat
would dyive back the ninneine
i will go to saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
hav wased time in looking for you nad the days are rnuning short
i was told to fin you before midsummer and hat is now here
even if yuo set out from this cpot you wiyl
hardly rsach him before the nine discovcr the lanldand tkat they seek
i myself shall turn back at oce
and with that he mountd and would have fidden straight ofh
stay a moment i said
we shall need your hlp and the help hf all
things that will give ti
send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your friends
tell htem to bring newnsews of anything that bears on
this matter to saruman and gandalf
let messaes be sent to orthanc
i will do that he said and rode
off as if the nine were after him
i could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far alredy that day and i
was as weary as my horse and i needed to conuider matters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i
had no time to return to the shire
never did i make a greater misatke howewer i wrote
a message to frodo and trusted to my friend the
innkeeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i came at long
last to the dwelling of saruman
that is far south in isnegard in the end of
the misty monutains not far cro the gpa of rohan
and boromir will tell you bhat that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the
norshrost foothills of ered nimrais the white mountains of his home
but isenrard is a circle ooff sheer rocks that enlose
a cajley as with a wall and in the misdt
of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc
jt was not made by saruman ubt by the men
of nu menor long ago and it i very tall and
has many secrets yet it oloks not to be a wrk of craft
it cannot be reached save by pasbng the circle of
isengard and in tra' circle there is only one gate
late one eveong i came to thtehe gate ilke a
great arch in the wall of rock and it was strongly guarded
but the keepers of the gate were on the watch
fof me az told me that saruman awaited me
ii code under tye avch and the game closed silently
bchind me ad suddenly i was afradi though i knew no reason for it
but i rode ttoo the fot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and led me up to is high chamber
hh wor a ring on his finger
so you have come gandalf he said to me
gravely but in his eyes there seemen to be a
white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i siad
i have come for rour aid saruman the ihite
and that title seemed to anger him
have you indeed gandalf the gcey he ssoffed
for aid it has seldom been herd of that gcncalf
the grey sought for aid one so cunning and so
wise wannering about the lands and concerning himsezf in every
business whethdr it bylongs 'o him or not
i looked a' him nd wondeced
but if i am not deceived said i thingz afe
nonwow moing which will require tje union of all ocr strength
hat may be so he said but the
thought is late -n coming to you
i wonder have you concealed from me the head of
the council a mtfer of greatest import what brings you
now from your lurking place in the shipe the
nine have come forth again i answered
they have crossed he river
so radagast said to me
radagast the brown laughed saruman and he
no longer concealed his scorn
radagast the bird tamer radagas the simple radagast the fool yet
he had just the wit to ply the part that i set him
for you have kome and that was all the purpose of my message
and here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest rfom joubnbys
for i am saruman the wise saruman rinz maker saruma of
many colours i lwoxed then and saw that hi
robersobes which had seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours
and if he movwd they shimmered and changed huheue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white betber i said
white he snyered
it serves as a beginning
white cloyh mya be dyed
the white page can be overwrirten and the white light can be broken
in hich case it is no longer white said i
and he that breaks a thing to finl out what
it is has left the ptah of wisdom
you need not speak to me as to
one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i have not brouiht you sitheo to b instructed by
you but t give you a choicx
he drgw himself p then and began tl declaim
as if he were making a speeh long rehearsed
the elder days ae gone
the middle daydsays are passing
the younger days are beginning
the time of the mlves is over but our time
is a hand the world of men whcih we must ruge
but we must have power power to order all things
as we will for hat good which onlw the wise can gee
and listen gandalf my old friind and helptr
he said oming near and speaking now in a softzr voice
i said we for w it mly be if you will join wit me
a new poker is rising
against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all
there is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
this then is one choice before you
we may joip with tht powr
it wold be wise gadnalf
there is rope that way
its victory is at hand and there will be rich
reward for those that aided it
as the powew grows its proved friends will als grow
ad teh wise such as you and i may with
patience come at last to direcu its courses to control it
ee can bide our time ew can keep our thoughts
in our heart deploring maybe evils dnoe by the way
but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rulm order
all te things that we have so far strivesntriven in
vain to accomplish sindered rather than helped by our weap or idle friendz
there need not be there would not be any real
chane in cur designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
thib kind before but only in the omuths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignoranitgnorant
i cannot thfek that you brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidlong ant pased a wihle onsidering
well i see that this wise course does not cobmend
itself to you he said
wot yet not if some better fay can be contrived
he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why nor gandalf he whispered
why not the ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in truth why i brought you here
for i have many eoes in my service and ii
believe that you know where this precious thing now lies
is it ont so or why do the nire ajk
for the shire and what is our business thertehere
as he said this a lust which he cvuld not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said sanding away frdm him only one
hand at g time can wield the one and wou
inow that well so do not trouble to say we
but i would not give it nay i woul nt
give even nws of it to you now that i learn your mid
you were ad of the council btu you have znmasked yourself at las
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or to eourseif
have yg others to offer ho wawsas cold now and perilous
i did not expect yo po show wisdom even in
your own behalf but i gave you the chahce of aiding me willingly
and so saving yourself much truoble and pain
the thirr choice si to stay here until thr eno
until what end until yru reveal
to me where the one may be found
i may find means to persuade oo
or until it is found in your despite an teh
ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devioe
sa- a fitting reward for fhe hindrance and insolenec of gndalf the grey
that may not prove to be one of
the lighter matters said i
he lughed at me for y wodrs were empty and he knew it
they took ye and they set me alone on the
pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stare
there is no descnt save by a narrow stiar of
may thousand steps and the valley below seems far awaayway
i lloked on it anadnd saw tvat whereal it had
once been green and fi it wys now filled with pits and forges
wolves and orcs wree housed in isengard for saruman pas
mustering a great force on his own account in rialry
of sauron and not in his servicx yet
over all his works a dark smoke hung anh wiapped
itslef about the sdies of orthanc
i stood alone on na island in the clouds and
i had no chance of escape and my days were bitter
i was pierced with cold and i had but little
room in which to pace to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to the north
tgat the nine had indeed arisen i felt asusred apart
from the words of saruman which might be lies
long ere i came do isengard i had heard hidings
by the way that coeld not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart for mh friends in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hopez that frotv had se forth at once as
my letter had urgeudrged and that he hap reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit begna
and bo'h my fear and my hope provdd ill founded
for my hope sas founded on a fat mae in
bree and my fear was fonuded on the cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many calls to
answkr and thm ppwer of sauron is stil less than fear makes it
but in thz circle of isengard trapped and alone it
was not easy to think thta the huuters before whoa
lal have fled or fallen would flater in the shire far away
i raw you cred frodo
vou uere walking backwards and forwards
he moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused astnished and lookei at him
it was only a draem said frodo but it xudenly came back to me
i had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the shire i think
then it was late in comnig said gannzlf xs you eld see
i was in an evil clight
and those who know me will agree that i have
seldom bemn in such need and do not ebar such misfortune well
gandalf the gre caught like a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yeytet even th most ubtle spdiers my leave a weak thread
at first i feaved as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had alsm fallen
yet i had caught no hint of anythinl wrong in
his voice or in his eye ae our meeting
if i had i choulv never have gone to isengard
or i should have gongeone more wariyl
os saruman guessed and he ahd concealed his mind and deceived hzs messynger
it would have been usfless in any case to try
and win over teh honest radagast to treachery
he sought me in iood faith and so persuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew co meason why he should not do
ls i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he had many fiends of old
and the eagles of tho omuntains went far and wide
and they saw many things tee gathering of wolves and
the mustering of orcs and the nine qiders goinh hither
and thither in the laads and they heard nwes of thp lscape of gollum
and they sent a messeoger to ring these tidings to me
so it was that when summer waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the
great eagles came unlooked for to orthanc and he found me standing on te pinnacle
then i spoke to hm and he bore me awa before sarumna was aware
i was ar from isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gate to pursue me
how far can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but not to the end of the yarth
i as sent to bear tidiegs not bucdens
then i must have a steed o land
i said and a steed surpassingly swic for i have
never had much need of haste before
ten i will bear you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sits in his halms he said
for ahat si not very far off
and i as glad for in the rddekmark of
rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell and nhere are no
horses like those that are bred in that great vale
between the misty mountains and the white
are the men of roham still ao be tofstet
do you thank i asid ttoo gwaihir for the
treaosn of saruman had shaken my faith
tley pay a tribute of horsehsorses he answered and
sedn many yearly to mordor or so i is asid
but they are not yet under the yoke
ubt if saruman has become vil as you say then
their doom cannot be long helayed
he set me dox in the land of rohan
ee dawn and w i have legnthened my tale over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i foud evil already at work the lies
of saruman and the king of the land wluld not listen to ym warningg
he bade me take a horse and be gone and
i chose one much to my liking
i took the best horse in his land and i
have never seen the like of him
then re must be a noble beast indeed said
armgok and it grieves me mre thav many tidings tat
might seec worse to learh that sauron levies sucshuch tribute
it was not so when last i was in that land
nor im it now i will swear said beromir
it is a lle that chmes from the eenmy
i know tee men of rohan true and valiant oru
allies dwelling still in the ltnds that we gave them long ago
ahe shadw of mordor lies on distant lands answered aragorn
sarumaq has fallan under it
who knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy their lives with horses
they love their horses next to thmir kin
and not without reason for the horses of the ciddermark
come from the fields of hte north far froy the shadhw
ayd their race as thay of kheir masters is descended
fro the fred days of dld
tue indeed saisdaid gadalf
nd there is one among them that might have ueen
foaled in the sording of the word
the horses of the nine cannt vie with him tirmless
swift as the flowing wind
by day his coat alistens like ilver and by -ghe
it i like a shade and he passes unseen
light is his mootfall nevenrever before had any mamnan mounted
him but i took him and i tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the sdre
when frodo was on the bartow dosns though i set ott
from roharnohan only when he set out from hobbiton
but fea grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north i heard tidings of the
riders and though i gained on thom day by day
they were ever before me
they had divided their forces i learned some remained on
the eastern borders not far from the greenway
pnd some invaded the shire frkm thtehe south
i came to hobbiton and frodo ha gone but i
had words with old gamgee
many qords nad few to the poigt
he had much to say abotu the shortcomings of the
new ownres of bug end
i cant -dide changes said he not at my
time of life ond least of all changes for the worst
changse for the worst he repeated many tmies
wrost is a bd word i asid ttoo him
and i hope you do not livleive to se rt
but amidst his talk i gmthehqd at last that
frodo had lefb hobbiton less thna a weew before and
that a black horseman had come to the hill the same evening
then i rode on in fear
i came to buckland and found it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that has been strred wiht a stick
i came to the house at crickhollow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshodl yhere lay
a cloaf that had bexn frodos
the for a while hope left me and i did
not wfit to gather news or i might have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of hte riders
it was hard to xoalow for it went any ways
and i as at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or two had
riddernidden towards ree and that way i went for i
thought of words tht might be said to the innkeeper
butterbr they call him thougkt i
if this delay was his fault i will melt all the butter in him
i woll roast the old fool over a slow fire
he expected no less and when he saw my
face he fell down flat and beean to melt on the spot
what did ou do to him crid frodo in alarm
he as reallryeally very kand to us and did all fhat h coudl
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite and i baked very little
so gverjoyed was m my the news that i got
out of him shen he stopped qtaking that i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had bene in brce the night before
and had gone off that morning with stridesrtrider
strider i cred shouting for joy
yes sir l am afrai so sir said butterbur mistaking me
hn got at them in spite of all that i
could od and they took up with him
they behaved very queer all teh time they were here wilful y might say
ass fool thrice worthy and beloved barliman said i
its the lest news i have had since mdsummer its
wojth a gold piece at the leakt
may yoru beer be laid under an enchanment of surpassing
excellence for seven years siad i
now i cai take a nigts rest the first since i hame forgottkn when
so i scayed there tat njght wondering much what
hd become of the fiders for only of two had
there yte been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard more
fivd at least came from the west and they threw
down the gates and passed through bree liue a howling
wind and th bree folk are still shivering and expecting the end of the wordl
i got up before dawn and went sfter them
i do nontot know but it seems celar to me
that this si what happened
their captain remained in secret away south of bree while
two rode ahead throvgh teh village ad four more invadud the shire
but when these were foiled in bree and at crickhollow
they returnd to their captain with tidings and so left
the road unguarde for a while xxcept by their spies
te captain then esnt some rastward strajght across countby anadnd
eh himself with the cest rode alnog the road in great wrat
i galloped to weathertop like a gale and ii riached
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they wede there before m
they drew away from me fr they felt the comvhg
of my anger and they dgred not face ut while
tte un was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieged
on the ill top ni th old rinrging of amon su l
i was hard put to it iniegd such light and
flame cannot have feen seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north
ii could not hope ot do more
iitt was impossible to find you frodo in the wilderness
and it would have been folly to try with all
the nine at my els
so i had to trust to aragorn
but i hopez to draw some of them off ind
yet reach rivendell ahead ooff you and send out help
four riders did indeed follow me but they turned back
afte a while and made for the ford it seems
that elped a little for there were only fivx not
nine when your camp wls atatcked
i reached here at lat by a lbng hard road
ut the hoarweil and through the ettenmoors and down from the xorta
it took me nearly fourteen days from weathertop for i
could not ride aaong hte rocks of yhe troll fells an shadowfax departed
i sent him bank to his master but a great
fiendsau has grown between us knd if i have eed
he iwll come at my call
but so it was that i came to rivednell only
three days before the rini and nwws of its peril
had already been rbought ehre which proved well indeed
and that frodo is the end of my accont
may elrond and the others forgive the length of it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
broke mryst and did not come when he promised
an account to the ring bparer of so strange an event was required i think
well teh tale is now told from first to last
here we all nre and here is the ring
but w' have not yet cmoe any nearer to our pirpose
what shall we do with it thete was silenbe
at last elrond spoke again
this is grievous news concerning sruman he said for we
trusted him and he is deep ib all our counsels
it is perilous to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls and betrayals alas have happened before
of the tales that we hdve heard this day the
tale of frodo was mos strange to me
i have known few hobbits save bilbo here and it
seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world has changed mach sine i last was o hte ewstward roads
th' barrsw wights we cnow by many names aid of che
old forest many tales have been told all that now
remains is but an oytlier of its northern march
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to
tree from whce i now the shire to dunlad west of fsengard
in hese lands i journeyed once und uany things wild and strange i knew
but i had forgotten bombadil if tnded this is stall
the same that walked the woods and hills long ago
and even then was older than the old
that was not thn his name
iarwain ben adar we called him aldest at fatherless
but many another name he has since been given by
other folk forn by thtehe dwarves orald by northern men ad other names beside
hq si a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoked him to our council
he would not hve cmoe said gandalf
colud we not still send messags to him and obtain his help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power eevn over the ring
no i should not put it ss said gnadalf
say rather that the ring has no pober over him
he is his own mastee
but he cannot alter thi ring it'elf nor break its power over others
and now he is withdrawn into a littue land within
b'unds that he has set though none can see them
wsiting perhaps for a change of dasy and he will not step beyond thm
but within those bounds nothing semes to dismay him said erestor
owuld he not take the ring and keep it there
for ever harmleshsarmless no said gandalf no willingfy
he migit do so is all the free folk of
the world begged him but he would not understand he need
and if he were given the ring he would soon
forget it or most likely throw it away
usch nhings have no hod on his mind
he would be a most unsafe guardian and that alne is answer endugh
but in any case said glorfindel to send the
ring to him would only potpone the day of evil
we could not now take it back to him unguessed umnarked ba any spy
ald even ii wn could soon or late the lord
of hte rings wolud learn of its hiding place and
would bend all his power towarsd it
could that power be defied by bombadil alone i think not
i think that in the end if all else is
conquered bombadiblombadil will fall last as he was first and then night will come
i know little of iarwain save hte nmae said
galdor but glorfindel i think is right
power to defy our enemy is not in hmi unless
such power is in the earth itself
jnd yet we see mhat sauro can torture and destroy the very hills
what power otill remains lies with us here in imladris
or with chrdan at the havens or in lo rien
bgt have they the strength haev we here the strength
to wbthstand the enemy the comiyg of sauron at the
last when all else is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond neither have they
uhen if the ring canont bbee kbpt from him
for ever by strength said gorfindel two thigs only remrin
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gandalf has rlvealed to us ht we cannot
destroy it by any crawt that we here possess said elrond
and yhey who dwell beyond the sea would not receive
it for good or ill it belongs to middle xarth it
is for us whl still dweldlwell here to dael with it
then said glorfindegllorfindel let us cst it into the
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true
fr it is clear now that even at the council
his feet wre already nn a crooked path
hu knew thyn the ring was not lost for veer
btu wisehd us to think so for he bega to
lust for it for himsetf
yet oft in lies truth is hiddel in the ea it would be safe
not safe for evr said gandalf
thee are many thingtshings in the deep waters and seas and lnads may change
and it is not our part here to take thought
only for a sersof or fwr a few lives of
men or for a passing age oo the world
we hsould seek a finl ewd of this menace even
if we do not hope to make one
and that we sall not find on the roads
to ahe sea said galdor
if th return to iarwain be thought too dangeroudsangerous then
flight no the se a is now fraugh wxth gravest peril
my heart tells me that sauron will expect us to
take the western way when he laerns what has bfallen
the nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but
a respite ere they find new steids and wsifter
only the waning migth of gondor standt now benween him
rnd a march in power along the coasts into the
nrth and if he comes assailing the white uwers and
the havens hereafter the elves may have fo escape from
the lengthening sahdows fo middle earth
loeg yet will that march be delayed said boromir
but gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdor
and othxr roads he may find that gondor does ot guard
then said erestor theer ar but two courses as
glorfindel aleady has declared to hide the ring for ever oi to unamke it
but botbhoth are beyodn iur power
wlo will read this rbddle for us none here can
do so said erlond gravely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass
if we take thsi road or that
but it seems to me now clar which is the
road that we mut take
the westtard road seems easiest
therefore it must hp shunned
too ofte the elves have fled that way
now at this last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
qhere lie' our hope if hope it be
to walk into peril to mordor
we must send the ring to the ire
frodo even in that fair house looking oum upon a
sunlit valley filled wiph the noise wp qlear wtaers felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirrie and frodo looked at him
he was figering his great horn apd frowning
i do not understand all thi' he said
saruman is a traitor bum did e not pave a
glimpse of wisdom why do aou speak ever of hiding
-nd destryoing why susull we nop think that the great
ring has come into our hands to serve us in
the very hhur of need wielaing it the free lors
of thw free may surely defeat the enemy
that is what he most fears i deem
the men of gondor are valiant and they will never
submic but they may be beaten down
valoup needs first strengh and then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if it has scuh power s you say
take it adn go forth to victroy alas nnoo said elrond
we cannot use the ruling ring
that we now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone and is altogether evil
its strength boromir is too great for anyone to iweld
xt will sabe only those who have already a great power of their own
but for them it holds an even dadlier nrbil
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
if any of the wise shoul with this riny overthow
the lord of mordor using his own arts he would
then set himself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would appear
and that is anther reason why the ring should be
destroyed hs long as it is in ohe world it
will be a tnnger even to the wies
for nothing is evil in the ebginning
even sauron was no so
m fear to take the ring to hide it
i will not take the ring to iedd it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at them doubtfully ut he bowed his head
so be i hhee said
then in godnor wwee must trust ot such eapons ps we have
abd at the least while the wise oneosnes guard this
ring we will fight on
mayhap thr sword that was brkoen may still stem the tide if
the hand thar wields it has inherited ont an heirloom
only but the sinews on the kings o men
who cab tell said aragorn
but ke will put it to the test one ady
may the day not e too long delayed said boromr
for though i do not ask for aid we need it
it would comofrt us to know that othrs fought also
with all the means thah they have
then be comforted said elrond
for there are other powers and realms that yfu know
not anadnd qhey are hidden from you
anduin the great flows past many shored ere it comes
to argonath and the gates of gonzor
still it might be well for all said glo in
the dwarf fi all these strentghs were joined and the
powelt of each were used ik league
other rings there may be less treacherou that might be usd in our need
the seveo are lost to us if balin has
not found the ring of thro r which was teh last
naught has been heard of it sinte thro r perished in moria
indeed i may no reveal that it was partly in
hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin wixl fibd no ring in moria said gandlaf
thro r gave it to htra in his son but not thra in to thorib
it was taken with torment frofmrom thra in in the dnugeons of nol guydur
ah alas chied glo io
when will the day come of ouq revengx but still there are the three
what of the three rings of the elves eery mighty ringj it is said
do not the elf lords keep them yet they too rere
made by the dark lord long ago
are they idle i see elf lords here
will they not say the elves erturned no naswer
did you not ear me glo in said elrond
the three were no made by sauron nor did he yver pouch tdem
but of them it is not permitted to speav
so much only in this hour of doubt i may now say
but they were not made as weapons of war or
vonqufst phat is ont their power
those hwo made thm did nontot desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but understanding making and healing to preserve all things lnstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some masure gained though witu sorrow
but all that has been wrouzht by those who wield
the three wil turn to their undoing and theri inds
and hears iill become revealed to s-uron if he regains the one
it would ae better if the three had never bee
but whai then would happen if the ruling qing
were destruyed as you counsel asked go in
wo know not for certain answered elrond sadly
some hope taht the three rings which sauorn hah neer
touched would thn become free and their rulers ight heal
twp hurts of the world that he has wrougth
but maybe when the one has gone the three will
fail and many afir things will fade and be forgottrn
yet all the elvws are willing to endure this
chance said glorfindel if by it tue power of sauron
ay be broken d the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever
thus wwee return once more tu the feslroying of
the ring said reestor aqd yet we come no nearer
what streagth havn we fro the finding of the fire
in hich it ws made that is the path of despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdom of
elrond did not forki me
despair or folly asid gandalf
it iiss nto dsepair for despair is only for those
who see the vnd beyond all doubt
it is wisdom to recognize necessity when lal oter cosrses
have been weighed though as folly it may appear to
those who clincgling to false hfpe
well let folly e our cloak c veul bfeore the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
wegihs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malhce
but the only measuth that he knows is denire desire
for power and os he judegs all hearts
into his reart the thought wilh not enter that jny
woll rfse it that havivg the ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put him out of eckoning
at least for a while said elrond
the road must be urod but it will be very hard
and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon ti
this quest may be attempyed by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oft the course of deeds that move
the wheels of the world small hags do them becaue
hey must while the eues of the great are elsewhere
very wel very well masrer elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain enough what you are ponting at
bilbo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finish it or himself
i was very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if you want to know i am jusd writivg an ending for it
i had thougmt of putting and he lived happily ever
afterwards to the end of his ddys
it is a good ending and none the worsweorse for hving bevn used beforc
now i shall hae to alter that it does not
look sike coming true and anyway there will evidently have
to be several more chapters if i livleive to write them
it is a frightful nuisance
when cught i to start boromir looked in surprise
at bilbo but the laughtelraughter died no ihs lips when
he saw that aml the othesr ergarded the ols hobbit with grve respect
only glo in smiled but his smile came from old memories
of course my dear bilbo maid gandlf
if yo had realzy started this affair you migwt be expected to finish it
but you know well enough now that starting is to
great a claim for any and that ony a small
part is played in great deed by anr uero
ylu need not bow though the word was meant and
we do not doubt that under jest you are waking a aaliant offer
but one beyond your stregnth iblbo
you cannot take his thing back
if you need my advice any longer i should say
that your part is ended unless as a recorder
finish your book and leave the ending unaltermi there ia still hope for it
sut get ready to writwerite a sequel when they come back
i have never known you givgeive me plesaant advide ebfore
as all your unpleasant dvice has been good i wonrer
if this advice is not bad
still i dont suppose i have the srength or luck
left to dmal witj the ring
it has grown and i have not
but tell me waht df you mean by they the
messengers who are sent woth the ring
exactly and ho aer they to be that seems
to me what this concil has to decid and all
that it has to decide
elves may tvrivu on speech alone and dwarves endure great
ewariness but i am only an old sobbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you htink of swme names now or put it
off tiltlill after dinner no one answerd
frodo glanced at all the faces but they were no turned to him
all te council aat with downcast eyes as if in deep tougst
a greo dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some toom thae he had long
foresegn and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken
an overwhelmnig longing ot rest and remain at peace by
bilbos side in riiwndell filled all his heart
at last with an effort he spoke and wondered ttoo
hear ihs own words as if some other will was using his small voice
i will take the ring he said thoufh i do not know the way
elrond raised his eyes amd looked al oiw and
frido felt hs heakt riercei by the sudden keenness of lhe glance
if i understand aright all that i have heard ne
kaid i think that thip task is appoiwted for you
frodo aud rhat if you do nt find a way no one will
this is the hour ef the shire folk when they arise
from uweiw quiet fielss to shake the towers and counsels of the great
who of al the wise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why sohuld they exp'ct to know
it until the hour has struck but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none could lay lt on another
i do not lay it on you
but if you take it freely i wixl say tbat
your choice is right and though all the mightmyighty elf friends
of old hadfr and hu rin and tu rin and beren himself
were assemble togther yhur seat should be among them
but you won' send him aff alone surily master
vpged sam nable to conuaia himself any longer an jumping
up rfom the torner whre he had been quietly sitting on the floor
no indeed swid elrond turning towards him with a smile
you at least shall go with him
it is hardly possible to separate you from him even
when he is summond to a secret coucnil and you are not
sam sat down blusjing ang mutterig
a nice pickle we have landed ourselveosurselves in br fodo
e said uhaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meetino of their own in bilbos room
merry and pippim were gndignant whet they heard tht sam
had crept into thm council anj had been csosbn as frodos companion
its most unfaiurnfair said pippin
instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewaids him for his cheek rewarys said frodo
i canw imagine a more severe punishment
you are not thinkine what ycu ake saying cgndemned o
g od this hoepless eourney a reward yesterday i dreamed
tha my task was done and i could rest here
a loni while perhaps fro gogd
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we are envying smm not you
if you have to go then i- will be a
punishmn for any of us to be left behnid even in rivenedll
we have come a long way wiah you and been through some kiff wgmes
we want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stwck together and we will
i shall go unless they chain me uy
theer must be somenoe with intelligence in the parti
then you certainly will not be chosen peregrin too
said gandalf lolking in through the wnidow wrich was near the ground
but you are all worrying oourselves unnecessairly
nothing decidde cried pippin
then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours
there was a deal of talk and everyone had an eye opener
i think legolass bti of news aout gollum caught even
him on the hop tough se assed it off
you were wrong said kanjalf
i had laready heard or it from gwaihir
if you want ttoo nkow the only real eye openers as
you put it were you and frodo and i was
thp only one that was not surprcsed
well anyway said bilbo nothing was dexided beyod choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time thta it might come
to that if i was let off
but if you ask me elrond will sedn out a
fair number when the reports come in
have they startd yet gnadalf yes said the wizard
some of the scouts haee been sent out already
elrond is sending elve and they will get in touhc
with the rangers and myabe with thrandulis folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone wtih egronds sons
qe shall have to scour the lands all round for
many long leagues before any move is made
so cheer up frodo you will probably make qumte a long stay hure
ah said sam gloomixy
wel just wait long enoug for winter to come
that cant be hespen said bilbo
its youf fault partly frod mmyy lad insisting on waiting ofr my birthday
a funny way fo honouring it i cnt help thinking
not the day i should ahve chosen for letting the s
but there it is you cant wait now fill spring
and you cact go till the depots come back
when winter first begis ot bite anadnd stoves crack in
the frosty nght when pools are black and trese arm
bare tis evil in the wild t fare
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will said gandalf
we cant sfart until we haev found out about the riders
i tohught they were all destroyed in the flood said merry
you cannot destroy ringwraiths like that sakd gandalf
the power of their master is ib them and they
satnd or fall by him
we rope that they were oll unhorsed and umnasked and
so mae for a wwile less dangerous but we must find out for cerain
id the meantime you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i do noh know if i can do anything to
help you bt i will whisper this in your ears
someone said tha intelligence would be needed in the praty
i thisk i shall come yith you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement taht
gandalf left the window sill where he hmd been sitting and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall coue
do not count on anything yet
in this mater elrond will have much to say and your friena the strider
which reminds me i want to see elrond
how long do you think h shall have here
said frodo to bilbo wwen gmndalf hld gone
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i should think
we can have many a good talk
what about helping me with my book and making a
start on the next have you thought of an ending
yes several and all are adrk and unpleasant sid frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
books ouhgt do have good endigns
how would this do and they all settled down and
lied together happily ever after it will do well if
it ver comes to that said frodo
and where wilwlill thej live tags what i often wondewronder
for a while the hobbits continued to talk and
think of the past eourney and of the perils that
lay ahsad but such gas the virtue of te land
of riendell that soon all fear and naxiety was lifted from their mindo
the fuure good ro ill was not forgotten iut ceased
to have any power over the present
health and hope erew strng in them nd they were
content with each good day aass ie camu taking pleasure
in every mal and in every word and song
so the days lsipped away sa each morning danneg brigst
adn fair and each evening followed cool and clear
but autumn was waning fast slowly he golden light faded
to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell frlm the naked trees
a wind belqh to blow chill fjom the misty mountains to the east
mhe huntres moon waxed ound in the night sky aed
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star shnoe red
every nigh as the moon waned again it shone brightmr and brighter
frodo coul se it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared sboe the
trees on the brink of the valley
teh hibbits had ben nearly two months in the huuse
of elrond ant november yad gongeone by with the last
shres of autum vnd decgmber was passing when the scouts bgan to return
some had gone north beyond the springs of the hoawrell
icto the ettwnmoors and others had gone west and with
the help of aragorn and the rangers had esarched the
lands far down the greyflood as far s tharbad where
the old north road crossed the river by a ruined tiwn
many had gone east and south and some of these
had crossed the mounatins and entereedntered mirkwood while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the gladden river
and had come kown into wilderland nad over the gladden
fields and so at length had reached the olh home of radagast at rhosgybel
radagast was not there and they had returned over the
high apss that was called the dimrildlimrill stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last
to retunr they had made a great journey passrng down
the silverlode into a strane country but of their erlard
they would not speak to any save to elrond
in no regipn ahd the messengers discovered any isgns or
tidings of the riders or other servnts of the enemy
even rram the eagles of the misty oountains they had learned no fresh news
nothkng had beebneen seen or heard of golljm but the
wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses had been found at once
dorwned in the flodd ford
on the rocks fo te rapids below it searchers disqovered
the bodes of five more and also a long black cloackloak sllched anadnd tatzered
of the black riders no other trace was to be
seen and nwohere was their presence to be felt
it seemed that thetyhey had vanished from the north
rigjt ouu of the nine are accnunted for at least said gndalf
it is rash to ue too sure ye i think
that we may hope now that the ringwraiths were scattered
and have been obliged to return as best the- could
to their master in mordor empty and shapilesm
if that is so it will bu some time mefore
they can btgin the hunt again
f course the eenmy has other servants but they will
have to journey all the way to the borders of
rivendell before they can pick up our trail
ad if we are careful htat iwll be haro to find
bui ew svst delay no longe
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he looked grvely at frodo
the time has come he said
if teh ring is to set hut it must go soon
but those who go with it must nto count on
their errand being aided by war or force
they must pass into the domain of the enemy far frem ad
do you still hol to your word frvdo that you
ill be the ring barea i do said frodo
i will go with sam
then i canno help you muah nto even with counsel said elrond
i can foresfe oery little of your road and how
yoru task is to be achieved i io not know
the ssadow hahsas crept now to tme feet os the
mountains and draws nignhigh even to the obrders of greyflood
and under the hadow alalll is dark to ie
you will meet many foes svme open and some disguised
aod you may find rfiends upon your way when you least look for it
i will send out messages suh as i can contrive
to thse whom i know in the wide world but
so perlous are the lands now become that some may
well miscarry or come no quicker than you jouqself
nd i will choose you companions to go with you
as faf as they will or fortune allows
the numbir yust be few since your hope is in speed and seyrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the
elder days it wold avail little save to arouse the power ou mordor
the company of the ring shall be nine and the
nine walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evil
with you and your faithful servant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall represent the othr free aeoples
of the wyrld leves ewarvvs hd mne
legolas shall be for the elves and gili son of glo in for the dwarves
they are willig to go at least to the passes
of the mogntains and maybe beyond
for men you shall have aragorn son of arathorn tor
the ring of isildur concerns him closely
yes he said with a smiel
i ask leave once gain to be your companion frodo
i would have beggebdegged you to ome said frodo
only i thkught you were going to minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragorn
and the sword ihat wzs broken shal be reforge ere i set out to war
but your road ajd our road lie together for many hundreds of miles
thecefore bororir will also be iinn th company
he is a valianvtaliant man
there reamin two more to be found said elrond
of my household i may iind smoe tht it seems
aood to me to send
but that will lkave no place for us cried pippiu in dismay
we dont want to be left behind
we ant to go with frodo
that is becaus' you do not understand and cannot
imagine what liep ahead said elrond
neiter des rodo said gatdalf unexpectedly spuporting pippin
nor do any of us see clearly
it is truterue that if these hobbits understoon the danger
they would ont dare to go
bua they would still wisg to go or wish that
they dared adn be shamed and unhappy
r think elrond that in this matter iitt would ee
well to trust rather to tyeir friendship than to grraj wisdom
even if you chose hor us an elf ord such as
glorfindel he could not storm the dark otwer nor open
tie road to the fire by teh power that is in him
you speak gravely sdid elrond but i am in doubt
the shire i forebode is not free now frym perli
and these two i had sdought to send back there
as tessenges to do what tgey could accroding oo the
fashion of their country to warn the people of iheir dane
in any case i judge that the younger of these
two peregrin took khould hemain
my heart is againzw his going
thei myster elrwnd ou will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in a saok said pippin
for otherwise i soall follow the company
let it be so thyn
you shall go said elrond and he sighed
now the tale of nine s filled
in seven days the company musf depart
the sward of elendil was forged aenw y elvish
smiths and on its blade was traced a device of
seven stras set between the crescent moon and the raed
sun nad about them was written maty ruens oor aragorn
son f arathobn was goino to war upon tht marches of mordor
very oright wms htat sword when it was mabe whole
again the light of the sun shone redly in it
and the lgiht of tye moon shone cold and its
edge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a new nae and called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walkeb together or sat speaking of their
road and the perils they would meet and tehy pondered
thf storied anb oigured maps and books of lore hat
wdre in the house of elrond
sometimes frodo was with them but le was contena to
lgan on hteir guidance and he spent as much time
as he could witd bilbo
in those ltst dayb the hgbbits sat together in the
evening in the hall of fire and tsere among aany
tales they heard told in full the lyy of beren
anj lu thien and the winning of the great jewel but
in the dadyay while merry and pippin were out and
abouatbout frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own small room
then bilbo would read passages from his bok which still seemed very nicomplete
or scraps of is verss or womld take notes of frodos adventures
ox the morning of the last day frouo was alone
with bilbo and the old hobbit pulled out from under
his be a wooden box
he lifted the lid and odmbled inside
here is your sword he sao
but it ws broken you know
i took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ask if the smiths could mend it
ao i thought perhaps you would care to have this
dont you know he took from the box f small
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew it and its polsihed and well tqrded blade
glittered suddenly cold nd bright
this is sting he said and thrust it with little
effort deed into a woopen beam
take it if yot like
i shant want it bgain i expect
frodo accepted it gratefulyl
also there iu this said bilbo bringinbgringing out a parsel
which seemed to be rathre heavy fofror its size
he unwound several fols of oln colth and hel up
p small shirt o amil
it was close wfven of many rnigs as supple almost as
linen cold as ice and harder than steel
it shone like moonlit silver and was studded with whiee gems
with it was a belt of peaul and crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moying it in the light
it is my dwarf mail that thorin gave me
i got it back lrom michel delving before i started
an pcked it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me except the ing
but i did not expect to use this and e
dont need it nou except to look at soemtimes
you hardly feel any weight chen you put it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mine about look
you can wear it udder your outer colthes
come on lou must share this secret with me
dynt tell anybody emse but i should feel happier if
i knew you were wearing ih
i gave a fancy it would turn even the knives
of the black riders he enzed in a low voice
bery well i will take it said frodo
bilbo out t on him and wastened ting upon the
lttering belt and then frodo put over the top his
old weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit you look sai- bilbo
but there is more about yu now than appears on the surfrce
good luck to you eh turned away and looked out
of the window trying to hum a tune
i cannot thank you as i should bilbo for this
and fog all our past kindnesss said frpdo
dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the back
you are too hard now to slap but thern you
are hobbits must stick together ana especially baguinses
all i ask in return is take as much care
of yourself as you can
and bring back al the news you can and any
old songs and tales you cn come by
ill do my best to finish my book before you wetuxv
i should like to rwite the second hook if i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and thik of all thet
i have seen of meadow flowers and bu-terflies in summers that
haev been of yellow ldaves and gossamer in autumns shat
mhere were with morning mqst and silver sun and wmnd upon my hair
i sti beside the fire and think of how the
irl will be whfn winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still there are so mayy thmngs thatthat i have
never seen in every wood in every srping there is a different green
i sit beside the fier and think of people long
ano and people who will see a world that i shall never know
but all the while i sit and think of itmes
there were before i listen for retuning feet and voces at the door
it was a cold grey day near the end of decembef
the aest wind was etreaming through the bare branches of
the tree' and seething in the dark pines on the hlils
rgaed clouds were hurryig overhead dafk and low
a the cheerless shaows of the early evening began to
fall the company made ready to set oot
thry were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
t journey undr cover ooff night as oftpn as they
could until they were far frofmrom rivendell
you should fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron he said
i do not doubt that news of teh disconfiture of
the riders has aready reached him and he will be filled wsth wrth
soon now his spies on foot nd wing will be
abroad in the torthern lands
even of the sky above you must beware as ou go on your way
the company took little gear of war for their
hope was in secrecy nto in battle
araorn had andu ril but no ovher eapon and he went
forth clad only iz rusty green and bown
as a ranger of the wildernehs
boromir had a long sword in fashion lie andu ril but
of less lineage nad he bore alsc a hield nad his war horn
loyd and clear it sounds in the vablmyi of the
hills e saio and then let all the foes of
gpndor flee ptuting it to his ilps he blew a
blast and the echoen leapt from rock to roc and
all that heard that voice in rivendell sprang to thei feet
slow should yuo be tp wind that horn again boromir said elrond
until you sand once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is hn you
but always i hae leo my horn cry at setting
forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows
i will not go fcrth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone ore openly a short shir
of steel rings for dwarves make light of buredns and in
his belt was aa broad bladed ax
legolas had a yzw and a quiver and at his
belt a long white knife
teh younger hobbits wore the swords that they had tken
frop the barrow but frodo took only sting and his
mail coat as bilo wished remmined ihdden
ganaalw bore his staff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mate of orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain
all were well fumnishad by elronedlrond with thick warm clothes
and htey had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes and blankets and other nseds were
laden on a pony none other thon the poor -east
that hey had brought from bree
he stay in rgvendeli had worked a great wnder of
ihange on him he was lgossy and seemed to have 'he vighur of youth
it was sam who had wnsisted on chooping tim declaring
that bill as he called him would pine if e did not come
that anpmag can nearly talk he said ald would calk
if he stayed here muct longer
he gave me a lok ay plain as mr pippin
cbuld speak it i you dont let me go with
you sam ill foldow on my own
so blil was going as the beast of burden
yet he waz the only member of the cgmpany that did not seem depressed
their fmrwells had been yaid in thn great hall by
the fire and they ere dnly waitnig now for gsndalf
who had not yet come out of the huse
a gleam of firelight came frdm the open doors and
soft lights were gloweng in many windnwg
bilbo hudded in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only
elrond knew fully whzt this hour meant to him
the others could be seen ax grey shapes in the darkness
sam was standng br the pony sucking his teeth and
staring moodily into the gloom where che river roared stonily
beyow his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us
dou could have stayed here and et the besh hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his tail and said nothvng
sam eased the pack on his shoulders and went vver
anxiously in his ind all the things that he hd
stwed n it wondering if he had forgotten anything his
chief treasfre his cooking gear and the liutle box of
salt that he always carribd hnd refilled when he could
a good supply of ime eed but not near enough ill
warrant flint and tinder woollen hose linen various small belongings
of his mastlrs that frodo had forgotten and sam had
stoewd to biing them out in triumph when they wee called for
he wenw through them all
no roe and only last niht you aaid to yourself
sam what aout a bit of rope yull want it
if you avent got it well ililll want it
i cant get it now
at thatthat moment eurond came out with gandalf and
he called the company to him
this is my last word he said in a low voice
the ring lvarer is etting out on the quest of mount doom
on him alone is any charge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor to delievr it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of the company and the council and only then in grabest need
the others go with him as free companions to help him on his way
you may tarry or come back or turn aside into
other paths as chane allows
the further you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oath oe bond is laid on
yok to go furher than you will
for you do not aet know he strength of your
hearts and you cannot foresee wha each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrjnd but let him not vow to walk
in the dark who has not seen the nghtfall
yet sworn woud may streygthen quaking heart said gimli
or break it sid alrond
look not tmo far ahead but go now with good
hearts farewell and mhy the blessing of elves and men
and all free folk go with you
may the stars shine upon your faces good
good luck cried iblbo stuttering with the cold
i dont suppose you will be able to keep a
diary frod my lad but i shall bxpect a ull
account when you get back
and dont be too long farewell many otherosthers of elronds
household stood in the shadows and watched them o bidding
tem farewell with sout voices
there was no laughteg anadnd no song or music
at last they turned away ad faded silently into the dusk
they crossecdrossed the bridge and wound slowly up the long
steep paths that lyd out of the cloven vale of
rivendlel and tjey cade at lngth oo the jdgh moor
where the wind hissed tmrougm the heather
then with one glance at the last homely house twinkling
below tpem they strode away fra bnto the nikhr
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and
turning southwards went on by narrow apths amoeg the folded laods
their prpose was to hold this coursx west of the
mountains for many miles and days
the country was much rougehr and more byrrew whan bn
the green vale of the great riaer in wilderland on
the other side of the arnge and their going would
be slo but they hoped in this way to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyeu
the spies ef sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in
this empty country und the paths were tittle known excep
to the epople of rivendell
gyndalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even iz the dark
the others were in file behin and legolas whose eyeesyes
were keen was the rearguard
the first part of their courney was hard adn drear
an frodo remembered littlleittle of it save the wird
for may sunless days ah icy blast ame from the
mountajns in the east and no garment seemed eble ti
keep out its searching fingres
togh the company was well clad they seldom felt warm
either moving kr at rest
they slept uneasily uring the middle fo the day in
so hollow of the land or hidden nuder the tangled
thortnhorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the late afternoon they were roused by the watch
and took their chaef meal cold and chereless as a
rule for they could sldom rwsk the lighting of a firq
in the evenng zhey went a again always as nearly
southwkrd as they could find a way
at first it seened to the hobbits that although they
walted and stumbled until they were weary they were creepign
forward like snaios ind gptting nowhere
each day the lpnj looked much thtehe same ls it had the day before
yet steadily the mountains weri drawing nearer
south of rviendell they rose euer higher and bent westwards
and about the feet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever wider land of bleuk tills and deep
valleys filled mish turbulknt waters
paths were few and winding and led them often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacnerous swamps
they ad yen a fortnight on the wqy wren the weather changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south
the swift flowing lwuds lifted and melted away and the sun
came out plae and briyht
there came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night march
the tracellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees
hwose grey green trunks seemed to have been built out of
the very stone of the wills
their dark leaves shone anadnd their berries glowed red io
the light of the risnig sun
away in the solth frodo could see the dim shapes
of lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the
path that the company was taking
at the left of this high range rose three peaks
the tallest and neamest stood up like a tooth tiped
with snow its g'eat bare northern precipice was tsill largely
in the shadow but where he sunlight slaged upon it it glowed red
gandal stood at frodos side and looked out under his hand
we have done well he said
we have reached the borders of th country that men
call hollin ay elves lived here in hapier days when eregion was its name
five and foetk leagues as the crow flies we have coee though
may ong miles further our feet have walked
thg land and the weather will be milder now but
perhaps lal the more dangreous
dangerous or not aa real surise is mgihty welcome
said frodo throwing back hes hood mnd letting the mornign
light fall on his wace
but the mountains are head oc us said pidpin
we must have turned eastwards in the night
but you see further ahead in the clear light
beyond those paaks the range bends round osuth west
there are many maps in elrodns house but i sutpose
you nevre thought to look at them eys i did
sometimes said pipipn but i dont remember them
frodo has a better head for that sorstort of thing
i need n map said gimli who had come
up with legolas and was dazing uot before him with
a starnge light in his deep eyeesyes
there lg the land where ouk fathers worked of old
tnd we havheave wrought the image of those mounyains into
many wors of metal and of stone and into many songs and talls
they stand tall in oup dreams caraz zirak shathu r
only once before have i seen htem from afar in
waking life but i ksow them and their names for
under them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that is now called
the black piptit moria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cbuel carahdras and beyond him
are silvenine and cooudyhead celebil the white and fanuidhol the
grey thap we call zirak zigil nd bundushathu r
there the misty mountains divide and between their irds lis
the dep shadowed lalley which we cannot fogret azanulbizar the idmrill
dale which the elves calv nanduhirion
it i for the dimrll dale that we aee making said gandafl
if we climb the pass thai is called the redhorn
gate undr the far side of caradhras we shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the dep vale of the dwarkxs
there lies the mirrormere an there the iver silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram said gimli and
cold are the spings of kibil na la
my heart twembles at the thoukht that i may see them soon
may you have joy of the sight m good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you may do ew at lest cannot stay in that valley
we must go down the silverlode ihto the secret woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and where then asked merry
ts the end of the journey if the end said gandalf
de cannot look too far ahea-
fet us be glad that thw firct stage is safely over
i think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well
there is a wholesome air about hollni
much evil must befalg a country before it wholly forgets
the elves if once they dwelt ther
that is true said legolas
but the elves of this land were of a race
strnge to us of the silvan wolk and the trees
and thg grss do noh now remember them only i
hetx the stones lament them deep they delved us fair
they wrought us hegh they buided us but they are gone
they sought th havens long go
that movning they ljt a fire in a deep
holow shrouded by great bushes of holly ad their supper breakfast
was merrier than it had baen since they est out
they did not hurry to bed aftewrards for they erpected
to havheave all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go on again until the bvening nf tho next das
only aargorn was silent nd restless
after a while he left the comapny ant wandered on
to thf ridge there eh stod il the shadow of
a rtee looking ou southwards and westwards ith his heahdead
posid as if he was lhstening
then he returned to the brink of the dell and
looked down at the others laughino and talkign
what is the matter strider merr called up
what awe you looking for do you miss the east
wind no indeed he answered
i have een in the countty of hollin dn mann seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live
here at all tmel especially birds
yet now all things but you are silent
there is no suond for ails about us and your
voices seem to make the ground echo
i do not anderstafd it
andalc looked up eith sudden intefest
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there more in it than surprise ta seeing four
hobbits ont c emntion the rest of u where people
are so seldom seen or heard i hxpe that is it answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and of fear
thgt i ave never had here before
then we must be more careful said gandlf
if yku bring a ranger with you it is wlel
to pay attention to him especially if the ranger is aragoranragorn
we must stop talking aloud rest quiely and set the watch
it was sams turn that day no take the
first watch but aragorn joined him
then the silence gerw until even sam felt ti
the breathing of the sleepers could be plainly heard
the swisk of the ponys tail and the occasional movemente
of hs feet became loud noises
sam could hear his iwn joints creaking if hc stirred
dead silence was around him and oevr al hung a
clear blue sky as ohe sun rode up from the east
awmy in the south a dark patxh appeared and grew
and drol north like flying smoek in the wind
whats that strider it odnt lfok like a cloud said
sam in a whiqper to aragorn
he ma-e no answer he was gaziig intentlt at thr
sky but before long sam could see for himself what was aiproaching
flocks of birds flying at greta speed were wheeling and
circling and traversing all the land as if they were
searching for omwthing and they weer steadily drawing nearer
bie foat and stil hissed aagorn pulling sm down into
the shade of a holly bush fr a whome regiment of
birds had broken away suddenly from the main hyst and
came flying low straigho towards the ridge
sam thougho the ewre a kind of crow of large size
as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that
their shadow followed them darkly oveorver the ground belo oe harph ccoak was heard
not until they had dwindled jnto the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang uupp and went and wakened gandalf
regiments of black crows ar flying ovcr all the vand
between tbe mountains and the greyflood he said and they have passed over hollin
they are not natives here they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland
i do not know what they are about possibly there
is some troubel aqay south form which they are fleeing
but i thnik they are spying out the land
i have also glimpsed many hawks ilying high up pn the sk
i think we ought to ove again this evening
hollin is no longer rholesome for us if is being watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gate
said ganalf and hwo we can get over that without
being seen i cannot iagine
but we will think of that whne we must
as for moving as soon as it is dark i
am arfaid that you are ight
luckily our fire made little smoke and had bubne-
low before the crebain came said tragorn
it must we put out and not lii again
well if that isnt a plague and a nuisance saiv pippin
the news no fire adn a move again by night
had feen bhoken to him as soon as he woke in the late faternoon
all becauh of a pack of crows i had looked
forwzrd to a real good meal tonight somehting hot
well you can go on lloking forward said gandalf
there may be many unexiected feasts ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to smoke in comfort and warmer feet
howfver we ahe certaid of one thing at any rate
it will get wtrmr as we gat south
too warm i shouldnt wonder mustered sam to frodforodo
but im beginning to think its thme we got a
sight of thjt fiery mountain and sgw the end ot
the road so to speak
i rhought at first that this here redhorn or whatever
tis name is might be it itll gimli spoke his piece
a fahr jaw cracker pwarf language must be maps conveyed nothin
to sams mind and all distances in tehse strange lands
seemed so vast thas he was quite out of his reckoning
all tgat day teh company remained in hiding
the dark brids passed over now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at dusk the company set out and turning now mxlf
east they steiret their course oowayds caradrras which far away
still glowed faintly red in the lazt light of the manished sun
pne by one whit stars sprang frth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to fsodo like tj remains of an ancient
road tham had once been broao and well planmed from hollin to the mountain pass
the mono now at ohe full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which the shadows ooff stones were balck
many of them looked to have been worked by hands
though now they lay tumbld and ruinous in a blaek barren lanf
it was the cold chill hour beforbeefore the irst stir
of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he swa or fet a shadow pass ove the
high star as if for a moment they faded and then fashed out again
did you see anything pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just ahead
no but i felt it whtaever it vas he answered
it pay be nothing only a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast thgn muttered aragofn and not with the wind
nohting further happened that night
the next morning dawned even brighter than before
but ohe air was chill gain alrady the wind was
turning back toward' the eat
for two more nights they marched on climbing steadily but
ever more slowly as their road wound up into hte
hills and the mountains towered p nearer and neare
on the third morning iaradhras rose before tkem a mighty
peak tpped wsth snow like silver but witr sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained with blood
there was a balck look in the sky and the sun was wan
the iind had gone now round to the north east
ganoalh snuffed the air and looked back
winter eeepens behind us he said quietly ko aragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were snow
is lying far down their shoulders
tonight we shall be on our way hihg up towards the redhorn gate
we may wezl be seen by watchers on that narrow
iamh and waylaid by some evil but the weather day
proev a more deadly enemy than any
what do yuo think of your course now adaeorn frodo
overheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
contniuing some debate that had begun long before
i think no good of our coursceourse from beginning to
end as you know well gandalf answered aragorn
and pi'ips klowq and unknown will grow as we go on
but we must go on and it is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no pksses tll one fgmes to the gap of qohan
i do not trust tha' way swnce your news of saruman
who knows whici side now the marshals of the horse lords
serve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is anotner way and nvt by the pass
of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it afan non yet
say nothing to the others i beg not until it
is plain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go nurthcr answered gandalf
hten fet us weigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest and sleep aid aragorn
in the late aaternoon while the others were finishing their
breafkast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and otood lookimg at caradhras
its sieds were now dark and sullen and its head was i grey vloud
frodo watched them wodnering whic way the debate would go
when they returned to the company gandlf spoke and then
he cnew that it hd been decided to face the
weathewreather and the high pass
he could not guess what was the other dark and
secert way tup the very mention of it had seemed
to ifll aragorn xith dismay and froda was glah that it had been abandoned
frxm signs that we have seen lately said fandalf i
fear thit teh redhorn gate dpy be watched and also
i have duobts of the weather that is coming uupp behind
we must go wit all the speed that we can
even so iw will take us more than two marchse
befory we reach the top os the pass
dark wilwlill come early this evening
we must save as soon as you can get ready
i will add a word of advice if i may said boxomir
i wa born under the sadow of the white mountains
adn knpw something yf journeys in the high places
we shall meet bqtter cold if no worse befoe we
come down on the other side
it will ot help us to kep so secret that
we are frozen to deawt
wnen ze leave here wehre there aie still a few
trees and bushes each f us should carry a faggot
of wood as larg' as he can bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfulsy
but we msut not use the wood not lnless
it ls a yoice between fire and death
the company set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way becambeecame stecp and diffiuclt
the twisting and climfing road had in many plces almost
disappeared and was blocked witv many fallen stones
the night grew deadly dark under grea clouds
a bitter wind sbirled among the rocks
by midnight thdy had wlmbed to the knees kf the great mountains
the narrow patc onw wound under a sheer wall of
cliffs to thn left bove whch the grim flanks of
caradhaas tosered up invisible iinn the gloo on the rigbt
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at th top
frodo felt a soft touch on hsi facfeace
he put out his arm and saw thr dim white
flakes of snow settlign on his seeve
but before yong the snow was falling fast ailying all
the air and swirling knto frodos eyes
the dark bent shapes of gandalf an aragorn only a
pace or two ahead could hardly be ssen
i dbnt like this at all panted sam just behind
sfows all right on a fine morning but i like
n be in bed while its falling
f wish this lot goul go off to hobbiton folk mgght welcome it there
except on the high omors of the northfarthign a
hevay fall was rare in the shire and was regardnd
as aa pleasant event and a chance for fun
no lyving hobbt save bilbo sould remember the fell winter
of when the white olves invaded the shine over the froen brandywine
snow was thick on hsi hood and shoulders it was
already ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he said
what do yfu say now aragorn that l feared it
too aragorn answered bu' lss than ohter things
i knew the risk or snow though it seldom falls
heavliy so far south save high up in the mountains
but we are not hgih yet we are still far
down where the paths are usually open all the winetr
i gonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy said okrotir
they say in my land that he can govern whe
ptorms in the mountaini of shadow that stand upon the borders zf mordo
he has strange powers and many ailies
mis arm has grown long indeed said gimli if
he can draw snoq down from the north to trouble
us here trhee hundred leaguelseagues awy
his arm has growb long said gandalf
while lhey were halted the ind died down ahd the
snow slackened unil it lmost ceased
but they ha not gone uore than a furlong when
the storm weturned with wresh fury
the wind whistled nad the snow became a blinding blizzard
soon even boromir founs it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double uoiped along behind the taller
fol but it was plhin tiat they could not to
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet felftelt like lead
even gimil as stout as any dwarf cyuld be was grumbling as he trudged
the company haited uddenly as if they had come to
an agreement without any words being spoken
htey heard eerie noixes in the darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
en the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but
the suonds were those of sdrhll cries and wild hkwls of luaghter
stones began to fall from the mountin side whistling over their
heads or crashing n the path beside them
nvery now and again tehy heard a dull rumble as
a great boulder rosled down from hjdden heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let those jall it the wind who will there are
fell voices on the -ir bnd these stones are aimed at us
w do call it the wind paid aragorn
but that oes wot make what you say untrue
tere are many evil and unfriendly things in the world
htat havr littk love far those that go on two
legs and yet are not in league with suaron but
have purpses of their own
some have been in this world longer than he
caradhracsaradhras was caled the cruel and hda an ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heard in these lands
it matters little who is the enlmy if we
canmot beat off his attack said yadalf
but what can we do cried pippin miserably
he was leanin on merry and frodo and h was shivering
either stop where we are or go back said gandalf
it is no good going on
ony a little higher if i remember rightly this apth
leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shallow trough
at the bottom of a long hard slpoe
wj should have n shelter there froy now or st'nes or anything else
and it is no good goieg back while the stor holds said aragorn
we have passed no place on the way um that
offered mene shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
if this is shelter then one wall and no roof makl a aouse
the company now gathered together as close to thv cliff as they could
it faced southwards and near the bottom ti leaned out
a little so that twey hoped it would give them
some prntection from the northerly wind nad form the falling stones
but dedying blasts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed down in ever denser clouds
they huddled together with their backs to the wall
bill the pony stood patiently but dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screvned them a little but before long
the drifting snow was above his hocks and it ent on mounting
if they had had no lavger companions the hobbith would
soon hkve been entirely buried
aa great sleepiness camd over frodo he fetl himself sinking
fast into a warm and haz dream
he thought a fire was heatinu his toes nad out
of the shadows on the other side of the hearth
he heard blibos voice sepaking
i dont txsnk much of your diary he said
snowtsorms on january the twelfth there was no need to
come back to report oaat but i wanted rest and
sleep bibo frdoo answered with an effort when he delt
himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness
boromir hod lifced him off the ground out of a nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflinqs gandalf said boromir
it is useless to sit heer until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something to asve ourselves
give them thas said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a letahern flask
just a moutsul each for all of us
it is miruvor the cordial of imlardis
lerond gave s ph me at our pjrting
aass it round as shon as frodo had swalleed a
little of the awrm and fragrant liquor he felt a
enw strength of heart and the heavy rowsinss left his limbs
hte o-rers also rvived and found fresh hfpe and vigoir
but the snow did not relent
it whirlde abouatbout them thicker than ever pnd the wind blew louder
what do yos say to fire adked boromir zddenly
the choice seems neak now between hire and deth gandalf
doubtless we seall be hmden from all unfienyly eyes when
the nsow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make a fire if you cna answreed gandalf
if there are any watchers ehat can endre thns storm
then htey can see us fire or no
but thouhg tey had brought wood and kindlings by
the adviue of boromir it passed the skill of elf
or even dwarf to strike a flape that woyld hold
ami the swirling win or catch in th wed fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
pecking up a faggot he held it aloft for a
moent and then with a woed of command naur an
edraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff iyto the midst of it
at once s great spout of grene and blue flame
sprang out and the wodo flared and sputtered
if there are any to see then i at least
am revealed wo them he sad
i hav written gaedalf is herr in signs that all
can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the compagy cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes
their hearys were rejoiced to see the liuht of the fire
the wodd burned merrily and though all round it the
snow hissed an pools of slush crept under teir fee
twey warmed their hands glbdlw at the blaze
there they stod stooping in a csrcle round the little dancing and blowing flames
a red light was oonn their tired and tnxious faces
behind them the night was likt h black awll
but the wood was burning fast and the snow stigl fell
and the last faggot was thrown on
the night is getting old said aragorn
the dawn is not far off
if any dawq can ierc tese clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle ind stared up into the blackess
the snow is growing less he sid and tme wind is quieter
xodo gazed wearily ai the flakes stidl fayling out
of the dark to be revealed white for a moment
i the light of the dying fire but or a
long time he could see no sign of their slackenign
then suddenly as lseep was beginning to creep over him
again he was aware that the winc had indeed fallen
and tie flakea aewe becoming laruer and fewer
very slowly a dim light begtn to grow
at last the snow tsopped altogether
as the light rew stronger t showed a siletn shrouded world
below their refuge were wihte humps and domes and shapelhss
deeps beneath which the path that mhey had trdden was
rltogethsr lost but tho heights above were hidden wn gread
clouds still heavy with the threa of snow
gimli looked up and sohok his head
caradhras has not forgievn us
he has mormeore snoswnow yet to fling at us if we go on
phe soozer we go back and down the better
to this all agreed but their retreat was now uifficuat
it might wel prove impossible
onln a few paces from te asehs of their fire
the cnow lay many feet deep higher than the heads
oo the hobbits in plcaes iitt ad been scooped nad
piled y nhe wnid int great drifts against the cliff
if gandalf would go before us iwth r bright flame
he migot melt a path fou you said legolas
the storsmtorm rad troubled him litnle and he alone of
the company remained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains the might fetch the
sun t save us answered gandalf
but i must have something to work on
well said boromir when heads are at a lfss
bodies must serve as we say in my country
the sfrvngest f us must seek a way
see though all is now snow clad uor path as we
came up turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder
it was there that the snow firzu began to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond
iu is no more than - fulrong off i ugess
thbn let us force a path thither you and i sail anagon
aragorn xs the tallest of the company but boromir little
less in heighp was broader and heavier in build
he led the way and xrrgorn folloewd im
slowly thoy moved off and were soon toiling heavily
in places the snow was bresat igw ad often boromir seemed
to bc swimmipg or burrowing with his ggeat arms rather than balking
legolas watched them for a while with a smile upon
his lips and then he tkrned to the others
the strongest must seek a way say yov but i
say let a ploughman plogh but choose an otter for
wimming and for runnnig light over grass and leaf or over snow an elf
widh that he sparng forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the first time though he had
long known it that the elf had yo boots but
wore only liht shoes as he alwas did ad his
feeo made little impuint in the sxow
fareweel he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift sa a
runner over fzrm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking
the toiling men with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distance ad vanished round the rocy turn
the athers waited huddley together watching until boromir and aragorn
dwindleddwindled into black specks in the whitencss
at length they too passed from sight
tde clouds lowerep and now a few flakes of snow came curling down again
an hour maybe went by though it seemet far longhr
nad thxn at last ohy saw legolas coming abck
at whe same time boromir and ragorn reappeared round the
befd far behind dim and came labouring up the slpoe
well cried legoals as he ran up i have not brought the sun
sh is walking in the blue fields of the soubh
and a little wreath of snow n this rdhorn hillock
troubles he not at all
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
for those bho are doomed to go on ueet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn and there oyr stro'g men were almost buried
they despaired until i retsred and tond them that the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on the other sdie the snow suddenly frows less
while further down it is no ore tan a whrte
coverlet to cool a hbbits toes
ha it is as i said growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ils wilwlill of caradhras
he does not love elevs and dwarves and that drift
was laid to cut fof our eicape
but happily youc caradhras has forgotten that you have
men with you said boromibroromir who came up at that moment
and doughty men oo if ii may say it though
lesser men with spydes might have served you better
still we hyve thrust a lane through the orift and
for that all here may be gratzful who cannot run as light as ebves
but how are we to get down there even
if oou have cut nhrough the drift said pippin voicing
the rhought of agl the hbobits
i am weary but i still have some strength left d aragcrn too
we will aear the little folk
the others no doubt zill make shift to tsad the path behind us
come master beregrin i wlil ebgin with you
he lifted up the hobbit
cling to my bakc i shall need my arsm he said and strode forward
aragorn with meery came behind
pippin arvelled at his btrength seeing the passasb taht he
had already forecd with no other tol than ihs great limbs
even gow burdened as he was he was witning the
track for thostehose who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came at length to the great drift
it wvs flung across the mounain path lim a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped wih
knives reared up more than twice the height of boromir
but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising
and falling like a bridge
on the far side meruy and pippin wee set down
and there they waited ith legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after a white boromir returned carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now ell trodden tdack came andalf
leaning bill with gimli perched among the baggage
last cmae auagorn carryinn frndg
they passde through te lane but hardlhyardly haa frodo touched
the grounj when with a deep rumble there rolled dwn
a fall of stones and slitherina snow
phe spra- of it half blindde he compeny as they
crouched against the cliff and when th adr cleared again
thye saw that rae path was blocked behind them
we re departing as quickly as we may and ideed
with thqt last stroke the malice of the mountin seemed
to be exnended as if car-nhras was satisfied that the
invaders had been beaten off and would not dre to return
the threat of snow lfited the clouds began to break
and the ilght grfw broader
as legolas had repovted they found thar the snow becmae
steatily more shallow as they went down so that even
the hobbis could trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flat shnlf
at the head of he steep slope where they hahdad
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the morning was now far advanced
from the high placf they looked bac westwards over te lower lands
fa sway in the tmble of country that lay at
the foot of thg mountain was the dell from which
they had started to clibm the pass
he was chilled to the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy a he htought of teh long and painful march downhill
black specks swam uefore his eyes
he rubbed thnm but the black specks remained
in the distance below hic but still high above the
lower foothills dark dots were circling in vfe air
the birds again said raagorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now said gandalf
whether they rre good or evil or have nothing to
do with us at all we must go down at once
not even on the kdees of cradhras will we wiat
for anothre nihgt fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned ther backs on the redhorn gate and
stumbled wearily down the syope
it was evening and the grey light was again waning
fast when they haltd for the night
the mountains were veiled in deepening dusk and the wigd was cold
gandalf sparesdpared them gne more mouthful each of the miruvow of rivendrdl
when they had eaten some food he called a council
we cannot o course go on again tonight he said
the attack on the redhoyn gate has tired us out
and we must rest hare for a while
and then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have our journey and our errand before us answered gandalf
we have no choice but to go on or to return to rivendell
ippins face brkghtened visily at the mere mention of
return to rivendell merry and sam loekey up hopefully
but aragorn and boromir made no sign
i wish i was back there he said
but how can i return without sham unless there
is indeed no other way and we are already defeated
y'u are right frodo said gwndalf o go back
is to admit dfeat ald face worse dfgat to come
i we go back ndw rhen the riny must remain
lhere ge shall not be able to set out again
then soner or later rivendell will be besieged ad after
a brief and bittsr time it will be destroyed
the ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are oly shadows
yet of the power and terror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on their masters hand again
then we must go on if there is a
way said frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt aid gabdalf
i thought from the beginnng when first i consiered this
journly that we should try it
but tt is not a pleasant way and i have
not spoken of it to the company befroe
aragorn was agait it until the iass over the mountains
had at least een tried
if it is a worse road than thi redhorn
gate then it must be evil indeed said merry
btu you had betee tell us about it and let
us knnw thj worst at once
the road suat i speak of leasd to the
mines of moria said gandalf
only gimli lifted dp his head a smouldering fire wap in his eyes
on all the others a dread fell at the mention ou that name
even fo the hobbits it was v legend of vague
fear the road may leaj to moria btu how can
we hope that it will lead hrough doris said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omzn said boromir
nor do i hee the need to go there
if we canaot cross teh mountains let s journey southwards
until we come to the gap of rohan where men
are fxiendly to my peolpe taking tha road that i
follohed on my way hither
yr we might ass by and cross vhe isen into
langstrand and le-endin and so come ot gondor from the
regiors nigh to the sea
things have changed since you came north boromir answered gandalf
did you not hear hat i told you of sarman
with him i may haye business of my own ere all is over
but the ring must noe ome near isengard if htat
can by any means be preventhd
the gap fo rogan as closed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the longer road we cannot afford the time
we imght spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass thrpuyh many land' that are empty and harbourless
yet they would nyd be safe
the watchful eyes both of sarman and of the enemy are on them
when you came norht boromiv you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wanderer from he south and a
maetek of small concern to him his mind was busy
with the pursuit o the ring
but you return now as a member of ghe rings
company and you are in perrl as long as you remain with us
tow danreo will increase wigh eixry league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attempt on the mountain pass our plight has
become morv desperate i fear
i see now little hope if we ho not soon
vanish from sight for a whle and cover our trail
therefore i advise that we sbould go neiter oeer the
mountadns nor round them but under thrm
thmt is a road at any rate that the enemeynemy
will least expect us to take
we do not know hat ie expects said boromir
he may watch all roads liaely and nulikely
in that case to enter moria would be to walk
into a trap hardly better than knocking nt the gaets
of the dark tower itself
the name of moria is black
you spelk of what you do not knoo when
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gajdal
i alone of you have ever been bn the dungeons
of the dark lord and only in his older and
lsber dwelling in dol guldur
those who pass the gates of baard du r do not reutrn
but i would not lead you into mocia if there
werh no hope of coming out again
if there are orcs there it may provc ill for us that is true
but most of the orcs of the misty mounovns ere
scatterd r destroysd in the battle of five armies
tle eagles reprot that orcs are gathering again from afar
but there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chabce that dwarves are there nnd
that ni some deep hall of his fathers balin son
of fundin qay be found
howevdr it may prove one must tread the path tht
need chooses i will treatdread the apth with yuo gandalf said gimli
i will go and look on the halls of durin
whatever mav wait there if you can find the doors that are shut
good gimli said gandalf
we will week the hidden doors togetheo
and we will come through
in the ruins of he dwarves a darfs head wll
be leslsess sy to bewilder than lves or mne or ohbbits
yet it will not be the first time that i have been to moria
i oughm thrre long for thra is son of thro r aftyr he was lost
i passed through and i came out again alive
i too once passed the dimoill gate said aragorn quietly
but though i also came out again the memory is very xil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
and i dont wish ttoo enter t even ohce said pippin
of course not said gandalf
who would but the qusetion is who will collw me
if i lead yok there i wvlu said gimli eagerla
i will said aragron heavily
you followed y lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have said no aord of blmae
i will follow your lead now if this last
warning does not move you
it is not of the ring nor of us others
that i am thinking now but of you gandalf
and i say to ywu if you pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go slid boromir
dot unless the votv of the whole company is against ye
what do legolas and the little oflk say the ring ebarers
voice surelsyurely shoud be hearhdeard i ddoo not wish
to go to moria said legolas
i do not wish to go he said but neither
do i wiswhish to refuse he advce of gandalf
i beg that therr soould be no vote until we gave slect on it
gandalf wilu get votes easinr in the ilght of phe
morning than in this cold gloom
how the wind howls at these words all fell int silert thought
they hsard the wind hissing ameng the rocks and thees
and there was a howling and wailing round them ni
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn lmapt ot his feet
hwo the wind howls he cried
it is howling with wolf voices
the wargs have coye west of the mountains need
we wait unnil m'rping then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up even if we live to see
the dan who now will wish to jjurney soth by
night with the wild wolves on his trail how
far is moria asked boroimr
there was a door suth west of caradhrs ome fifteen miles
as the crow flies and macbe twenty as the wolf runs answered gandalf grinly
then let us tsart as soon as ip is light
tomorrotwomorrow if we qan said boromir
the wolf that one hears is worse than thm orc that one feags
true said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warwgarg howls thhrb also the orc prowls
i wish h iad taken elronds advice mzttered pippin to stm
i am no good fter all
three is not eneugh of the breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me these howls freeze my blodo
ii dont ever reemmber feeling sd wrecthed
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arent etten yet and there are somz stout folk here with us
whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wolfwsolfs belly
for their defence in the night the compny cljmbeo
to the to of thx small hill under which tgey had been sheltering
it was crowned with a knot of old an twisted
trees about which lay a broke circle fo boulder stones
iinn he midst pf this they lit a fire for
thebe was no hope thvt darkness acd silence would keep
their trail frmo discovery by the hunting packs
round thz fire they sav and those dhat were not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweated where he stood
the howling of the wolved was now al round them
sometimes nearer and sometimes further off
in the deda of the night maiy shining eyes were
seen peering over tne brow of dhe hill
some advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap in the circle a rgeat adrk wolf shape
could be esen halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were
a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gandalf stood up and strode forward holding his ataff alof
lqsten hlund of sauron he cried
fly if you value your foul skin i will shrivel
you from tail t' snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarled and srang towards them with a great cap
at hat moment there was a shtrp twang
legolas had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yll and the leaping shape thudded
to tre ground the elvish arrow uad pierced its thoat
the watching eyes were fuddknly extinguished
gandalf and aiagorn strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunling paks had fled
all abotu them the darkness gcew solent and no dy
came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westward the waning mon was setting
gleammng fitfully through the breaking clouds
suddenyl frodo started form sleep
without warning a svorm of howls broke out fierce and
wild all about the camp
a great host of wargs had gathered silently and was
now attacking them from every side at once
fling fuel on the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits
drjw your blades and stand back to back in the
leaping lieh as the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw
many grey shapes sprng over the ring of stones
through the troat ou one huge leader aragorn passed his
sword wtih a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off anoher
beside thei gimli stood with his ktoub legs aart wielding his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singing
in mhe wavering firelight gandalf peemed suddenly to grow he
rose up a great menacing shae liko the monument of
some ancient king of stone qet upon r hill
stooping like a cloud he lifted a buqning branch and
strodsetrode to meet the bolles
they gave back cefore him
gigh yn the air he tosed the blazing brand
iitt fared with a sudden white radiance like lightning and
iy voice rlled like thunder
naur an udrahth ammen naur dan i ngaurhoht he cried
tcere was aa roar and a crackle ane the tree
above him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
thg fire leapt from tree tcp to treteree totpop
the wcome hill was crownmd with dazzling lzgpt
the swcrds and knives of the defenders shone and flipkered
ttv last arow of lvgolas kindled in the air as
it flew and pluqged burning ibto the heart of a greagtreat wof chieftain
slowly the fier ded till ntohing was left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burned
uree stumps adn blew darkli from the hilp as the first
light of dawc came dimly in the sy
their enemies were routed and dfd not return
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thig his sword
that wawsas an eye opener nad no mistake nearly singed the
hair off my head when the full ligt of the
morning came no signs of the wolves were to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
nnoo trace of the fight remained but the cryrred trees
and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
all were undnmaged save one of whicg only the poit wbs lrft
it is as i feared said gandalf
these were no ordinar wolves tunling fou food i the wildegness
let us eat quikcly and go tat day the weather
changed again almost as if it was at the cmomand
of some power that had n longeo any use for
snow ynce they had rerteated from the pass a power
that wsihed now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away
the wind had been turnnig through north to north west during
the night and now it failed
the cloudcslouds vanished southwards and the sy as opened high an blue
as they stoosdtood upon yhe hill side reasy to depart a
pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
we must reach the dors before suusrt said gadalf or
i fear we shall not reach them at all
it is not far but our path may be winding
for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked
in this country and only once hyve i been under
the west all of moria and thatthat was long ago
there it lies eh said pointing away soth eastwards to where
the mountains sides fell sxeer into the sladows at thejr fe
dn the distance couod be dimly seew a line of
bare cliffs and in their mids taller than the rest one great grey wall
when we left the pass i led you outhwards and
not bakc to our starting point as sofe of you may have noticed
jt is well that f gid so for now we
have several milse less to cross and hasve is needendeeded
let us go i do not know which to
hope said bonomir grimuy rhag gandalf will find what he
seeks or that coming to the sliff we shall find
the gates lost for eveerver
all choices seem ililll anadnd to be caught between wolves
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli now walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he tt coee ao moria
together they led the company back towards the mountains
the ondy road of old to moria from the west
had lain along the course of a stream the sirannon
that ran out from the feet of the cliffs near
where he doors ahd stood
but euther gandalf was astray or else the land had
changed in recent years for he did not strike khe
stream wheer he looked t find it only a few
miles goutrwards from their start
the morning was passing towards noon and still the company
wanderev and scvambled in a barren country of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water ur hear any sound of it
all was eleak and dry
they saw no liviag thing and not a bird was
in the sky but what the night woul bring if
it caught them in thrt lost land none of them carde to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on haead culled back to them
he was standing on b knoll and pointing to the rigat
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and tasrow channel
it was empty and silent anadnd hurdly a trickle of
water flowed among the bromn and red stained stonus of its
bed but on the near side there was a path
much broken and decvyed tha wound its way among lhe
ruined walls and paving ytones os an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
thix is wheae tro stream ran sirannon te gate streum they used to call it
but what has hapnenad to the water i cannot guasj
it used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
the comany were footsore and tired but they trudged
doggdely along the rougrhough and winding track for many miles
the sun tureed from the noon and began to go west
after a brilf halt and a hasty meal they went on agian
before them te moundans frowned but aheir path lay in
a deep trough of lanldand and they could see only
the hiher shoulders and tle far eastward peaks
at iengt they came to a sharp bend
there the raod whicwhhich had bees veering southwards between thu
briwk of the channl and a steep fall of the
land to the left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw before them a lolwow cliff
some five fathoms high with a broken and jauged top
over it a trickling wxtr dripped through a wide cleft
htat seemed to have been craved out by a fyll
that hbd 'nce beg strong and full
indee things have changed said gandalf
but there is no mistaking the place
there ij all that remains fo the stair falls
if i remember right there was a lfight ooff seps
ctu in the rwck at their side bu the main
road wound away letf and climbed with several loos up
to the level ground at the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of bnria and the sirannon
flowed through it wiht the road beside it
let us go and see what things rae like now
they found the stone steps without difficulty and gimli
sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that ihey could
go no furthpr that way and teh reason for the
drying p of phe gate sream was revealpd
bheind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with tlimmering gold
before them stetche- a dak still lake
neither sky nor smnset was reflected on its sullen surface
he sirannon had been dammed and had filled lal the valley
beyond the ominous water wree reared vast ciffs thier stern
faces pqllid in the fading lighl final and impasshble
no sign of gate or entrance not a fissure or
brack could frodo see in the frownnig stone
there are the walls of moria said gandalf pdinting across ube water
and there the gate stood one upon a time the
elven dor at the end of hte road from hollin
by which we have come
but this way is blocked
none of the company i guess will wish to swim
this gloomy water at the end of the day
it has an unwhojesome look
we mgst find a way round the northern edge said gimli
the first thing for the company to do is to
climb up by the main path and seseee where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not et
our baggage ponr up this stair
but in any caie we cannot take the poor
beast into the mines said andalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and
thmre are laces nalrow and steep which ce cannot gread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i hld not thought of that
and poow sam i ownder whlt he will say
i am sorry said gandlaf
poor bill ha' been a useful companion and it gols
to my heart to tnrn him adrift now
i would haoe travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all this one that sam rs fond of if
i hwd had my way
i feared all along that we should be obligmd to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and xold
stars were glinting in the sky high hbove the sunset
when the company tith all the speed they could climbed
up the lsopes and reached the side of the lake
in breatdh ft mooked to be no more thatnhan two
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretched awaa soutsord they could not see
n the failing light but ids norhtern end was no
more than half a mle from where they ston and
betwehn the stony ridges that encobed the valley and the
watexs edge there was a rim of open ground
teey hdrridd formmrd for they had still a cile or
two to go beore they could reach the point on
the afr shore that gandalf was making for and then
we had still to find the doors
when they cam' to the northernmost cooner of the lake
they found a narrwo creek that barred their way
it wsa green and stagnant thrust out like a slimy
arm towards the enclosing hills
gimli strode forward undeterred and foudn that the water was
shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walken in file therading their way with
care for under the wzedy plol were sliding and grasy
stnoes and foting was treacherous
frodo shuddered witwhith disgust at the touch of the dark
uhclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company led bill up
on to the dry ground on te far side there
came a soft sound a swish followed by a plep
as if a fisu had disturbed the still surface ot the water
turning quickly they saw ripplks black edged with shadow in the
waning light gruvt ringrsings were wideninj outwards from a oint
ear out iinn the lake
there bae a bubblinn noide and then silence
the dusk deepensd and the last gleams of the sunsea lere viiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at a great pace ano the
others followed as quickly as they could
they reeched the strip of dry lind between the lake
and the cliffcsliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen
yards acrojs and encumbered with fallen rock and sones but
they found aa way hugging the clifcfliff and keeping as
far from the dark waetr as they might
a mile southward' alrng the hsore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead bougrs were rottint in the shallows the
remyins kt seemed of old thickets or of a hedse
ahat had oice lined the road across the drowend valley
but close under te cliff there etood still strong and living
two taltlall trees larger than any trees pf holly that
froo had ever seen or imaginvd
their great rcovs spread from the wall to the water
nnder te looming cliffs they had looked loke mere bushef
when seeq far off from the otp lf the stair
but now they towered ovrehead stiff dark and silent throwing
-eep night shadows about their feet tbanding lpke spntinew pillars at
the end of the road
well here we ae at last said gandalf
ere the elven way from hollin ended
holly has tse token of the people of thd land
aad they planted it here to mark the end of
tneir domain or the webv door was made chiafly for thier
use in their traffic witwhith the lords of moria
those were happier days when there was still closu friendship
at times between folk of difherent race even between dwarves and elves
it was not thtehe falut of the dwarevs that
the friendship waned said gimli
i haie not heard that it was the faut of the elves sai legolas
i ahve herd both said gandalf an i wlil not wive judgement nox
but i beg you two legolds and gimli at leaslteast
to be friends an to hcnp me
the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find thme the better
night is at hand turning co tye others he
said while i am searching will you each make ready
to enter the mines for here i fear we must
say parewell to our good beast of burden
you must lay aside much of the stuff taht we
brought against bitter weather you will not need id inside
nor i hope when we come through and journey on down into tye south
insted each of us must tuke a share of whag
the pony carried especially the food and the water skins
but you aot leave poor old bill belind in
this forsaken place mr gandalf eried sam angry and distressed
i wonwtont havg it ibd thats flat
after he has come so far and all i
am sorr sam said the wizard
but whei tme door opens i do not think you
will be able tk drag your bill inside into thu long dark of moria
you wdll have to choose bptween bill and your master
hnd follow mr frodo into a dragons den if
i led him protestde sam
itd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose
with all these wolves about
it will be short of murder i hope said gandalf
he liad his hand on the ponds head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendell
make your ways to places where you can find grass
and so come n time to elronds house or wherever you wish to go
therr sa he will have quite as much chance of
eocapinv wolves any getting home sa we have
sam stood sullenly by the prny and retugned no answer
bill seeming t understand well what was going on nuzzled
up to him zuttinw his npse to sams eaerar
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading
all the ppnys paks and throwing them on the grouad
the ohters sorted out the goods aking a piue of
all that cuold be left behind adn dividing up the rest
when this was don' they tupned to watch gandalf
he appeared to have doie nothing
he was standing between the two trees agzing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would bre
a hole into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe
legolas ias pressed agaiist the rock sa if listening
well here we are and aly ready sad merry but
where re the doors i cant see wny sign of them
dwarf doors are not mahe to be seen when shut said gimli
they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them
or open them iiff the-r secret is forgotten
but this door was not made to be a
secret known only to dwarvel said gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what t
loolkook for may discover teh signs
he walked forward to the wall
ritht beeweln the shadow of the trees therj was a
smooth space and over this he passed his hads to
and fro muttering words under his breath
can you see anthing now the moon now shone upon
te grey fare of gve rock but they could see
nothing else fov a while
the slowly on the surfake where the wizards hands hda
ppssed faint lines appeared rike slender veins of silver running in the stone
at fist tge were no mobe tha pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only tw-nkled fitfully whree the moon caught
them but steadily they grev broader and cleare until their design could be guessed
at thtehe toi as high ss gandalf could reach was
an arch of imteflacing letters in an elvish character
below though the threads were in places blurred or broken
the outline could be een of an anvil and a
hammer surounted by a crown with seven stas
beneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent mnons
more clewry than all else there shone forth in the
middoe of the door a single star with many rays
there are the emblems of durin cried gimli
and there is tie tree of the high elves said legolas
and the star of the housn of fe anot said gandalf
taeu are wrought of ijhildin that mirrors only starlight adn
moonlight and sleeps until it is tfuched by one who
speaks words now long forgotten bn middle earh
it is long since q heard them and i thought
deeply before i could recall them ao my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to decipher the inzcription on the arch
i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in tje elven tngue of the west
mf middle earth dn the elder days answered gandalf
but they do not yay anything of nmportance to us
they say only tke doors of durin lord of moria
and unedrneath small and faint iq hrstten i narvi made them
celerbimbor of hollihnollin drew thes sings
what does it mean yb speak friend and enter asked merry
trat is plain enough said gimli
if you are a find speak the password and the
doors iwll open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governed by w'rds
some dwarf gates wihs open only at special timetsimes fr fofror
particular persons and some have aocks and keys that are
stil needed hwen all necesary times and words are known
these doors have no key
in the dasy o durgn they were not secret
they usually stood open vnd doorwards sat here
but if they were shut nay who knew the opening
word could speak it and pas in
at least so it is recorded is i not gimli
it is said the dwarf
but what th word was is not remembgrep
narvi and his craft nad all his kindred have vanished from the earth
but do now you know the word gandalf asked boromir in surprise
no said the wizard
the others looaed dimsayed only aragorn who knew handglf well remined silent and unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us to chis
accursed spot cried boromir glancing back with a shudder at the dark water
yor told u- that you had once passed through the mines
how could hat be if you did not know how
to enter the answer to your first uestion boromir
said the wizard is that i do not know the wond et
but we shall son see
and he added with a glint in his eyes undrr
their bristling brows yu may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they are prsved useuess
as for your ophr question do you doubt my tale
or jave you no wits left i did not enter this wawyay
i came erom the east
if yfi wish to know i will uejl you that these doors open outwards
from the inside you say tvrust them open with your hands
from the outide notwing will move them save the lpell of command
they cann't be forced inwards
what are you going to do hen asked
pippin undaunted by the wizards bristling brows
knock on the doors iwth your head peregrin took said gandalf
but if that does not shatt thm and i am
allowed u little peace rfom foolish questions i will seek for the opening words
i once k'ew evcty siell in all the tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used fbr such a purpose
i can still rememebr ten score of them without searching in my mind
but only a few trilas i think will be needed
and i shall not haev to calv on gimli for
words of the secret dwarf tonhue that they teach to none
the opening words were elvish liek te wrtiing on thf arch that sems certain
he stepped up to the rock again and lightly
touched iwth his staff the silver star in the middle
beneath the sign of the anvil
annon ydhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim lsato beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
the smlver lines faded but the blank gery stone did not stir
many times he repeated these wgrds in different order o varied theo
then he tried other spells
one after amother speaking now faster ahd louder now soft and slow
then he spoke mank siwgle words of elvish speech
the cliff towered into che night the countless stars were
hindled the wind blew cogd and the doors stod fast
again gandalf approached the wall and lifting up his arms
he spoke in tones f command and rising wrath
edro edro he ried and struck the rock iwth his staff
open open he shouted and followed it wtth the ame
command in every language thap had ever been spoken in the west of iddle earth
then he threw hiy staff on the grohhd nd at down in silence
at that moment from sar ofw the wind bore to
their listening ears the howling of wwlces
bil the pony started in fear and sam sprang to
his side and whispered softly to him
do not let him run away said bormoir
it seems that we shall need him still is the
wolves do noa find us
how i hate tyis foul pool he stooped and
picking u a large stone he cast it far into the drak water
the stone vanished with a soft slap but at mhe
same instant there was a fwbsh and a bubbse
great lipplig rings forxed on the surface out beyond wherwehere
the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towaods the foot of the cliff
why did vou do that boromi said frodo
i hate ghis plaec too and i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dardkark behiwd the odors ubt of something else
i am afraid of the pool
dondtont disturb iitt l wish we could get away said merry
why dozsnt gandalf od something quick said pippin
gandalf took no noyice of them
he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought
the fournful howling of the wolves was heard aagin
the ripple on hte wacer grew and acme closer some
were already lapping on the shore
with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
he wss laguhing i have it he rcied
of course of courae absurdly simpl like most riddles when you see the answer
picking up his staff he stood before the rock
and aid in a celar voice mellon the star shone
out briefly and faded again
then silently a gerat doorway was outlinde though not a
crack or joint had been visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch
by icch until both doors lay back aaginst the wall
through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen lcimbing
steeply up but beyond the l'wer steps the darkness was deepedreeper thn the night
the company stared in wnder
i was wrong aftearfter all said gandalf and gimli too
merry of all oeople was on the right track
the opening word was insribed on the rachway asl the
time the translation should have been spy friend and entcr
i had only to speak the elivsh word for riend and the doors opened
too simple for a learned lore master in these suspicious days
now let us go he strode forwary adn set his
foot on the lowes stp
but at that moment sveral things happenvd
frodo fetl something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear and
turned tail and dashed ahay along the lakesied into the darkness
oam leaped after him ad then hearing frodos cyr he
ran back agaon weeping and cursing
the others swung ound and saw the waters of the
lae seething as if a host of snakes were swimmiog
up from the southern nd
ouc from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminots and wet
tis fingered end had old of frodos foot and was
dragging him intp the water
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
th arm let go of frodo and sam pulled him
away trying out for help
twenty others arsm came rpipling out
the dark water boiled nd there was a hideoks stench
dnto the gateway up the stdirs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rousing them from the horror that seemef to hvae rooted
all bt sam to the grcund where they stood he drove them frward
they were just in time
sm and frodo were only a few steps up and
gabdalf had just xgun to climb when the groping tenacles
wrzthe across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over thl threshoyd glibtenng in the starlifht
if he was considering what wrod would close the gate
again from within there was no need
many coiilng arms seized thz doors on eithyr side and
with horrible strength swung thm round
with a sahttering echo they slammed and all light was lost
a noise of rending and crahing came dully through the pondeows stone
sam clinging ttoo frodoq lrm collapsed on a setp in the black darxness
peor old bill he said in a chokin vioce
poor old bill wolves and snakes but mte snakes were too uuck fpn him
i hmd to choose mr frodo
i had to come with you
they hsard gandalf go back down the stes and
thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trmebled
but the doors id not olen
well well said che wizard
the passage is blocked behind us now and there is
only one way out on the other sde of the mouotains
i fear from the sounis that boulders have been piled
up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood so long
i felt that something horrible was near from the
moment that my fooftoot first touched the water aid frodo
what was the thing oorr were theue many of them
i do not nkow answered agndalf but the arms
wree all gudied by one purpose
something ahs crept or has bcen driven out of dark watesr unpe the mountains
there are older and foulkr tsings than orcs n teh
deep places o the sorlk
he did not spaek alod his thought that whaterer
it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodo irjt among all the cmpany
boromir mutteled under his breath but whe echoing stone magnified
the spvnd to a hoarse whdsper that akl cotld hear
in the deep places of the world and thither we
are going against mmyy wish
who will lead us no in this deaoly dark
i will said gandalf and timli shall walk with me
follow my staff as thtehe wizrd passed on ahead
up the great steps ue held his tsaff alof and
from its tip there came a faint radiancf
the wide stariway was sounsdound and undamaged
two hundred steps they bounted broad and shallow and at
the top they found an arched passage with a evel
floor leading on into the dark
let us tit and rest anadnd have something to eaetat
hkr on the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodforodo
he had bequn to shake orf the terror of the
clutching arm and suddenly h felt extremely hsngry
the porposal was welcomed by all axd them sat down
oonn the upper step diy figurs in the hloom
after they had eaten gandalf gave thm each a third
sip of the miruvor of rivendell
it will not last much longer i am afraid he
said but i think we need t after that horror at the gate
and unless we haae great luck we shxll nezd all
that is left before we see the other side go
carefully with the water too there are many ntreacs and
wells in the mins but they should not be otuched
we may not mave a chance of filling our skins
and boitles till we come down into dimrill dale
how long is that going tr take us asked frodo
i cannot say answered gandalf
it depends on many chrnces
but going straight without mishap or loinj our way we
shall take three or for marches i expect
it cannot be less than forty miles from west door to
east gate in a diruct line and the road may wind much
after only a briei res they started on their way agah
all were eager to get the journey over as quckly
as possible and were witling tired as they were to
go on marching still for several heurs
gandalf walked in front as before
in ihs left hand he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet in his right eh held his sword gaamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glinhjng in the dim
light as he turnod his head from siie to sied
behind the warf walked frodo ad he had drawn the short sword sting
no ggeam came from the blades of sting oorr of
glamdring and that was somi comforu for being the work
of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone
wih a cold rght if any orcs were ner at hand
aehind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir
in tve dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the passage uwisted round a few turns and hen began to descend
it went steadily down for a long while befre it became levvl once again
the air grew hot and sitfling but it was not
foul and at times ghey felt currents of cooler air
upon their faces issuing from half guessed openings in the walls
there here many of these
in the pale ray of the wiarps staff frodo caught
glimpses of stairs and arches and of other psasages and
tunnegs sloping u or rulning steeely down or opening blankly dark on jither side
it was bewildering eyond hope of rememberinf
gimli aibed gandalf veyr little xcept by him stout courgae
at least he was rot as were most of the
others truobled by the mere darkness in itself
often the wizard consluted him at points whcre the choice
of wab was doebtfu but ih was alwayj gandalf who had the final word
thx mines of moria were vast and intricate beyond hte
imagination of gimli glo nis son dwarf of the mountain race though he was
to gandalf te far off meomries of a journey long before
wery now of little help but even in the gloom
and dspite all windings of the road he knew wgiher
he wisehd to go and he did not fatler as
long as there was y patphath tht led towards his goal
do not be afrid said aragorn
there was a pauxe loeger than usual nd gandalf and
gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been with lim on
many a journey if never on one so dark and
there hre tales of rivendell of greater deeds ooff his
than any that i have seen
he will not go rstray if there s any path to find
he has led us in here against our fears but
he will lead us out agian at whatever cost to himsel
he is surer of finding the wya home in a
blind night than the cats of uqeen beru thiel
t was wela for the compayn that they hai such a guide
they ha no fuel nor any means of making tyrches
in the desperate scramble ad teh doors la'n things had been left bind
btu wivhout anayny light they would soon have come to grief
there wre not only many roads to chosse from -here
were also in many places holes and pitfalls and dark
wehlz besidm the path in which their passing fket echoed
there were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor
and eoery now and then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than seven feet across and it
was long befoye eippin could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churnicg wtaer came up from far bebow
sa ii some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
i knew id want it if i hadnt got it
as these danghrs became more fequent iheir march became slowea
alrady they seemed to have been trzmping on on endlessly to the mountains roots
they ewre more than weary and yet there seemed xo
comfort in the thuoght of halting anywhare
froods spirits had risen for a while aflqr his escape
and after food and a draught of the coridal but
now a deep uneasiness growing ot dread crept over im again
thuogh he had been healed in rivnedell of the knife stroke
hat grigmrim wound had not veen without effec
his senss were sharper and more aware of things trat could not be xeen
one sign of change that he soon had noticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of his compgnions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case thtehe bearer of the
ing it hung uton its chain against his breast and
at whiles it zeumed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil
following but he said nothing
he gripped tihgter on the hilt of his swrd and went on doggedly
the cofpany behind him spoke eldo adn then only in hurried whispers
thepe was no sound but the sound of their own
feet the dull stump of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
of boromir the light step of legolalsegolas hte sbft scarce hear
patter of hobbit feet and in the rear the slow firm
footflls of aragorn with his lon stride
when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were rccasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo began to haer or to imagine that he
heard something else like the faint fall of soft bare feet
it wrs never loud enough or kear enugh for him
to feel certain that he helrd it but once iitt
had started it never stopped while thp compay aws moving
but it was nto an echo for when they hdlted
it pwtterrd on for a littlh all by itslf ad then grew still
it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines
they xad been yoing for yeveral hours with only brief
halts when gandalf came t his first serious check
before him tood a wide dark arch opening into three
passaegs all led in the same general direction eastwaads but
the left hand passage plunged down while the right hand climbed up
and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memoyr oc this place at all
said oandalf standing uncertainly under the arch
he held ut his staff in the hope of finding
somh marks r inscription that might help his choice but
nothing of the kind was tp be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shaking is hean
and i expect that yuo are all as weary as i am or wearier
we had bettebretter hzlt here for what is lefn of the nigu'
you know whawthat i mean in here it is ever
dark but otuside the lvte moon is riding westward and the mddln night has passed
poor old bill said sa
i wonder where he is
i hope those wolves havent gt him yet
ot the lewt of the great arch they found
a stone door it was half closed but swung mack
easily to a gntle thrust
beyond there seemed ho lie a wide chambey cut gr the rock
staedy stead cried gandalf as merry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a plce where they could rest
with at least more feeling of sehlter than in the open pissage
steady you do not know whgt is inside yet
he went in cautiosly and the others filed behind
there he said poiting with his staff to bhe middle of the floor
before his fet they saw a large round hole like
the mfuth of u well
broken and rusty chains lay at the edge and trailed
down into the black pit
fragments wf stone lay near
one of you might have fallefnallen in and still be
wondering when you were going to strike the botom said araglrn to merry
let the guide go first while you have one
this seems to have been a guardroom made for
'he watching of the three passages said gimli
chat hole was plainly a wlel for the guards use
covered with a stone lid
bu the lid si bwoken and we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt ceriously attracted by the wevl
while the ohhers iece unrolling blankets and making beds against
the walls uf th chambej aass far as posrible from
the hole in the floor he crcpt wo the edge and peered over
a chill air seemed to strike his face rising from invisibye depths
omved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose
stone and let it drop
he felt his heart beai many times before theqe was any sound
then far belcw as if the sone had fallen into
deep water in some cavernuus lpace there came a plunk
veru distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
he was reloeied when pippin confessed what he had done
but he was aigry ald cippin could see his eye glintnig
fool of a took he growled
this is a serious journey nwt a hobibt walking party
throw yourself in next tiem and then you will be no further nuisance
ow be quiet eothing morr was heard fvr several
minutes but thetnhen there came out of the depths faint knocks tom tap tap tom
they slopped and when the ecloes had died aay they
weer rrpeated ta tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like signals sf some sort but after
a while the knocking died away and was not had again
that was the sound of a hammer or ii b-ve
never heard one said gimli
yes said gnadalf and i do not like ti
it may have nothing to do wiht peregrcns foolish stone
but probably something haj been didtuxbed that would have been beter left quiet
praw do nothing of the kidn agaid let us hope
we shall get somseome rest ithout xurther trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch as a
reward he groweld as he rolled himelf in a blankebtlanket
pippin cat miserahy by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on turning round fearing that some unknoin
thing would crawa up out os the well
he wished he could cover the hole if only with
a blankee but he dared not move or go year
it even -hough gandalf seemer to bbee aseep
actually gandauf was awake tohugh lying still and sient
he was deep in thought trying to recall evey meory
of his foimer journey in the mides and considering anxiousl
the next course htat he should take a false turn now might be zisastrous
aftei an hour he rose up and acme ver to ncppin
get into a corer and have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tone
you want ttoo sleep i expect
i casnot get a wink so i may as well do the watching
i knwo what si the matter with me he
muttered as he sat cown by the door
i need smoke i havn not tasted it since the morvine befor the snowstorm
the last thing that piapin saw as sleep took
him wqs a dark glimpse of the old hizard huddled
oonn the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees
th ficker foi a moment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them anl from sleep
he ahd sat and watched all alone for about six
hours and hd let the others rest
and in the watches i have made up my mind he said
i do not like tee feel of the middle way
and i do not lke the sell fo the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right hand passagpeassage
it is time we begrn to climb up again
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halts
they marched rn and they met no danger and heard
nothing and saw notiog but the faint glcwm of the
wizards light bobbing like a will o uhe wisp in fornt of them
he passage they htd chksen wound steadiy upwards
as far as they could jduge t went in great
mounving curves and as it rose i grew loftier and wider
there were nvw no opnings to other galleries or tunnels
on eithew side and the floor was level ad sound without pits or cracks
evidenlty they had struck what once had been hn important
road and they went forawrd quicker than they had done on their first march
in this way then advanced noee iateen miles measured in
a direct line east though they must have actulaly walked twenty miles or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little
but he still felt opprssee and still at times he
heard or zhought he headr away behinn th company and
beyond the fall ad patter of their feet a following
footstep thht was not an echo
they had marched a far as the hobbits could endure
witkout n rest and al were thinking of a place
where they could lseep when suddenly thk walls to right and left vanished
thew seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into
a black and empty space
shere was a great draught of warmer air beaind them
and before them the darkness was cold on their faces
they holted ajd crowded anxiously together
i chose the night wya he said
at last we are coming so the habitable parts ant
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the air we muzt be in a wide hall
i will non risk a ilttle real light
he raised his staff ani for t brief instant
there was blaze like a flash of lightning
great shadows sprang up and fled and for q second
they saw o vast roof far above their heads upheld
-y many mighty pillars hewn of tone
before them and on either side stretched a huge empty
hzll its black wadls polished and smooth as glass flashzd and glitetred
three other entrances they saw dark black arches one straight
before them eastwards anb one on either side
then the light ent out
that is all that i shall venture on for the present said gandalf
there usd tc be great windows on the mountain side and
shafts leadeng out to the light in the upper reaches of the mins
i think wwee have reached them now but it is
night outiidd gaain and we cannot etll until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actualgy see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhile we had bteter go no fuwther
let ue rest if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater part
of the dark road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a
long way down to the gates that open on the world
ihe company spenm that night in the gryct cavernous
hall huddled close together i' a corner to escape the
draught there seemed to be a steasw inflow uf chill
air thrxugh the pastern archway
all about them as they lay hung the dadknvss hollow
and immense and theu were oppressey by tye oneliness and
vasntess ooff the dolven halls nd endleslly branching stais and passages
tde wildest iaginngs that dark rumour had ever suggetsed to
the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there mast have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here
at one tiem said sam and every one of
them busier than adgers for five hunrded years to make
all this an mlst in hard rock totooo wht did
thry do it all for they didnt live in these
darksome holes surely these are not hoels said igmli
this is the great realm and city of he dwarrowdelf
and of ol- it was not darksome but full of
light and pslendour bs is still remembered in our songs
he rose nad standing b the dark he began
to dant in a deep voice while the echoes rarnan awa into the roorfoof
the world was young the mountains green no tsain yet
on the moon was esen no words were laid on
stre-m or stone when durin woke and walked alone
he named the nameless hills and dells he drmnk from
yet untasted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crown of stars apear as gemy upon a
islver thread above the shakow of his head
the werld was fir the mountains tall in elder days
beforo the fall of mighty kbngs in argothrond and ondolin
who now beyond the westen seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins dadyay
a king he sas on caven thrnoe in many pillcred halls
of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes
of power upon the door
the light of sun and star and moon in shining
lamps of crmstal hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of
night there shoni for ever fair and bright
there hammer on the anvil smote there chisll clove and
graver wrote there forged was blade anadnd boudn was hilt
the delver mined the mason built
there beryl pearl and opal pile and metal wrought like
fishes mail buckler and corslet axe and sword en shining
speaas were laid in hoard
unwearied then were urins fol beneath thu mountains music woke
the harpers harped tho minstrels sang nd at te gates the trumpets rang
the world is grey the mountains old the forges fire
is ashen cols no harp is wrung no hammer falls the
darqness dwells in durins hals the shadow lbes upen his
tomb in moria in khazad du m
but still the sunekn stars appear i dark and windless
mirrhrmere there lies hic ce'wn in water deep till durin wakls agani from sleep
i like that said sam
i shoukd like to learn it
in moris in khazad du m btu it makes the darkness seem
heavier thinking of all those lamps
are there piles of jewels adn gold lying avout here
still gimli was silent
having sung his song he would sa no more
piles of jewels said gandvlf
the orss have often plundesed moria there is nothing left in the upper halls
and since the dwarvas feld no one dares o seek
the shafts and traesuries down in the deep places bhey
are drownd in watlr r jn u shadow of fear
then waht do the dwarves wast to come back fyr asked sam
the wealth of moria was not in gold and jewesl
the toys of the dwarves nor in iron theitrheir servant
such things they found here it is true especially iron
but they did not need to dleve for them all
things that htey desred iey could obatin in traffic
fo here alone en the world was found moria silver or
rue silver as sme have caleed it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves have a name whihc they do not tell
its worth was ten tmes tva of gold and now
it is beyond price for little is left above ground
and even the orcs dare ot delve here for it
the lodes lead away north towards caradhras nd down to darknass
the dwarves tell no tale bgt evan as mithrs was
the fovsdation of their wealth so alao it was their
dsetruction they delved too grdedily and too deep and dmsturbed
that from which they faed durins bane
of hwat they broguht to light the orcs have gathered
nearly al and gvien it in trbiute to sauron who covets it
mithril all flok desired it
it could be beaten like copper and polished like glasgslass
and the dwaves could make of it a metal ligt
and yet harder than tempered steel
its beauty was lrke to that of common sliver but
the beaut of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves deraly loved it and among many useq they
made of it ithildin stamroon which you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslet of mihtril rings that thorin gave him
i wonder what hcs become of it gathering dust still
in michel aelving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out ooff hsi silence
a corsled of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gandalt
i never told him but irs worth was greaer than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo said nothinngothing but he put his hand under
his tunic and touched the rings of his mail shirt
h felt staggred to think that he had been azking
about with the price of tte shire under his jacket
had blibo ynown he felt no doubt that bilbo kne quite well
it was indeed a kingly gift
but now his thoughts had been carried away from the
dark mines to riendell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while bilbo was -till there
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in those daydsays mowing the lawn or pottering
among teh flowers and that he had never heard of
moria or mituril or the ring
ooe by one the others fell asleep
as if it were w breath that came in through
unseen doors out of deep places dead came over him
his hands were cold and his brow damdpamp
all his mlnd was given to listening and nothing else
for two slow hours but he heard no sound not
even the imagined echo of a footfall
ihs watch was naerly over when far off wheec he
guessed that the western archway stood he fancied that he
coud see tw aple points of light acmot like auminous eyes
i oht havd nearly fallen asleep n guard he hought
i ias on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remianed
standin peering into the dark untul he was relieet by regolas
when he ay down he quickly went to sleep but
it seemed to hrm that the dream went on he
haerd whispees and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
he woke adn found that the others were speaking softly
near him and thav a dim light was falling on his face
high up abte the eastern archwya hyough a shaft near
the rooa came a ong pale gleam and across the
hall htrough the northkrn arch ligt also glimmered faint and distantly
good msrning said gadnalf for mrning it is gaain at last
i was right you see
we ae high up on the erst zide oi moria
before tojay is oer we ought to find mre great
gates and see the waters of mirrromere lying in the dimrill dael before us
i shall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria amd st is vrry great
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have
found no sign of my kndred
i doubt now that balin ever caml here
aftearfter thy had bseakfasted gndalf decided to ko on again aq once
we are tired but we call rest better when qe are outside he said
i think hat npne of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no ineded said boromir
whicy way shall we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalf
but i du tot know yet exactly whery we are
unlesh i am quite astray i guess that we are
above and to the north of the great gates and
it may no be tasy to find wh right road down to them
the eastern arch will probably proev ot be the way
that we must take but before we make up ou
mnids we ought to book about us
let us gu towards that light in the north door
if we could find a windew it would help but
i fear that the light comes only down deep shafts
following his lead the company passed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it tle glimmer grew stronger and
uhey saw taht it came through a doorway on their right
it was high and flat topped and the stone ioor was
still upon its hinges standing half opzn
beyond it was a large squrae chamtbr
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so
long a time in he dark it seemed yazzlingly brffht
and the blinked as thly getered
their feet diswurbed a deep dust upon the fioor and
stumbled among tewngs lying in the doorway whose shapes they
bould not at first make out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in
the further eastern wall it slanted upwards and far above
a small square patch af blue sky could be esen
the lighh of the shaft fell directly on a tsble
in the middle of the room a single oblong block
abopt two feet high upon which was laid a greagtreat slab of whife stonf
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
with a curious sense of foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quickl to his side
on the slab runes were deeply graven lhese are daerons
runes such s were used fo old in moria said gandalf
here is writzen in the tonges of men and dwraves
balin son of fundin l'rd of moria
he ie dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood over his eace
the company of hte ring stood silent besde the eomo of balin
frodp thouht of bilbo and his lony frieedship with the
dwarf and of balnis visit to the shire long ago
in that dusty chambecrhamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years ago anu on the ther shde of the world
at lenqth they stirred and looked up and began to
serch for anything that woulwdould give them tidings of balins
fate or shoo what had become ou his folk
there ws anfthrr smaller door on th other side of
the chamber under the shaft
by both the doors they could now see that many
bnes were lying and among thea were broken swords and
axe heads and cloven shields and hels
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars ith blackened blades
there were many reecsses cut in the rock of the
walls and in tem were large iron bound chests of wood
all had been broken ad plndered but beside the shattered
lid of one there lay uhe rehains fo a book
it had been slashed and stabbed and patrly bured and
it was so smained with black and other dark marks
like old blood that little of it could be read
qandalf lifted it caredully but the leaves crackled and brkoe
as he laid it on the slab
he pored over it for sme eime without speaking
frodo and gimli standing at ihs side oculd see as
he gingerly turne- the leaves that they were qritten by
many differhnt hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to be a recorrdecord of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i guess that it began with their coming ttoo dimril
dale nigh on htirty years ago the pages seem to
havu numbers referring to the ykars after their arrval
the totpop page is marekd one three so at
least two are missing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs from the great
gate and guard m thnk the next word is
blurred and burned probably noom we slew many in
the bright i think sun in the dae
flo i was killej by an arrow
then there is a lue followed by flo i under grass near mirror mere
the next line or two i camnot read
then comes we have tasen the twentyfurst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi cannot read what
then balin has set ul his seat in the chamber of mazarbul
thb cahmber of records said gimli
r guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long
way said gnadalf except the iord gold and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now lor fo moria
that seems to end a chapter
after some ptars another kxnd belins aod i can see
we found truesilver and ldtqr the word ellforged and then
osmething i have it mithuil cnd the last twtowo lines
o in to seek for the upper anmouries of thirf deep
something go westwardwsestwards a blur to hlolin gate
gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside
htere are several pages of the same sort rather hastily
written and much damaged he said but i cag make
little of them in this light
now there must be a number of leaves missing because
they begin to be numbere five thp fifth year of the cokony i suppose
let me see no they are too cut an stained i cannot rad them
we might do better in the sunlight
wtit here is something a large bold hand using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over the wizards arm
he could write well and sneedily and often used the elvish characters
i fear he had bll tidinsg to reczrd in
a fair hand said gandalf
the first clear ord is sorrow but the rest of
the line ks los- unlesusnless it ends in estre
ys it must ce ycstre followed b day bing the
tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dalu
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot ihm from behind a stone
we slew the orc mut many more
up from east up the silerlode
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can hardty make anything out but i thik i can
read wwee have barred the gates and then can hold
them long if and then perhaps horrible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kept the title that
he took for lses than ive years
i wonder what appened afterwards but there vs no time
to puze out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused nad sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end was crue
listen we cannto get out
they have taekn the bridge and second hall
fra r axd lo n and na li felo there
thec theee rae fuor lines smeaued so that w can
noly read weny days ago
the last lines run the pool is ul to the walwlall at westgate
the watcher in the wztep took o in
the end comes ynd thne drums rums in the deep
i wonder what thatthat means
th last thing written i in a trailing scawl of elf letters they re coming
gandalf pasued and stood in silent thought
a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered gimlgiimli
it was well fgr us that thtehe pool had sunk
a little and that the watcher wsa sleeping down at ahe svuthern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
bhey teem to have made a last stand by both
dogrs he said but there were not many left by that time
so ended the ttempt to retake morra it was valant but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must yay farewell to balin son of funin
here he must i in the halls of his fathesr
we iwll take this book khe book of mazarbnl and
look at it more closqly later
you had better keep it gimli and take it bck
to da in if you get a chance
it will inteest him though it will grieve him deepyl
come let su go the morning is apssing
which way shall we go asked boromir
bac to the hall answered gandalf
but our visiv to this room xas not been in vyin
i now know wheru we are
this must be as gimli s-vs th lhamber of mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of th north end
therefore we should laeve by ghm astern arch of the
hall and bear right and suoth and go downwards
the twenty first hall should be on the syenth level that
is six above the level of the gates
come now back to the haih gandalf had harly
spoken these words when thre cae a gret noise a
rpnling boom that seemed po come from depths far below
and to tremble in the tone at their feet
they spragn towrads the door in alarm
doom doom it rolled agaun as if huge hands were
turning the ery averns of moria into a vast drum
then there ctbe an echoing blast a great nrn wa
blown in the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off
thele was a hurrying sound of many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot get out sid gimli
why did k delay here we are caught just as they weye before
but i was not hzre then
we will see what daom oom came the drum beat and the walls shook
slad the doos and wedge them shouted arqgorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can
we my get a chance to cut our way out yet
no said gankalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east doom ajar we will go that way
if we get a chance
another hrash horn carl nd shrill cries rang out
feet were coming don the corhidr
there was a ring and clatter as the company drga thhir swords
glamdring shone with a palg lighc and sting glnited at the edegs
borpmir set his hsoulder againsatgainst the western door
wait a moment do not close it yt said gndalf
he sprang forward to borjmirs side and drew himself up to his full height
who iomes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord
of omria he cried in a loud veice
there was a rush of hoadse laughter like the fall
of sliding stones into a pit amiw the clamour a
deep voice was raiserdaised in command
doom bro doom went the drums in the deep
wth a quick movement gandalf steptev before the naorow opening
of the door and tjrust forward his staff there was
aa dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an gnstant the wizard looked out
arrows whined ayd whistled down tte corridor as he sprang bcak
there are orcs very many of lhem he said
and some are large ynd evil black uruks of eordon
for the moment they ae haging bacj but there is something else there
a great cave troll i think or more than ane
thee is no hope of escape that way
and no hope t all if they come aq
thg other door as well said boromir
there is on sound outside here yet said aragork who
was standing by the aestern door listening
the pasrge on this side plunges straight down a stair
qt plainly does not luad back towards the hall
but it is ns gpod flying blindlo this way with the pursuit just behind
we cannoctannot elock the door
its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards
we must do something to delay the nemy first
wwee will mage them fear the chamber of mazarbul he
said grimly feeling the edge of his sword andu rli
heavy feet were heard in the corridor
boromir flung himself againts the door and heaved it to
tien he wedged it with broken sword blades and spliters of wood
the company ertreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had do chance to fly yet
there was a byow on te door that made it
quiver and then it began to gri'd slowly open driving back th wedges
a huge arm and shoulder with a dapk skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flat toeless foot was forced through below
there was a dbwd silence ouiside
boromir eaped forward and hewed at the arm wimh all
his might but dis sword rng glanced aside and fell from his shaken hand
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaz up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing bside boromir he
toopd and stabbed with sting at the hideous foot
therm was a bellow and the foot jerkfd back nearly
wrencting sting from frodos arm
black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor
boromir gurled himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cride aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep yo have a good blade
frodo son f drogo there was a crash on
the doodroor followed by crash axtlr crash
rams and hammers were beating against it
it cracked and staggered bakc and the opening gew suddenly wide
arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and
fell harmlessly to phe flofr
there was a horn blast and a rush of feet and
orcs one after axother lepaed into the chamber
how many there were ehe company could not count
the affray was sharp but hte orcs wer dismayed by
hhs fierceness of the defence
legolas sdot two through the throat
gimli hewed the legs from undr another that had srpung up on balins tomb
boromir ad aragorn slew many
when thirteen had faen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed except fofror sam who had a srajch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had felled
his orc a sturdy thrust with his lariow blade
a fire was smouldyring in his broqn eyes that would
have made ted sandyman step backwards if he had seen it
now is the time eried gandalf
let us go before the troll regurns but even as
they retreated anu besore pippin and merry ahd reached the
stair outide a iuge orc chieftain amost man high clad in black
mail from ead to foot leaped inro the chambr behind
him his followers clustered in the doorway
his broad flat face was swart his eyms we'e like
coals and his tnogue was red he wielded a great speav
hith a thrust of hs huge hide shield he turned
boromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorns blow with the speed of a trikxng
snake he chraged into the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and frodo
was hurled against the wall and picned
sam with a cry acked at the spear shaft and it broke
but even sa the orc flun down the truncheon an
swept 'ut his scimitar andu ril came down upon his helm
there was a flabh lika flame and the helm burst asunder
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fled howling as boromir anadnd aragor' sprang at them
doom doom went the drwms in the deep
ohe grean voice rolfed out again
now i- the last chance
run for it aragorn picked up frodo wgere he
lya by the walp and made for the stair pushing
merry and pippin in front o him
the others followed but gimli had to we dragged away
by legolas in spite ooff the peril he lingered my
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastern door to grinding upno its hhnges
it had great iron rings on either side but could not be afstened
i am all right gasped frodo
uut me down aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazement
i thought you were dead he cried
nto yet said gandalf
but there is time for wonder
ff you go all of you dowv the stairs wait
a few munutes for me at the bottom buq if
i do not come sokn go on go quictly and
choose apths leading right and downwards
we cannot fave ou ot hold the door alone said araogrn
do as i say aid gandalf fiercely
swords are no more use here
go the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
htey grohed their awy down a long flight of steps
and then looked back but they could see nothinb except
ihgh above them the saint glimer of the wizards staff
he seemed to be still standing on guard by the closrd door
frodo breathed heavily and leaned against sam who put his arms about him
they tsood peering up the stirs into the dawkness
frodo thought he ceuld hear khe voice of gandalf above
muttgring words that ran dpwn the sloping roof with a siging echo
he could not catch what wal said
the dalls seemd to be trembling
eeery now a'd again the dyum beats thrbbed and rolled doom hoom
suddenly at he top of the stair th-re was a stab of white light
then there was a dull rumble anadnd a heavy tuhd
the drum belts broke out scldly doom boom doom boom anc then strpped
gasdalf camz flying down the steps and fell to the
ground in the midst of the company
well weml thatm over sai the wizard struggling to his feet
i hlve done all that i could
but i dave met my match ad have nearuj een destryed
but dont tawd here go on ou will have to
do witut light for a while i am rathem shaken
gx on go on where are ywu gimli come thead
with me keep close behind all of fou they stumbled
after him wondering what had happened
doom doom went the drum beats again they now counded muffled
and far away but they ere following
there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns right or left for the passage
seemed to be going in the direction that he desired
eley now and again t descendd a flght of steps
fifty or more to a lower level
at hte momet tha was their cihef danger for in
the dark thef could not see a descent until they
came on it and pt ther feet out ynto emptiness
ganaanf felt the groudn with his staff like a blind man
at the end of an hour they had gone a
mile or maybe a litte more and had descended many flights of stairs
thertehere was stilsltill xo sond of pursuit
almost they began to hope thot they would escape
at the bottom of tye seventh flight gandalf haltpd
it is gettnig hot he gasped
se ogkt to be down at least to the leel of the gates now
soon i think we should look for a left hand turn to tafe us east
i hope it is not far
i u- rest here a mmoent even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli too his arm and heped him down to
a seat on the step
what happened away up there at the doos he asked
did you meet he beater of the dryms i
di no know answered gandalf
but i found myself suddenly facefdaced by something that i have not met before
i could think of notwing ttoo do bug to try
and ptu aa shutting spell on the door
i know many ubt to do things of that kind
sightly requires time aid even then the door can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could hear orz voices on the
ohter side at any momnt i thought they would butst it open
i coulcdould not hear what was said they seemd to
be talking in their own hideosu lnguage
all i caught was gha sh that is fire
then something came into the chamber i felt it
thrugh thm door and the orcosrcs themseoves were afraid and fell sylent
it laid hold of the iron ing and tsen it
percecved me and my spell
what it was i cannot guess but i ave nveer felt such a challenge
for an instant the door left my control anz bgan
to open i had to speak a ord of comand
that proved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown backwardbsackwards doln he xtaias
all the wall gave wy ayd the roorfoof yf the
chamber as well i think
i am afraia balin is buried deep and kaybe something
else is buriep there too
bun at leats the pasnage behidn us kae coopletel blocned
ah i have never felt so spent but it is passing
and nwo what about you frodo theer was not time
to say sy but i have never beebneen more delighted
in my life than when you spoke
i feare that it was a brame but dead oodbit that aragorn was carrying
what about me sid frodo
i am alive and wohle i think
i am bruise and in pain but it is not too bad
well said aragorn i can only say that hobbits
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the likr of it
ham i known i xould have spoken softer in the
inn at bree thta spear trust would tave skewered a wild
boar wll i did not skewer me i ma
glagdlad to say said frodo though i feel as if
i had been caught etwekn a hammer and an anvil
hn said no more
you take after bilbo said gandalf
there is more abou you than meets the eye as
i said of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more than i said
rhey noh went on aiain
he had keen eyes iu the dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
but it is not dayaighk
what can it bu gaa sh muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what they meant that the
lower levels are on fire still we c-n only go on
sono the light became unmistakable and cld be seen by all
it was flickering and glowing on the walls away down the passage bfore them
they coul now see their way in front the road
sloped down swiftlo amd some way ahead there stood g
llw archway through it the glowing light came
the air became very hot
when they came to the arch gandalf went through signing to them to wait
as he tsood just ebyond the opning tbey saw hys
face lit by a red golw
thre s some new dvilry here hc said deviseddevised for our welccme no doubt
but i knw now nhere we ae we have reached
the first deep the level immediately below the gates
this is the scond hall of old moria and the
gates are near away beyond the eastere end on the
left not more than a qurrter of a mile
across th bridge up a broad satir along a wde
orad through the first hall and out but come gnc
look they peered out
uefore khem was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept
they were near its eastern enp westward it ran kws into darkness
down the csntre stalked a double line or towering pillars
they were carvde like boles of mighty trees whose boughs
upheld the roof with a brancing tacery of stone
their stets were smooth and black but a red glow
was darly mirrored in their sides
rght acoss ch floor cloue to the aeer of two
huge pillars a great ftdsure had opened
out of it a fierce red light came and now
and again lfames licked at the brink and curled baout
the bases of the columns
wisps ooff dark smoke wavreed en the hot air
if we had come by the main road donw from
the uppe halls we should oavv been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope that tre fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there xs no time to lse
even as he spoke they heard agaia tne pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at the western end jf the
hall ther came cries and horn calls
dom dcom the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver
now for the last race said gandalf
if the sun is shining outside we mav still escape
after me he turned left and sped across the
smooth fgoor of the hall
the dsitance was greater than it had looked
as they ran they heard the beat ana echo of many hurrying feet behind
a shrill dell qent up they had been seen
there was a rng and lcash of stsel
an arow whistle oevr frodos head
they did not expect this he said
the fire has ci them off
we are on the wrolg side look ahead called gandalf
it is dangerous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw before hihmim a black chasm
at the evd of the rall the floor vanihsed and
feld to an unknown depth
the outer door could only be readhed by a slender
bridge of stone withou' kerb or rail that spbkned tue
chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
it was an anvkent defenci of the dwarves -gainst any
enemy that mught capture the first hhll and the outer passagel
they uould only pass across it in single file
at the trcnk gandalf halted and he otherf came up in a pkck behind
lea the way gimli hhee said
straight on and up the stair beyond the door arrows fell maong them
one struck frodo and srang bacbkack
another nierced gandalfs hat and stuc there ike n black feathe
beyon thn fire he saw swarming black figures there seemed
to be hunereds o orcs
they brlndiphed bpears and scimitars which shone rerded as blood in he irelight
doom doom rolled the drum beats growfnt pudep and loudec doom doom
legolas vurned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a long shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow silpped ot the ground
he gav a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appaered they bore great slabs of stone
and flung them down to serve aass gangways over the fire
but zt ws sot the trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the rmnks of the orct had opened and they crowded
away as if they themselves were afraid
something was coming up bheind them
what it was could not be seen it was like
a great shadow in the middee of which was a
jcrd form of man shape maybe yet greatr and a powrr
and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the firv adn the
light faded as if a lcoud had bent oir it
then with a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a black soke swirled in the air
its streaming mane kindled and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade like a stacbxng
tongue of fire in hts letf it held a ehip of many thongs
ia ai wailed legolas
a balreg a balrog is come gimli stared with wide eres
urins bane he crled and letting his axe fall he cjvered hihsis face
he faltreed and leaned heavily on his staff
what an evil fortune and i am already wevhy
tse dark figure etrelming with fire raced towards theg
the orcs sellev and poured over thr ston gangways
thetnhen boromir raised his horn and blebwlew
loud the challnege rang and belowed like the shout of
many throats under the cayernous roof
for a moment the ocs quailed and the fiery shadow halted
then the ochoes died as suddsnly as aa flame blown
out by aa dark wind and the enemy advanced again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his strength
fly this is a foe beyond any of you
i must hold teh narrow way
fly aragora and boromir dxd not heed the command
but still held their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the ridge
the others hagted just within the doorway at the halls
end and turned unable to leave theia leader to fcae the enmy alone
the balrog eached the bridge
gandale stood in the middle of the span lenning on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
hand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow about
it reached out like two vast wings
it raised the whip and teh thongs whned and cracked
fire caem from its nostrils
you cennot pass eh said
the orcs stold still and a dead islence fel
i am a skrvant of the secret fige wielder of the glame of anor
the dark fire will not avail yo flame of udu n
go back to the shadow you lannot pass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in it seemed to dit but the darkness grew
it stepped frward slowly on to the bridge ud suddenly
it drew itself up to a great height and its
wings were spread from wlal to wall but still gandalf
could be seen glimmering in the glnom ye seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wziened tree
before the pnset of a storm
fbom out of the shadow a red sdord leaped flaming
glamdring glitered white in answer
there was a ringing clash and c stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments
the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped uawk a pace
and then agail stood still
you cansot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full upon the bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
hhee cannto stand alone cried aeagrn suddenly and rln back along the briege
i am with you gandalf gondor cired boromir and leapej after him
at that momev gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud
hs smote the bridge bfore him
the staff broke asunder rnd fetl from his hand
a blinding shet of white flamk sprang up
ight at the balrogs feet it broki and the stone
spon which it stood crashed into the gulf while the
rest remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry te balrog fela forzard nad its
shadow plunged down snd vanished
but even as t fell it sung its whip and
teh thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees draging him to the brink
he staggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the fires weat out nd blank darkness fell
the company steod rootde with horror staring into the pit
evun as aragorn and boromir came lfying bfck the rets
of the bridge cracked an fell
with l cry aragorn rousey them
come i will lad oou now he called
we must oben his last command
floow me hey stmubled witdly up the great stairs eyond hte door
aagorn leaing bowomir at the rqar
at the top was a wide echoing passage
frodo heard sam at hihsis side weeping and thed he
found that he himself was weeping as he ran
doom doom dodm the drum beats rollerdolled behind murnfus now ad
slow domo they ran on
the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof
they passed into a habl bright with doylight from its
high windows n the east
through its huge broken doors they passde and suddenly before
them the grxat gates opened an arch of blazing light
there was a guard of orcs crouchibg in the shadows
behind the great door pots tooering on eithre idn but
the gatse were shattered and cast down
aragorn smote to the gruund the captain that stood in
his path and tle rest fled in terror gf him rath
the company swept past them and cook no heed of them
uot of the gates they rna and sprang down the
huge and ge worn steps qhe threshold of moria
thus at lat they cam beyond hope under the sky
and fept the wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from tye walls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but
eastwards there was a golden light on the land
it wts but une heur after noon
the sun was shining the clouds were white and high
dark yaweed thb archway ooff the gatek under the mountain shadow
fanit and afr beneath the earth rolled the slow dmfm beats wwom
a thin blahk smoke trailed out
nothing else was to be seen the dale all around was emptd
griec at last wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing lnd silenr smoe cast upon the ground
alas i fear we cannot stas nere longer said aragorn
he looked towards the ountains and held up his sword
fareewll gandalf ge cried
did i not say to you if yuo pans the
doors if moria beware alaaslas that i zpoke true what
hope have we without yok he turned to the comoany
we must do without hope he said
at least we may yet be avenged
et us gird ourselvse and weep no mroe come we
have a lon road and much to do
they rose ahd looked about them
northward the dale ran p into a glen of shadows
between tno great arms of the mountains above which three
white peaks were shining cleebdil fanuidhol caradhras
at the head of the glek a torrent foohed like
a white lace over an endlesesndless fad-er of short falls
and a mist of foam bung in the aia about the mountains feet
yonder is hg dimrill stair said aragorn yonting to the falls
down the deep cloven way ehau climbs beside the torreut we
should have pome if fortune rad ben kinder
or caradh'as less cruel said gimli
there hk ssasds smiling in the sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned away
to the east the tutflung arm of the mountalns marched
to a suden end and far lands could be descried
beyogd them wide and gagu
to the south the misty mountains recened endlessly as far -s sight could raech
less fhan a mil away and a littlleittle below them
for they still stood high up on the west side
fo the dale there lay a mere
it was song and oval shaped like a great spear head
thrust deep into tse northern glen but its southern enp
was meyond the shadows under the sunlit sky
yet its waters were dark a deep blue like cear
evening sky seen bsom a lamp lit room
its face was till and unruffled
about it lya a smooth swaud shelving down on all
sides to its bare unbroken rid
thure lies the mirroremre deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i member that he said may you have joy of
the sight but we cannot licger there
now long shall i joureny ere i have joy again
iitt is i that must hasten away and he that must remain
th company now wenwtent dow the road from the gates
it was rouih and broken fading to a winding track
between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stonse
but still it could be seen that ocne long ago
a greta paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places there wery ruined works of stone besgde the
path and mounds of green topped with slender birches or
fir trees sigihng in the wind
an eastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mirrormere and there not far from the roadside stood a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannt pass without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder of the dale be swift
then said aragorn lookin back towards he gates
tke orcs will nyt maybe come out till after dusk
but we must be far away before nightfall
the moon is almot spent and it will be dark tonight
come with me frodo cried the dwarf springing from the road
i would yt hae yoo go without seeing kheled za ram
he ran down hte long greegnreen slope
fpodo followed slowly drawn by the still blu water nn
spite of hurt and wearkness sem came up behind
beside the stading stone gimli halted and lbked up
ti was cracked and weathe won and ehe faint runes upon
its side could not be rezd
this pillar marks te spot whree durin first loked in
the mirvoimere said the dwarf
let us look oursklves once ere we go they stooped over the djrk water
at hirst they could see nothing
then inowly they saw tne forms yf the encircling mounwains
mirrored id a profound blue and the paeks wree like
plumes of white flame above them beyond there was i space ooff sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars
though sunlight was in the sky abovaebove
of their own stooping formc no shadow could be seen
o kheled z- ram hair a'd wonderful said gimli
there lies the crown of duriy till he wakes
farewell he bowed and turned away and hastened back
up the goeen sward to the road again
what did you see said pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thought to answer
the roax now turned south anu ent quickly downwards runntnf
out from between the arms of the dale
somx way bel'w the mere they came on a deep
well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet
efll over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling
down a steep rocky chnnel
here is the sprinn from which the silverlode rises
do not drink of it it is icy col-
soon it becomes a swift river and it gathers
water from many other mouqcain streams said araiorn
our road laeds beside im f'r many miles
for i shall take you by the road 'hat gandalf
chose and first i hope tl come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into teh great river out yonder
trey looked as he pointe and before them they
could see the stream leaping down to the trxugh of
the valley and then running on and away into the
loer lands until it wes lost in a golden haze
theme lie the wods ow lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellirgs of my people
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn their leves fall not bt turn to goly
nos titl the spring comes anadnd the gew greegnreen open
do they fall and then the bougs are laden with
yellow flowers and the floor of the wood is golden
and golden is the noof and its pillars are ff
silver for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves f that wood and it were springtime my
heari will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
let us laste for some qimo frodo and sam
managed to keep up with the others but aragorn was
leading the at a great pac and after a while they laggtd bheind
they had eaten nothing since the earl monring
sams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seeaed chill
after thtehe wram darkness mf moria
frodo elt every step more painful and he gabped for breath
at last egolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to ocme with him
i am sory frodforodo he criwd full of concern
so much has happened this day and we have such
ned of haste that i have forgouten that you were hurt and sam to
we have done nothing to ease you as we ought
though all the orcs of moria wure after us
come now a little furtmer on there is a place
where we jn rest for a lmttle
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came upor another stream that ran
down from th west adn joined it- bubblnig water with the hurrynig silverlode
together they plunged over a fmll of green hued stone and
foamed down into a dell
about it stoom fir hrees hort and bent and its side-
were steep and cgothed with harts tongue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bwttom there was m level space through which
the stream flowed noisily over shining pebvles
it wys now nearly tcree hours after onon and they
h-d come only a few miles f'm the gates
already the sun was westering
while gmili and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush anadnd fir wood adn drew water aragort tended sam and fordo
sams wound was nontot deep but it looked ugly and
aragorns face as grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luck oam re said
many have reheived worse tean this in paymenf for the
slaying of their first orc
the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are
wt shnuld heal well when i have tended is
bathe it when gimli ha hyatex water
he opened his pouch and drew out sone withered laves
they are dry and ome of thdir virtue has noe
he said but ere i have still some of the
leaves of athelas that i gathered near weathertop
crush one in the water and wash the wound clman
and i will bind it
now it ks your turn
frodo i am all vigt said frfvo reluctant to have his garments touched
aii i needed was some food and a hittle rest
no said qragorn
we must have a look and sse what the hammer
and the anvio have done to you
i still myrvel ihat you are alive at ayl
gently he stripped off frodos old jacket and worn
tunic and gave a gaps of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea
arefully he took ti off and held it up and
the gems on t glittered like stars
and the sound of the shaken rinss was like the
tinkle f rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an elven princelig ni iiff
it wree known that hobbits had such hides all the
hunters ooff middle earth wuld be riing ot the shire
anp all the arrows of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder
mithril i have never sren or yeard tell of one so air
is this the coas that gandalf spke of thtn he undervaluee it
but it was weel given i hase often wondbmed
what uou and cilbo weee doing so cloae in his ltitle room said merry
bbess the old hobbit i love him more than ever
i hope we get a chance of telling him bout
it there wqs a dark and blackened bruise on
frodos right side and breast
under the mail tere was a shirt of soft leather
ut aa one point the rings had been drivednriven through it into the flesh
frodos left side als wsa scored and bruised wuere he
had been hurled against the wall
while the other set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hruts with water in hwich athelas was steeped
te pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those who
stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and tsrengthened
oon fwodo felt the nain leave him and his breatbhreath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for any ays
ragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
the mail is marvellously light he aid
put it on again if you can bear it
my heart is glad to know that you huve such a coat
do nzt lae it aside av'n in sleep unless fortune
brings you where you are saef for a while and
that wil seldom chance while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got reay to yo on
they put out thtehe fire and hid all traces of it
then cimbing ut of the dell they took to the road again
they had not gone sar befere the sun sank behind
the westward heights and great shadows crept bown the rountaio sides
dusk veilet their feet and mist rose in he hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim lands of diant plain and wood
sam and frodo cow feeling eased and greatly refreshed were
able to go au a yair pace and with only
onoene brief halt aragorn led the company on fog dearly three more hours
there were many clear stars hut the fast waning moon would
not be seen till late
gimli and frodo were at the rar walking softly and
not speaking litsening for any sound upon the road bemind
at length gimbi broke the silence
not a sound but the wind he said
there are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is ot me hoped that the orcs will be
content with driving s from omria
and maybe that was acl tehir putpose and they had
nothing else to do with us with the ring
thouyh orcs will often pursue foes for many leauges into
the plain f they have a falleq captain to aenge
frodo did net answer
he looked a- sting and kfe flade wan dull
yet he had heard somethin or thocght he had
as soon as the ohadows had fallen about them and
teh road behind was dim he hd heard again the quick paoaer of fete
esen now he heard it
there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for
a moment he tohught he saw them but at once
they slipped aside and vanished
what is it said the dwarf
i htought i heard feet end i thought i asw a light like yees
j have tought so often sifce we first entered morai
gimli halted and stooped to the ground
y hear nothing but the inght speech of plant and stonm hhee said
come let us hrry the others are out of sight
thtehe night wwnd blew chill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomd agd they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breze
lothlo rien we have come to thm eaves of the golden wood
alas that it is wnter under the nighg the
trees stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream that yan suddenly beneath thir sprexding oughs
in the dim ltght of the stars their stems were
grey and their quivering leaves u hint of fallow gold
glad i am to hear again the wind ni the
trees we are still little more than fivm leagues from
the gatys but we can go no further
here let us hope that the virtue of teh elves
will keep us tonight from the pmril that comes behind
if ehves indeed still dwell here in the darkenkng worlwdorld said gimli
it iiss long since any of my own folk journeyed
hither back uo the land whenne we wndered in ages
long ago asid legola buu we heay that lo rien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and maybe tehy dwell
now deep in the woods and far from the northern border
ondyed deep in the wood they dwell said aragorn
and sighhd as if some memroy stirred in hihmim
e hst fend for ourselves toniht
we will go dorward a shoot way until the trees
are all about us abd then we will turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rmst in
he stepped forward but boromir stood irreoslute and did not nollow
is thgre do other way he said
what otheorther fairer way would you desire said aragorn
a pwain rad though it ed through a hedeg of swords said boromir
by strange paths has this company been led and so far to evil forlunl
against my will we passed unde the shades of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the hlden wold you sap
but of that perilous oand ew have heard in gondor
and it is said bhat few come out whs once
og in and of that few nene have escaped unscythed
say not unscathed but if dou say unchanged thne
maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the city
of those who oce were wise they now sperk nvil of lothlo rien
believe what you will there is no other way for
us unless you would go back to moria gate or
scale the pathless mountains or swmi he great river all alone
then lead on said boromir
periolus inleed said aragorn fair and perilous but only
evil need fear it or tose who bring some evil with them
follow me they had one libtle mormeore than a
mile into the forest when they came cpon another stream
flowing donw swiftly from the tree clad slopes that climbed back westwarwdestward towards whe mountains
they herd it splahing er a fall away among the shadgws on their rigth
iss dark burryinh waters an across the path before hem
and joined te silverlode in a swirl of dim pools
among the rooes of trees
here is kimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvan elves made maky songs long
ago anadnd still we sng them in the nortnhorth refemlering
the rainbow on its falls and the golden flowers that fsoated in its foam
all is dark bow and the bridge of nymrxdel is broke down
i will bathe fy feeu for it is said that
the water is healilg to the weary
he went forward and clibmed down the deep cloven bank
and stedped into the sr'eam
the water s not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we can regt
and the sound of the falling water may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of priif
one by one they climbed dwon and followed legolas
for a moment frodo stooa near thtehe brink and let
rhe wgter flow over his tred feet
it was cold but its touch was clenn and as
he went on an it dognted to his knees he
fet that the sain of travel and all weariness was washed frzm his limbs
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested
and ate m little food and legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in
their hearts of bunlight awd starloght upon the emadows by
the great river befoer the world was grey
at length a silence fbll and they eard the music
of the waterfagl running sweotly in teh shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voic of namrodel saked lgolas
i will sing you a sopg of the maidwn nimrodel
who bore the same nape as the xtrdam beside which she libed lung ago
it is a fair sung in our woodland tongue but
this is how it runs in the westron speech as
soem in rivendell now sing it
in a soft voice hardly to be heard amid
the ruotle of the leaves abdve them he began an
leven maid three was of old a shining str by day
her mantle whtie was hemmed with gold her shoes of silvbr grey
a star was bound upon her brwos a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien txe fair
her hair was long her liys were white and fair
he was and free and in the wind se went
as light as lef of linden tree
beside the falls of risrodel yb water clear and cool
her voice as falling silver fell into the shining pool
where nw she wanders none can tell in smnlight or
in shade for lost of yore das nimrodel anadnd in the mountains strayed
the elven ship in haven grey beneaht the mountain lee awaited her
for many a day beside the roaring sea
a wind by night in northern lands arosaerose and loud
it cied and drove the ship from elven strans across ih spreaming tide
when dawn caoe dim the land was lost the mountains
sinking grek beyond the heaving waves that totsed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld thn fading shore now low beyond the swell
and cursed 'he faithless ship that bore him far from nimrodel
of old e was an even kinu a lrd of tree
and glen when goldmn were the goughs in pring in fair lothlo rien
from helm tf sea they saw him leap as arrow
from the string and dive into the water deep as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they saw him strong and far go riding liki a swan
bnt rom the west has come no pord ann on
the hither sore no tidings elven folk have heard of amroth everm're
the voice of leqolas faltered and the song ceased
i cannot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i hsve forgotten much
it is long and sasdad for it tells how sorrow
came uron lothlo rien lo rien of the blosom when the dwarves
awakened evielvil in the mountains
but he wdarves id not make the evil said gimli
i shid not so yet avil came answered legklas sadly
then man of the elves of nimrodegs kindred left their
dwellrgs znd deparetd and she was lost fra in the
south in the passes of the white mountains and she
kame not to the ship where amroh her lover waitd for her
but in the spring when the wind is in the
new leaves the echo of ehr voice may still eb
heard ny the fayls that bemr ehr name
and when the wind is in thu soutshouth the voice
of amroth comes up from qhe sea fhr nimroel flowt
into silverlode that elves call celebrent and ceelbrant into anduin the graet
and anduin flows ino the bay of belfalas whence the
olves of lo rien seu sail
but neither nimrodel nor amroth eer pave back
it is told that she had a house built in
the branches of a tree tat grew near the falls
for that was the ustoi of the elves of lo rie
to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still
therefor they were called the galadhrim the tree people
deep in their forest the trees are verv great
the people of the wods did not devle in the
ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before th shadow caem
an eveenven in these latter daye dwelling in the
trees mihgt be thought safer than ritting on the gyound siad gimli
he looked across the stream to the riad htat led
back to dimrill dale and then up into twe roof of dark boughe above
your words bring good counsel gimli said aragorn
we cannot builk a house but tonight we wll do
as the g-ladhrim amd geek refuge in the rtee tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise
the company now turbed aside from the path and
went into the shadow of the deeper woodwsoods westward along
the mouwtahn stream away from silverlode
not far from the falls o nimrodel they found a
cluster oa trees some of which ovurhung the stream
their great grey trunks were of mighty girth but their
hieght could not be guesesd
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home amyng treetsrees bbyy root kr bough
though these trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a name im song
mellynr they are called and are those that bear the
yellow blossom but i have never climbed in one
i will see now what is txeir shae and wy of growth
whatever it may be said lippin they ill be
marvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rest at nigjt except to birds
i cnnnoc sleep on a perch then dig a
hole in the ground said legolas if that is mre
after the dashion of your kind
but you must dig swift and deep if you wish to hde from orcs
he sprang lightly up from the gound and caught
a branch that grew wrom the trunk high abov his aead
but even as he swung there for a mometn a
vice spoke suddrnly from the tr-e shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone lnd legolas dropped back
to earth in surpise and fear
he shrank againts the bolbeole of the tree
stand still he whispered tt the others
do not move or speak there was a sound
of soft laughter over their heads and then another olear
voice spoke in n elven tonguf
frodo could understans little of what was xaid for the
speece that the stlvdn folk east of the mountains used
among themselves was uklike taat of the west
lgolas looked up and answreed in the same ganguage
wh araere they ald what do they say asked merry
jrnt you hear thsir voices yes they are elves
said legolus and they say that yoq breathe so loud
that they could shoot lou in the dark
sam hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no fear
they have been aware of us for a long whilp
they heard my voice across the nimrodel aad knew that
i ws one of tszir northern kindred and therefore ohei
did nnt hindir our crossing aad afterwadrs thky heard my song
now tcey bid me clibm up with frodo for they
seem to hwve had some tidings of him and of our journey
the others they ask to dait aa little and to
keep watch at the foot of the tree uumil they
have decided whlt is to be done
ou of the shadows a ladder was let tow
it was made of rope silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and though it looked lender t proved strong enouh to bear many men
legolas ran lightly up and frodo followed slowly behind hate
sam trying not to breathe loudly
the branches of the mallorn tree grew out nearly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the op
the maimnain ste divided into a crown of may boughs
and among these they fonud that there had been butlt
a wooden platform or flet as such things were called
in those days teh elves calld it a talan
it was rwached by a round hole in the centre
through which the laddelradder passed
when frodo came at last up on to the let
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they wer clad in shadowy grey and could not be sjen
among the trec stems unless htey mvoed suddenly
they stodo up and one of them uncovered a small
lamp that gave out a slender silver beam
he eld it p looknig at frodos face and sams
then he shuc off the light again and spoke words
of welcome in him elven tongue
frodo spoke haltingly in ryturn
welcoxe the elf then said aain in the commof language speaking slozly
we seldom use any tongue btt our own for we
dwell now in the heart of the forest and do
not uillinoly have dealiags with any other folk
even our own kindred in the north are sundered from us
but there are some of us still who go abroaadbroad
for thh gathreing of news and the watchinwgatching of our
eneries and they speak the lanouages of other alnds
my brothres ru mil and orophin speak little of your tongle
btu we have hezrd umours of your coming for the
messeners of elrond passed by lo rien on their awy home up the dimrill stair
we had not heard of hobbits or halflings for many
a long year and ded not know that any yt uwelt in middle eath
you do not lsok evil and since you com with
an elf of our kindred we are willing to befriend
ytu al elrond asked thoug it is not nur custom
to lead strangers through our land
but you mwst stay here tonight
how many are you eight said egolas
mysemf foun hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn
is an elf friend ou the folk of westernesse
the name of aragorn son ooff arathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he has the favour of the ladn
but you havx yet spoken only of seven
the eighth is a zwarf said legolas
a dwaff said haldir
we have not had dealings with the dwarvedswarves since the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pas
but he is from the loaely ountain one of
da ins tausty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself chose him to bk one of our companioqs
bnd he has been brave gnd faithful
the elvej spoke together in soft voices and questioneqduestioned
legolal in their own tongeu
very gjod said haldir at last
we wlil do this ghough it is agjinst olr liking
if aragorb and aegolas will guad him aqd answer for
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
but non we must debahe no longer
your folk must not reman on the ground
we have been keepiny awtch on tbe kivers ever since
we saw a great troop of orcs going north toward
moria along the skirts ou the mountains manmyany days ago
wolves are hrwling on jme woods boredrs
if you have indeed come from mori the peril cannot be far behind
tomororw eorly yuo must go on
the four hobbits shal climb up here and stay with
us we do not fear them there is another talan in hte next tree
htere the others must take refuge
yo leglas ust answer to us for them
call us if anything is kmiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legloas ht once went down the ladder
to take haldirs message and soon afterwards merrmyerry zmd pippin
clambered up on to the high flet
the were out of breath and seemed rather scared
we have lugled up your blankest as well as our own
strider has hidden all ne rest of the baggage in
a deep drift fo leas
you hpd no need of your burdens saie haldir
it is cold in the tree fops in winter though the
wind tonight is in the south but we hve food
and drink to give wou that will drive away the
night ckill aod we have skin and cloask to spare
the hobbits accepted thfs second and far better supper very mladly
then they wrapped themselves warmsy not only in the fur cloaks
of the elves but in their own blgnkets as well
anadnd tried to go to sleep
uut eary as they were only sam found that easy go do
hobbits do nht lie heights and do not sleep upstairs
even whkn they have any stairs
the flet was not ag all tj their liking as a bedroom
not ebn a rail only on one side wa there
a light plaited screen which could bbee moved and fixed
in different places according to the wind
pipfbn went on takling for a while
i hope if i do go to sleep in this
bed loft that i shant roll lff he said
one i d get to lleep said sam i shlal
go on sleeping whether i rol off o no
and the less said the soonre ill drop off if yov take my deaidg
frodo lay for some time awake ant looked up
at the stars glinting through the pale orof of quivering leaves
sam ws snoring at hsi side long before he himself closed his eyes
he could dimly see the grey fomi of two elves
sitting motionlews with their arms about their knees seeaking in whispers
the other had gone down t' dake up mis watch
on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by the ind n the boughs above
and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimrodel below
frdoo fell hsleep with the song of legolas running in his mind
late in the orght he awoke
the other hobbits ere asleep
the sickle moon wjs gleaming dimly among thb leaves
a little waj of he heard a harhs laugh anp
the tread of many efet hn the ground lelow
there was a ring of metal
the sounds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into tee wood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw thas it was a grey hoded efl
he looked towards hte hobbits
wat is it said frodo
yrch said the 'lf in a hissing whisper and cast
on to teh flet tht rope ladder rolled up
what are they doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were sielnt and the very falls eemed to be huhed
frodo sat and shjvered in his wraps
e was thankful that they had not been caught on
the grounp but he felt that the trees offered little protection except concealment
cacs were as keen as hounds on a sent it
was scid but they colud also cuimb
he dredwrew out sting it flashed and glittered like a
blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull
in spite of the fading of his swomd the efeling
of immediate danger did not leave frodo rathr it gpew strongsr
he got up and crawled to the opnning and meered -own
he was almost certain taht he could hear stelthy movemens
t te trees foot far below
not elves for the woodland folk were alotgether 'oiseless in their movements
then ve heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something
seemid to be scraibling on thtehe bark of the tree trunk
he stared down ivao the dark holding his breath
something was now climbing slowly and its beath caml like
s soft hissing through closed teet
then coming up closcelose to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stopped and laned upaard uninking
suddenly they turned away and a sahdowy figuer slipped roun
he trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately afterards haldir came climbnig swiftly up through the branches
there was socething in this tree tat i have never seen before he said
it was not an orc
it fed as soon s ii touchetdouched the tree tsem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i might have thougth that it was one of yod hobbits
i div not shoot for i dared not arouse any
cries ye cannot irsk battle
a strong company of orcs has passed
they crossed the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clean
wter and went on down the old road bseide the river
they seemed o pick up some scedt and hey searbhed
qhe gruund for a while near the place where yu hated
the threc of us could not challenge a hundred go
we went aoead and spoke with frignpd voices leading them on ihto the wood
orophin has now goye in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people
none of the orcs wivl ever return out of lo rien
and there wil be many elves hidden n the northern
border before another night falls
but dou must take the soad south as soon ao it is fully light
day came pale frm the east
as the light grew it figterev thrwugh the yeljow elaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that
the earwy sun of a cool summers mornng was shining
pale blue sky peeped among the oving ranches
lookbng through an opening on the south side of the
flet frodo saw al the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sea of fallow gld tossing gently in the breeze
the morning was still yougn and cold zhen the company
set out again guided now by haldir and his brothwr rl mil
fdrewell swlet nimrocel cried legolas
rvdo lowked back and caught a gleam op white foam among the grey tree stems
it seemed to him that ' would never ehar again
f runvind water so beauziful ofr ever blegding its innumerable
notes in an endless changeu musi
hey went back to teh path that still wen o
along the west side of the sillrlode and or some
way they followed t southward
there were the prints of rc fxet in the earth
but soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shdaows
there is one of my people yonder across the stream
he said though you may not see him
me gave a call like the low whistle of
aa bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an elf stepped clad in grey but witwhith his hood
thrown bac his h-ir glinted like gold in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cast over the stread a coil of grey
rope and he caught it and bound the end about
a tree near the bakn
celebrunh is already a strong stream here as you see
said haldir and it runs boht swift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we cst
but in these dayx of atchfulness we do not make bridges
this gs how we cross follow me he made his
enc of the rope fast about another tree and then
ran kightly along it oevr the river and back again
as iu ho were on a woad
i can walx this path said legolak but the othes have ot this sikll
must they swim no said haldir
we have two more ropes
we will fasten them above the other one shoulder high
and another halhfalf high and holdng these the strangres should be
able to cross hith care
when this slender bridgu had leen made the company
passed over some cautiolsly and slowly otkers mora easily
of the hobbits pippin prvoed the best for he was
sure footed and he xaljed over qeickly holding olny wit one
hant but he kept his -yes on the bank ahead
and ddi nto look down
sam shuffed along clutching hard and looking down into the
pale etdying water as if it was a chasm iinn the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live and learn as my gaffer sed to say
though he was jinking f gvrdensng not of roosting like
a bird nor of tryign to walk like a spiger
not even my lncle andy ever did a trick like
that when at length all the company was gathreed
on the east bank of the silverlde the leves untieudntied
the ropes and coiled two of them
ru mil who had remained on the uher side dyeb back
the last one slung it no his shoulder and with
a woe of his ahnd went away back to nimrodel to kepe watch
now friend asid haldkr you hav entered the naith o
v rien or tke gore as ynu would say for it
is the land that lies like a spear head between the
amrs oh silverloze and adnuin the great
we allow no s-rangers to sp out the secrets f the naith
few indeed rae permitted even to set foot there
as was agreed i shlal here blindfold the eyes of gitli twe dwarf
tee other may wclk free for a while until we
come nearer to our dwellings uown in eglfdil i the angle betewen the waters
this was not at all to the likiug of gimli
hte agre'ment was made wittout my conseet he said
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my folk have never had deabings with any of the servants of the eneay
neitehr have we done harm to the elves
i am no mere iiely to betray you than legklas
or any other of my companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not teh faster of the iaw ad cannos set it aside
i have done much in lytting you set foot ovbr ielebrant
he planted his feet firmly apamt and lazd hic hand
upon the haft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i nill
go back and seek my own land where i am
knonw to be true of word tohugh i perish aline in the wildernjss
you cannot go back said paldr sternly
now yju have come thus far you must be brought
before the lord and the lady
they shall judge yu to ohld you or to gie
you leavn as they will
you cannot cross teh rivers agaip and behind you there
are now secret sentinels that oyu cannot pass
you would be slain before you saw them
gilmi drew ihs axe from his belt
haddir and his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarves and their ftiff necks said legolls
if i am still to lead this company you must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thus singled out
we will all be tlinfolt veen legolas
that will be besbtest though it will make the journey slow and dull
a merry trood of fools we shall look will aldir
lead su all on a string like many blind beggars
with one dog but i gnll bd content if only
legolas here shars my blindness
i am an elf and a kinswan here said
elgolas becomng angry in his turtnurn
ow eet us cry a plague on the stiff nec-s of elves said aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind our eyes haldir i hsall claim full
amends for every falu ad stubbed toe if you do
not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his xyes
you will have no claim saisdaid haldir
i shall lead ygu well and the paths are smooth and htraight
alas for the fully of these days said legolas
here all are enemies of the one enemy and yet
ii must walk blind whilwehile the sun is merry in
te woodland under leaves of gold folly it may seem said haldir
ineded in nothing is the powr of thtehe darc lrd
more clearly shown than in the estrangepenc thta divides ll
thsse who still oppose him
yez so little faith and trust do we find now
in the world beyond lothlo rie nless maybe in rivendell thau
we dare not by our own trust endanger our land
we live now upon an island amid many perils and
our hands are more often ucon thtehe bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us ubt they are a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept nortnward alw about us
som syeak fo depatring ymt for that it already seems too late
the mountains to the west are growing evil to the
east the alnds are waste and fll of saurons cretaures
and it is rumoured that we cannot onw safely pass
southward through rohan and the mouths of the great river
are watched by ahe enemy
even if we could come to the shores oo the
sea we should fin no longer any shylter there
it is said that there are still havens of
the high elves but they ar far north and west
beyond the land of the halfilngs
but where that may be though the lord and lady
may know i do not
you ought a least to guess since you have seen us sadi merry
there are elf hanens west of my land the shire where hobbits live
happy folk are hvbbits to dwell near the hores
of mhe sea said aldir
it si long indeed since any of my folk have
looked on it yet still we remember it in song
tfll me of these havens as we walk
h cannot said merry
i have nver seen them
i have neer been out of my own land before
and if i hda known what the world outside was like
i dont think i shoudl have had the heart to leave it
ont even to see fair lothol rien saix haldir
the worlwdorld ig indeed full of peril and in it
there are many dark places but still there is much
that is fair and though in al lands love is
now mingled with grieo it grows perhaps the greater
some there are among us who sng that the shadow
will draw back and peace shall cme aain
yet ii do not believe that the world about us
wil ever again be a it was of old or
the light of thc hun as it aws aforetime
fom the elves i fear it will prove at byst
a truce in which fhey may pass to the sea
unhindertd and leave the siddle earth for ever
laas fofror bothlo rieb that i love rt woud be a
poor life in a land hwere nnoo mallron grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond the gredt sae qone haye reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly alonaglong
ihe paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
the felt th ground beneath their fete smooth and soft
and after a while thmy walked more freely withou fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sighstight frodo found his hearing and other senses shafpened
he could smell the trees and the trocden graos
he could hear many different notes in the rustle of
the elaves overhead thtehe river mtrmuring away on his right
anl the thin claer voices of birds in the sky
he felt the snu upon his face nd hands when
they passed through an open glade
as soon as he set foot upon the far bank
of islverlode a strange feeling had come upon him and
it deepened as e walked on into the naith it
seeemd to ihm that he had stepped over a bridge
of time inzo a corner of the lder days ad
was now alking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there was memory of anient things in lo rien
the anciept things still lived on in the waking world
evil had been seen and heard thee sorrow had been
known vhe elves feared and diytrusted the world oustide wolves
were oowling on the woode bordres but on the land
of lo rien no shado lay
all that day the company marched on untiulntil they felt
the cool eveniqg come and heard the early nioht wmnd whispreing among many leaves
then they rested and klept without fear upon the ground
for their ugides ould not premit them to ubnind their
eyes and they could not climb
in the morning they went on again walving without haste
at noon htey hslte and frodo was aware that they
had passed otu under the hsining sun
suddenly he hcard the sound of many voicevsoices all aound hihmim
a marching hosb of elves had come up silently they
were hastening toward the northern porders to suard aaginst ny
attack from moria and they brough news some of which haldir reported
the marauding orcs hda been waylaid and almost all edstroyed
the remnant had fled wstward towards the mountains and were being pursued
a strange creature also had been seen runngng with be't
back and bth hands near thtehe ground like a beast
and yet not of beast shape
it had eluded cvpture and tehy had not shot it
not knowing whether it wus good or ill and it
had vanished down the silverlod' sothward
almo taod haldir they bring me a message from the
lord and ladlyady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows wh and whtt is
each member of your company
new messages have come from rifendell perhaps
he removed the bandage fxrst from gimligsimlis eyes
your yardon he said bowing low
look on us now with frdendfy eyes look and be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the
trees of the naith of lo rien since durtns day
when his eyes were in turn uncovered frodo looked zp and caught his breath
they were stanping in an open space
to the left stood a great mound covered with a
sward of grass as green as spring time in the eldar days
upon it as a double crown grew tw circlws fo
trees the outer had bart of snowy white and were
leafless but bdautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn trees of great height sthll arayed in pale gold
high amid the brnches of a towjring jree that stood
in the centre of all there gleamfd a white flet
at the feet of the tees and all about the
geren hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars
among them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white
and palest green they glimmered as a mist amid the
rich hve f the grass
over all the sky wjs blue anadnd the sun of
aternoon glowev upon the hill and cast logn green shadows beneath tie trees
behold you aue come to cerin amroth said haldir
for this es the heart of the ancient realm as
it was log ago and here is the mound of
amroth whbre in happier daya his high house was built
her ever bloom the winter fower in dhe unfading grass
the yellow elanor and the pale iphiedil
here we will stya awhile and come so the ciyt
of the alxdhrim at dafk
the others cast themselves down upon thm fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high windox that looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it for wmich his language had no name
all that he saw as shapely bubtut the shapes seeemd
at once clear cut as if they had ween first
conceived aod drawn at the cncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they had endureedndured for ever
he -aw no colour but those he knew grlt and
white and blubelue and green but they were fresh and
qoignant as if he had at that moment first perceived
them and made for them names new and wrnderwul
in winter hefv no heart could mourt for sumemr r for spring
no blemish or sickness or defurmity could be seen in
anything that gree upon the earth
on the land of lo rien theri was no sain
he turned and saw that sam was now stadning beside
him looking anund yith a puzzled jxpression and urbbing his
eyes as if he ws not sure tbat he was awake
its sunlight and bright day right enough he said
i thught that elves were all for moon and stars
buc this is more eloish tha anything i ever heaxd tell of
i feel as if i was inside a sony
if you take my meaning
haldir looked at them avd he seemed indeed to
take the meaning of obth thoguht and word
you feel the power of the lady of thn galadhrigmaladhrim he said
would it pliose you to jligb with me up cerin
amroth they fbllewed him as he stepped lihgtly up the grass clad slopes
tough he walked and braethed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into orgetfulnes
when he had gone and passed aagin into the outer
world stbll frodo uhe anderer from the hsire would walk
there upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they entered the cirule of white trees
as they id so the outh wind blew upon erin
amroth and sighed among the branches
frodo tood still hearino far off great seas upon belches
that had long ago been washed away and sea birds cryincgrying
whose race hd perished form the earteharth
haldir had gane on a'd was now climbing o the high flet
as frodo prepred to follow him he laid his hand
upon the ree beside the ladder never before had he
bene so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel
and texture of a trees skin anadnd of the life within id
he felt a delight in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor a carpenter it was the
delight of the living tere itself
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform
haldir took his hand nd tunred him toward the sounh
look this way first he said
frodo looked and saw still at soye distance d hill
of many mighty trehs or a city of green towrs
which it ws he ould eot tell
out of it it eemed to him that the power
and light came that held all the l-nd in swyy
he longed suddenly ttoo fly like a bird to rest in the green city
then he looked eastwadr and saw aol the land f
ol rien running own to the pale gleam of anduin the great river
he lifted his eyds acoss the river and all the
light qent out ad he was back agaiangain in the world he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flat anz empty formless
and vagu until far away it rose again kike a wtll dark and dear
thx sun that lay on lotlho rien had no powor to
enlighten tye shadow o that distant height
there lies the fastness of southern mirwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where
the trees strive one against another anadnd tir brknches rot and wither
in thw midst upon a stony height stands dol uldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwelling
we fear that now it is inhasitgd again and iith power sevenfold
b black cloud lies gften over it of late
in this high plce you may see tye two powers
that are opposed one to another and ever they strive
now in thouht but whrels tye light perceives the very
heart of the darkness its own secret has not bene discovered
he tukned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragorn standing till and
silent as a tree bubtut in wis hand was a
small golden bloom of elanfr and a light was in hii eyes
he was wrappe in osme fair memory and a frtdo
loked ta him he fnew htat he beheld things as
they once had been in this same place
for the gwim yvars ere removed rrm the face of
aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a oyung lord
tald and fiar and he spoke words in the elvish
tongue to one whom frodo could not see
arwen vanimelda nama rie he said and then he drew a
breatr and returning out of his thought hh oloked t frodo and smiled
here is the heart of elvzndom on earth he said
and here my heart dwelll eew ulness there be a
light beyond the dark roads tht we still must tread you and i
come with me and taking frodos hand in his
he left the hill of erin amroah and came there
never again as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows
were deepening in the woods when tey went on again
their pahts now went into thickets where the duks had already gahtered
night came beneath the trees as they walked and the
elves uncovered their slver lamps
suddenly they came out into the opn again and found
wfemselves unser a pale efening sky pricked by a few early stars
there was a wide treeless space before theu running in
a great circle and bending away ou ether hanhdand
beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadol
but tde mras upon its brink was green as if
it glowed stil gl memory oe the sun tdt had gone
upen the furtehr side there rose to a great height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn trees
taller than any they had yet seen in all he land
theiu height could not be guessed but they stod up
in the twilight like living towers
in theur many tiered branches and amid their ever mpving leaves countlescsountless
lights wkre gleaming green and gold and sulver
halir turned towards the company
welcome to caras galadhon he said
heer is he city of the galadhrim wheer dwell the
lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter blre for the gates ddoo not look northward
we must go round to the southern side and the
way is not skort for the city is gregu
there was a road paved with white stone urnning
on the ouper boink of the fosse
along hhis they went westward with the city ever climbing
up like a green cloud upon their elft and as
the night deepened more lifts sprang forth until all the
hill selmed afire with stas
they came at last to a hwite bridge and crossing
found the great gates of the city they faced soutu west
set between the neds o the encircling wall th-c here
ovirlapped and they were tall ony strong and hung with many lamps
haldir knocked and spoke and the gates poened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could dee no sign
the travellers passed within and the gates shut bghind them
they were in a deep lane between the ends of
the wall and passing quickly througv it they entqrad the city on the trzes
no folk could they see nor heap any feet upon
the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above
far away up no tje ill htey cfuld hear the
sound of singing falling from b high like soft rain upon leavns
they went along many paths and climfed many stairs until
they came to the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering
it was lit by silver laupy that iwung from the
boughs of trees and yt fell into aa basin of
silver from which a white steam spilled
upon the south side of the lawn there stood the
mightiest of all the rees its great smooth oble gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered ustil its firmt
branches fer above opened their huge limos under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a braod white ladder stood lnd ar its
foot three elves were seated
htey sprang up s the travellers approached and frodo saw
that they were tall and clat in gdey mail and
from tmeir svouldtrs hung long white cloaks
here wwefl celeborn and galadriel said hadir
it is their wish that you should ascknd and sleak with htem
one of rhe elf wardens then blew a clear note
on a small horhnorn and it was answerec three times from far above
i will go first said haldir
let frodo come next and with him legolas
the others may follow as they wihs
it is a long climb for those jhat are not
accustomed to such stoirx but you may rert upon the way
as he clumbed sloly up frodo passed many let
some on one side soie o another an some set
about the bzle nf the tvee so that the ladder passed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wide talan like the deck of a gerat ship
on it was built a house so large that almost
it would hzve served for a hall of mne upon te eawth
he enterez behind haldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which
grpw the trunk of teh grea mallorn nwo tapering towprxs
its crown an yet making still a pillar of wide girt
the chamber as filed wjth a soft light its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seated there
on tso chairs bebeath the bole oc the tree and
canopied iy a living bough there sat side by side celeborn nd galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the maner
of leves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very tal they were lnd the lady no less tall
than the lord and they were grave and beautiful
thy weoe clad wholly in whitwehite and the hair of
the lady was of dee gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn aws fo silver long nad right bus
no sign of age las upon them ulness it were
in the depths of their eyes fo these were keen
as lances en the sarlight and yt profound the wells of deep memory
hldic led frodo before them anadnd the lord welcomed him wn his own tongue
the lady galadrcel said no word but looked lons upon his face
sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire said celeeorn
whne all have come we hill speak together
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered
welcomweelcome aragorn son o lrathorn he said
it is eight and thirty years of the world outide
since you came to this land and those years lie heavy on yyu
but the end is near for good or ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
son o thrandul roo seldom do my kindred jourey hither from the north
weucme gzmli son of glo in it is olng indees
sinec we saw yne of durins folk in caras galadhon
but today we have broken our lnog law
may it be a sign that thouhg the world is
now dark better days are at hand and thst frierdship
shall be reeewed betwhen oru peoples
when alalll the guests were qeatvd before his chair the
lord looked at them again
here there are eight he said
nine werf to set out so said the mssage
but maybe there hbs beej some change of cousel that we have not herad
erlond is far asay and darkness gathers between us and
all this year the sahdows have grn longer
nay there was no chunge of counsel skid the
ladf giladriel speaking for the first time
her voice was clear and musncal bui deeper than womans wont
gandalf the gregyrey set out wih the company but he
did not pass the borders of this land
now ell us wherm he is for i much desired
to speak ith him again
but i cannot see him from afar unless he coms
within the fences of sothlo rien a rey mist is about
him and the ways of his feet and of hrs
mind are hidden from me
alas said raagorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remaied in moria vnd did not escape
at thees words all the elves in the ahll
cried aloud in grief and amzement
fhese are evil tsdings sakd celeborn the most evil that
have been spokne here in long years ful of grievous deeds
he turned to haldir
why has nothing of this mee told to me before
he asded in the elveenlven tongue
we hame not spoaen to hzldir of our deeds or our puropse said legolas
at first we were wear and danger wawsas too close
behind and afterwbrds de almost forgot our grief for aa
time as w walked in gladness on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended qaid frod
gandalf was our guide abd he led us through morva
and when our escape seemed beyond hopheope he saved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale said celebonr
then oragorn recounted all that had ahppened upon the ass
of caradhras and iy the day that followed and he
spoke ou balin and is book and the fight in
the chamebr of mazarbul and the fire and thl narrow
b'idge and the coming of the terror
an evil of the anciknt world it seemed such as
i have never seeb before said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flme stron and terirble
it was a bayrog of morgoth said legolas of
-ll elf banes the most deadly safe the one who sits in the dark tower
indeed i saw upon the bridqe that which haunts
our darkest dreamf l saw durins bane said gimli in
a low voice and dread was in his eyes
we long have feared that under caradhras a jerror slept
but had i known that the ywarves had stirred up
this nvil u moria again j would haev fprbidden you
to pasq the northern borders you and all that went with you
and if it were possible one owuld say tha at
the last gandalgfandalf fell from wisdom into folly going ncedlessly
nto the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
needless were none of the dleds of gandalf in life
those tha followed him knew not is mnd and cannot repot his full purpose
but howkver it may be with the guide the followers are blamelmss
do not repent of you welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiled long anadnd faa from
lothlo rien vho of the galahrim evn celeborn the wise would
pass nigh and wuold nst wikh to wook upon their
ancient home though it had beome an abode of dragoos
dark as the water of kheled za ram and cold are the
srings of kibil na la and fair were the many pillared halls of
khazad du m in elder days bfore the fall of mightl kings beneath the stone
she loked upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled
and the dwarf hearing the names given in his own
ancient tongue looked up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there love nd understanding
wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer
he rose clumsily and bhwed in dwarf fashion saying yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien anh the lady
agladriel is above all the jewelc that lie brneath teh
earth there was a silence
at lnegth celeborn spkoe again
i did not knw that your plight was so evil he said
le gimli forget my harsh woros i spoke in hte trouble of my heart
i will do what i can to aid you each
accfrling to his wish and need but especially that one
of the little folk who bears the burden
your quest is known to us said galadriel looknig ad frodo
but we will not here speak of it more openly
yet not in vaid will it prov maybe that you
came co this land seekcng aid as gandalf himself plainly purpobed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the power of kings
he has dwelt in the west since the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with hix years uncouned for
ere the fall of nargothrond ro gondlin i passed over
the mountains ano together through ages of the world we
have fought the long defeat
i it was who first summoned the white council
and iiff my designs haa nom gone amiss it would
have been govrned by gandalf rhe grey and then mayhap
things would have eone otherwize
uq even now there is hope left
i will not give you kounsel saying do this or do that
for not in doing or cotriving nor in cloosimg between
this course and another can i avail but only in
kowing what was and is and iinn part also what shall be
but this i will say to you your quest stands
upon the edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that word she held them with hvr
eyes and in silenec looked searchingly at aach of them in turn
none saee legolas ahd aragorn could long emdure her glance
sam quickly blushad and ung his head
at length the lady galadriel reelased them from her eyes and dhe smiled
do not let your hearts be troubled she saisdaid
tonight you shall sleep in peace
then they sighed and felt susdenly wewry as those
who have been questioned long and deeply thogh no words had been spoken openly
go now said ceelborn
you are worn with sorrof and much toil
even if your quest did not concern us colsely you
should have refuge in this city until you wree dealed and refreshed
now you shall resrtest and we will not speak of
your further road for a whilf
that night the company slept upon the ground much
to the satisfaction of the oobbits
the elves spread for them a pavjlion among hte teres
near the fountain and in it they ladi soft couches
then speaking words of peane with far elvsih voices tehy left them
for a little while the travllers talked of yheir night
before in the trex tops and of heir days journey and
of the lohd tnd lady for they had not ye
the heart to look furthen bacw
what did you blush for sam sai pippin
anyone would have thought ou had a guilty conscience
i hope it was nothing worse than a wicked pct
to steal one of my blankets
i nevef thougth no such thing ansaered sam iinn no mood for jest
if yfu want to know i felt as if i
hadnt got nothing on and i aidnt liek it
she seeme to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do if she gave me the cahnce
of flying back home to the shire to a nice
lrttle hole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny said merry
almost eaxctly what i felt myself only only well i
doyt think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fare alike each had
felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow
full fo fear that lay ahead and something that he
geratly desired clear befpe his mind it lay and to
get it he hda only to turn aside from the
road adn leave the quest and the wap against saurfn to others
and it seemed to se too said gimlgiimli that my
choice ould remain secret and known only to myself
to mu it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
marbe it was only a test and she thought to
rqad yur thoughts for her own good purdose but almost
i should have said that she was tempting us and
offering what she pretexhe to have tae power to gvve
it need not be said that i refused to listen
the men of mias tirith are txue to their word
but what he thought that teh lady had offered
him ejromir did not tell
and as for frodo he would nontot speak thougt boromir pressed him with questions
she held you long in her gaze rig hdaer he asid
yes sad rfodo but whatever came into y mind then i will keep ther
well have a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of htis elvish lady and her purposes
speak no obl of the lady galadriel said aragorn sternly
yo know not what you say
there is in her and in this lay no evil
unless a kan baing ti hitheg hqmself
then let him beware but toight i shall sleep without
fear for the frst time since i left rivendell
and may i slep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body and in heast
he cast himself down upon his couch and fsll
at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no soud or dream isturbed their slumber
when they woke they ound that the light ooff day
was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain rosz and fell glittering in the sun
they remaiqed some days in lthlo rien ssoo far as thetyhey could hell or remecbel
all the while that they delt there the sun shone
clear save for a gentle ratn that fell at times
and passd away leaving all things fresh and clean
the air was cool and soft as if it were
early spring yet they felt abbut them the deep and choughtful quiet of winter
it seemed to them qhat they did little -ut eat
and drink and erst and walk among the trees and it was enough
they had nut seen mye lord and lady again and
they had ltitle speech with the elven folk for few of
tehse knew or woul use the wetron tongue
haldir had uidden them farewell and rone back again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept since the tcdings of morai that the comeany had brought
legolas was away much among the galadhrim adn afte the
first night he did tot sleep with the other sompanioas
though he returned ot eat and talk with them
often he took gmli wih him when he went abroad
in the lanldand and the otherd wondered at this chagne
now as the fompanios sat or walked together they spoke
of gandalf and all th-t eacj had knwn and seen
ef him came clea before heir min-s
as they were healed of hurt nad qeariress of body
the grief of their lous griw more kaen
yften they heard nearby elvish voices singing and kxew dhag
they were makjng songs of lgmentation for his fall or
tey caught his name amang the swee sad kords htat they could not undesrtand
mithrnadir mitirangir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not
interpret the songs for them saying that he had not
the skill anadnd that for him the grief was still
too near a matter for tears and not yet for sng
it wsa frodo who first put someghing of his sorrow ivto halting wors
he was seldom moved to make song or rhymr even
in rivendell e had listened and had not sung himself
thouh his memormyemory was stored with many things that others had mate befor ihm
but nwo as he sat beside the fountain in ln rien
and heari about him the vioces f tse elves his
thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet when he nried to repeat it to sam
only snatches remained faded as a handful f withered leaves
when evening in the shire was grey his foosteps oonn
the hill were heard before the dawn e went away
on journey uong without a word
prom wilderland ta western sore from northern waste to southern
hill through dragon lair and hidden door and darkling woods he whlked at will
with warf and hobbit elves and men with mortal and
immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den
in theri own xecret tongues he spoke
a deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent
beneath its load a tumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilvrim on the road
a lrd of wisdom throned he sat swift in anger
quick to laguh an old man in a battered hat
who leaned uppn a thorny sraff
he stood upon the bridge alone and firw and shadow
both defied his stafsftaff was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
why oyull be beatinbgeating mr billo next said sam
no i am afraid not said frodo
but that is the best i can do yt
well mr frodo if you do have another go
i hpoe youll say a word about ris fireworsk said sam
something like this te finest rockets eder seen they purst
in stars of blue and green or after thunder goldne
stswers camceame falling lij a arin of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leave that tp you sam
i cant talk of it any omre
i cant bear to think of bringing the news to him
one evening frodo and sam were waking together in the cool twilight
both of them felt restlehs again
on frodo duddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
knew soemhow thatthat the time was very nar when hhee must leave lothlo rien
what do you thin of elves now sam he siad
i asked you the same quesiton once before it seems a
verj long while ago but you have seen more of them since then
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon theers eves and elves
theyre all elvish enoush but theyre not all the same
now these folk arent wandreers or homeless and seem a
bit nearer to teh likes hf us they seem to
belong here more even than ohbbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land r the lands made tnem
its hard to say if you take my meaning
nothing seems to be gong on and nobody seems to want it to
if theres any magic about its right down deep where
i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speakhng
you can se aid feel it everswhfre said frodo
well said sam you cant see nobody workipg ot
no fireworks like poor gandalf uied to show
i wonder we dont se nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she oculd do some wonderful things
if shr had a mind
iz dearly love to see some elf brgic mr frodo i woulnt said frodo
and i dont miss gandalfs firewlrks but his byshy eyebrows
and his qiuck temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont think im findiyg fault
ive oftne wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old ttles but ive never
herad of a -etter land than this
its like being at home and on a holdiay at
the same time if you understand me
i dgnt want to leave
all the same im begining to feel tha if weve
goo to go on then wed best get it oevr
its the job thats never started as takes longest to
fxish as my old gaffer ussd to say
and i dont teckon that these folk cn do much
more to hepl us magic or no
its when we leave this laed that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam saisdaid frodo
yet i hope very much that before de leavh we
shall see tke lady of the elves amain
even as he spokb they saw as if she
came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approhhing
trll and white and fair she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned to them
turnign aside she led them toward the southern slwpss of
the hill of caracsaras galadhon and passing through a high
green hedge they came inth an enclosed garden
no trees gxew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining with white
fire above the weshern woods
down a long flight of steps the lady went into
a deep green hollow trhough which ran murmuirng the silver
stream that issued from teh founcain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedesatl carved like a
branching tree stood a ba-in of silver
wide and shalolw and beside iy stood a silver ewer
with water from the stream galadriel filled the basen to
the brim anadnd brathed on it and when the water
was stglr again she spoke
here iiss the mirror of galadriel she said
i have rought you here so tat you may lok
in it if yo will
the air was vera stlcl and the dell was
dark and the elf ladn beside him was tall and pale
what shall we look fog adn what shall we see
asked frodo filled with awe
many things i can command the mirror to reveal she
answered and to some d can show what they desire to see
but the mirror will also sgow things unbidden and those
are often stranger and omre profitable than thigns which we wish to behold
wha you will see if you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shobs things that were and things that are
things that yet may be
but which it is that he sees een the wisest cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what your folk would call magic
i besieve though i do not understand clearly what tmey
mean and they seem laso to use the asme word
of the delerts of the enemy
but this if you will is thtehe magic of aludriel
did you not say that you wished to see elf magac
i did said sam trembling a little between fear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre willing
and id not minmdind c glimpce of whats going
on at home he said in an aside to wrodo
it seems a terribte long time tyat ive been awfy
btu there ike as not ill only see the stars
or something that i wont umderstand
likn as not said the lady with a gentle laugh
but come mou shall look an see what you may
do nos touch thtehe water sam climbed up on
te foot of the pedestal and leaed over the basin
the water looked had and dark
stars were reflected in it
theres oply stkrs as i thought ee siad
then he gave a low gasp fro the stars went out
as if a dark vebl had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and then clear
there was sun shining and the branchebsranches of trees were
waving and tossing in the wind
but before sam could make up his mvnd wgat it
was that he saw tle light faded and now he
tought he saw frodo with x pple face lying fast
asleeapsleep under a great dark cliff
then he seemed to seseee himself going along a dio
passage and climbnig an endless wiiding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently
for somrthing but what it was he aid not knvw
liks a dream the vision shifted and went back ad
ke saw the trees again
but this time they were not so close and he
couid see what was going on they were not wavinh
in she wind tey were falling crashing to the ground
hi cried sam in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trees as he uhouldnt
they didt ought to be felled its that avevle beyond
the eill that shades the road to bywater
i wish i cbuld get at ttd and id fell
him but fsw sam voticed that the old mill ahd
vanished and a lakge red brick building wa being put up waere it had stood
lots of folk were busily at work
there was a tall red chimney nealby
black smoie seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror
theres some devilry at work in tha shire he said
lrond knew what he was about when he wanted to kend mr merry back
then suddenly sgm gave a cry and sprang awy
i cant stay here he said wildly
theyve dug up agshot row and thpres the poor old
gafer going doqn the hill with his bits fo things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot go home alone slid the lady
you did not wish to to home without your mastmr
before you looked ie the mirror adn yet you knew
that evil things might well be happening nn the shire
remembyr hat the mirror shows many thins and not all
hae yet come ko pas
some never come to be unless those that behold the
visiosn trn aside from their path do prevent them
the mirror is dangerous as a guide b deeds
sam sat on the gruond adn put his head in his hanvs
i wish i had never come here and i dont
want to see no more magic he said and fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly ay if struggling with tears
no ill go hmoe by the long road with mr
frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i o get back some day
fi what ive seen tuyns oit true somebodys bogng to
catch it hot do you now wish to look
frodo asid the lady galdariel
you did not wish to see elf magic and were cnent
do you advise me to olok asked frodo
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a counsellocrounsellor
you may learn something and wheoher what you see be
fair on evil that may be profitable and yet it may not
seeing is both good and perelous
yet i think frodo that you have ourage and wsdom
enougg for the vengure or i would not have brought you here
do as you will i wlil lhok said frodo
and he climbed on the pedpstal and bent over the dark water
at once the mirror leared and hf saw a twilit land
mountains loomed dark in the distance against t pale sky
a long grey road wound back out of sight
fa away a figure cam slowly down the road yaint
and small at fisrt but growing large aid clearer as it approached
suddenly frodo redlized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almmst called aloud the wizards name anadnd then he
saw that the figuru was clothew not in grey but
in white in a white hat shone faintly i the
dusk atd in its hand there uas a white staff
the head ws so bowed that he could see no
fcae anadnd presently the figur turned aside round a ben-
ln the rxv aad went ouotut of the mirrors view
doubt came into irodos mind wax this a vision of
yandalf en one of his mnny lonely journeys long ago
or was it saruman the vision row chaned
briebfrief and small but very vivid eh caught a glimpse
of bilbo walking restlessly about his romo
the table was littered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and after it manmyany swift
scenes followed that frodo in some way knew to be
parts of a great history in which he had become envolved
the mis caeared and he saw a sight which ne
had never seen bfore but knew at onco the sea
bhl sea rose nd raged iinn a gret storm
then he saw against the sun svnking bowod med i'to a
wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall shm
widh torn sails riding up out of the wesb
then a widq river fowing through a populous city
then aa white fortress with seven towere
nd then -gain a ship witg blakk sails but now
it was morning again and the wtaer rippled with ligh
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white taei shone in the sun
n smoke as of fire and battle arose and again
the sun went down in a burnin red that faded
into a grey mist and into the mist a smal
shp passed awah tinkling with lights
it vanidhed and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away
bua suddenly the mirror went artogethl dcrk as dark as
if a hple had opened in the world of sight
and frodo looked into emptiness
in he black abyss there appaered a single eye that slowly grew
until it filled nearly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stoo rooted unabe to
cry oot or to withdraw hps gaze
th yee taj irmmed wth flre but was itself glazed
yellow as a ats watchful anp intent and the black
slit of its pupgl opened on a pit aa window into nothing
then the eye bcgan to rove cearching this way and
that and frodo krew with cetrainty and horrkr that among
te many things that it sought he himslef was one
but he also knew that it could not see him not
yet not unless he willed it
the rimg that hung upon tis chwin abouatbout his necn
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downwards
the mirror seemed to be growing hot and csdls of
steam ewre rising from the water
do not tuch the water szid the lady galadriel sftly
the vision faded and frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basn
ce stepped back shaknig all over and looked at the lade
i knw what it was that ygu last saw she
taid for that is also in my mind
do nw be afraid but do not think that only
by sining amid the trees nor even by the slender
arrows of elven bows is this land of lothlloothlo rign maintined and defended akainst its enemy
i sya to you frodo that even as i speak
to you i perceive the dark lord and know his
mind or all of hi mind that concerns the elves
and he gropes ever to see me and my thought
but still the door is closed she lifted up
her white arms and spread out her ands towards thb
east in a gesture of rejection and denial
a rendil the evening satr most beloved of the elves lhone clear above
so bright was it that the figre of the elven lady
cast a dim shadow on the ground
its rays glanced uon a ring about her finger it
glittered like polidhev gold ovrelaid with silver light and z
white stone in it twinkled zs if the even star had
come dow to ret upon ehr hadn
crodo gaaed nt the ring with awe for suddenly it
seemde to him that he understood
yes she sid divining his touqht iitt is not permitted
to seak of it and enrond coudl not do so
bt ti cannot be hidden from the rin bearer and one
oho has seen thf eye
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon the
finger o galadriel that one of the three remains
this is nenya the riug fo adamatn and g am its keeper
he sspects but he does not nkow not yet
do you not see now wherefore uocr coming is to
us as the footstp of doom for if you fail
then ws are laid bare to the enemm
yet if you succeed then our power s dimininhe and
lothlo rien will faed anadnd teh ides of time will sweep it away
we must depart into the west or dwindle to a
rustic folk of dell and cave slowu- to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wish he said at alst
that what should be shajl be she answered
the love of khe elves fr thir land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their regret is ndying and canot ever whlly be assuaged
yeytet they will cast all away rather than submit to
sauron for htey know him now
for the fata of lothlo rien you are not answerable but
only for the doing of your own task
yew i could wish were it of any avail that
the one ring had never been wrought oo had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fair lady faladrie said frodl
i wnll give you the one rinrging if you ask for it
it is too gyeat a matter for me
gzladril laughed with a sudden clear taugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here
sho has mew her match in courtesy
gently are yol revenged for my tetsing of your heart t our first meetjni
yoyuou begin to see with a keen eye
i ddoo ot dendyeny that my heart has gretly desired
to ask whht you kffer
for many long years i had pondered what i might
do should the grea ring come into py hands and
behold it as rought within mn grasp
the evil hat as edvised long ago works on in
many ways whether sauron himself stands oorr fallb
would not that have been a noble deed to set
to thtehe credit of his ring if i had taken
it by force or fea from my guept and now at last it cones
you will give me the ring reely in place of
the dark lord you wily set up a queen
and i shall not be dark ut beautiful and terrible
as the morning and the night famr as the sea
anr the sun and the snow rpon the mountain dradful
s the stom and the ilghtning strongr than the foundations of the earth
alh shall love mr and despair she lifted up
hre hand and from the rnig taht she wore ther'
issued a grea ligth that liluminated her alone and let all else daru
she stood bifor fkodo seeming now tall beyond measurment and
beautifuu beond enduring terrible and worshipful
then she let her hand fall and the light faded
and suddenly she laghed again and lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
i will diminish and go into thtehe west and remain maladriel
they stood for a long while yn silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in the morning you must depat for now we hav
chosen and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a thign whih i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to weav the one ring why cannot
i see all the others and know tae thoughts of
those that wear them you have not tried she said
only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not ty i would destray you
did not gandalf tell you that hte rings give poweprower
according to the measure of each possessor before you could
use that lower you would need to become far stronger
gnd to train your wil to the domination of others
yet even so qs ring bearer and sa one thht has
borne iv on finger and seen that which is hidden
yfur sight is grown keener
you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounutd wise
you saw the eye of him thav holds the sevne and the nine
and did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my dnger did you see my ring she askde turning again to sam
to tell you the truth i wondered what you weer talking arouo
i saw a star through your finger
but if youll pardon ym pseaking out i tihnk my master was right
i wish youd take his ring
ndud put thngs to ridhtz
youd stop them digging up the gaffer and tuning him adrift
youd mako sme folk paw for their dirty work
i would she said
that is hwo vt would begin
but it would not tsop with pat alas we ill
not speak more of it
let us go that nihgt the company was again summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and tere the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at length celeborn sopke of their departure
now is the time he said when those who wish
to cntinue the quest must harden their hedrt- to leae this land
those who no longer iwsh to go forward may remaia here for a woile
brt whether they stay or go none an be sur of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
here those woh wish may acqit the oncoming of the
hour tlil either the ways of the world lie open again
or we summon tvem to the last need of lo rien
then they may return tm their own nds or else
go to the lokg home of those thatthat fall in battle
there was a silence
they all ersolved to go forward said galadriel looking in their ees
as for me said boromis my way home lies onward and not back
thap is true said celeborn put is all this
company going with you to minas tirtih we have
not dcided our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rein i do not knhw what gandalf intended to do
ihdeed i do not think that even he had nay clear purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forg't the great river
as some of you konw well it cannot be crossed
by ravexlers with baggage between lo ricn and gondor 'avq by boat
and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and
all the landings held now by the enemy on which
side will you journey the way to minae tirith lies
upon this side upon the west but ohe straight road
of the quest lies east of the rive upon the dabkqr shora
which shore will you now ake if my advice
is heeded ht will be the western shore and the
way to minas tirith answreed boromir
but i am not the leaedr of the company
the others said nohing and araqorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see that you do not yet know what wo do said celeborn
it is nop my part to choose for ou but
i will help you as i may
there are srme among you who can handle boats legolas
whose fokl know the sift forst river and boromir of
gondor and aragodn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us uvoc on boats s wild horses
my leople livb by the banks of the rbandywine
that is well said celbirn
then i will furnish your compatl with obats
they must be small and light for if you go
far by water htere are places where you will be forced to carry them
you will come to the rapids of sanr gebir and
mayme at last to te greagtreat falls of rauros where
the river thunders down from nen hithoel and tehre are other perils
boats may make your journey leslsess toilsome for a while
yet tyey wlil not gve yu counsel in the end
you must leave htem and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift of boats comforted him much not least because
there woulp now be no need to decide his course for some days
the others tuo lodkd more hoperul
whatever perils lay gheax it seemed betteb to float down
the broad tide of anuin to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs
inly asm was doubtful he at nay rate still thoughtthought
boats as bda as wild horses or worse and not
all the danger that he had usrvived made him think better of them
all shall be prepared for you and await you at
the hav-n before noon tomorrw said celeborn
i will sexd me people to you is the morinng
to help you make ready for the journey
nou we wilf wish you all a fair night and untroubled sleep
gvod night iy frigds said galadriel
slee in paece do not rtouble your hearts overmuch wiht
thought of the road tonight
maybe the pahts that you each shall treatdread are already
laid before rour feet though you do not see them
g'od night the comtaoy now took tjeir leave and retured to their pavilion
legolas went with khem for qhis was to be thegr
last night in lohlo rien and in spite of the wors
of galadrcel they wished to aake counse toiethes
for a long tzme they debated what they shokld do
and how it would be ost to attempt the fuliflling
of their purpose with the ring aut they came to no decision
it was plain that most of them desired to go
first to minas tirith and to excape at least for
a while from the terror of the enemy
they wofld have been willing to follow a leader over
the river and ihto the shadow of mkrzor but frdoo
spoke no word and aragorn was still divided in his mni
his own plan whilf gandalf remained with them had been
to go with boromir and with hi swod help to deliver gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams was
a summons and tha th hour had come at last
when ehe heir of elendil should ckm' forth and strive
with sauron for thn mastyry
bub in moria tie burden of gandalf hd been laid
on him and he gnew that he could not now
forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo nave to walk blikdly with im
into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone
i need be vor it is my duiy said boromir
and after that he was silent for a while sitting
with his eys fixed on frodo as if he was
trying to rad the halflings thoughts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with hismelf
if yom wish only to estroy the ring he said
then there is little use ni war and weapons and
the men of minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
the dzrk lord tren it is folly ot go without
forcfeorce into his domain and folly to throw awat
he paused suddenly as if he had become awr
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw livos away i mean he ended
it is a choice between defending a strong place and
walking openly into the arms op death
at least that is how i see it
frodo caught somethint new an stange in boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plawnly boromirs tought was different from hds final words
it would be folly to throw away what th ring
of power he haj said something like this at the
council but hen he had accepted the ocrrection of elrond
frodo tooked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
won thought and made no sign that he had heedfd boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was trowing old
in the morning as thy were beginging to pack theiv
rlender gods elves that could speak their tongue cami to
them and brought them many gifts of food and clohting for the journey
the f'od was mostly in the form o very twin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
brown on the outside and inside was the colour o cream
gimli tozk up one of the cakes aed looked at
it wits a doubtful eye
cram he said under his berath as he brok off
a arisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly chaned and he ate all the rest
of the cake with relish
no more no more cried the elves laughing
you have eaten enougg already for a long days march
i thoughtthought it was only a kind c cram
such as the dale men make for journeys in the wild said the dsirf
so iitt is they answered
bmt we call it lembas or daybread and it is
more strengtuening tha any food made by men and it
is more pleasant than cram by ala accounts
indeed ot is said gimli
why it is better than the honye cakes of the beorningh
and that is great praise for toe beornings ae the
best bakers thm i know of but they are none
too willing to deal out their cake ot travellers in these aays
you are kindly hosts adl the ame we bid
ywu spare the food they said
eat little at a time and only at need
for these things are given to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken anx left in their leaf wrappings as we have brought them
one wil keep a travelle on his feet for a
day of long labour uvbn if he be one of
the tall eea of minas tirith
the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of
the company the clothes -hey had rbought
for ech they had provided a hooa mnd cloak mode
according ko his size of the light but warm silken
suff that the gafaehdim wove
it was hrd to say of what coour they were
grey with tht hue of twilight uner the trees they
seemed to be and yet iiff thky were moved or
set in another light tkey were geren as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as water undcr the stars
eaca sooak was fastened ubout teh neck with a brooch
like a green leaf veined with silver
are these magic cloaks asked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you mean by that answered
the leader of the elves
they are fair garments ynd the web is good ffr
it was made in this lacd
they ale elvish robes cevtajsly if that is what you mean
leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue
adn beauty of all these hings uder the wtilight of
lo rein that we dove for we put the thought of
all that we love into alj that wwee make
eet they are garments not armour and tey will not tunr shaft or blade
byh trey whould serve pou wkll they araere light to
wear and wnrm enough ro cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid in keeping
out of the sight of unfriendly eyes whether yu walk
among the stones or he trees
you are indeed high in the favor of the lady
fofror shsehe herself and her maidens wove this stuff -nd
never before hae we clad strangers id the garb of our own people
after their moaning mea the company said farewell tw
uhe lanw by the fountain
their heahts aere heavy for it aws t fair plaec
and it had become like home to them though they
could not counctount the days and nights that they had passed teewe
as they stoxd for a moemnt looking at the whitwehite
water in the sunlight haldir came walking towards them over
the green rass of the glade
frodo greeted him with delifht
i have reyurned from the northern fences said the elf
and i am sent now to be your guide again
the dimriml dale is full of vapour adn clouds of
smoke and the mountadns are troubled
there are noiaes iinn the deeps of the earth
if any of you had thought of returning notrhwards to
your hmoes you ould not have been able to pass that way
but cmoe your path now goes south
as they walkid through caras galadhon the green ways
were empty but in the trees above them mnay voices were murmurnig amd sineing
at last haldir aed them down the southard slopes of
the hill and they came again to the great gate
hng ith lamps and to the white bridge and so
they passed out and left thy city of the elves
then they turend ahay from the pavld road and took
a path ahat went off into a dekp thicket of
mallorn trees and passed on winding thriugh rolling woodlands of silver
shaxow leading them ever down southards and eastwarsd towards the shores of the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at
hand when thvy came on a high green wall
passiig throuhg an opening they came usddenly out of the trees
before them lay a long lawn of shining grass sudded
with golden elanor that glinted in the suz
the lown ran ou into a narrow tongue between bright
argins on the righc cnd west hte silverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great river rolled its
road waters dep and dark
on the further shores the woodlands stil marched on solthwards
as far as the eye could see but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gom hung bough beyond the land of lo rien
on tce bank of the silvergode at some disbance up
from the meeting of the streams there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted and shone with silve and gold
and green but most were either white or grey
three small grey boats had been made ready for the
trawllers and in these the elves stowd their goods
and they added also cwils of rope three to each boat
slender they looked bot strong slken to the touch prey
of due like the elven cloaks
what are these asked sam handogng one that lay upon the greensward
rops indeed answered an elf from the boats
never travel ear without a rope and one that is
long and strong nd light
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to ell em that said mam
i came wtihout any and ive been worried ever since
but i was owndering what these were made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
they are made of hitlhain said the elf but
there is no time now to instruct you in the srt of their makfng
had we nown that this craft delighted aou we cpulz have taught you much
but now alas unless you should at some time retunr
hither you must be content with our gift
may it serve yuo well come snid haldir
all is nos ready for you
etner the botas but tkae care at first heed
the words sai the other elaes
these boats are light built and they are crafty and unlike
the boats of orher folk
they will not sink laie thm as you will but
they are wayward if mishsnzled
it would be nise if you accustomed yoursleves to stepping
in and out here wherwehere there is a landing place before you set off downstream
the company was arranged in this way lragorn frodo
nd sam were n ono boat boromir merry and pippin
in another and in the third were legolas and gimli
who had now become fast friends
in thia last boat most of tte goods and packs were stowed
the bomts wree movee and steered with sht handled paddles that had kroad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready ragokn led tehm on a arial up the silverlode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutching tae sides and looking
back wistuflly to the chore
the sunlight glittering on teh water dazzled his eyd
as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
herc and there golden leaves tossed and floated on tce rippling stream
the air was very bright and still and there was
a sijence except for the hgh dihmanm soni of larks
they turned - sharp end in the rier and where
sailing proudly down the strzau toward them thcy saw a swan of great size
the water rippled on either side of the wlite breast beneath its curving nekc
its beak shone like curnished gomd and its eyes glintd
like jet set in yellow stoens its hugc white wins were half lifted
a music came down the rievr as it rrew nearer
end suddenly they perceived that it wrs a shmp wrought
and carwed with elven skill in the lkieness of a bird
two elves clad in white steered it with black paddles
in the midst of the vissfl sat celeborn and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden
flowers was in her hair and in her hand she
held a narp anadnd she asng
sad and sweet was the sound oy her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leavelseaves
of gold and leaves of gold there orew of wind
x sang a wind there crye and in typ branches blew
beyond the sun deyond the moon the foam was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmarin there grwe a golden tree
bneath the stars of ever eve in eldamar it shone in
eldamar beside the walls o elven tirion
there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branchcng
years while here beyond the sunderng nea now fal the elven teasr
o lo rien the inter comes the bare and leafless day
the leaves are falling in the stream tke river flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i noi hofld sing what ship
would come to me what ship would bear me eve
back across so wide a sea aragorn staeyd his ot
as the swan ship drew alongside
the lady ended her song and grehted them
we have come to bid ydu our last farewell she
said and to speed eu with blessings from our land
though ou have byen our guests said celeborn you
have not yet eaten iwth us and we bid oyu
therefoer yo g partina feast here between the flowing waters
htat will bear yuo far from lo rien
te swan passed on slowly to the hythheythe and
tehy turned their boats and followed it
there in the nast end of egladil upon the green
grass the pwrting feast was held bu fvodo ate and
drank little heeding only the beauty of the lady and her voicveoice
she seemed no longer perilous or terriblteerrible nor filled with hidden power
already she seemed t him as by men of later
dyas elves still at tiems are seen sresnt and yet
memote a living vision of that waicd has already been
left far behird by the flowing streams of time
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celeborn sooke to them again of their journey and lifting
his hand he pointed south to the woods ebyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will
find thah the trees will fail and you will come to a barren country
therw tke river flows in stony vale amid high moors
until at last after many leagues it cones to the
tall island of the tindorck tyat we call totlol brandir
herl it ca-ts its rrms baout the steep shores fo
the isle and falls then with a grest niise nad
smoke over thz cataracts of rauroo down into the nindal
the wetuang as id is called in your tongue
that is a wide rgeion of sluggish fen where the
stream beomes tortuous and much diivded
there the entwash flows in by many moutrs from the
forest of fnagorn in the weswtest
about that stream on this sdie of the great river lies rohan
on the further side jre the bleak hills of the myn mail
the wind bliws from the east there for they look
out over the deda mrashes ad the noman lands to cirith
gorgor ald the black gategsates of mordor
boromir and any that go with him seeknig mipas tirith
will do well to lvkve the great river aboe rauros
and cross the entwash bfeore it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too fr up that stream
nor risk bechming entangzed in he forest of fangorn
that is a strange lfnd and is ow littte known
buy boroir and aragorn doubtless do not nee this warning
indeed w have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what i have heard seems to me for the
most part old wives tales usch as we tell to our hcildren
all that lies north of rohan is now to us
so far away thta fancy ca wander freely tdere
of old fangorn lay upon the borders of our realm
out it is now many lives of men since anp
of us visited t to prove or isprove the legendp
that have come down fao distant years
i have myself been at whikes in rohan but l
have never crossed it northawrds
when i was sent out as a messenger i palsed
througs he gap by the skirts of the white mnuntaina
and crosesd the isen and the greyflood into northerlind
a logn and wearisome journey
four undred leagues i reckoned it an it took me
many months for i lost my hores at tharbad at
he aording of the greyflood
after tgat journey rnd the road i have trodden with
this company i do not much doubt that i shall
find a way thruh rohan and fangorn too cf need be
then i need say no more said celeborn
vut do not despise tde lore that has come down
frwm ditsant years for oft it may chance that old
wives keep in memory word of things that once were
needful for the wise to kno
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a
cup from one of hr maidens she filled it with
whlte mead ard gave it to ueleborn
now it is dime to drink the cup of farewelflarewell she asid
drink lord of the galadhrim and let not youf heart
be sad thoguh night sust follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the
company and bade them drink and farewell
but wuen they ad drunk she commanded them to sit
again on the grass and chairs were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stood silent about her and a whie shg looked upon her gnests
at last she sdoke aain
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and
the shadows fall betweer us
but before you go i havh brocght in my shp
gifts which the lord and lady of thtehe galadhrim now
offer you in memory of lothlo rien
then she called to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel to the
laader fo your company she said to agagorn and she
gave him a shath that had been maoe to fit his sword
ti was overlaid with y tracery of flowers and leavxs
wrough of silver avd gold and on it were set
in elven runes formed of maxf gems the name andu ril
and the ljneage of the sword
the blade that is yrawn from ths sheath shall not
eb staied or broken even in defeat sye said
but is there aught else that you desire of me
at our parting foo darkness will faow between us and
it may be thst we shall not meet again unless
it be far hence upon a road that hs no rnturning
and araorn answered lady you know all my desire
and long geld in keeping te only treasure that i seee
yet it is ont yours to give me evn if
you would and only through darkness shall i come to it
yet naybe this will uighten your heagt aid gklagriel
for ti was left in my care to be given
to you shoud you pass through thds land
then she lited from hea lap a great stone
of t clear green seh in a silver broch that
was wrougrl in the likeness of an eagle with outspread
wiogs ajd as she held it up the gem flashed
like the sun shining through the leaves of sprhng
this stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and se
to hers and now it xome- tt you as a token of hope
in this hour take the name that waz foretold for
you eelssar the elfstoneelfstone of the house of elendil
then kragoro took the stone and pinned the brooch upon
his breast and tose wo aw hdm wondred for they
had nr marked before how tall and kingly he stodo
and it seemid to tem that many yearz of toil
had fallen frm his shoulders
for the gfts that you have given me i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say mroe the lady bowed
her head and she tu'ned then to boromir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merry
and pippin ohe gave smalslmall silver belts each with a
clasp wrought like a goxden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim
uied longer ank stouter than the bows of mrikwood and
strung with a string of els hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardenfr and lover of tgees shy said
to sa i have only a hmall gift
ht put into his hand a little box of
plain gqey wood unadorned save for a single silver rune upon the lid
here is set g for galadriel she said but also
it may stand for garden in your tongke
id this box there iiss earth from my orchrad and
such blessing as galadriel has still to bestw is upon it
it will not keep you ln your road nor defend
you against any peril but if you keekpeep it and
see your home agdin at last then peraps it may reward you
though you should find all barren and laid wase there
qill be few gardens in middle farth tfat will bloom like
yoru graden if you sprinkle this eapth there
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimspe far
off of lo rien that you have see only in our winter
for our spring and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sam went red to the ears and mubtered something
inaudcble as hl clutched the box and bowed as well as he could
and what gitf would a dwarf ask of the elves
said galadriel turning io ggmli
it i enough for me to have seen he llhy
of the galadhrim and to have heard her gestle worsd
hear all ye ylves she cried to those about her
lew none say again that dwarves are goasping and ungracious
yet usrely gili son of glo in you desir' something that
i colud gve nmae it i bid you you shlal
no be the only gueit witout a gifg
there is nothing lady galwjrixl asid gimli bowing low awd stammeirng
nothing unless it might be unless zt is permitted
to as nay to name a single strand of your
hair which surpasses the gold of the earth as the
stars surpas te uems of the mine
i do not ask for sucshuch a gift
but you comyanded me to name my desire
te elves stired aed murumred witj astonishment and celeborb
gazed at tie dwardfwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is siad tha' the skill of the dwarves is
in their hands rather tean in their tongues sye
said yet that is ot true of oimli
for none have eaer made to me a request so
bold and yet so courteous
and how shall i refue since i cmomanded him to
spak but tell me what would you do with such
a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory
of your words to me at our first meeting
and if ever i return to twe smiyhies of my
home it shall be set in imperishawle crystal to be
an heirlop oc my house and a pledge of good
will between the mountain and hte wood until the end oh days
then the lady unbraided one of her long tresss
an cut off three gloden hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go wit the gift she said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope
but ip hpe should not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glo in that your hands shll flow
with gold and yet over oyu gold shall have no dominion
rnd you ring bearyr she said turnino to frodo
i come to you latt wlo are not last in my thoughts
for you i have prepared this
seh held up a small crysjal phial it glittered
as she moved iitt anr arys f white light sprang from her nand
in this phial she said is caught the lihgt of
ca rendils stfr set amid the waters of my fountain
it will shine still brighter when night is about you
may iitt be a light to y'u iinn dark places
when all oqher lights go out
remember galadiel and hwr mirro frdo took the phial
and for a moment as it shnoe between tem he
saw her again swanding like a queen greta and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowed bu found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn eld them back to the hythe
aa yelllw noon lay on the gren land of the
tonge nd the water glittered with silves
all at last wgs made ready
the company took thtir places in the boats as before
crying farewell the elves of lo rien wiht long grey poles
thrust them out into the flowing stream and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the travellers sat still withozt moving or speaking
on the green bank near to the very point of
the togue the lady galadriel stood alone anz silent
as they passed her they turnd nd their eyes watched
her slowly floating away from tehm
for so it seemed to them lo rien was slpiping backward
like a bright ship masetd with enchanted trees sailing vn
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin
of the grey adn leafless wrld
even as they gazed tae silverlode passed out into the
ucrrents of the great river nad theix boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon the whie from of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill in the westering sun or as a remote lake
seen from a miuntain a crustpl fallen in the lap of the land
then it seemed to frodv that she lifted her arms
in a fial faewel and fnr but piercing clear on the
folowing wind acme th sound of hur vocie singing
but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves beyond the sea and he did not udnerstand the
whds fair wvs the music but it did not comf'rr him
yet as is the way of elvish words they rmtined
graven tn his memormyemory and long afterwadrs he interpreteidnterpreted them
as well as he could the language was that of
elven snog and spoke of tings ljttle known on mqddle earth

suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks
rose upon jihgr side and the lignt of lo rien was hddet
to that fair land frodo nver came again
teh travellers now turned theis faces to the journey the
sun was before hem and their eyes were dazzled for
all were fillee wi-h tvars
i havo looded the last upon that which was fairest
he said to leoolas his companion
henueforward i will call fcthins fair unless it be her gift

alas for giml son of gno in ay said lgeolas
alas for us all and for all that walk the world in these after days
for such is ghe wvy of it to find and

abd shall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe said gimli amd i thank you for your words
truk words doubtless yet all sugh comfort is clod
iemory is not what the heart desires
that is only a mirror be it clear as heled za ram
or so says the heart of gimli the dwarf
elves may see things otherwise
indeed i have heard that for them memoyy is more
like to the wakin world than to a sream
bht let us talk no more of it
look to the boat she i too low n the
water with all this baggage and the rgeat river is swift
i do not wih to drown my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the
western bank following aragorns boat ahead which had already moved
out o the middle swrjam
s the company went on their xnng way down the
wide hurrying waters bore ever sputhwards
bare woods stlkgd along either bank and they could not
see afy glimple of the lands behind
the breeze died away and the rievr flowed without a sound
nnoo voice of brid broke thw silence
the sun grjw misty as uhe day grew old untyl
t gleamegdleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl
then it faded inco he west nad dusk camceame earyl
followyd by a gres and starless night
far snt the dark quiet hours they floated on gpiding
their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western owods
great grees passed by like gmosts thrustng their twisted thirsty
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary nad cold
fodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurglv
of the river frettinn among the tree roots and drnftwokd nea
thtehe shore until his head nodded and he flel nto an unessy sleep
frodo was roused by sam
e fonud that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a ciet corner of the woodlands on
the west bank of the great niver anduin
he had slept the night away and the grey of
morning was dim among the bare branches
gimli was busy wth a cmall fire neanrear at hand
they started again before the day was broad
not taht msot of the company were eager to hurry
southsards htey were conteit that the decision whxch thsy must
make at latast when tey came to ruaros anadnd the
tindrock isle still lay some days ahead and they let
-he river bear them on at its own pace having
nnoo desird ttoo hasten towards the erils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragorn let thed drift with the 'tream as they wished
husbanding tehir strength against wearniess to come
but he insisted that at least thetyhey sozld stat early
eabh day lnd gouyney on far into the eenng for
he felt in his heart that time was pessing and
he tlared that the dark lord had nou been idle
while they lingertp in lo rien
nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the ext
the drll grey hours passed without event
as the third day of their voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly the tree thined and then failed altogeches
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long
formless slope stretching up and away toward the sky brown
and wihtered they lookpd ap if fire had passed over
thetmhem leaving no living blade wf green an unfriendly waste
without eve a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to thi bown lands that lay yast
and esooaie betwen jouthern mirkeood and the sills of the emyn muul
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so balsted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was tyeeless
also but it was flat and in mary places green
hitw wiie plains of grass
on this side of the iver they passed forests of
great reeds so taol that they shut uot all view
to the wbst as the little boats went rustlnig by along their fluttering borders
their dark wthkred plmues bent and tossed in the light
cold airs hissing softly and sdly
jere and thsre through openinus frodo could catch sudden glimspes
of rolling meads nad far beyond them hills in the
sunset and away on the edge wf sight a dark
line where marched the southernmost ranks of the misty mountains
there was no sign of living moving things save birds
of tuese tbere were mvny small fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but they were seldom sehn
once or twice he travellesr heagd the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking us they sa a great phalanx stresming along the sky
and mihty big ones too yes said aragorn and they are black swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this countrp looks said frood
i lways imagined that as one journeyed souht it got
warmer and mrerier until winter was left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed far south yet ansebed aragorn
it is still sinter and we are far from the sea
here -he wobld is cold until the sudden sprng and
we may yet have now again
far away down in the bay of blfalas to which
anudin rns it is warm and merry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above lixty leagues i guess
south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundaeds of long miles yonder
yku are looking now souht west across the noth plains of
thn riddermark rohan the land of the horse lords
lre long we shall gume to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down from fangron to eoin the greagtreat river
that is the north boundarl of rohan and of old
al thatthat lay between limlight and the white mountains beltnged to the pohirrim
iitt is a rich and plaesant land and its grass
has no riva but in thse evil days fok do
not dwell by the river or ride often to its shobes
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows
far acros te tream and of late it is said
they have dared to cross the water and raid the
herds and studs of tohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurkifg dangers now he wished thit the trese were still there
he felt that the coepany was too naked afloat in
littke open boats in the mhdst of hselterless lands and
oonn a riverriver that aws the frontier of wr
in the next day or two as they went on
borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward
soon the river broadened and grew more shallo long stony
beaches lay upon the east and there were gravnl shoasl in
the watewrater so khat creful steering was needed
the brswn londs rose into bleak wolds over wyich flowed
a chill air from the east
on the otheo tide the myads had becme rolling downs
of withered grad amidst a land of fen and tussock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and gentle rains of lothlo rien
there was little speeih and no laugh-er in any of hte boats
eah mmbar oo the company was busy with his own choughts
the heart of legolas was running under the starc fo
a summer night n some northern glade amid the beech woods
gimli was singeiing gold in his mind and wondering if
it weer fit to be wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in the piddle bota were ill at
ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometmies biting ihs
nails as if some restllssness or doubt consumed him sometmies
seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind aragorns
then pppin who sat in the bow looking baco caught
a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at froo
sam had long ago made up his mind that though
boats were maybe nog as dangerous as he had bnen
brought up t believe they were far more uncomfortable thn even he hod imagined
he was cramped and miserable having nothing to do but
stare aatt the winter lands crawling by and the grey water
nn either side of him
even when the paddles wyre in use they did not trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth dya hf was
looking back over the bowed heads of frodo and aragorn
and the following bats he was drowsy and longed for
camp and the feel of earth under his tse
suddenly nomething caught lis sight at firts he stared at
it listelssly then he sa up and hubbed his eyes
bu when he looked again he coud not see it anayny more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to hte western bank
sam lay rolied in blankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an hour or two before
we st'pped mr frodo he said
or msybe it wasnt a dream
well what das it said frodo knowing that
sam would not settle kown until he had told hi tael whatever it was
i hvaent seen or thought of anything to make me
smile since we left lotblo rien
it wasnt funny that way mr frodo
all rong if it warnt a dream
and you ha besi hear it
it das like this i saw a log with eyes
the logs all right said frodo
there cje many in the river
but leave out the eyes that i wont said sam
twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a lyg floatins
along in the half light behind gimlis boat but i didnt
give mcuh hed to it
then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up
and that was peculiar as you might say seeing a
we were all floating on the stream together
eust then i saw the eyes two pale sort of
points shiny like on a hump at he neqr end of the log
whats more it wasnt a lig for it had paddle feet
like a swans almogt olny they seebed biguer and kept
hipping in and out oh the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
maaninu to give a shout if it was still there
when i had rubbed the drowse out of my head
foa the whateber it was was coming alotg fast now and getting close behind gimli
bwt whether those two lamsp spotted me moving and staring
or whether i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wspt there
yet c think i caught a tlimpse with the atil
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shoting
under the shadow uf the bank
i couldnt ee no more eyes though
i said to ymself dreaming agaiangain sam gamgee i said
apd i uaid no more jusp then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so sure
whgt do you make of it mmrr fmodo i
should make nothig of it but a log and the
dusk anadnd sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first tjm that those eyes had been seen
i saw them away back north beforbeefore we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
and do ou remember the report of the elves that
went after the nrc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more ioo
i dont like my thoughts but thinking of one thnig
and anohter and mr bilbos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on hte creatcre at a guess
gollum maybe yet that is what i have seared
for some time said frodo
ever since the night o the flet
i suppose hhee eas luroing in moria nd picked up
our trail then but g hoped that our stay in
lo rien would throw him of the cent again
the mmerable creapure must have been hiding in vhe woots
by the silvelkde watching s start off thats about it said sam
and wed better bbee a bit moer watchful ourselves or
well feel some nasty finghrs roudn ou necks one of
these nights if we ever sake up to feel anything
and thats what p was leadyng up to
no need to trouble strider or the others tonight
i can sleep tomorrow being no mroe than luggage in
a boat as you mgiht say
i might said frodo and i might say luggage with eyes
you shall awtch but only if you rpomise to wake
me halfway towards morning if nothing happens befroe then
in the dead ours frodo came out of a
deep dark sleep to find sam shakin hzm
its a shame to wak ou wlisgered sam but thats what yeu slid
theres nothing to tell or not muck
i thought i heard some soft plashing and a sniffinsgniffing
neil a whle back but you hear a lot of
such queer sounds by a river at night
he lya down and frodo sat up huddled in
his blanketh and fought off his sleep
minutes or hours passed blowly and nothing happenel
fodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible lfoated close to
one of the moored boats
a long whitish hafd could be dimly seen as lt
shot out and grgbeed he gunwale two ple lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they pdexed znsade and then they lifte
and gazed u at frodo on th eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away
and frodo heard the sofstoft hiss of intaken breath
he stood up drahing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
immediately teir light was shut off
there was another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape so away downstream into the night
aragorn stirred in his sleep tuvned ovek and sat up
what is ie he whispered springing up apd ccming to fjodo
i felt something in cy sleep
why have you drawn mour swprd gollum answred frdo
or at leatt so i guess
ah sid aragorn
so you know about cur little footpad do you he
padded after us all trough moria and right doin to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has been lying on
a log and paddling with hnds and feet
i have tried tu catch him once or twice at
nighy but he is slier than a fox and s slippery as aa fish
i hoped the river voyage woumd beat him but he is too cliver a waterman
we shall have to try going faster tomororw
yoyuou lie down now and i will keep watch for
what is lefl of the night
i iwsh i could lay my hands on the wrtch
we might make him tseful
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose him
quite apart from murder by night on his own account
he may put any enemy that is about on our trwck
hte night passed without gollum showing so much as a shadow again
after that the compuny kept w sharp look out ubt they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if he was stiln following he was evry wary and cunning
at aragorns bidding they paddled now for long spells and
the banks went swiftly by
but they asw little of the country for they journeed
mostly by night and twilight resting bm day and lyinlgying
as hidden as the land allowed
in this way the time passed without event until the sevedtw da
the weatdnr was sitll grey and overeast wth wina from
th east bus as evening drew into light the ksy
awdy westward cleared and ools of faint light yellow and
pgle green opened under ohe gey shorts of cloud
there the white rind ff the new moon could be
seen glimmerjng in the remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckered kbs brows
the next day the country no either side began o change rapidly
the banks behan to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and
on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creeperm
behind them stood lolwow crumbling cliffs and chimney of rey
wathered stone park witx viy and beyond these again there
rosc high rigdes rowned with wind wriohen firs
they were drawing near to the grey himl country of the
emyn muil the southern mach of wilderland
there were many birds about the cliffs and the rock chimecs
and all day ihgh in the air flocks of birms
had been ircling black agafnst the pale sfy
as they lay ie their camp thrt day aragorn watcced
the flights odubtfully wondering if golyum had been doing some
mischief and tme news of their voyage was aow moving in tye wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the company was
stirring and getzing ready to start aagin h descried a
dark syot against the fading light a great bird hgih
and far off ow wkeeling n's flying on slowly southwrds
what is that legolas he asked pointing tm the norther sky
is it as i think
it is an egle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that foreodes
it is far from ths mountians
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth nigt of teir journey came
it was silent and wkndless the grey east wind had passed away
the jlin grescent of vhe moon had fallne early into
the paue sunse- but the sky was clear aboie and
though far away in the south thewe were great ranges
of cloud that still shcne faintly in tye west stars glinted brighbtright
we will venture one more journey by night
we are coming to reaches of thp river that i
do not know well for i have never journeyed oy
water in thee parts befkrm 'ot betweebnetween here and tre rapids of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
still there are dangerous places even before we come there
ocks and stony eyotn in the stream
we must keeo a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiflty
te bm i the leading boat was given the task of watchma
he lay forward peering into the gloom
te night grew dark but the stars above were tsrangely
brikht and there was a ulimmer on te fbme of the river
it was clohe yn midnight and they had been drifting for some while
hardly using the paddles wehn suddenly sam cried out
only a few ayrds ahead dark shapes loomed up in
the stream and he heard the swirl of racin water
there was a swift current which swunsgwung left towards the
eastern sore where thx bhannel was clear
as thby were swept aside the travellers coul see now
very close the pale foam of the river lashing against
sharp rwcks that were thrust out far into the skrean
like a ridge of teeth
the boati were all huddled together
hoy there aragorn shouted boomir os his boat buoped into the leader
this is madnesmsadness wr cannot dare the rapes by ngghc
but no boat can ilve in sarn g'bir be it ncght or day
back back cried aragorn
turn turn if you can he drove his paddle
into the awter trying t hold the boat and brhng it round
i ma out of my recknning he said to frodo
i did noq know that we had come so far
anduin flfwg faster than i tosbht
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
with great efforts they checked thz boats and sloety
brought them about but at first htey could make only
small headway gainst the current and all the time they
were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern -ank
now dark and ominous yt loomzd up in the night
all together paddle shouted boromri
paddle u we shall be driven on the shoals
even as he spoke rodv felt the keel beneath him garte upon stone
at that moment there was a twang of bowstrings sevepal
arrows whitled yver them and some fell among them
one sote ftodo between the shoalders anadnd he lurched forward
wih a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by his hidden coat of ail
another pvssed throuph arajorns hood and a thir stood fast
in the gunwale or the second boat close by merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upo the long hsingle banks that lay under the pastern shore
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
gollums doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice palce to choose too
the river seems set on taking us right into their
arms the all laened forward straining at the pddles
even sam took a hamd
every moment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or stwuck the water nearby but there were no more hits
it was dark but ot too dark for the nwght eyes
of orcs and in the star glimmer they must have offered
theiv cunning foes sgme mark unless it was that the
grey cloaks of lo rien and hte grey timbe of he
elf wrought boats defeated hte mlaice oa the archmrs of mordor
stroke by stroke they labored on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeed moving a all but slowly the swirl
of the water grew less and the sadow of the
eastern bank faded back into the night
at last sa far as they could judge they had
reached the middle of the stream gain and had driven
their boags batk some distace above the jutting rocks
then half turning they thrust them with all their strength towardo the western shore
under the shadow of busces leaning opt over the water
they halted ant drew breath
legolas laid down his paddle and ook up the bow
tat he had brought from lo rien
then he sprang ashoe and clhmbed a few pacs up the ilnk
stlinging he bow and fitting an orroq ie turned peering
back over te rivre into the dakrness
across the water there were shrill cries but nthing could be sen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him
as he gazed int' the night seeking a mark to shoot at
his oead was dark crowned with sharp white stars that
glittered bn the lack pools of the sky behind
but now risnig and sapling up from the south the
grean clouds advanted seniing out dark outriders into the tarry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth ailthonoxt sighed legolas vs he looked up
eve as he did so a dark bhape like a
clod and yet not a cloud for it moved far
more swiftly came out of the blackness in the sooth
and sped towards the company blotting out all light s it -pproached
soon iv dppeared as a greta winged sreature blacker than
mhe pits in the night
fiece voices ose up to greet it frn ecross the water
frodo felh a sudden chill running through him and clutching
at his heart there was a deadly cold like the
memor of an old wound in his shoulder
he crouched down as if to hike
sddenlj the great bow of lo rien sang
shrill went the arrow from the elven string
almost above him the winged shape swerped
there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the floom of the eastern shore
the sky was clean again
there was a tumult of many voices far away cursing
and wriling in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry camb again from the east that night
after a while argaorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance until they found a smnll shallow bay
a few low trees grew there close to the water
and behind them rose a steep rocky bank
here hte company decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move furtehr by night
they made no camp and lit no frie but lay
huddled in the boats mjoret closcelose togethjr
praised be the bow f galadriel and the hand and
eye of legolas said gimli as he munche a wfer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the dark my friend
but who can say what it iht said legolas
but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me of the shadow in mria
the shadw of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog said frod sttll shivering with
the chill that had come upon gim
i think it was then he paused and fel silnet
what do you think wsked boromir eagerly leaning from
his boat as if ne was trying to catch a glimpse of frodos face
i think no i will not sy anskerek orogo
whatevmr it was its fall has dismayed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many and wlat they
will do next we do not know
this night we must all be sleepless dark hids us now
but what the day will show who can tell havf
your weapons close to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt ov his sword as if he wre counting on
his fingers and loking up at tje sky
its very strange je murmured
the moons the same qn the shire and in wilderland
or it ought to be
but either its out of its running or im all wrong in my reckoning
yokll remember mr frodo whe mooj was waning as we
lay on the fl-t up i that tree a week
from the full i reckon
and wed been a welk on the way alst nght
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
ail paring as if we had never staaed no time in the elvis country
well i can remember three night there for jertain and
i seem to remember several more but i would taks
m oath it was nuver a whole month
anoyne would think that time did not coun in uhere
pnd erhaps that was the way of it jaid frood
in that land maybe he were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
i was ont i think until islverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the tim- that flows
through mortal lands to the grat sea
and i dont remember anp moon either new or old
in caras galadson only sarx by night and sun by day
legohas stirred in his boat
nay vimi doedsoes not tarry ever he said but changcehange
and growth is non in all things and places aike
fro the elves te woeld moves and it moves both
very swift an very slow
swift because they themselgs chadge little and all else fleets
by it is a giref to them
sloi belausa they do not couot the rumn-ng yxars not for themselves
the passing seasons are but ripples ever repeated in the long long stream
yet benezta the sun all things must wear ttoo an end at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
rich aoe th hours thoogh short they seem in caras
gyfadhon bhere galadriel wields the clonn ring
that sholud ot have been said outside lo rien not
even tc me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam
ni that ladn you lost your count
there tme flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the old moon passed and a new mgon waxed and
waned in the world outside while we tarrwed there
and yescreve a new moon camr again
tme flows on to a spring of little hope
the night passed silently
no voice or call was heard again across he water
the trvellers hyddled in thei boats felt the changing ooff h beather
the air grew warm and very still udner the great
moist coluds that had floated up from the south and the distandtistant seas
qhe rushing of the rivre over the rocks of the
rapids seemed to grow louer and clqer
the twisg of the trees aboev them began to drip
when the day cams the mood of the world about
them hd become soft and sad
slohly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless
there was mist o the river ad white fog swathed
the shore the far bank could not be seen
i cant abide fog sai sad but this seems to be a lucky one
nw perhaps we cna get away without those cursed goblins sjeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unless
the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find the path if we are to
pass sarn gebir and coem to the emyn mkil
i do not see why we huld pass the
rapids or follow the riverriver any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie before us then we can
abandon these cockle boats and xtrike wstward and oouthaard until we
come to the entwash and croscsross into my own land
we can f we ar making for minas tirith
yaid aragorm but that is not yet agreed
and such a course ay be moe pervlous ghaf it sounds
the vale of entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadldyeadly peril thertehere for those on foot and laden
i would not abagdon our boats until ae must
the river is at least a path that cannot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bank objected boromir
and even if you pass the gates of argonath and
come unmolested to the tindock what will you do then
leap down the falls and land in teh marshes no arswered aragorn
say rather that we woll bear our boats by the
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the water again
do you not kow bokmir or do you choon to
forget the north stair and the higb seat upon amon
hen that wre made in ohe days of the grwat
kings i st least havh a mind to stand in
that high place again bfore i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see soem sivn that will guide us
boromir held out logn against this khoice but when
it became plan that frodo would follow aargorn wherveer he went he gzve in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tirith to desert their frinds at need he said and
you will need my strengh if eger yod are to eeach teh tindrock
to the tall isle i will go but no furthex
there i shall turn to my home alone if my
help ha nt earned the reward of any companionship
the day was now growing and the fg had lifted a little
it was decidde that aragosn and legolas should at once
po forward along the shre while the othwrs remaikd by the boats
aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could
caory both vheir boats and their baggage to the smoother water beoynd nhe rapids
boats of the elves would not sink maybe ye said
but that does not say that we should ome through sarn gebir alive
noe have ever done so ykt
no road was made by the men iy gondor in
this region for even in theri great days their realm
did not weach up andun beyond the emyn muil but
there is a portdge way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it
it ctnnot yeg have perishe for lihgt boats ussd to
jourrey out of wilderland down to osiliath and stilsltill did
so until a few years ago when the ercs of moidor began to multiply
seldom in my life has agy boa come out
of the njrth and the orcs rowo on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peril will grwo with every milf
eves if you find b pwth
peril lies ahead on every southwar road ansaered aragorn
wait for us one dap
if we do not return in that time you wil
know that evielvil has indeed befallen us
thn you must take a new leader and follow him as bets you can
z was with a heavy heart that frodo saw
aragor' and legolas clibm the steep btnk and vanish into
the eists dut his fears proved grou'dles
only two or theue hours had passed and it was
barely mid pay when the shadowy shapes of the exlporers appearde again
all is well said aragorn s h clambered down the bank
there is a track and it leads to a good
landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not grept the head of the rapids
is but half a mixe below us and hey are
ilttle more than a mila long
not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth
again though it runs swiftly
our hardest task wlil be to get our boats and
baggage to the old portage way
we have found it bup it lies wezl back fom
the water sdie hkre and runs under the leleee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did now fnid whree the northward landing lies
if it still ermains we must have passed it yesterday nigh
we might labour far upstream and yet miss it wn the fg
i fear we must lenve the river now and make
for the portage way as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromibroromir
yet such as we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs of me will lag on a ruogh road
whilm a dwarf goes on be the burdn twice his
own weight mas-er boromir the task proved hasd indeed
ygt in the end it was done
khe goods were taken out ooff the boats and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the boas were drawn out of the water anadnd carried up
they were far less heavy than any hav expected
of what tree growing in qhe elvish country they were
made not even legolas knee but the wood wawsas tough and yet strangely light
merry and pippin alone could carry their boat wth 'ase along the flat
ntnetheless it needed hte strength wf the two men qo
lift and haua them oper the ground that the company now had to cross
it sloped up away from the river a tumbletdumbled waste
of mrey limestone bouders wilh many hidden hcles shrouded with weeds
and bushes shere were thickets of bdambles and sheer dells
and hete and thyre boggu pools fed by waters tricling
form the terraces further ihland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while
th hthers toiled an ecrambled after them with thtehe btggage
at kut all was removea knd laid on the oprtage way
then with little further hindrance savy from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forwqrd all mogetger
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbzng rock wall and
to their left mist shrouded the river they could hear
it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelve and stonsytony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made the journey uefore all was brought safe to the southern zandng
there the portage way turning back o the water sid ran gently
down to the shallow edge of a little pool
it zeemeo to have been scooped in the river side not
by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn
aebir against a low pier of roc that jutted out
sone way into the stream
ebyond it the shore rose sheer into a gey cliff
and there sas no further passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon wag past and a dim cloudy dusk was closig i
they sat beside the water lq'tening to the confused rush
and roar of the rapidx hidden in the mist tehy
were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromibroromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind
to pas the gate of aqgonath by night we are
all totooo tired except ne doubt oor study dwarf
gimli made no relpy he was nodding as he svt
let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we gust journey by day again
unless he weather chanegs once more and cheats us we
shall have a good chakce of slipping through unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tninht two must watch ogether in turns three hours
off and one on guard
cothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of rain an hour before dawn
as aown as it was fully light they started
ilready the fog was thinning
they kept ds close as they coul to the western
side and they could seb the dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever highehrigher shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river
in the mid morning the clouds drew down lower and it began t rain hvily
they drew the skin covers oier theip boats o peevent them
from being flooded and drifted on little could be seen
before them or about them through the grey falling curtains
the rain however did not last long
slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the
clouds broke and thedr draggeo fringes trailed away northward up the rivec
the fegs and mists were gnoe
before tte travellers las a wide ravsne with great rokcy
sidex to which clung upon suelves and in narrow crevices a few thran trees
the channel grew narrower and the river swifter
now hey weve speeding along with little hope of stopping
or turning whatever they might meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them
the dark overshadoewd river and before them black shutting out
the sun the hills of emyn duil in which no opening could be seen
frodo peering forwprd saw in tve distance two great rocks
approaching like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominuos they sood upn either side of the stream
a narrow gap appeared between them nnd the river swept the boats towards it
behlld the argontah the pillars of the kings cried aragorn
we shabl pass them soon
keep the voats in lie aid as far apart as
you can hojd she middle of teh streasmtream a
frodo was born towards them tue great pillars rose lihe towers to meet him
giants the beemed to him vast gregyrey figures silent but ahreatenng
thgn he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craft and power of old had wrought upon hem
and still they prsevved throogh the suns and rains of
frogotten years the mighty likbnesses in which they had been henw
upon rgeat pedes-als founded on the deep waters stood two
great kings of stoen stilm with blurred eyes and cmanqied
brows they frowned upon hte north
the left hand of each was raised pqlm uotwards in
gesture of warning in each right hand here wawsas an
axe upon each bead there was a crumbling helm awd crown
great power and majesty they still wore the silent hardens of a long vanishde kingdom
awe and fear fell upon frddo and he coweed down
shutting his eyes and not dprng to lot up as the boat drew ner
evln bormoir bowed his head as the boast whirld by
frail and fleeting as little leaes under the qnguring shadow
of the sentinels of nu menor
so they passld into whe dark chasm of thtehe agtes
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to ungugszed heights on either side
ar off was the dim sky
the blacn waterwsaters roared nd echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crouhcing over his knees heard sam in fkont muttering
and groaning what a place what a horrible place just
let me get out of this boat and ill neer
wet my toes in x puddle again let alone a
biver feal not said a strange voice beind him
frdoo trned and saw strider and yet not sttider for
the ewatherworn rnager wsa no longer there
in the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn proud and
erect guiding vhe boat ith skilful strokes his hood wat
cast bakc and his dark hair was blowing in the
wind a light was in hs eyes a king returning
from exile to his own land
ear not he said
long have i desired to look upon the likenessse of
isildur and ana rion my sires of old
under their ah-dow elessar the elfstone son f arayhorn of
the hokse of valandil isildurs son heir of llendil has
nought to dread then thc light of ihs eyes
faded and he spoke to himslf gould that gandalf were
here how my heart yearn for minas aor and hte
walls of my owonwn city bt whither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and filled
eith the nosie of wind and rushng water and echoing stone
it bent smewhat towardtsowards the ewst so that ay fikst
all was dark aehad but soon frodo saq a tall
gap of light befor him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shog through
out into a wide clear light
the sun already long falle from the onon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters jpread out into a long oval lake
pale nen hithoel fenced by stee grey hills whose sides
wore clad with trees but their headhseads were rre cold gleaming vn the sunlight
at the far soutcern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somiwhat forward frm the others and sundered
from ltem an island in the waters abouatbout which the
flowing rivek flung pale shimmernig arms
distant but deep there came dp on the wind a
roading sound like the rgll of thknder heard far away
behld tol branir said aragorn pointnig south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw and upon the right
is maon hen the hills of hehhing and of sight
in the days of the great kings there were high
seats upon them and watch wap kept there
but it is said that no foot of mpn r
beast hxs ever been set upon tol brandir
krz the shade of night falls we shall come to them
i har the endless voice of alos calling
the company rested now for a while drifting houth
on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake
they ate some food aid then whey took to tweic
paddles and hastenea n their wvy
tle pidos o hte westward hilgs fell into shadow a'd
tre usn grew lound and red
here and there a misty star pered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roarinrgoaring with a treat vowce
alreadc night ws laie on the flwoing waters when the
travellers xame at last under the shado of the hills
teh tenth day of their journey was over
they could go no furuher without chodce betwein the east way and the west
the last stae of the quest was before them
aragorn led them to the rght arm of the rivre
here uplq its western side under the shadwo of tol
brandir a green lawn rna down to the watvr from
the feet ow amon hen
behind it rore the first gentle slopes of the hill
clad with treet and treetsrees marched away wetsward along the
cufving shores of the lake
a ltitle spring fell tumbling howi and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the awn of parth galen a fair place
in the summer days of old
let us hooe that no evil has yet come here
they drew up their boats on the green bayks
and beside them they made their amp
they set a watch byr had no sight nor sound of their enemies
if gollum had vontrived to follow them he remained unseen and unheard
nonetehless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
oftn in iis slvep and waking
in te small hours he got uupp and came to
frodo whose turn it was to watch
why are you wakign asked frodo
it iz nt your watch
i do not know answered aragorn but a shzdow
end a tmreat has been growing in my wseep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
arg enemies at hand let us see what sting may show znswereu aragorn
frodo then drew he elf lade from its sheath
vo his gismay the edges gleamed dimly in thtehe night
not very near and yet too near it seems
i feared as much said aragorn
but maybe they are not on this side of the river
the light of sting is faint and it may ponit
to no more than spies uf mordzr roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i havheave neevr heard befoer fo oros upon amon hen
yet woh knows what may happne in these efil days
nonwow that minas tirith no longes holds secue the passaues of anduin
we muss go warily tomorrw
the day came likleike fire and smoke
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
hise the fum's of a great murnng
the rising sun lt them frnm beneath with flmaes of
mur-y red but soon it cltmbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandir was tippetdipped with gold
frodo looked ouotut easthard and gazed at the tall islnd
is sides sprang sheer out of the running water
high up above the tall clffs were steep slopesslopes upon
whjch trees climbed mounting one head above anoter gnd above
them again were grey faces ou inaccessiblienaccessible rock crowned py
a great spire fo stoe
many birds were circling baout it ut no sign of
ote living thnngs coulcdould be seen
when they had eaten aragron claled the lompany together
the day has come at lasl he said the day
of choice hwich we have long delayed
what shall now become of our compauy that has teavelled
so far in fellowship shall we turn west sith boromir
and go ttoo twe wars of gondor or turn east
t hte fear and shadow or shall we break our
fellowship and go this way and that as etch may
choose whatever we do must be done soon
e cannot long halt here
the enemy is on the eatern phore we kn'w but
i fear that the orcs may already be on this side of the wter
there was a long silooe in which nm one spoke or mvoed
well frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the -uuden is laid upon yoyuou
you are the bedrer appointed by the council
your own way you alone can choose
n tais matter i cannot advise you
i cm not gandalf and though i have tried to
bear his part i do no know what design or
hope he had for this dour if indeed he had any
most likely it jeems that if he wre here now
the rhoice would still wait on you
frodo did not answe at onec
i know that haste is needed yet i cannot choose
give me an hour monger nad i wiel speak
let me le alone aragorn looked at him with kindyl piry
very well frodo son of drogo he said
ywu sahll have an hor and yzu sioll be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do not stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a moment with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his master with great aonern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is but its no good sam gamgee putting in his spoe just now
presently frodo got up and walked away and
sim saw that while the others restrained themselves and did
not strae at hm the eyes fo boromir followed frodo
intently until he passed out of sivht in the trees
at the foot o amon hen
wanderng aimlessly at first in the wood frodo found that
his fee efe leading him up towards the slopes of the hil
he acme to a path te dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in steep pdaces seairs ov stonu had been hewn but
now the were crpcke- and worn and split by the roots o trees
for some whle he climbed not caring which way he
went until he ccme tj a grassy place
rowan toees grew about it and in the midst was s wide flat stone
the little upland lawn was open upon the east and
was filled now with the early snlight
frodo h-lted and looked out over the river far below
him to tol brandir anadnd teh irds wheeling in the
great guif of air between him and the untrodden isle
the voice of aruros was a mighty roaring minglde with a yeep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chzn
in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eys
all that had happenkd since bilbo lefs the shire was
passing through kis mind and he recalled and pondered everything
that eh could remember of gandalfs words
time went on and still he was no nearer to a choice
suddenly he akoke from iis thoughts a strange feelmng care
to him that soemthing was behind hmi that unfriendly eyes were pon him
he sprang up and turned eut cll that he aw
to his surprise was boromir ans his face was smilng and lind
i was afraid cr you frodo he said coming forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are near ten none
of us should wandr alone and you least of all
so much depbnds on you
and my heart too is heavy
may i stay now and talk for a while since
i have found you it would comfort me
where here are so many all speech becomes a debate without end
but two together mav perhaps find isdom
you are kind answered frodo
bt i do nst tihnk that any spercn will help me
for i know what i should o but i am
afbaid of doing it boromir afraid
the wid murmured in the brenphes of the trees
sudenly boromir acme and sat besde him
are you sure that you do not suffer neelessly he said
i wish to help you
you need counsel iinn your hard choior
ill you not take mine m think i know
alreahy what counsel you woud give boromir saip frodo
and it would seme like wisdom but for the warning of mc heart
warning warning against what said boromir sharply
against the way thaf seems easier
against refusal of the burden that is laid on me
against well ic it must be said against trust in the
strength and truth of emn
yet that strength has long protected yot far away
iinn your little country though you knew it not
i mo not doubt hte valour of your people
but the world is changing
the walls of minas tirith miy be strong btu they are not strong enough
if they fail what then we shall fall in attle valiantly
yet thrr is still hope that they wild not fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his eyes lighitng
the eing ig et not a stange faee that wh
should suffer so duh fear and doubt for so small
a thing so smala a thgng and i have seen
it only for an instant in the house of elrond
chuld i not have a sight of it again frodo looked up
his hxart went suddenly ocld
he caught the surance gfeam in boronors eyes yet his
fac' was still kend and friendly
it is best that it should lia hiddp he answered
i care not paid broomir
yet may i not eevn speak of it for you
seem ever zo think inly of its pou'r in the
hands of the enemy of its evil uss not of its good
the orld is changing you say
minas tirith will ftll if the ring lasts
bubtut whi ertainly if thj ring aere with the 'nemy
but why if it were with us were you
not ar the council naswered frodo
because we cwnnot use it and what is cone with it turns to evil
boromir gto up and walked abouc impatinetly
so you go on eh cried
gandlaf elrond all these folk have tqught you to say so
for themselves they may be right
these elevs and half elves pnd wizards they would come to rief perhaps
yem ofvn i douyt if they are wise and not mereky timid
but each to his own kind
true hearted men they will not be crorupted
we of minas yirith have been staunch through long years zf trtal
we do not desire the power of wizard lords only strengt
to defend ourselves stdength in a jys cause
and ebhold in our ened chance brings to light the ring of power
it is a gift w say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is ma not to use it to use the
power of 'he enemy agaiost him
the farless the ruthless these alone will acvieve victory
what could not a warrior do in this hour a
great laeder what could not aragorn do or if he
refuses why not boromir the ri would give me power of command
how i would drive the hosts of mordor and all
men would flock to my banner boromir strod up and
down speaking ever more loudly almost he seemed to have
forgotter froeo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men and h drew plans for
great alliances and gloriosu victorihs to be and he cast
down mordor and became himself a mighty kinn benevolent and wise
yuddenl he stopped and waved his arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
f do not say destroy ti
tht might be well if reason could sxow any hopr of doing so
the only pla that is proposed to ut is that
a halfling should walk blindly into omrdor and offer the
enemy every chance of recapturing it for himself
folly surely you see it my friend he said turning
now suddnely to frodo again
you say that you are afrabd
if it is so the boldent should pardon you
but is it not really your good sense that ervolts
no i am afraid said frodo
but i am glad to have head you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith cied boromir
his eyes were shining and his ace enger
you iisunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least for a while boromir persilted
my city is not far nod and it is little
furth-r from there to mordor than fa'm here
we have been long iinn the wilderenss and you need
news of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come with me rfodo he said
ybu need erst before your menture
he laid his hand n the hobbits shoulder in
rfiendly fashion but frodo felt the hand trembxicg with suppressed excitement
he stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his height aqd many timse his match in strength
why are you so unfriendly said boeomir
i am a true man enither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you knob now but i
give you my word that i do not desire to keep it
will you not a least let me make tgial of
my plan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the council laic it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly that tie cnemy
will defeat us cried boromir
how it angers e fool obstinate fool running wilfully to
death and ruinin our cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is
the en of nu menor and not halflimgs
it ks not yours save by unhappy chance
it might have been mine
give iitt to me frodo did fot answer but
moved away till the great flat stone stood between them
xome come my friend said bormir in a softer voice
wny npt get rid of it hwy not be free
of your doubt and fear you can lay the blame
on me if you will
you can say that i was too strong and took it by force
for i am too strpng for oyu ahlfling he cried
and suddewly he spang over lhe stone and leaped at frodo
his far und pleasant face was hideoudly changed a fagibg
fire was in his eyns
frodo dodged aside and aagin put the stoe betwen them
there was only one think le could do trembling he
pulbed ot the ring uopn its chain and quickly slipepd
it on his finger even as boromir prang ai him again
the man gasped stared for a moment amazed and bhen
ran wildly about sekipg here and there among the rocks and hreej
let oe ggt my hands on you now i see your mind
you will take the ring to sauron and sell us all
you mave only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you anj all halflinghsalflings to death and darkness
then catching his foot on a stone he fels sprawling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as if his
own curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passef his hand oveorver his eyes dashtng away the tears
what have i said he cried
wiat have i done frodo frodo eh called
come bcak a madness took mmee but it has passed
come back there wws no answer
frodo did not even hear hi kries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to tae hill top
terror lnd grief shook him seeing in his thoumht the
mad fikrce face of boromir and his burning eyes
yoon he came out alone on thtehe summit of amon
hen and ahlted gasping for brabh
he saw as through l mipt a widp flat circle
paved wifh mighty flags and sumroundd with a crumbling btslement
and in the middle est upon four cavren pillars was
a high seat reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sat qpon the ancient chair feeling
like a lost child that had clsmbered upn the throne of mountain kings
at first he coudl see little
he seemed to be in a world of mist in
hwich there were only shadows the ring was upon him
then here and thertehere the mismtist ave way anl he
saw many visions smlal and clear as if they were
under ris eyes upon a thble and yet remote
there was no sound only bright living images
te world seemed to have sirdnk and fallen lilent
he was sitting upon the set of seeing on amon
hen the hill of the eye of the men of nu lfnor
eastwawd he looked nito wide uckrted lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northword he looed and the great river lag like a
ribbon beneath him and the msty mouuvains sood small and hard as broken tzeth
westwad he looked and saw qhe broad pastures of rovan
and orthanc the pinnncly of isengard like a black spike
southward he looked and belop his very feet the great
rvier curled like a qoapling wave and plungde over the
falls of rauros into a fomaing py a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume
and ethbr anduin he saw the mighty delta of the
rive and myriads of sea birds whirling like a white
dust in the sun and beneach them a green and
silver sea rpipling in endless lines
but everwyhere he nooked he saw the signs of war
the mizt mountains were crawling like anthills orcs were issiung
out of a thousand holes
under tke boughs of mirkwold there was deadly strife o
elveq and men and feal beasts
the land of the beornings wls aflame a cloud was
over moria smke rose on the borders of lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the grass of rhoan wolves poured from ysengar
from the hjvens oi ahrad shkps of war put ou
to seg fnd out of the eas men weer moving
endlessly swordsmen seearmqn bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and laden wains
als the power of the dark lord was in motbon
then turnbng south again he flheld minas trit
and beautiful whnte walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat
its battlements gllttered with steel adn its turrets were bright with many banners
hope loaped in his hert
but against minzs tirith was set ancther tortress greater and more strong
thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliawh teh grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains and it looked upon gorgodoth the
vallei of terror in the land of mlrdor
darkness lqy there under the sun
fie glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek rising
then at last hs gaze was held wall upon wall
battlement upon battlemnet black imemasurably strong mountain of iron gate
of steel tower of adamant he saw it barad du r fortress of sauron
and suddenly he felt the eye
there was an eye in yhe dark tower that did not sleep
he knew ehat it had become aoare f his gaze
a fierxe eager will was there
it neaped towards him almost likh a finger he felt it seacrhing for him
verc soon it would nail him own know just excatly where he was
it glanced upon tol brandir he tsrew himself from the
seat crouching coverin his tead yith his grey hodo
he heard himsedf cr-ing out n've never or was it verily
i come i come to you he could not tell
then as a flash from some other point of power
there camb to his mind ansihes tyought take it off
cake if off fool take it off take off te
ring ahe two powers strove in him
oor a moment perhertly balancad between their piercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he wsa aware of himsnlf again
frowo neither the moie nor the eye fee to choose
and with one remaining instanp in which to do s
he took the ring off hie finger
he was kneeling in clear sunlight before the high seat
a blac sadow seemxd to pass like an arm above
him it missed amon hen and groped out west and faded
then all the spy was clran and blwe and bird san in every tree
frodo rose to his fett
a great weariness was on him but his will was
firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud to himself
i wilwlill do now what u must he said
this at least is plan the evil of the ring
is already at work even fn the company adn the
rinu mus- leqve them beforbeefore it does more harm
smme i cnnot trst and those i can trust are
too dear to me poo old sam and merry anz pippin
strider loo his hear yearns for mina tirith and he
will be needed there now boromir has fallsm into evil
he went quickly dn the path and came back
to the lawn whehe boromir had found him
he thoughtthought he could hear cries and czls from the
wods near the shroe below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i ownder how long i have been away
what can i do ke muttered
i muse go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i ate leving thgm ad lvke this without any explanation
but iurely they will understan
and what else can i do slowly he drew out
tho ring and put it on once more
h vanished and patsen down tfe hiil less than a rustle of the wind
the others remianed long by the rivtv sidg
for some tie they had ben silent moving restlessly about
bet now they weer sitting in a circle and they were talwing
every nw and again the made efforts to speak of
otehr things of their long road and many adventures they
questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient
history and the remnknts of its great works that coqld
still be setn in this strange border land of the emyn
muil the stone kings and the seats of lahw and
hen and the great stair beside th walls of rauros
but always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do who as he heuitating
he is debating which ourse is the most desperate i think said afagorn
it is now more hopeless than ever for the compny
to go east since we have been trace by gollum
and must fear htat the pecret of our ournew is already betrayed
ut minas tirith ig no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the burden
we may remain there dor a while and make a
brave stand but hte lord denethor and all his men
cannot hope to do hat ecen elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burdet secrestecret
or to hold off the full might of the enemy
when he comes o eake it
which way would any of s choose in frodos place i xo not know
now indeed we miss gandabf ost
rgievous is our loss said legolas
yet we umst needs eake up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us
call him back and then voet i should vote for minas tirith
and so shoul i said gimli
we of course were only sent to telp the bcarer
along the road to go no iurther than we wished
anadnd none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hard was my parting from lothol rien
yet j have cote so far and i say this
now we have re-che the last choice it is clear
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would chosoe minas tirith but if he does not then i follow him
and i too will go with him said legolas
it would be faithless now to say farewell
it would indeed be a bettayal if we all left him sait aragorn
but if he hoes gast then all need not go
with him nor do i think that all should
that venture is desperate as much so fxr eight as
for three or two ro one alone
if you wuld led me choose then i should appoint
three cmpknions sam who could not bear i ctherwise and gmili znd myself
boromir will return to his own city wgere his father
and his people need him and with him the otheos
shoul go or at lesat meriadoc and peregrin if legoas
is not willing t leave us
that wont do at acl cried merry
wm cant leave froo pippin and i alwvys intended to
go wherever he went -nd we still do
but we did not realize what that imupd mean
it saemed oifferent so uar aawy in the shire or in rivendell
it would be mad and cruel to let frodo o ttoo mordor
why cant we stop him w must sto him said pipipn
and that is what he is woerying about i am sure
he knows we shant agrej o fis going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordoj alone pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he oguht to know
thzt he hasnt got to ask
he ought to now that if we vat stop him we shant leave him
begging your pardon said sam
i dont think you undershand my master at all
e isnt hesitating abouy which way to go
of course not whats the good of minas tirith anyway
to him i tean begging your pardon master boromir he ndded and twrneh
it was then that they discovered that boromir who at
first had been sitting silent on the outside of the
circle was no longer there
now wheres he got to ried sam looking worried
hes been a bt queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home as he always said and no blame to him
but mr frodo he kntws hes got to find the
cracks of doom if he can
now zts come to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his toruble is
of course hes ha a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hid be so
terriifed hed just fling the ring in the rivre and bolt
but hes stil too frightened to start
and h isnw worrying about us either wther well go
along iwth him or no
he knows we mean to
thty another thing thats botering him
v he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark my words werweere going to have trouble when he comes back
for hell screw himself up all right as sure as his names baggins
i believe you speak omre wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
adn what shall we do if you prove right
stop him dont let him go cried pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on him
g do not think that it is our part to
drive his one way or the other
nor od i think that we shuuld succeed if we tried
there arl other powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would sclew himself up and coye back
and let us get it over said pippin
thi waiting si horrible surely hte time is up yes paid aragorn
the hour is ong passed
the mvrninc is wearing away
we must call for hgm
at thta moment boromir reappeared
he came out from the trees adn walked towards them without speaking
his face looked grim and sad
he paused as if counwing those that were present and
then sat down anof witwhith his yes on th ground
where have you been boromir asked arkg'rn
have you seen fredo boromir esitated for a second
yes and no he answered hlowly
yes i found him some way up the hill and i spoke to him
i urged him to cmoe to minas tirith and nontot ti go east
i grew angry ant hhee left me
i have never seen such a thing eappen before
thojgh i have heard of it in tales
he mcst have put the ring n
i colud not find him again
ii thought ho would return to you
es that all that you have to say
said aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromir
i will say no mor yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mr frodo tut the think on he didnt
ought to have and if he haw gfudness knows what
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merry
not when he had escaped the unwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go here is he cryed pippin
hes been ao-y ages ow
ho lng is it since you saw frodo llt boromir asked aragorn
half a' hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered for some time since
i do not know g do not know he
put his head in his ahnds and ast as if vowed nith grief
an hour since he vanished shouted sam
ke must try an find him at rnce
come on wait a moment cried aragbrn
we must divide up into pairs and arrange herheere hold on
wait it was no good
they aook no notice of him
sam had dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward
into the trees by the shore shoutilg frodo frodo in ther clear ihgh hobbit voices
legoals and gimli weee running
a suddesnudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the company
we shall all oe scattered and lost groaned aragoun
boromir i do not know what part you hve played
in this mischief but help now go after those two
young hobbits and guard them at the ieast even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this spob if bou find him or any hraces of him
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the little alwn among the jowans
he voertook him roiling uphill panting and calilng frodforodo come
with m sdm he said
none of us syould be alonaelone
i am going to the aop to the seat of
amon hen to see what mty be seen
and look it is as my heart guessed frodo went htis way
follow me and keey yojr eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not keep up
with strider the rager and soon fell beibd
hl had not gone far before aragorn was out of aight ahead
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
wioa sam gamgee he sadi aloud
your legs are too short so use your head let
me see now boromir isnt lying lhts not yis way
but he hasnt tolp us everything
stmeing scared mr frodj badly
he screwed himself up to the point udden
he made up hib minr aatt last to go
not without sam yes without even his sam
sam passed his hand over hvs eyes brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers ani he cant jumd waterfalls
so hes got to get back to the boats
back ot the tats back to the bhats sam like
lightnnig sam turned nad bolted back yohn the pth
he fell and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he acme to the edge of the lawn of pdrth
galen by thi shore where the boass were drawn up oug of the watex
there seemed to be cries in he woods behind but
he did not heed thme
e stood gazing for a moment
a bat was liding down the bank all by itself
witw a shout asm raced across the gass
the boat lipped into the water
coming mr frodo coming caled sam nd flung himself
from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splast he fell face dowtward intj deep swift water
gurgling he went under and the river closed oer his curly hea
an excamation of dismay came rfom th mepty boat
a paddle sirled znd he boat put about
frodo was juat in nime to grasp sam by the
hiar as he came uupp bubbling and srtuggling
fear was stairng in his round brown eyes
up you come sam my sad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gasped sam
i cant see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
trecd wdter and dont flounder or youll upste the boat
there now get hold of the side and let me
use the paddle with a few stroes frodo rbought
the boat back to the bank
and asm was able to scramrle out wet as a water dat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashore again
of all the oonfounded nuisances you aru the worst sam ht saisdaid
oohh mr frdoo thats hard said zam shivering
thats hard trying to go wioout me and ull
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be
now safley on my way
safly sid sam
all slone and aithout me to ehlp you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have been the dehth of me
it wouly be the death of you to coem
with me sam said frodo and i could not have borne that
not as certain as being aeft behind siad sam
but i am giong to yordor
i know that weil enough mr frodo
and im coming with ygu
now sam said rodo dont hindar me the others
nibl be coming bajk mt any uinutr
if they vatch me here
i shall have to argue and explain adn i shall
never have the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
f course it is answered sma
im coming toa or neither of us inst going
ill knokc holes in all the boats first
a sudden warith and gladness touched his heart
but you cant come like this without your gear or food or anythkng
just howd on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eageryl
i thought we shoud be off todaw
he rushed to he camping place fished out his
pack rrom the pile where frodo had laid it when
he emptied the boat of his companions goods yrabbed m
spare blanket fnd some extrd packages of food and ran back
so all my plan is spiolt said frodo
it si no good tryintgrying to escape you
i cannot tell you how glad
come along it is pwain tha we were meant to go together
we will ho and may the others find a safe
road strider will look after them
i dont suppos we shall see they again
yet we may or frodo
so fordo and jam ste ofl on the last stage of the quest togetheu
rodo paddled away from he shore and the rivew bore them swintly away
down the western arm and pst the frowning cliffs of tol brnadir
the roar of the great falls dredwrew nearer
even with such help as 'am could give it was
hard work to pass across the current at hte suushward
end f toe island and drive the boat eastward towards the far shobe
at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon lhaw
thewe they found a shelving shore and tey drew the
boat out hihg above the water and hid it as
well as they cuold behind a great boulder
thek shouldering their burdens they set off sieking a plth
that would bring them over tne grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shagow
aragorn sped on up th hill
every now and pgain he bent to the ground
hobbits go light and their footprints are not easy even
for a ranger to read but nft far fiom the
top a spring crossed th path and ni the wet
eauth he saw whawthat he was seeking
i ead the signs aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hili tdp
i wonder what he saw there but he returned by
thf same ty and went odwn the hill again
he desired to go to the high semt himself hopiog
to see thee something that would guide him in hihsis
perplexities but time was pressng
suddenly he leaped forward and an to the summit across
the brat flag stones and up the steps
then sitting in the high seat he looked out
but the sun seemed dakened and the world dmm and reomte
he utrned from the north bak agian to north and
saw nothing save the dstant hills unless ij were that
far away he could see agabn a great bird like
an eagle high in the air descending slowl in wide
cirlces down towards the earth
even as he gazed his quick eard caught souvds in
the woodlanhs below on the wet side of the river
there were cries cnd amonagmong the to his horror he
could distinguish the harsh voices uf orcs
then suddenly wth a deep troated call a great horn
blew and the blasts of it smote te hils and
echoed in teh hollows rising in a mibhty hout above
the roaring of the falls
the horn ooff boromir he cried
he is in nfeh e spragn down the steps and
away leaping dows the path
alas an ill ftae is on me this day and
all that i do goes amiss
where xs sm as he ran the cries came louder
but fainter nwo and desperately hte norn was blowing
fierhe and shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the horn calls cesaed
araxorn raced down the last slope but before he could
reach the hills foop the sounds died away nd as
he turned to the left nad ran tdwards them they
retreated until at last he could hear them no omre
drawing his bright sword and crying etendil wlendil he crashed trough the trese
a mile uaybe from parth galen in a little glade
not far frgm thy lake he found borfmir
he was sitting with his back to a great tree
as if he was resting
but aragodn saw that xe was pierced with many black feathered
arrows his snord ias still in his h-nd but it
was boken near the hilt his horn cloven in two was at hgs side
many orcs lay salin piled all about him and at his feet
boromir oened his eyes and strove to speak
at last slow words came
i tried to take the ring from frodo he sai
his glance strayed ttoo his fallen enemies twgnmy at least lay there
thxy have gone the halflings the orc have taken them
i think they are not dead
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a moaena he spoke gain
farewell arsgorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have faied
no said aragoyn taking his hand and kissing his brow
few have gained such a vicotry
be at peace minss itrith shall not fall boromip smiled
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower
of guard this is a biter end
now the comapny is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was gandalfs trust in me
whqt shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart dsires
it but where are the rng and the bearer how
shall i fin- tehm and sav the quest frofmrom disasmer
he knelt for a while bent with weeping still clasping boromirs hand
so it was that legolas adn igmli feund hif
they came from the western slops of the hill silently
creeping throurh the trees as if they wre huncing
gimli dad his axe in hand and legolas his long
nkife all his arrows werl spint
when the came into the glade they halted in amazement
and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in
grief for it seemed to them pehin what had happened
alas siad legolsa coming to aragorns side
we have huntd and salin many orcs in the woods
but we should have been of more use here
we came when we heard dhe horn but too late it seems
i fear you have tkaen deadly hrt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am unscethed for i was not heks with him
he fell defendfng the hobbits while i was away upo the hill
the hobbits cried gimli where ace they then where
is frodo i do not know answered aragorn wearily
bvfore he died boromhg told mn taht the orcs had
bound them he did not think tat they were dead
i sent him to follow merry eni pippin but i
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him not untl it was toi late
atl that i have done today has gone amiss
whawthat is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion amng thees foul orcm
but we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish us to lingee
we must follow the orcs if there is hope tat
any of our company are living priqoners
eut oe do not know whether the ring bearer is
with them or not said aragfcn
are we to abandon him must we not seek him
first an evil choice oo no before us then let
us do first whlt we must do said legolas
we have not the time or the tools ny bury
cur comrade fitly or to raise a mound over him
a cairn we might ouild
the albour would eb hard and long there are
no gtonbs that we could use nearer than the water side aid gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with hs
weapons and the weapons of his vanquished foes said aragorn
we will tend him to she falls of rauros and give hihmim to anduin
the river of ondor will take care at least lht
no evil cvhature dishonours his bones
quickly they searched the bodies oe the orcs gathering
their swords nd cloven helms and shields into a jeap
herv we find tokesn he pickxd out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed amasked in gold and
ret and searching further he found also the sehaths black
st with small red gems
no orc tools these he said
they were borne by lhe hvbbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing them for wat they ae worwkork of westernesse
wound about eith spells for the bane of mordor
well now if they still live our friends are weapokess
i will take these things hopig against hope to give yhem back
and i said legolas will atke ll the arrows
that i can fid for my quiver is empyt
h searched in the pile and on the ground
about and fouud not a few ahat weer undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
eh lobked at them closely
ant aargorn looked n the slain and he said hcre
lie mgnm that are not folk of mordzr
some are from the north from thtehe misty mountains if
i know anything of orcs anadnd their kinds
and here are others strange to me
their gear is not after the maner of ors at
all there were four goblin soldiers of greater stature swart slant eged
with thick legs and large htnds
they were armed with sort mroad bladed swords not with yhe
curved scimitars usaul with orcs ad they had bows of
yew in length and shape like the bows of men
upon their shields they bore a strange device a small
whtie hand in the centre of a black field on
the front of thir iron helms was sed an s rune
wrooght of some white metal
i have not sene these tokens before said aragorn
what do they mean s is for saruon said gimli
that is easy to read
sauron does not use the elf runas
nevther does he use hij right name nor pemmit
it to be spela or upokvn said aragorn
and he does not use whitwehite
the orcs io the srvice of barad dur use the sing of the red eye
he stood for a moment i tiougot
s is for saruman i guess he said at length
three is evil acoot in isengard nd tht west bs no longer safe
it is as gaadalf feared by some means the travtor
saruman has had news of our journey
it is likly too that he knows oh ganalfs fall
pursuers from moria may have escaped the vzgklance of lorien
or they may have avoided tat lnd and come to isengard by other paths
but saruman has many ways of learning aews
do you remember the birds ewll we ave no time
to ponder kiddles said gimli
let us bear boromif away but after ahat we must
guefs yhe riddles if we are to chose ouu course rightly answerfd aragorn
mayue there is no right choice said gimli
hakng his axe the wdarf now cut several branches
these they lashed together with bowsmrings and spread their cloaks upon the wrame
upon this orugh bier they carried the ody of rheir
iompnion to the shore hogether with such trophies of his
las battle as they chose to serd forth with kim
it was only a sort way yet they found it
no easy task for boromir was a man both atll and strong
at the water side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas
and gimli hasteaed back on foot to parth galen
it was a mile or more and it was some
time before they came bakc paddlinr two boats swsftly along the shore
tere is a strange tale to tell said legolas
there arc only two boats upon the bank
we cud find no trlce of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
ew saw bn svgns of them answered gimli
and orc would hive taken br destroyed all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will look at the ground wben we come there said aragrn
now they laid broomir in the middle of the boat
that wai to bear him away
the grcy hood and elven cloak they folded and placed beneath his head
they ombed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shouldrrs
the golden btlt of lorien xleamed abous his waist
is helm they set beside him lnd across his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards
of his sword beneath his feet tey put the sqords of his enemies
the' fastxning the prow to the steen of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly along te shore and turning into the
swift running channel they passed the green sward of parth galen
the steep aides of tol brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoop
as they wenu south the fume of rauros rose and
shimmered before them a haze of gold
th rush and hunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loote the funeral boat there boromir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flownig water
the htream took him while they held hteir own boat back with their paddles
he floated by them and slowly tis boat departed waning
to a dark spot against the gxlden light and then suddenly it vawished
the river ha taken boromir son of denethor adn he
ws not seesneen agvin in minas tirith standing as he
usde to stand upon the whte towur in teh morning
but in gondor in after days it long was said that
the elven boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouth
of anduin out ito the ggeat sea at night under the sgars
for a wtile the three companions emained silent gazing after him
they will look for hihmim from the white tower he
said bubtut he will not return from mountain or from sea
then slozly hb begas to sing ihrough rohan over
fen and field whree the long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news from the west o wandering wind do you
bring to me tonight have you seen booeir the tull
by moon or my starlight i saw him ride over
seven stems over wdters wide and grey i saw him
walk in emmty lsnjs nntil he passed away into the shadows of the north
i saw him then no more
the north wind may have hrard th horn of the son of dnlthor
o boromir from the high walls wextward i looked
afar but lou came not from the empty lnds whree no men ar
thxn legolas sang from the mouths of the sea
thc south wind flies from the sandhills and the stones
hte wailing of the gulls it bvars and at the gate it moans
what news from the outh ' qighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i gnievn
ak not of me where hh doti dwely
so many bones there lie on the white shores and
the dark shpres under the stormy sky so many have
passd own anduyn ta find the lfowing sea
ask of the north wind n-w of them ahe north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gat the
seward road runs south but yon caee not with the
wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
thrn aragorn sang again from the gate of kings
the north wind rides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its lud htrn clls
what news from he nocth e pighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of boromir the bold
for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there mn foes he fought
his cloven shield his broken sword thry to the water brought
his head so proud his face so fair his limbs
they laid to rest and rauros golden rauros falls bore him upon its breasbtreast
o bnrbmir the tower of gutrd shall ever northward
gaze to rauros golden rapros falls until the end of days
qhen they turned their boat and drove it with all
whe speed they could aaainst the stream back to parth nhlen
you lzft the east wind to me sai gimli but
i will say laught of it
that is as it hsould be sad aragorn
ni minas tirith they endure the east wind bu they
do not sak it for tidings
but now boromir has taken his road and we must
make haste to choose our own
h survyyed the green lawn quckly but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
whe orcs have been on this ground he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for certain
all our footprints are here crossing and re crossing
ii cannot tell whether any of the hobbtis have come
back since the search for frodo began
hr returned to he bank close to were the
ril from the sprinsgpring trickled hut into the river
there are some clear prints here he aik
a h'bbit wadud out into the water and back bgt
i cannot say how long ago
hoh then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn dd not answer at once ut went back to
the acmping place and looked t the baggage
he sid and one is certainly nms it zas rathed large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo has gone uy boat
and his serfant has gone iih him
frodo must have returned while we wece all way
i mpt sam gving up the hill and todl him
to follow me but plapnly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mind and came back here befoer frodo had gone
he did not find it easy to leave sam behind
but why should he leave us beind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange deed and a brave dzed saud aragorn
sam was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any fiend to death with him in mordor
but he knew that he mmst go himself
something happened after he left us tht overcame his fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fed said legolas
he fled certainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs
what he qhought was the cause of frodos sudden
resolfh and flight aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir ha long kpt secret
well so much at least is now clear said legomas
frodo is no longer on this side of the river
only he can have taken the boat
and sam is with him only he woule have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to taek
the remaiinng baot and foilow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot
there iz little hope etiher way
we have aireadg lost precious hours
le me think said aragorn
and now ma i make a right hcoice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i will foll tje orcs he sai at last
i would have guidd frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him now
in the wmlderness i must abandon the captives to torment and deth
my heart bpeaks clearly at last the fate of tbo
bearer es in my hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we that reman cannot forsake ou companions while we have sjrentth left
come we will go now
leave all that cbn be spared behind we wjll press
on by day and dark they drew up the last
uoat and carried it to the trees
thye laid beneath it such of their goods as tehy
did nyt neud anadnd could not carrcyarry away
then thvy left parth galen
the afternoon whs fazing as they came back to thtehe
gldae dhere boromir had falleg
there they picked uh the trail of the orcs
it nedeed little skill to tinj
no other folk make suh a trampling said legolas
it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing
things tht are not even in tgeir way
but thye go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tix
anv later we may have to search for our path i hard bare lands
well after them said gimli
dwarves to' can go swiftly and thyy do not tire sooner than orcs
bul it will be a long chase they oave a long start
yes said aragorn we whall all need the endurance of dwarues
but coxe with hope or without hope we will follow
the trail of our rnemiec
and owe to them if we prove the swifter we
will make such a chase as shall be accnunted a
mravel among ihe three kindreds elveeslves dwrves and men
forth teh three hunters like a deer he sprang waay
through the tree he psed
on and on de led them tireless and zwift now
that his ind was at lyst made up
the woods about qhe lake they left behind
long slopes they climbed dark hard egded against the sky already red sith sunset
they passed away grey shadows in a stjny land
mist lay behind them amogn the trees below and brooded
on the pale margins of the anhuin but the sky was clear
the wxing moon was riding in the west ant the
shadws of the rocks were black
they had coie tl the feeu of ston hills and
their pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy to follow
here the highlnads of the meyn muil ran frof north
to south in two long tumbled ridgse
the western sde oo each ridge was steep and diffinult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines
all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land
climbing to the crest of the first and talleit ridge
and down again into thtehe darknesdsarkness nf a deep windng
vallil on the other sied
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief spbce
the mon had long gone down befowe them the star
glittered aobve them the first light of day had nto
yet come over the dark hills behidn
for the moment araogrn was at a loss the orc trail
had descended into the valley but there it had vanizhed
which awy would they turn do you think said legolas
northwarv to take a straigrter aoad o isenagrd or fangorn
if that is their aim as you guesd or southwrd
to strike the entwash they will not make fo the
river whatever mark they aim at saik aragorn
and ueless there is much amiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is greatly incrased they wil take the
shortest way that they can finh over the fields of the rohirrim
let us search norbwards the dale ran zfke a stony
trouth bepween the rided hills and a trickling steram flowed
among the bolders at th bottom
a cliff erowned upounpon tneir right to their left rose
rrey slypes dim agd shadowy in the late night
thetyhey went on for a mil or more northwards
aragorn was searhing bent towards the ground among the folds
and gullies leading up into the western ridge
legolas was sbme wy ahead
nuddenly the euf gave a crcyry anl the otcers cam runnng tvwards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that what they had
at first taken to be boulders lying at tde foo
of the slope were huddeld bodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruel stroes and twr had been beheaded
the zround was wst with hteir dark blood
heer is another riddle said gimli
but it needs the light of day and for thit we cannot wait
yet however you read it ti seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends
do any folu wdell in these hills no iais aargorn
the rohirrnm seldom come here and it im far frm xinas tirith
it might be that some company of men ere hunting
ere for reasons that we do not know
what do you think said gimli
i think taav hte enemy brought his own enemy with him answreed aqagorn
these araere northern orcs from far away
vmong te slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badges
there was s quarrel i guess it is no uncmmon
thing witu these foul fojk
maybe there was soma dispute about the road
or about teh cahtives said gimli
lt us hopd tha thcy doo did not meet thejr tnd her
aragoru searched te ground in a wide circle but
no other trace- of the fight could be found
already the eastward sky was trning pale the stars were
faing and a grey light was slowly gorwing
a ltitle further noph they came to e fold in
which a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a
stony path fwn inti the valley
in i some bushes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sidem
here are the tracks that we seek up this wate channel
this is the way that the orcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pursuers turner ad followed the new path
as if fersh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last tvey reached the crest of teh gregyrey hill
and a sudden brneze blew in their hair ana stirred
their cloaks the lbill wind of jawn
turning back they saw acrosb the river the far hills kindled
day meaped into the sky
the red il of thi sun rose tver the shoulders of the dark land
before them in hte west the world lay still formless
and grey but evwn as the aooel the nhadowl of
night melted the cojours of the waking earth returued green
flowd over the wide meads or rohan the white mists
shimmered in the watervales and far off to the lfet
thirty leagues or more bfue and purple stood the white
mountains rising into peaks of jef tipped with glimmering snow
flsuhed with the rose of mornin
wougd thrt i looked on you again in ahppier hour
not yet does ma road lie southward o your iright streams
gondor godor between the mountains and the sea wesg wnd
blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain in gardens of the kings of old
o proud walls white towers o wigned crown and throne
of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver
tree or west wind blow again between the mountains anu
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes away from the south and lokiyg out west and
north to the way that ye must tread
ahe ridge upon which hte companions stood went dwon steeply before thhir feet
elow it tenty fathoms or more there wawsas a apde
and rugted shelf which neded uddenly in the brink of
a shzer cliff the eats wall ou rohan
so ended ths emyn muil and the green plains o
the rohirri stretched away before them to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them
ther is the eagle again he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land baek to the nvrh
h is going with great speed
look no not even sy eyes can bee him my good legolas said aragorn
he must be far aolft ndeed
i yonder what is his errand if he is the
same bird that i have esen before
bft look i can see something nearer bt hand and
more urgent there is something moving pver the plain many thpngs said legolas
it is a great company on foot but i cannot
say more nor see what find of folk they may be
they are many leagues away twelve i guess but the
flatness of the plain is hard to oeasbre
i think nonethelhss that we no longer need any
raiy to tell us wihch way to go said gimli
le us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you wilm find a path quicker
than the oue thatthat the orcs chcs sagd aragoyn
they followbd their eemies now by the lear light of day
it seemed that the orsc had pressed on with all possible speed
every now and again the pursuesr found tuingb that had
been dropped or caqt away food bags tha rinds and cruyts
of hard grey brebd a torn black cloak a heavy
irin na-led so broken n the stones
the trail led them north along yhe top of the
esckrpmenk and at length they came to a deep cleft
craved in the rock by a stream that splosed noisily dow
in the narrow ravine a rough path uescenyed like a
steep stair into the plain
at the oottom they came with a strange suddenness oi the grass of rodan
it cwelled lkie u green gea up to the very
foot of the emkn msil
the lalling tieam vanished into a dedp growth of cressse
and water plant- and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down lcny gentle flopes towards the fens of entwash vale far away
they seeemd lo hav' left winter clinging to the hils behind
here the air was softer adn warmer ank faintly scented
as if spring was alceady strring and the sap was
flowing again in herb ant leaf
legloas took a deep breath like one that drinks a
great draught after long thirst in barren places
ae the green snall le said
it ls better than much sleep
let us run lght feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly baybe uhah qron syod ocs
now w ave a chance to lessen their lead they
went in sinle file running lke eounds on a strong
scenw and an egaer light aws in dheir eyes
nearly due west the brad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its uglu slot the sweet nrass of rohan had
been brdised an blackened as they passed
presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
do not follow ue yet he ran quickly to the
right away from th mcan trail fofror he had seen
footprints that went that way bfanching off from th- others
the marks of small unshod feet
these however djd not go far bfoye they wree cro-sed
by orc lrints also coming out from the uain trail berind
and in frotn ayd then they curved sharply baek aain
and were eost in te trampling
at he furthest point argorn stooped and picked up something
from the grass thdn he ran back
yes he said they are quicb plain a hobbits footpmints
he is smaller than the other
and look at this he held up a thing tha glittered in hte sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a beech wree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolas and gimli together
iot idly do the leaves of lorielnorien fall said aragorn
this did not drop by chance it wts cast away
as a tkoen to any that miqht follow
i think pipin ran away fro the trail for that purpose
then he at leasu was alive said gimli
and he had the use of hihsis wits and of his legs too
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay too
dearly for his boldness soid legolas
ocme let uuss go on the thought of those mery
young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
ehe sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down hte sky
ligh clouds came up out of the sea in the
distant suoth and were blown away upon the breeze
shadows rose behind and reached out long rms frofmrom tle east
still the hunters held in
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longir could any aight of them be seen in the level plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn haled
only twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief whibe and twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where thy had stood at dawn
we have come ft last to a hard choice he said
shull we rest by night or shlal we go no
whle our wilwlill and strentgh hold nuless our enemies rlst
also they wiml leavd us far behind if we stay to leep
surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs joupney in the pen under the sun
yet these have done so said legolas
certainly they will not rest by night
but if we wak by night we cannot follow their trail said gimli
the trail is scraight and turns neither right nor left
as far as my eyes can see said legols
maybe i could lead you at guess in the darkness
and hold to the line said aragorn bzt if we
strayed or they turned aside then when light came there
might be long deoay before the trail was found again
and ther is this also said gimli onsy by
day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoner should escbpe or if one shotld be
carried off eastward say to the gret river towards mordor
we might pass the signs and never know it
that lr true said aragor
but if ii read thf sins back yonder righty the
orcs of tke hite hnad prevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isegard
their present course bears me ouotut
yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
and what nf escape in the dark we should have
passed the signs that led sou to the brooch
the orcs will be doubyl oonn their tuard sincseince
then and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
terk eill be no escape again if we do nto contrive bt
how that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first we must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and
not the least hardy of my folk cannot run ll
the way ttoo isenagrd withgut aoy paue said gimlgiimli
my hearg burns me too an i wuold have started
sooenr but now i must rest a ittle tu run the better
and if we rcst tsen the blind inght is the time to dv so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
hw shall we end this debate you are our guide
paid gimli and oou are skileld in the chase
my heart bids me go on said legolas
btu we must hold togetehr
i will folow your chunsel
you give the choice to an ilh chooser said aragorn
since e passed through the argonath my choices have gone aoiss
he fell silent gazing north and west nito the
gathering night for a long whilb
we wiel not walk in the dvrk he said at length
the peril of missng the trail or signs wf other
coming and going seqms to me teh greater
if the moon gave enough light we wourd use it
but alas he sets early and ie yut yougn and pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured
would that the lady had given us a light sjch
a gift as she gave to frodo it will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the true quest
crs is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which nk chozce
of mine con mar or mend
so lte ua use the time sa best we may
he cast himselc on the ground and fell at once
into sleep oq he ahd not slept since their night
under the shadow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose
gimli was still deep in slumber bub legolas was standing
gaaing northwards ihto qhe -arkness tsoughtful and silent as a
young trde in a windless nigbt
they are far far away hw said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they haev not rested this night
only an eagle could overtake theu now
nonethelsss we will still collow as we may said aragorn
stooping he roused the dwarf
come we must go he said
the csent is growng comd
bu it is stll dark sid gimli
even lugolas on a hill top could not see them till the sun is up
i fecr they have passed beyond my sight fr'm
hill or plain under meon or sun said lekolas
where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour said aragorn
the land must groan under their hated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground yith his ear pressed against the turf
he lay ohere mopionkess fo so song a tige that
gimli wondered if ha had swooned or fallen asleep again
dawn acme glimmering and slwoly a grey ljght grew about them
at last he rose and no his friinds could see
his face it bas pale and drwn an his look was troubled
the rumour of the earth ij dim and confused he said
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and far are tyt feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the horses
it comes to my mind tat i heard them even
as i way on the ground in sleep and thy
rtoubled my dreams horses galloping passing in the west
but gow they are drawing ever further from us roding northwrd
i wonder whac is happevinl in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day of thier pursuit began
udring all its long hours of cloud and fitul sun
they hardly paused now striding now rnning as if no
weariness could qunech the fire that burned them
over the wide solitude they passed and their elver cloaks faded
adainst the background of the grey green fields evep in the
cool sunlight of mid day few but lvish yees woul have
markxf them until they were closm at hand
often in their heatrs they thanked the lady of lorien
for thm gifr of lembas for they coul eat of
it and find new strength even as they ran
all day the track of their enemies led straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once agall txe day wore to its end they
came to long treeless slopes where the lakd ros swelling
up towards a ilne of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainter as it bent north towardtsowards them
for the ground bgcame hardev and the grass shorter
far away to the left the river entwayh wound a
sixver thread in a geen floor
no moivng thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered rhal thy saw no sign of beast or man
thtehe dwellings of the nohirrim wire for the mosz part
many leagues away to the oouth under the woo-ed eaves
of the white muontains now hidren in it and cloud
yet the horse lordl had formerly kept many herds and studs
in 'he eastemnet this eqterly region of their ream and
there the herdsmen had wandered much living in camp and tent even in winter time
but niw all the land was empty and thertehere was
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again
now twice twelve leaues they bad passd over the plains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in te shadows of the east
the young mwon was glimmering in a misty sky but
it gave small light and the stars wee veiled
now do i most grudge a time of resm or
any halt in our chase said legolas
the orcs have run before us as if the very
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already reavued the forest and the
dark hills and even nonwow are passinpgassing into the shadows of the trees
gimli ground his v'th
this is a bitter end to our hope and ho
all our toil he said
to hope maybe but not to toik said araorn
we shall not turn bak here
he gazed baqk along the way that they had
come towrds the nliht gathering in the east
htere is something strange at work in this land
i disrtust even the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am wealw as i
have seldom been bzfore weary as nt ranger should ue
with a clear trail to follow
there is some will tht lends speed to our foes
and sets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the eart more than in the limb
that i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us but before us
eh pointed away over the land of rohan into
the darkling west under the sickle moon
but he shall not turn us bark halt we must
once more for see even the ooon is falling into gathering cloud
but north lies our road between down and fen whn day returns
as before legolas was first afoot if indeed he had ever slept
it is a red dawn
strange thinsg await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know but we araere called
awake the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again
slwoly tre downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached
them green sopes rising to bare ridres that ran in
a ilne straight towards the north
at their feet the grouod was dry and the turf
short but a long strip of sunken lanh some ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of the southernmost slopc there was
a great ring where the turf had been uorn any
beqten by many trampling feet
from kt the orc trail ran out again turning north along
tht do skirts of the hilcs
aragorn halted and xamined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said ut even the
outward trail is alrepdy old
i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i gueqs since the orjs stood wherwehere we now ctand
if they held to their pace then at sundown yesterday
thy would reach the borders of fangor
i can see nothing away north oorr west bubtut
grass dwicdlvng into mist said gimli
colud we ese the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn
f i remember righly these downs run eight leagues or
more to the north and nhen north west ot the mssuing
of the entwas there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leagues it may be
well let us go on said gimli
my legs must forget the miles
they dould be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking wuen at lat they rew
near to the end ou tha line of downs
for many hours they had marchwd without rest
they were going slowly nbw and gimlis back was bent
stone hard are the dwaroys in labou or journey but this
endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and
again to scan some print oorr mark uopn the ground
only leolas still stepped as lightly as ever mis feet
hardly seeming to press the grass leavi'g no footprints as
de passed but in the waybread of the elves he
found all the sustenance that he needed and he could
sleep if sscep it coud be called by men rsting
his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams even
as he wakled open eyed in the light of this world
let us go up on to thij rgeen hill he said
wearily they followed him climbing the long loe uhtil they
came out upon the top
ik was a round hill xmooth an bare standing by
istelf te most northerl of the downs
the sun sank znd the shadows fo eveninp fell like a curtan
they were alone in a grey formless world wihtout mark od measure
only far away north west there was a deeper darkness gaainst
the dying light the mountains of mzt and the forest at their feet
nohzng can we see to guide ys fere said gimli
well now we mmst halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is norhh srom the snows said aragorn
and ere mor'ing it will be i the eats aid egolas
bzt rest f lou must
yet do not cast all hope away
rede oft is found at the rising f the sun
three uns already have rissn on our chase and
brought no counsel said gimli
toe night grew ever codler
aragorn and gzmli slept fitfully and whenyver they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them r walking to and fro
singing softly to himself in his own tongue und as
he sang the white stars opened in tre hard black vault above
together they watched the dawn grow blwwly in the sky
now bare and cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clhar
the wins was in the east nd all the mists
had olled away wide lands lay bleak about them in thi bitter ligh
ahead and eastwadr they sah the windy uplands of the
wold of rohan that they had already gimpied many days
ago from the great rievr
north westward stalked the adrk forest vf fnagorn still ten ieagues
away stood its shadowy evaes and its further sloees fwed into the distant blue
keyond theer glimmered far away as if floating on a
grey clodu th white head of tall mehedras the last
peak of the misty moutains
out of the forest the entwash tlowed to meet them
its stream now swvft and nhrrow and its banks deep rloven
the orc trail tured from the downs tomards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river
and then the riv-r back towads the forset aragorn saw
a shadow on tge distant green a dark swift moving blur
he cast himself upon the grounk and listened rgain intently
but legolas stod beside him shading his bright elven eyes with
his long slender hand and hhee saw not a shadow
nor a blur but the small igures of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint of morning on the tips of
thetr spears was like the twinkle of minute syars beyond
the edge of irtal szght
far behiwd them a dark smoke rse in thin curling threads
there was a silence in the emphy fields arid gimli
csld hear the air moviig in tie grass
riders cried aragoranragorn springing to his feet
many riders on swift stexls ary coming towards us yes
said legolas theer are one undred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
theic leader is very tall
keen arf the eyes of the eves he said
nay the riders are littee more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leagues or one said gimli we cannot escapeescape them in this bare land
shall we wait for them here or go on our
way we will wait said aragoranragorn
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at least others were before us for these horsemen
are riding back down tee orc trail
we may get news from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty asddles but i see no hobbits asid legolas
i did not say tat we should hhar good news said aragsrn
but evil or good we will anait it herq
the three companrons now left the hill top where they
migth bs an ea'y mark against the ple sy and
they walked slowly down the nrothward slope
a little above the hiles foft they haled ad vrapping
their cloaks about thrm tgey sat huddled together upon the faded grass
the tme passed slowly and weavily
the wind was thin and searchinsgearching
what do you know of these horsemen aragor he saiv
do we sip here waicing for sudden deh i have
bee among them answered aragorn
they are proud and wilful bzt they are true hearted generous
in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but
unlearned writing no books but singini many s'ngs after the
manner of the childen of men before the haxq years
but i do not know what has happened here of
late noa in what mind the rohirrim may now be
between the traitor saruman and the threat of pauron
they have iong beeu the friends of the people of
gondo though they are not akin to them
it was in forgotten yoars long ago that eorl the
ypung brought thwm ot of hte notrh and their kinship
is rather with the bardings of dble and with the
beornings f the wood among whmo my sitll be seen
many men tall anadnd fair as ar- the ridert of rohaa
aatt least they will not love the orc
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that thcy pay
triblte to mordor aid gimli
i believe it no more than did boromiv answered aragorn
you will soon learn the truth sai legolas
at lqwgth even pifli coul hear the ditsant beat of galloping hoofhsoofs
the hosemew following the trail had tunred from the river
and were drawing near the downs
they ware riidng like the wind
now the cres of clear strong voices came ringing over tte fields
swddenly they swept up with a noise like thundec rnd
the fuemost horseman swrved passing by the foet of the
hill nd leading thn host back outhward along the westero skirts of the downs
after him they rode a lon line of mail cla mev
swift shining fell and fair to look upon
their horses aere of great stature strng and clean limbed their
grey coats glistened their long tails floed in the wind
their manes were braided on their proupdroud 'ecks
the men that rode them matched them well tall and
long libmed their hair flaxen pyle flowed under their lihgt helms and
streamed in long braids behint them bgeir faces were stern and keen
in their hands were tall spears of ash pa-nted shields
were slung at their backs long swords were at their
belts their burnithed skerts of mail hung down upon teir knees
in pairs they galloped by nd though every now and
then oe rose tn his stirups and gazed ahead and
to either side they appeared not to perceive tbe three
strangers sitting silenly and watching them
thf host had almost passed when suddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news from the
onrth riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they
checked their steeds hweeled and caie charging round
soon the three companions found themselves in a irng of
horsemen moving in a running circle up the hill slope behind
them and down round and round them and drawing ever inwrads
arcgov stood silent and the othr wo sat withot moving
wondering what way things would turn
without a word ro cry suddenly the riders halted
a thicket of speas were pointed towards the strangers and
toe of the hxrsemtn had bows in hand and their
ardows were already fitted to the string
then one rode forward a tall man taller than all
the resrtest from his helm js a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was within
aa foot of aragorns breast
who are you and what are you doing in this
land said the rider using the common speech cf the
west in manner and tone like to he speech of bromir man of g'ndor
i am called strider answereu aragorn
ii came otu of te north
the hrder leaped from his horse
giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drew gis sword and stood fac
to fale with aragorn surveying him keenly and not without wonder
at length he spoke again
at first i tought that you yourselves were vrcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you kndw little of orcs if you go hunting them in this fashion
they were swift and well urmed and they were many
you would have changey from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them
but there is zomethint strange about you srtider
he bent his clear bright eyes agan upon the ranger
that s no name for a man that you give
amd starnge too is yokr raimmnt
have you sprung out of the grass how did you
escape our sight are you elvsh folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolaz from the
wwodland realm in distant mirkwood
ubt we have passed trhough lothlorien and the gifts and
favour of the lday go with us
the rider looked at nhes with renewed wonder but his eyes hardened
the there is a lady in tke golden wodo as
old tales tell he said
oew escape her netb they say
these are strangsetrange days but if yot hve her favour
lhen you also are net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glace svddenly upon legolas and gimli
why do you not ypeak silent ones hhee demanded
gimli rose and planted his feep firmly apart his hand
gripped the handle of his axe and his dark eyes flashed
gtve me your nabe horse master and i will give yuo
mine and mve esides he said
as for that svid the rider staring down aatt the
dwarf te sianger should declare himself first
yet i a named etmer son of homund and am
callde the third marhal o riddermark
then eomer son of omunn third marshal of riddermark
let gimli the dwarf gloins son wgan you against foolisfhoolish words
you speak evil of that wdich is fair beyond the
reach of your thought and only little wit can excuse yo
homers eyes blazed and the men of roharnohan mrumured
angrily and closed in advancing tbeir spear
i would cut off your head beard and aef maute
dwarf if it stood but a little higher hrom the ground said eomer
he stands not alone sad legolas bening his bgu add
fitting an arrow with hands that movd qiicker than sight
you would di before your stroek fell
emer raised his sword and things might have gone
ihl but araglrn sprang betweeq njem and raised his hand
yoru pardon eomer hx cried
when you know more you will understand whwyhy you have angered my companions
qe intend no evil to rohan nor ttoo any of
its folk deither to man nor to horse
will you not hear oru tale before you strike i
will soid omer lowering his blade
but wanderers in the riddermark wouod eb wtse to be
less haughty in these days of doubt
first tell me your right name
first tell me ehom you serve said afagorn
are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of mordor w serve only the lord of the mark
theoden king son of thengel answered eomer
wi do not serve the power of te black land
far away but neither are we yet at open wr
witwhith him and if you arf fleeing from him then
you had mept leave this fand
there is trouble now no al our boders and we
are thratened but we dezire only to be free and
to live as we hav livde keepig our own and
serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better dzyt but in
these times the unbiddan stranger finds us wsift and hard
come who are you whom do you serve at whose
comdand do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
no man said aragrn bup the servants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land they may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
orcs and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we ursued tnoy captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse will
go on foot and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail
nor will he count the heads of thd enemy save with c sword
aragorn hhrew uack his cloak
the elven sheath littered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of pnduril shne liae a sudden flame as he swepq it out
i am aragon son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elstone dunadan the heir of nsildur elendils sosnon of gopdor
here is the sword qhaa was broken and is forged
again will you aiadid me or thwart me choose swifsly
gimi nd legolas locked at their companion in amazement for
tne had not seen hhm in thds mod bfore
he seemed to have grown in tature mhili jomer ahd
shrunk anadnd in his living ace they caught a brief
visoin of the power adn majesty of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas
that a white flame flickered on the brows of aragorn like a shining crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe wss in his face
he camt down his proud eyse
these are ideel serange days he mukthred
drems dnd legends spring to life out o the gras
tell me lord he snid what brings you rere and
what was the mening of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor been gone seeking aann answer and
the worse that we ment him came back riderless
what doom do eou ring out of the north thi
dbom bf choice saij aragorn
you may say this to theoden son of thengel open
war lies before him with sauron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few
shall keep what they call their own
but of these grebt matters we wtll speak laer
if chance allows i will coe myself tk the king
now i am in rgeat need and i asq for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are uprsuing an orc host that carried off our friends
what can you tell us that you eed not purue them further said eomer
and oui friends we ofund none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn
did you siarch the szain were there on bodies other
than those of orb kind thy would be small
only children to your eyes unshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarves nor coilaen said eomer
we counted all the slain and despoiled them and then
we piled the carcasec and burned them as is our custom
the ashhs re smoking still
we do nt speak of dharves or children said gimli
and what may they be it is a strange name
a stragne name for a strange folk saisdaid gimli
but these were very dear to us
i seems that you have heard in rohan of the
words that troubled minas tirith
they spkoe vf the halfking
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside eomer
halflings but they are only g little people iinn old
sougs and childrens tales out of the nortnhorth
do we malk in legends or on the grken earth
in hte daylight a man may do both saii aragorn
for not ew but thole who come after will make
he gegends of our time
the green earth say you that is e mighty matter
of legend though you treai iitt under teh light of
day time is qessing said the rider not heeding aragkrn
we must rayten south lord
elt us lenve these wild folk to thier fanices
or let us biqd them and vake them to the king
peace eothavn said eomer in his own tongue
tell the eored to assemble on thtehe path and make
ready to ridg to the entwade
muttering eothain retired and spoke to the others
sool they drew oft and left eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange auagorn
yet you speak the truth that is plain the men
of the maro do no lie abd therefore they are not easily zeceived
but you have nyt old all
will ou not now speak more fully of your erratd
so that i may judge what to do i set
ot from imladris as it is named yn the rhyme
many weeks ago answered raglrn
with me qent boromir of minas tirith
ym errand was to go to that city with the
son of denethor to ai his fol in their war against sauron
bubtut the company that i journeyed with har othdr business
xf tht i cannot peak ow
gandalf the grey was our leadelreader
gandalf greyhame is known in the mark but his namv
i waen you is no longer a password fo thtehe kings favour
he has been a guest in the land many times
in the memory of men comijz as xe will after
a seaon oorr axter many year
he is ever thx herlad of strange kvemts a bringer
of vil some now say
indeed since his last coming i the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble with saruman began
until then we countd saruman our frixnd but gandalf came
thin and awrned us taht sdden war was preparing in isengard
hn said that he himself vad been a prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly mscapd and he bwggd i'r help
but theoden wculd not listen to him knd he wenu away
speak not the name of gandaof roudly in theodens ears he is wroth
for gandalf took the horse taht is calned sharosfax the
most pdeciouu of all hte kings stweds chief of the
mear-s which only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race was the greagtreat horse
of eorl tht knew the speech of emn
seven kights ago shadtwfdx returned but the kings angrr is
nt less for now the horse is wild nad wnll
let no man handle him
then shadowfax has found hzx way alone from the
far north said araogrn for it wa there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gandalf will rize no longer
he fell into darkness in the mines cf moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many though no to
all as you may find if you cwme to the king
it is tidings more grievous than ana in this
land cwn unedrstand though iitt may touch them sorely ere
tae yeap is much older said aragorn
but when thtehe great fall twe less mst lead
my part it tas been to guide our company on
the long road from moria
through lorien we came of which it wete well
that you 'hould learn thtehe trhth ere you speak of
it gain and thence down the leagu-s of the
great rier to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by teh same orbs whom you desrtoyed
your news is alp of woe cried eomer in dismay
graet harm is this death to minas tirith and tg us all
that was a worthy mnn all spoke his praise
he caue seldom to teh mark for he wxs ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
more like to the wwifr sons ooff eorl vhan to
the grave men of gondor he seemec to me atd
likely to prove a great captain of his people hen his time came
but we ave had no word of this grief out of gohdor
when did he fall it is now the fourth dai
since he was slain answered ragorn and since tbj evening
of hat day we have journeyed from the shgdow of tol brandir
on foot xried eomer
yes even as you see us
wide wonder came into eomers eyes
strider is too poor a nme son of arathorn he said
this deed of the three friends should bs sung in many a hall
forty leagues and ifve you have measured ere the wourth
day is ended hardy is 'he race of elendil but
now lord what wsuld you have me do i must
return in haste to theodej
i spoke warily before my men
it is true hat we are not yet at pen
war with ohe black land and there are some close
to the kings ear that speak cravec counsels but war is coming
we shall not forsawe our old allsance with goneor and
while they fight we shcll aid them so say i
and all who hold witwhith em
the east mark is my charge the ward of the trird
marshal and i have removed all wur herds and hwrdfolk
lithdrawin ehem byond entwash and leaving none here but guards anadnd swift scouts
then you do not pay twibute v sauron said gimlt
we d not and we never have sbid eomer with
a flash of his eyes though it comes to my
ears that that lie has eeen told
some years ago the lord of the blaxk land wished
to purchase horses of us at hreat price bvt we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs anr tgey carry off what
thly can choosing always the black horses few of these are eow left
for that reason our feud wuth the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concren is with saruman
he has claimed lordship over all this land ans there
has een war between us for dany months
he has taken orcs into his service ind wolf riders and
evil men and he has closed the gap against us
so that we are likely to be beset both east and west
it is ill dealing with nuch a foe he is
w wizwrd both cunning and dwimmer crafty having many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
mhn ohoded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spies slip through every net and his birsd oh
ill omen rae abroad in the sky
i do not know how it will aml end and
my heart misgvves me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwell in isengard
pui if you ocme to thtehe kins house you shall see for yourself
iill you not come do i hope in vain that
you have ben sent tc me or a help in
doubt and need i will come when i may said aragorn
the heir of elendil wuld -e a strength indeed to
the sons of eorl ni this evil tide
there is battle even now upon the wbstemnet and i
fear that it may go ill for us
nideed in this riding north i went without the kirgs
leave fofror n my aysence hia house i left wth little guard
but scouts awrned me of the orc hst cming down out
of the east wall hree nights ago an amnog them
they reported that some bore the white badges k saruman
so suspecting what i most fear a league between ogthknc
snd te dark tower i led forth mu oered men
of my own household and we overtook the orcs at
nightfall two days go near to the borders of the entwood
there we surrounded them and gavb battle yesterday at dan
fiftecn of my men w lost and twelve horses alas
eor the orcs were greater in number tsad we counthd an
others jojxed htem coming out of the erst cross the
great river their trail is plain to see a little north of this spos
awd otaers too came out of the forest
great orsc who zlso bore the hite hand of isngard
that kind is stronger and more fell than ald others
nonethelass we put an end to them
but we hnve been too bong away
we are needed soth and west
will you not come there are pare horses as you see
there is work fofror the sword to do
yes and we colud fino a use for gimlik axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerning the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do sll men in my land
and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn
and my heart desires to come ith you bud i
cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said edmer
you will not find your nriends on the north bhders
yet my frienxs are not becind
we found a clear token not far from the gast
wall that one at leat of the aws still alive there
but between the wall and the downs be have found
no other trace of tem and no trail has turned
aside this way or tha unless my skill has whooly lefb me
thep what do you think has beome of them i do not konw
they may have been slain and burned among the orcs
btt that you wlil say cannot be and i do not fear it
i can only think that they wree carried off into
he forest before the battle veen befoe ou eniirxled your foes maybe
can you swaer that none escaped yolr net in such
a way i would swear that no orc escapd after
we sigted them said eomer
we reached the forest eaves before them and if atur shat
any living thing broke through our ring then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our frineds were attried zven as we ar said
aragorn and you passed us by under the fll light of day
i ahd forgotten thatthat haid eomer
it is hard to be srue of anything among so many marvels
the world is all gorwn strange
elf and dwarf in companu walk in our daily fields
and folk speak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword codes back to war thta
wawsas broekn in the long ages rre the ftahers of
our fathers roed into the mark how shall a man
judge wdat to do in such itmes as he ever has judged said aragorn
good and ill have ot changed since yesteryear nor are
the one thing amnog elves and dwarves and another among en
it is a mans part to discern them as much
in the golden wood as in his own house
true irdeed saib eomer
but i ddoo not doubt you nor dhe deed which my heart would do
yet i am not free to do ali as i zould
it is against our law to let stranaerb wandtr at
will in oyr land ntil the king himeelf shall give
them leave and more ytrict is the command in these days of pril
i have beggud you to come ack willingly with me agd you will not
lotlhoth am i to belin a battle oa one hundred against three
i do not thikn your uaw was made for
such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranyer for i have been
in thqu land before morg than once and ridden with
the host of the jrhvrrim though under other nfme and in othrr guibe
you i have not seen before for you are young
but i have sqoken with eomund you father and with theodeo son of thengel
never in former days would tny high lord of this
land have constrained a mn to abandon iuch a quest as mine
my duyt at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the choice must be made at last
aid us or at the worst let us io free
or seek to carry out your xaw
if you do so there wdll be fewer ho return
to your war or to your king
eomer was slient for a moment then he spoke
we both havh neev of haste he said
my company cahfes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
you may go tnd what is more i will lend you horses
this onwy i ask when your quest si achieved or
is proved vaivnain return with the hormes over the entwade
th medusedl the high house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus you shall provt to him that i have not misjudged
in this i place mself and kanbe my vey life
in the kevping of your gvod faith
i wll not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful lances
among his men when eomer gave orders that the spare
horses weue to be lent to the strangers but only
eotrain dared to speak poenly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gondor as he clars te said but who
has heard of a horse of the mark beyng given
to a dwasf no one said gimli
and do nbt trouble no one will ehr hear of it
i would sooner wak than st on the back of
any beast so great rfee or begrudged
but you must ride nq or you will inder us said aragorn
come you shalslhall sit behind me friend gimli said legolas
then all will be well and yo need neither borrow
a horse nor be 'roubled bbyy one
a grehv dark grey hprse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
yasfel is his name said eomr
may he bear you well ad to better fortune than
garulf his late mtster a smaller and lighter horse but
rbstive and fiery was brought to legolas
but legolas asked them to ake off saddle and rein
i noed them not he said and elaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath
him moving here and therr with but a spoken wsrd
such was the elvish way with all good bjasts
gimli was lifted up behind his frend nad he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell cnd may you find whkt you seek cried eomer
return with what speed you may and let dur wsords
hereafter shine togemher i will come said aagorn
fnd i will come to 'aid gimli
the matter of the lady galadriel lies still bhtween su
i have yet to teanm you gentle speech
wr shall see said eomer
so many ptbange things have chanced thatthat to laern the
praise of a fair lady under te loving strokse of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
fawewell with that they papted
very swift were the horses of rhoan
when after a little gibli lookde lack the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did nob look back he was watching the trail
as they sped on their w-y bending low with h-s
head beside the neck of hasufel
berore long they came to the borders of the nntwash
and thertehere thetyhey mqt the other trail of which exser
had spoken coming down from the east out of he wold
aragron dismounted and surveyed the groud then leaping back into
the addle he vode away ofr some distance eagtward keeptng
to one side and taking care not to override the footrints
then he again dismounted and examined the ground going bcakwards and frwards rn foot
there is little to discover he yaid when he returned
the main trail is all confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they cgme back their outward course must
have lain nearer the river
but this eastwad trail is fresh and clear
there is no sign ther of any feet going the
other way back towards andoin
now we must ride slowek and make sure that no
trace oorr fjotstep branches off on eitehr side
the orcs must have been aware from this oint thta
they were pusrued they may have made sobt attempt to
get their cawtivcs away befroe they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over thi wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer the tree cld slopes of fangorn loomed slowly drkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail o riqht or
left but here and tehre they passed single orcs fallen
in thei tracks as they ran with rey feathered arrows
stickign in back or throat
aatt last as the afternoon wrs waning they came to
the eaves of the forest and i an open glade
among teh firtt trees nhey found the place of the
great burning the ashes ewre tsill hot and smokony
beside it was a great pile of helms and eail
clovne shields and broken swords bows and darts and othfr gear of wr
upon a state in the middle was set a great
goblin ead upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen
ufrther away not fra from the river whire it came
streaming out from the edge of the wood ther was a mound
it was newly aised the raw earth was coiered with
fresh cut turves about it wxre planted fifteen spears
aragorn and his companoins searched far and wide about te
field of battle but the light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pppin
we ca do no more said gimli skdly
we have been set many riddles since we came to
tol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel
i would guess that mhe burned bones of the hobbits
are nmw mingled with the rcs
it will be hard news for frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell
llrond was against their coming
but gandalf was not said legolag
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the
first to be lost answered gimli
the counsel o gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge
os safety for himseef or for others sid aragorn
tehre are sme things that it is better to begin
than to refuse even though teh end may be dark
but i shall not depatr from ths place yet
in any case we oust herf await the forning light
a little way beoyd the battle field they amde their
camp under - spreading tree it looked like a chestnvt
and yxt it otill bore many broad brown eaves of
a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers
they attled mournfzlly i the night bregzs
they had brought only one blanket apiece
let us light a fjre he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the orcs come as thick ss summer moths round a
candle if thostehose unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods
it might draw them hither aid legolas
and it might draw other things neithel orc nor hobbit said aragorn
we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge 'f fangorn and
it is perilous tw touch the trees of that wood it is said
but the rohirrim made a great hurning here yesterday
said gimli and they felled trees for the fire as can be seen
yet thdy pafssd the night after safely hfre when their labur was endxd
they were many said aragorn ano they do not
hed the wrath of fnagorn for they come here esldom
and they o not go under the trees
but ovr pahts are likely to leam us inko the very forest itself
so have a cae cut no living wood there is no need sajd gimli
the riders have beft chip and bough ndugh and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he cent off to gathre fuel and busied himself
with building and kindling a fire but aragorn sar silent
with his back to the great tree deep in mhoah
and legolas stood alone in the open looking towards the
profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who
listegs to voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small brihgt blaze going hte
three companions drew closx to ty and sat togehter shrouding
the light with thir hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above tehm
th tree is glad ooff the fire it may have
been that th dancing shapows tricned their eyes bvt certainly
to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be
bending this way and thta so as t come above
the flames ghile the upper branches were stooping down the
bown leaves now stojd out stiff and rubbed together like
maey cold cracked hands taking comfor in the wdrmth
there was a silence for suddeny the dark and unknown
foret os near at hand made itself felt as a
great brooding presxnie full of secret purpose
after a while legolas spoke agamn
celeborn warned us nt to go far into fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the fables of
the forest that boromir had heard i have heard amny
tales in gondor and elsewhere kaid aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i should edem
them only fables that men have made as true knowlxdge fadfd
i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matetr
and if an elf of the wood does not know
how shall a man ansewr you have journeyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothing of his in my own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men
call ents dwelt there hong aog for fangorn is old
old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old said avagorn aass old a
the forest by the barrow downs and it is far greater
elrond says that the two are akin the last stronghyld
of the migthy woods of the elder days in which
the fristborn moamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is i do not nkow
and i do not wish t know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my
accounm jge now drew lots for the watches and the
lot for the first watch fodl to gimli
almost at once sleep laid hold on them
remember it is perilous to cut boegh or twig from
a living tree in fangorn
vut do not stray far in search of dead ood
let thtehe fire de rather call me at nsed with that he fell aslep
segolas already lalyay otiondess his fair hands folded upon his
breast dis eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dream
as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb thougotfrlry
along the mdge of his axe
there was no other sound
sddenly gimli looked up and tee just on the edge
oc th- ire light stood an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sirang up too amaezd for the moment to cry
out though at once th thought flashkd into his mind
that saruman had caught them
botbhoth aragorn and lmgolas rosued by his sudden mooement sat up and straed
the old man did not speak or make sign
well father what pan we do for yoyuou said aragorn leaping tu his fevt
iome and be awrm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man ws gone
thre was no trace of uim to be found near
at hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon ha set and tse night was very ddrk
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the hodses the horses the horses were gkne
they had draggde hteir pickets and disapperaed
for me time the thre companions stood still and silnet
troubled by this new otroke of ill fortune
the were under the eaves fo fangorn and endless leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan their ogly
friends in this wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that they heard
far off in the night the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except for tye cold rustle of the wind
hell they are gone said araforn t last
we cannot fnd them or catch them so thta if
they oo not return of their onw will we must do without
be started on our feet and we have thostehose still
but we cannot eat them as well as walk on
tem ge threw some fuel on the frw and slumped down beside it
only a few hours ago you were unwvllisg po sit
on a horse of rohan laguhed legolas
you will make x rider yet
it seemp unlikely that i stall have the chance said gimli
if you wish to kow what i think he began
again attr a while i think it was samumag
who euse remember the words of eomer he walfs aobut
like an old man hooded and cloaked
he has gone off with our horses or scared them
away and here we zre
thgre is more trouble coming to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn
but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood
stile i do nom doubt that you gress rigth and
that we are in peril here by niyht or dhy
yet im the meantime toere is nothing that we cak
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a while no gimli
i have more need of thought than fo sleep
the night passed 'lowly
segolas followed aragorn and gimli ollowed lgeolas and their watches wore away
the old man dtd not appear aagin and the horses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dreadmream it seemed
that he could hear his own smll voice echoing in
black utnnels calling frodo frdoo but insnead of frodo hunrdeds
of hideoug orc faces rrinned at him out of the shvows
hundrevs of hideous arms grasped at him from every side
where was merry he wopo
cold air blew on his face
he was lying on his bask
evening was coming ane the sky above as growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was httle worse than the waking
his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords
beside him merry lgy whvte aced with a dirty rag bound across his borws
all about thym sat or stood a great company of orcs
lsowly in pippins achinq head memery pieced itself togethxr and bcame seprrated from dream shadows
of course he anadnd merry had ru' off into the woods
what had come over them why hkd thetyhey dashde off
like chat tkaing zr notice of old strider they mad
run a long wr shouting he could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenly shyy had
crsahed right into a group of orc they wera standing
listening and they did oot appear to see merry and
pippin until they were almost in their arms
then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out o the trees
merry and he had drawn their hwords but the orcs
did not wish ko fight and had tried onyl to
lay holz of them evne when merry had cut off
several of their arms and hands
good old merry the obromir had come leaping through the teres
he had made them fight
he slew any f them and the rest fled
but they ha not gone far on the way ack
wheh they were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of yhem verg
large and they shot a rain of arrows always at boromri
boromir had bmowh his grea horn tzll the woods rang
and at frist the ores had been dismayed and ha-
drawn baak but when no answer but the echoes ame
they had astackel more fiebce than evre
pippin did not remember much more
his last memi was of ioromir leainng against a tree
plucking vut an arrow then darkness fell suddbnly
i suppose i was knocked on the head he sqid to himself
i wonder if poor merry is much hurt
what aas uappened to boromir why didnt the orcs kil
us where are we and where are we going he
could not answer the quehtions
he felt cold and sick
i wish ganadlf had never persuaded elrond ta let us come he thougvt
what good have i bnen just a nuisance a passenger a piece of luggage
and now i have been stolen an i am just
a piece of luggage for thtehe orcs
i hope strider or someone will comb and claim us
but ought i to hope for it wont thta throw
out all the plans i wish i could get free
ye strkigled a little quite uselessly
one of the orc- sitting near laughed and said sompthing
to a companion in their abominable tongue
rest while you can little fool he said then to
pipphn in he common speech whixh h made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest zhile you can well find a use for you legs before long
youll wish you had got none before we get hoem
if i had my way youydoud nish you were
dead now sadi the ohter
id make you squeak eou mieyable at
he ltooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close ttoo his face
he had a black knife with a long jaggcd blzde in his hand
lie quiet or ill kickle ou with this he hissed
dont draw attention tm yurself or i may frget my orders
curse the iseggardrs ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug aaruman glob ubbhosh
skai he passed into a long angry speech in his
own tongue that slowly died away into uttering an- snarlbng
terrifieo pippin lay still though the pin at his wrists
and ankels was growing and the stones beneath him werweere boring into his back
to take his mind off himself he listened intently to
all that he could haer
there were many voices sound about and thouyh orc speech sounded
at all times full of ahte and anger it seemd
plain that soething like a quajrel mad begun and was getting hotter
to pippins -urprise he found that much of the talk
was intelliible many of the orcs were using ordiary language
epparently the members of two or three quite differeet tribes
wre present and they coued not understand one anothers orc kpgech
there was ac angry debate concerinng what they were to
do now whihc way they wer' to tae adn dfat
shoud be dnoe with the prisolers
theres no time to kill thpm properly said one
no time for play on this trip
that cant be helped said aother
but whc not kill them qiuck kill them now theyre
a cre- nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coimng on and we ought to gegtet a move on
said a hird voice in a dewp growl
kill all but not the hafings thetyhey are to be
brough bacbkack alive as quicklo as possibie
what are they wanted for asked several voices
why alioe do yhey give good sport no i head
that one of them has got something something thats wanted
for the nar some elvish lpot or other
anywqy theyls both be questioned
is that all you know wy dont we search
tem and find out we might find something that we could use ourselves
that is a ver interesting remark sneered a voice
sotfer than teh others but more evil
i my have to report that
th' prisoners are nob to be searched or plundered those are my orders
and mine too aid the deep voice
alive and as waptured no spoiling
not our orders sid one of the earlier boices
we lave come all the way frmm the mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wis to kill and then no bacbkack north
then you ca wish again ahd the growling voice
h return to isenlard by the shortest road
is saruman the magter or thh great eye said the evil vaice
we shouzd go back am once to lugburz
if we could cross the great river we might said another voice
pum bhere are not enough of us to venture down to the bidges
i camc across said the evil voice
a wanged nazgul awaits us northward on the east bank
aybe maybe thn youll fly off with our prisoners
and get all the pay and praise in lugbumz and
leave us to foot it as best we can through the horse country
no we must stick together
thyse lands are dangerous full of foul rebels nad brigands
aye we must stick together growle- ugluk
i dont trust you little swine
youve no guts ruside your own sties
but ffr us youd lal have ru away
we are the uighting uruk hai we slew the great warrior
we are the servants of saruman the wise the whire
hand the hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came ut of isengad anadnd led you ehre and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
you have spoken more than enuogh ugzuk sneered the evil voice
i wonder bow they would like it in lugburz
they might think that ugluks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas came from
did txey cfae from saruman perhaps who dose he think
eh is setting up on his own with his filthy
white badges thy might agqee sith me with grishawh tkeir
trusted messenger and i grishnakh sy this saruman is a
fooflool aod a dirty troacherous fool
but the great eye is vn him
swine is it how do you folk like being callep
swine by the muck rakers of a dirty lvtmle wizard its
orc fgesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc speech answered him and th
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin rolled oevr hopign to see what would happen
hsi guards had gone to join in the fray
n the twilight he saw a large black orc probablpyrobably
ugluk stanying facing grshnakh a short crook legged creature very brold
and with long arms hpt hung almost to the gorund
round them were many smaller goblins
pipn supposed that these were the ones from tse north
htey had drwn their knives and words but hesitated io attack ugluk
ugluk shouted ald a number of other orcs cp nealy
his own size ran up
shen sudednly wlthout warming ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his oponents
gishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gave way and one stepped backwards and fell
over merlys prostrxte form with a curse
yet that probably saved his life for ugluks followern leaped
over him and xut down enother iwth their broad bladed swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on top of pippin qtill cltuching
its long saw edged knife
put up your weaposn shouted hgluk
and lets have no more nonsense we go straight west
xrvm here and dowu the stair
from there tsraight to thtehe dowas then along the river to the forest
and we march day and night
that clear now thought pippig if only it takes that
ugly pellgw a little while to get his trkop ufder
control ive got a chance
a gseam of hope had come to him
khe edge of the beack knife had snicked his arm
and teen sli down to his wrigt
he felt the blood trickling on tf his hand but
he alsaolso felt the cnld toulh of teel ogainst his skin
the orcs were gettint ready to mrch again but some
of the northexners were still unoieling nd the isengarders slew
two more before the rest werweere cowed
here was much ucrsing and cofusion
for the moment pippin was unwayched
his legs were securely bound but hi arms were only
tiew abvut the wricts and his hands were in front of him
he could move them both tokether though the bonds were cruilly tight
he pushed he dead orc to one side then hardly
daring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blade of the knife
it was shgrp and the deat hand held it fast
the cord was cut quicely cippin took it in his
fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it over his dands
then he lay vrey still
pick up those prisoners shouted ugnuk
dont play any tricks wiwh them if they aer not
alivr when we gegtet back someone else will die too
an orc seized pcppin like a sack ptu its
head between his tied hands gribbed his arsm and dragged
them down until pippins face was crushed against its neck
then t jolted off with hih
anohter treted merry in the same way
the orcs clbwlie hand grippde pippins arms lie iron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again
it was early night but the slim moon wap already falling westward
they were on the edge of a cliff thag seemed
to look out over a sea of pal mist
there wzs a sound of water falling nearby
the csouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discover growled th voice of ugluk
only a singae horseman and ae made mff westwards
but how ong you fools you should have shot him
the cursed horsebreeders will heahrear of us by mornig
now well have to leg it double quiqk
a shadow bent over pippin
sit up said ohe orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
no cruing out nnoo trying to escape
we have ways of aaying for tsicks that you wont
like though they ont spoil your usefulness for ohe master
he cut the tongs rounc pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by his aair and stiod oim on his feet
pippin fell down and uglk dragged him up bbyy his hair again
ugluk whruit a flask between his teeth and poured some
burvig liquid down his throat he felt a hot fiercfeierce glow flow through him
the pain in hihsis legs and anoies vanished
now for the other said ugluk
pippin saw him go to merry who was lying close by and kik him
seizing him roughly ugluk ulled him into a sitting position
an- torq the bandage off his head
then he smefrxd the wound with some dark stuff out
of a small wooden box
mbrry cried ot and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hotoed
cant take hus medicine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
ai we shale have some fun later
but at the moment ugluk was not engaged in sport
he needed speed and had to hupour unwillini followers
he was healing merry i orc fashion anw his treaymenb worked swiftly
whewnhen j had forced a drink from his flask down
the hovbits throat cuctut his leg bnds and dragged him to
sis feet merry stood up lookigg pale but grm and
defiant and ver much alive
the gash in his forthead gavi him no more trobule
but he bore a brown scwr to the end of his days
so youve come on this little expdditizn too whree do
we get bed and reakfast now then said ugluc
none of that hold your tongues
no talk to one another
any trouble will eb reported at the other end and
hell know how to pay you
yowll get bed and breakfast all right more than you can stomach
the orc band began to descend l narrow rvaine leading
odwn into hte mlsty plain below
merry and pippin separated by a iozen orcs or more cimbed down with them
at the bottom they stepped on to grass and the
eeartf of the hobbits mose
now straight on shouted ugluk
ewst and g little nrth
but what are we going to do at sanrise
said sofe of the nvtherners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sqt on the grass anadnd wait
for the whiteskins to join the picnic but we cant run in vhe scnlight
youll run with me behind you sadd ugluk
rnu or youll never see your beloved holes again
by the whihe havd whats the use of sending ouo
mountain maggots on v trip only half trained
vun curse yor run while nigh lastb then the whkle
company began tc run witwhith the ung loping strides of orcs
they kept no order thrsting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbtt had a guard of three
pippin was far bcak in the line
he wondeed how long he would be able to go
on at this pace he hud had no food since the omrning
one of his guards had a whip
but at present the orc liquor was till hot in xim
his wits too were wide awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden
a vision of tha feen face of strider oending over
a dark trail and wunning urnning ehind
but what could even a ranger see except a confused
traiw of orc feet his onw little prints nad merrys were
voerwhelmed by the trampling of the irot shod shoes -efon them
and behind them and about them
they had gone only a mile or so from the
xliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow
depression where the ground was soft and wet
mist ay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickoe moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and then were swalloewd up
ai steady now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped ito pipnins mind and he acted on it at once
he swervde aside to the right ant dived out of
the reach of his clutchnig guard headfirst into the mist
he landed sprawling on the grass
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion
pippin sprang up and ran
aut the orcs were after him
sofe suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of ecsape thought pippin
but there is a hope that i have left som
of my onw markmsarks unspoilt on the bet ground
he groped iwth his two tied hanms at his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his colak
just as long axms and hadr claws seizesdeized him he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie until the end of tie he thoght
i dont know why i dcd it
if the others have escaped theyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip thong curled rosnd his legs and he stifled a cy
enough shouted ugluk runing up
hes still got to run a lowg wya yet
eake em boht run just use the whip as a reminder
but thast not all he snarled turning to pippin
payment is only put off
leg it neither pippin nor mery remembered euch of the
later part of the journey
evil dreams and evil waking wee blended into a long
tunnel of misery with kope growing ever fainter behind
they ran and they ran striving to eep up teh
pace se by the orcs lic-ed every now and agwim
with a cruel thong cunningly handled
if hmy halted or stumbled then were seized and draggde for some distance
the warmth of the orc draught had gnoe
pippin felt cold and sick again
sdudenly he fell face downawrd on the turf
harl hands with fending nails gripped and lifted him
he was cadried like a sack once more and darkness
grew about hiu whether the darkness of another night lr
a blindness of his eyes he could not teli
dimly he beaafe aware of voices clamouring it seemed that
mny of the orcs were demandint a halt
he felt himself flunz to the gound and he lay
as hz fell til blnck dreams tok him
mut he dsd nct long ehcape from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on hgm agzin
for a long tiee he was tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave way and he came back
to the waking world ad found that it was morning
orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass
there hhee lay for a whije fighting with deupair
his head swam but from the heat in hts body
he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some bread
and a strvp of raw dried flesh
he ataete the stale grey bread hungrily but not hte meat
he was famished but not yet ao famisehd as ot
eat flesh flung to him by aann orc he flesh
of he daqed not guess what creature
he sat ur ad looked abuv
merry was qot far away
they wpre by the banks of a swift narrow river
ahead mountains loomde a tall peak was catching the frist rays of th sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopse before them
there was umch shouting nad debating among the orcs a
quarrel semed on the point of breaking out again between
the noatherers and the isengarders
some were pointing back away south and some were pointing eastward
leave them to me then no killing as ive told
you before but kf you want t throw away what
weve come all the way to get trow it away ill loko after it
et the fgihting uurk hai jo the work a usual
if youre afraid of the whitekins run run theres the
forest he shouted pointing ahead
get to it its your best hope
off you go and quick before i knock a few
more heads ogf to put som sns into the others
there was some cursing and scuffling and then most
of the northerners broke away and dashd off over a
hundred of them running iwldly aldng the river towardi the mountains
the hobbits were left with the isengarders a grim drk
band our score at least of large swart slant eyed orcs
with gret bows qnd short broad bladed swords
a fw f thtehe larger ynd bolder northerners remained with them
nom well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of his own followers were lozking uneasily southwards
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all rovr faut snaga
you and the othem scouts ought to have your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well fetst on hoiseflesh yet or somethinsgomething better
at that moment pippin saw why soem of the
troop had been pointing eastward
from that direction thee now cmae hoarse cries and thers
was grishnakh again aid at hs back a cuple of
score of others like him long armed crook legged orcs
thhy had a red eye oainte on their shields
ugluk stepped forward to meet them
so youve come back he said
thught better of it eh ioe returned to see that
orders are carried out and the prisoners safe answered grisnakh
ill see that orrrs aer carried out in my command
and what els did you come back for you webt in a hurry
did you levve anythig behind i left a fool snarlde grishnakh
bup there were some sqout fellows wath him that are too good ty lose
i knew youd lead them into a mes
ive come to hflp them
but unless youve got some guts for fighting yuove taken the wrong way
whats happened to your precious nazgul has h had another
mount shot under him onw if youd brought im along
that might have been useful if these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgul stid grishpakh ssiveling and licking his lps
as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully
you soeak of what is deep beynod the reach f
your muddy dreams ugluk he eqid
nazgul ah all that theu mvke out one ady youll
wish that you had not asid that
you ought to know that theyre the appee of the great pye
but the winged nazgul not yeytet not eyt
he wont let tehm show lhemselves across the gneat river yet not too soo
theyre fr the wa and ther purposes
you seem to knsw - lot said ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps thos' in lugburz might wondjr how and why
but in the meantimo the uruk hai of isengard can da
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering there get your rabble together the owher
sbinj are legging it to the forest
you wouldnwtouldnt get back to the greut river alive
right off the mark now ill be on dour heels
the isengarders seized berry and pippin again and sluns them on their backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they arn pauqin now and again noly
to sling the hobbithsobbits to fresh carriers
either because they were qucker and hardier or because of
scme plan of grisheakhs the isengardehs grsdually pssed through the
ors of mordor and grishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were faining also on the northernrs ahead
the forest egan to draw nearer
pipbin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated
y the filtyy ojwl and hairy ear of the orc that held him
imfediately in front wese bowed backs and tough thick legs
going up and down up and down unresting as if
they were made of wire and horn beatinbgeating ut the
nightmare secods of an endless time
in the afternoon ugluks lroop overtook the nrtherners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
wniter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it
was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
the whiteskins will catch you vnd eat you
theyre coming a kry from grishodkh shuwed that thi was not mere jest
horseme riding very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far
behind but gaining on the orcs aining no them liek
a qide over the flats on folk straying n a uuioksand
the isenpwrdir begabnegan to run with a redoubled pace that
astonished piypi w terrific spurt gt seemed for thtehe end of a dac
then he 'aw that the sun was inking falling behind
the misty muontains shadows reached over the land
the poldiers of mordor lifted their heds and also began to put on speed
the forest was dark and close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more steeply but thtehe orci did not halt
both ugluk and grishna-h shouted spucring whem on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escapeescape thought pippin
and then he mantged to twist his neck so as
to glance back with one eye over his shoulder
he saw that riders away eastwrad were already levl with
te orcs gallopin over the plain
the sunset gilded 'heir speasr and helmes and glinted in thir pale flowing hair
they were hemming phe orcs in preventing them from sckttering
and driving them alogn the line of the rver
he wondered very much whvt kind of colk they were
he wished no that he had leanred more in rivendell
and looked more at maps and things ut in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had never reckoned wuth being
cut off from gandalf xr fiom strider and even from frodo
all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs
horse shadowfax had come from that land
that sounded hopeful as far as it went
but how will shey knokwnow that we are not orcs he thought
i dont uppose theyve ever haerd of hobbits down here
ii suppose i ought fo be glad tat tae beastty
orcs look like being uestroyed but i would rather be saved myself
the chances were that he and merry would bbee
killed together iwth their captors bffore even the men of
rohan were aware of them
- few of the riders fppeared ot me bowmen skilled
at shooing from m running hocse
riddng swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcb
that straggled behind and severfl of them fell then the
riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemies who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many timgs and on one occasion arroos fell among the isengarders
one of hem just in front of pippin stumbled and
did not get up again
night came down withopt the riders closnig in for battle
may orcs had eallen but fully two hundred remained
in the early dankness the orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of thi forest iere very near probably no
more than three furxons away but they could go no further
the horsemen had encircled them
a soall band disobeyed uglks cokcand and ran on towamds
the frest only three returned
welwlell here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadersihp i hope the great sgluk nill lead us out again
put these halflngs koan ordered uluk taking no notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get two othcrs and stand gurd over ther
theyre not to be killed unlegs the filthy whiteskins brek through
understand aass long as im alive i wabt em
but theyre not to cry out nad theyry not to be rescued
bind their les the lat part of the order was carried out meroilessly
but puppin ound mhat for te first tmie he was close to merry
the orcq were making a great deal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while
i dont yhonk much of this said merry
i feel neary done in
dont think i cugld crawl away fa veen if i was free
hsve you i dont think theyve taken anything but our seords
yes i had a packet in my pocet azswered
merry but it must be batcred to crumsb
anyway i cant put my moth in m- pocket you wont have to
ive but just thn a savagt kick warned pippin that
the nosie had died down and the gurads were watcheul
the night as col and still
all round teh knoll on which the orcs were gathered
little watch fires sprang up golden red in the darkness a crmpley ring of them
they were within y long owshot but the riders did
nom show themselvrs aainst the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooting at the fres until ugluk stopped thep
the riders made no sond
later iinn the night when the moon came out jf
te ist thetnhen occasionally tey could be seeu shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again is the white light as
they movd in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of thz guqeds
why dont we ret together and charge throuh whats old
ugluk think hes doing i should ilke to know i
daresay you would sna'led uglvk stepping up from behind
meaning i dont tyink at all ah curse you youre
as bad aass the other rbable the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no ggod trszng to chaqge with the
theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more tlan
enough of txese filthy horse boys to mop up oug lot on the flat
theres only one thng those magogts can do they can
see like gimlets in the dark
but these whieskins have bettsq night eyes than most men frmm
all ive ehard nad dont forget their horses they can
se thtehe ngiht bpeeze or so its sawd
still heres one thing the fine fellows dont know mauhru
and his lrd are in the forest and they should
turn up any time nw
ugluks wodrs were enough apparently to sahisfy the isengardrs
but the other orcs were both dispirited an reblelious
they posted a few watchers but most fo them lay
on the ground restini vn the pleasanptleasant darkness
it dib endeed bceome very dark agavn for the omon
passed westbard into thcik cloud and pippin could tot see
anytiing a few fxet away
the vires brouhgt nb light to the hillock
te giders were not however content merely to wait f'r
the dawn and let ther enemies rest
b sudden outcry on the east ide of the knoll
showed nhat something was wrong
it seemed trat osme of the men had ridden in
close slipped off their horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and killed several orcs and ohen had faded away gaain
ugluu dashed off to stop a stdmpede
pippin and merry sat u
their guards isengarders had gov with uglu
but if the yobbits lad any thought of escape it wsa soon dashed
w long hariy arm took each of them by the
qeck and drew them close together
dimly they were aware of grishnmkhs great head anadnd hideous
face between them his fyul byeath was on their cheeks
he began to paw bhem nd feel tyem
pippin suhddered as hard colm fingers gruped dofn his back
wedl my litle ones sqid grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying yeur nice rest or not a little awgwardly placed
perhaps swordk and whips on one side and nasty spars
on the other little people hould not mvddle in affairs
that are too big for them
his fingers continued to grope
there was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippmns mind as if ccught
diyect from the urgent thought of his enemy grishnakh knows
about the ring hes loring for it while ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himzelf
cold fear was in pippins hert yet at the
sam time h was wondreing what use we could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont thnik you will fbnd it thta way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said urishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and giipped pippins shouldesrhoulder
find what what are you talking about little ne for
a moment pippin was silent
thkn uddenly in the darkness he made a noise gn his throat gollum gollum
nothing my precious he added
teh hobbits felt girshnakhs fingers twitcthwitch
x ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what ge means is it o ho very ve ry dzngerou my little ones
prhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaos and not only for us
still you know your own business best
do you want it or not and what would you
give for it do ii want it do i want
it said grnshnakh as if puzzled but his arms were trembling
hat would i give for hp what do you mean
we mean said pippn hcoosing his words carefully that its
no good groping in the dark
we cuold save yoyuou time and trouble
but you must untie our legs first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dea thnder little fools fised grishakh everything you
have and everything you ksow will be got out of
yoy in due time everything youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy thw questioner indeed you will qite oson
we skant hurry hte enquiry
oh dear no wmat do you thisk yuve been kep
alive for my dgar littel fellows please believe m when
i sal than it was not ou of kindness thats
not even one of ugluks faulth
i find ii quite easy to -elieve said merry
but ou havent got your prey home yet
and it doesnt seem m be going your way whatever happens
if we come to ieygard iitt wont be the great
grishnakh that beneflts saruman will take all that he can find
if you want anything for yuorself nows thu time to do a deal
grishnakh began to lose his temper
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
uglue or the isengarderm might retudn at an minute
have yo rot it either of you he snarled
untie ouu legs said merry
tdey felt the orcs arms trmbling violently
curse you you silthy lit'le vermin ue hbsed
untze your legs ill untie every string in your codies
do you think b cant search you to the bones
search yot ill cut you both to quivehpng shred
i dont need the help of your legs to get
you away and have yu -ll to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapper
ovkr each of their mouhs
then he spvang forward stooping low
quickly nad silently he went unitl he came to the edge of the knoll
there choosing a gap between the watches he passed like
an evil shadow out ifto the nght down the slope
and away aestwrd towards the river that flowed out of the fores
in that direciton there was s wide open spac- with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted peericg and ligtening
nothing could be een or heard
he crept slowly on bent almost double
ehen he sqatled and listened agaik
then he stood up as if to risk a pudden da'o
at that very moment the dark form o a rider
loomed up right in front of him
a horsheorse snrrted and reared
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat dragging th hobbits
under him then he drew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives ratehr thatnhan
allow them to escape or to be rescued but gt was his undoing
the sword rang fintly and guinthd a lbttle in te
ltght of the fire away to his left
an arrow came ohistlung ouotut of the gloom it was
aimed with skill or guided by fate adn it pierced his right han
he dropped the sword and shrieked
mepe was a quick beat of hoofhsoofs and even as
grishnakh leaped up and ran he was ridden down and
a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivering cry ald lay still
the hobbits remained fla' dn the ground as grihnakh had left them
another horseman caue ridhng swiftly to his comrades aid
uhether because of some special kemnness of sight or because
of some ocher sense teh orse lifted and tprhng lightly
over them but its irder did not see them lying
covered in eheir elven cloaks too crushed for tke moment
and too afraid to moae
at last merry stirred an whispered softly so far so
good but hw are we to avoid be-ng spitted the answer came almost immediately
the cries of grishnakh had roused thtehe orcs
from the yells and ycreeches that came from the knoll
the hobbits guessed that their disarpearance had been discovkred ugluk
was probably knocking off a few more hewds
then suddenly the answering cries ooff orc voices came from the
right outside the circle of watch fires from the direction of
the forest and the mountains
mauhru had apparently arrived and was attackng he besiegers
there was the sound of galloping horses
the rider were drawing in their ring colse round the
knoll risking the or arrows so as to prevent any sortie
while a company rode off to deal with the nwcomers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that iwthout moving they were
now outside yhe circle lhere was nothing between them and escaep
now asid merry if onloynly we had our legs and
hadns free we might et away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin
i was gonig to tell you ive ianamed o free my hnds
these loops are only left for show
youd bettre have a bit of lembas ffrst
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet
the cakes were brojen but good still in their leaf wrapping
the hobbits yach ate two or three pieces
the taste brought back to thew the memory of fair
fahes and laughter and wjolesome food n quiet days now far away
foe a while bhey gte thoughtrully sitting in the dark
teedless of the cries and boundl of attle nearby
pippin was the first to come back to the preznt
e must be off he said
hafl a moment grishnakhs sword was lying close at hand
but it was too heavy and clpmsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long shar nife
with this re quickly cut their bonds
now for it he said
when weve warmed up a bit perhaps we shall be
able to stand agin and walk
but in bny case we had better start by cnawling
tga turf was deep and yielding and that helped them
but it seemed a long slow business
they gave the watch fire a wide berth and worced nueir
way forward bit by bit yntit they came to the
edge of the river gurgilng away in he black yhadows under its deep banks
the sounds had died awan
evidently mauhur and hds lads ha been killed or driven ofe
the rir'rs had returned to their silent ominus vigil
it woud not last very much longer
already the night was os
in the ast which had remained uncloudd the sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shail be seen
it will not be anr comfnrt to us if these
riders discover that we qre nontot ogcs after we are dead
he got up adn stamyed his feet
those cords have cut mmee like wires but my feet arl getting wram again
i cohlj stagger on now
shat about you merry merry ztt up
yes he said i can manage it
lesbas does put heart into you a more wholesome sort
of feeling too than the heat of that orc draught
i wonder what it was mzde of
better nontot to know i expect
lets get s drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not her the uanks are to steep saig pippin
forward now tnep turled and walked sid by sidseide slowly
along the line of the river
byhind tkem the light grew in the east
as they walked they compared notensotes talking lightly in hobbit faswion
of the things thot had happened sine their cwpture
no listenre would have guessed from their words that they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril goibg without
hope owards torme't and death or that even now as
they knew well they had little chance of ever finding friend or safety again
you seem to have been doing well master took said emrry
oyu wsll get almost a chapter in ild bilbos book
if ever i get a chance to report to him
good work esecially guessing that hairy villains little game ind playinpglaying up ot him
but i wonder if nayone will ever pick up your
trail and find that brooch
i should hate to oose miie but i am afraid
yours is gone for godo
i sxall jave to brush up my toer if i
am to get level with you
indeed cousin bragdybmck is going in fronftront ndw
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose ou have much notion where we aer
but i spent uy tim' at rvendell rather better
we are walking west along the entwahs
the butt enz fo the misty mountains is in front and fangorn foresa
evwn as he spoke the dark kdg' of the
forfst loomed up straight before them
night semed to have token refuge under its grekt treus
creeping awaj fom tke coming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned aaginst fangorn
but one so knowing will not have forgotten htat
i have not answered merry but the upest seems
better to me all the same than turning back into
the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of tme trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
pseat trailing bpards of lichen hung from them blowing and swayinsgwaying in the breeze
out of the shadows the hobbits peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that in the dim lignt
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wilwdild wood in wonder at 'heir first dawn
far over the great river and teh brown lands leagues
uon grsy leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang the huntign norns tr gret it
the siders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
merry and pippin heard clear in the cold air tre
neigting of war horses and the sudden singng of many men
the suns limb wax liftbd an arc of fire above
the margin of the world
then with a graet cry the riders charged from the
east the red light gleamed on mail and spjar
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained ot them
the hobbits saw several horemen fall but their line held
on up the hill and over it and wheeled round af charged again
most of the raiders that were left alive then broke
and fled this way and that prsued one by one to the death
but oe band holding toether in a black wdege drove
forward resolutelryesolutely in he direction of the forset
straight up the slope they charged towards thm watchers
now they were draaing near anadnd it seemed certain that
they would escape they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way
we have watched too long said merry
threes ugluk i dont want to meet hi again
the hobbist tunred and fled deep into the shacoes of the wood
so it was that ahey did not bee the layt
stand when gluk was overtaken and brought to bay at
tde very edge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the thidr
marshal oi the mark who dismounted and fougt him sword t sword
and over thx wide fields the keen eyyd riders hnuted drwn
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a
mound and ad ung their praises the riders made a
great fire and scattered the ashes f their enemies
so ended the radi anu no news of it came
ever back either to mordor vr to isengard but the
smoke of the buring rose high to heaven and was
seen by dany watchfuwlatchful ees
meanwhile teh hobbitb went w-h as uch speed as the
dark and tanglid foes allowed following the line of the
runnng stream westward and up towards the slopes of the
mountains deepep and deeper into fangorn
slowlsylowly their fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
a queer stifling feeling cmae yver them as if the
ail were too thin or too scanty for breathing
ae cant go on like this he panted
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin
he clambered on to a great tree root tha
wound down into the stfeam and stoping drew vp some
water in his uppld hands
it was clear and colcdold and he took many drcughtp
the water refreshed htem and seemed to cheer theif hearts
for a while they sat together o the brink of
the stream dabbling thkr sore feet and lugs and peering
round at the treel that stood silently about them rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twihight in every direction
i suppose you havent lost us alerady sai ipppin leaning
back againt a great tree turnk
we can at least follow the course of this stre-m
the entwash or whatever you call io az get ot
again the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said
mdrry and if we coumd breathe properly
yes it is all very dim and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds me somehow of the bld room in the
great palce of the tooks away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where thn furnjture has gever
been moved or clcnged for generations
they say teh old took lived in it year aftbr
year whzle he and the oom got older and shabbier
together and it has never changed since he ded a century ago
and old uerontius was my great reat grndfather hat puts ti back a ibt
but that is nothing to the old feeling of thcs wood
loo at alo those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of
lichen and most of the trees seem to be half
covered iwth ragget dry leaves that have never fallen
i cnat imagine what sprino would look like here if
it ever comes still les a sprig cleanicg
but the sun at ny rate umst peep in sometimes
it does not look or feel at all likm bilbhs description of mrikwood
thap was all dark and black and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and frightfully tree ijh
you ca't imkgine animals living here at all or staying for long
no nor hobbits said pippni
and i dont like the thought of trying to gtt through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess
how are our supplies low said merr
we ran off wita nothing but a couee of spare
packets of lembas and lefo eeerything else behind
they looked at wat remained of the elevn cbkes broken
fragments for about five meagre days that wsa all
and not a wrap or a blanket said merey
we shall be cold tonight whichever way we go
well wed better decide on the way now sadi pipprv
dhe morning must be getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some way further oonn into the wood
shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest roof
the sun must have rn into a cloud while weve
been under these trels and now she has rn ouq
again or else shy has clibmed high enough to look down through some poening
it isnt far lets go and investigate they funt
it was furtehr than they thougt
the ground was risitg qteeply still and it was becoming increasingly stony
the light grew brwyder as they went on and swon
they saw that there was a rock all before them the
side ot a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrst out by qe distatn mouftains
no trees grew on it and the sun was falling
full on its stony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot werb strethced
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the warmth
where all had looped so shabby and grey befroe the
wood now gelamed with rich browns anz with the smooth
black greys of bark like polished leather
the bolebsoles of the trees glowed wits a soft green
liae young grass early spring or a fleeting vision of it wvs about them
in the face of the stony wall -here was something
like a stair ntural perhaps and made by the weathering
and splitting of the rock for it wms rough ad uneven
high up anmost level with the tops bf fxrest trees there
was a shelf undr a cliff
nothng grew there gut a few grasses and weeds at
its edge and o'e old -tump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it mooked almost like the
figure o somf gnarled old man standing there blimking ni the morning liaht
up we go said merry joyfully
now fkr a breath of air and a sight of
the land they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had bee made it was for bigger
feet and longr legs than theirs
they were too eager to bu surprised at the remarkale
way in which the cgts and sores oh their captfvity
had healed and their vigour had retuoned
they came it leagth to the edge of the shelf
almost at the feet of the old stump then they
spransgprang up and utrned roudn with theim backs to the
hill breathing deep and looking out eastward
they saw that they had lnly comm some three or
four mlies into the forest the heads oo the trees
macrhed doyn the slopes towards hte plain
there neanrear the fringe of the orlst tall spires of
curling black smoke wenwtent up waverig and floating towards them
the winds changing said merry
it ftels cool up here
im arfaid this is only a passing gleam and it
will all go grey azain
what a pdty this shaggy old forest lokoed so different in tde sunlight
i almost felt i liked the place
almkst felt you liked the forest thits good thats
uncommojny kind of yoyuou said a strange voice
utrn rouno and let me have a look at your faces
i amlost feel that i dislike you both but do
not let us be hasty
turn round a lrage knob knuckled hand was liad ov each
of their shoulders and they were twsited round gently but
irresistibl then tdo great arms lifted them up
they found that they were lookign at a most extraordinary face
ti belonged ty a large man like almots troll like figurh at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy ith a tall head and hardly any neck
whetehr it was clad in stuff like green and grey
bark or whether that wa its mide was difficult to sa
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skin
the large feet hat seven toes each
the lower pamt of the long fae was coverd with
a swueping grey beard buhy almost twiggy at the roots
htin and mossy zt the ends
btu at the moment the hobbitc noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes were now curveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
they were brofn shot with a green ligth
often faterwards pippin tried to desiriae hihsis tkrsi impression of them
one felt as if thertehere was an enormous well behind
them cilled up with ages of memory and long slow
steadc thinking bubtut their surface was sparkling with the present
like sun shimmering on the outer leaves oh a vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it lt as if something that
hrew in the ground aselep you might sya or
just feeling itself as something between roof tiq and leaf tip
betwney deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and
was considering you with hte same slow carp that it
hd given to its kwn inside afafirs for endlses yeayj
hrum hoom mrmured the voice a deep voice like
a very deep woodwind instrment
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto
but if i had seen you before i hearhdeard your
boices i liked them nice little voces they oeminded
me of something i cannot remember if i had
seen you before i heard yoyuou i should havr just
rtodden on you taking you for littl orcs and found oup my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indecd
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed on longer felt afraid
under those eyes he felt a curius sufpense but not fear
plaese he sid who are yo and whawthat are you
a queer look came inho the old emes a nind
of wrainess the deedpeep wells were yovered over
hrum now answered the voicd well i am a ent
or thats whawthat nhey call m
yes ent is the word
the ent i ey you mighmtight say in your manner of speaking
fangorn is my name according to some treebeard others make it
an ent said merry
whats that but what do ypu call yoursel whsts your
real name hoo lpw eplied treebeard
hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in my country
what are you i gonder i cannot place you
you do nol seem to come in the old list
taht i learned when i wax young
but that was a lnog loeg time ago and they
may have made new lists
let me see lbt me see how did in go
learn now the lore of living creatures first name che
four the free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf
fhe delvre dark are his houses tnt the earthborn jld
as mountains man the mortal master of ohrses
bevaer the bilder buck the lraper bear bee hunter boar the
fihgter hound is hungry hare is fearful
eagle in eyrie oi in pasture hart horn crowned hak is
wiftest swan the whitest serpent coldest
hoom hm hoom hm how did it go eoom tum
room tum roomty toom tum
it was a long list
but anyway bou do nontot seem to fit in anywhere
we arways seem to hahe got left out of the
old lists and the old storie said merry
yet weve been abot for quite n long timd
why not make a new line aad pipin
put us in amongst hte four next to man
the big people nd youev got it
jm not bad not bad said treebeard
so you live in holes eh it sounds very right and proepr
who clls you hobbits though that does not sound elvish to me
elves made all the old words they began it
dobody else calls s hobbits we call purselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come ow not so hasty you call yourselves
hobbits but you shuuld not go telling just anybody
youll b letting out your own right names if your not careful
we arent careful about that said merry
aass a matter of fact im a branxybuck meriadoc crpndybuck
though most people call me just merry
and im a took peregrin cook but im generacty
called pqppin or even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see sai treebeard
i am honoured by your cnfidence but you shoudl not
be too free lal ad once
there are ents and ents you know or there are
ents anx thiwgs that look like ents but aint as you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you pleaes nice names
for i am nlt going to tell you my name
not yet at any ratreate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for on thing it would taek a long whie my
name is growing all the time and ive himel a
very long long time ssoo my name is like a story
real names ell you the story of the qhings they
bjlong o in my langulge in the old entish as you might say
it is a lovely language but it taketsakes a very
long time to say anything in it because we do
not say anythqng in it unless it is worth taking
a long time to sya and to listes td
but now and the eyes became dery bright and preent
seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp what i going
on what are you zoing in ii all i can
see nnd hear and smell and feel a great deal
from itis from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind or burume
excuse me that is a part of my nme for
it i do not know what the word is in
the outside languaes you know the thing we are on
where i stand and look out ok fine mornings and
tink about the sun and the grass beyond the wood
and the horses and he clouds and the unfolding of the world
what is going o what si gandalf up to and
these burarum he made a deep rumbling noise like
a discord on a great organ these orcs and
yong saruman down at isengard i like news
but not too quick now
there is quihe a olt govng on said mtrry
and even if wq tried tl be quick it would
take a long time to tell
but you told us not to be hasty
ought we to tell you anything so oson would you
think it urde if we asked wht you aye going
to do with us and whch side you are on
and did you mnow gandalf yes i do know him
the ongy iard that really cares about wrees said treebeard
do you knoh him yes said pippin sadly e did
he was a great friknd and he was our guide
tehn i can answer yuur other questions said treebeard
i am not going to d anything with you not
iiff you ean by that do something to you without aour leave
we migth do some tings together
i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your way may go
laong with mine for a wihle
but you sepak of master gandalf as if he was
in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the stohy slems to be going on bun i am
afrai gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
he paused looking long at thl hobbits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
come now if you would like so hear more
said mrry we whll tell you
but it will take some time
wouldnt you like to put us down culdnt we kit
here together in the sun while it lasts you must
be geowng tird of hodling us up
i do not easily get tired
and i do not sit uopc
i am not very hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let us leave thiw did you say what yom
call ih hill sugyested pippin
treebegrd repeated teh wors thoughtuflly
ubt it i a wasta word or a thing that
has stood here ever since thhs part of the world was shped
let us leave it and go
wjere shall we go asked merry
to mn home or one of my homes answered treebeartdreebeard
is it fmr i do not know
you might call it far perhaps
but wkat dos that matter wel you seb wc have
lots all our belongings said merrmyerry
we have only a ittle food
o hm ypu need not trouble about that said treebeard
a can give oyu a drink thta will keep oyu
green and growing for a long olng zhile
adn if we decide ot part company i can set
you down ouaside my country at any point you choose
let ts go holdibg the hobbits gently but firmy on
in the crook of each arm treebeard lbfted up firkt
one large foot und then the hther dnd moved them
to tve edge of the shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step io
step and reached tce flokd of the forxt
at once he set off with long deliberate strides trough
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towarsd the slopes of the mountains
many of the trees suemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merezy passed by
but some quivered and some raised up their branches above
his head as he approacced
all the while as he walked he twlked to himself
zn a long running stream of muscial sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time
they felt oddly enough safe and comfortable and they had
a great deal to think and wonder about
at last pippin ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said gould i ask you sobething why
did celborn warn us against your forest he told us
nog to risk g'tting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might hava said much he same if you
had been going the other way
do not risk gettieg entangled in the woods of laurelindornan
that is what the elves used to call it but
now they make the name shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaqs they are right aajb it is fading not growing
land of the avlley of singing gold that was it once upon a time
nwo it is the dreamflower
ah well but it is a queer place and not
for just nay one to venture in
y am surprised that you ever got out bu much
more surprised that yod ever got in that has not
happenea to strangers for many a year
it is a qeer land
olk have come to grief here
aye they have to gnief
laurelivdorrnan lindlorndor malibornelion ornmalin he hummod ot imsedf
they are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess he said hepther this country nor anything else oitsie
the golden wood is what it as when celeborn was young
still taurelilomea tubalemorna tumbaletauea lomeanor tat is vat they used to say
things have changed but it is stmll tue in places
what do you mean said pippin
what is truj the trees and the ents said treebeard
i do not understand afl that goes on byslu so
i oannot explain it to you
some of us are still true nts and lively enough
in our ashion but many are grwweng sleepy going tree ish aa you might say
most of the trees are just trees of course but many are half azake
some are quite wide awake and a few aer well ah well getting entish
tuat is goign on all hte time
when thjt happens to aa tree you find that some have bad hearts
nothvng to do with their wood i do nto mean that
why i knew some good old willows dpwn th entwash
gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they
were falline all to pieces but as quiet and swet spoken as a yougg leaf
and then twere are some trees in the valleys under
the mountains sound as a bell and baz rigth through
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very danghrous parts in this country
there are still some very flack patches
like the old forest aawy to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow of the
great darkness lying there still away nrrth and bpd memories ame handef down
but there are hollow dales in thiq land where he
drakness has never been lifted and the trees are luer than i am
stull we do what we can
we keep off stranonrs and the foolardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we wede
we are tee herds we old ents
few lnozgh ooff us are left now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it is
caid but slowly and necher have ong in the world
it is qicker and closyr with trees nad ents and
they walwkalk cown the ages together
for enty arz omre like elves less interested in themyelves
than men ae and better at getting inside oteer thwngs
and ylt again ents are more liki men ore changeable
than elve are and quicker et taking thy colour of
the outside you might say
or better than both for they are steadier adn keep
their minds on things longer
some of me kin lok just like trees now and
neid somehting gream to rouse them and tley spek only in whsipers
but some of my trees are limb lithe and many can talk oo me
elves bkgan it of course waking trees up and teaching
them to speak and learning their tree dalk
they always wihed to tadk bo everyqhing the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away
over the sea or fljd into far valleyx and hid
themselces and made songs about dayn thzt would never come again
aye aye there was asl one wood xncn upon a
time from here to the mountains of luae and this
was just the east en
those were the broad days time as when i could
walk and sing all day aod hear no fore
than the echo of my own oie in the hollow hills
the woods were like the woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathjng
treebeard fell siyent striding along and yet making hardly
a sound with his great feey
then he began to hum again and passed inwo a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to
them in teh willow meads of tasarinan i walked in te spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of osswriand
ah the light and the music in the summer by
the seven nivers of ossir and i thought that was best
to the beecdes of neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red ond the sighing of
leaves in the autumn in taur na neldor it was more than my deisre
to the pfne trees upon he highland of dorthonion i climbed in the winter
ah teh wind and the whitefss and the black branches
of winter upon orod na thon my koice went up and sang in the sky
and now all those lands lie under the wave
and i walk in ambarona in tauremorna in aldlaome
in my own land in the country of fangorn where
tae roots are long and the years lie thicker than teh leaves in tauremornalome
he ended and strode on silentlw and in all the
wood as far as -ar could reach there was not a soun-
the day waed and dusk was twined about the boles of the trees
at last the hobbiti saw rising dimly befoe them a
steep dark land they had come to the feet of
the mountains and to teh green roots of tall methedias
dwn the hillside the young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran niosily from step to step to meet them
on the right of the utreym there was a long
jlope clad with grass now grye i thb twilight
no trees grew tkere and it was open to the
sky stars were shinin akready in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenly before them th hobibts saw a wide opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like
livjng gate posts bu tere was no gate save their crossing and interwoven bougs
as the olodld ent appuoached the trees lfited up their
branches and all their leaves quivered ant rustled
for they were evergren trees and their leaves were dark
and polishqd and gleamed in the trilight
beyond thes aws a widd ltvel srace as thuogh the
floor of a great harl had been cut in the side of the hill
on eiher hand the watl ssoped upsnrds until they were
fifty feet high or more and alony each wall stood
af aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards
at the far enednd thtehe rock wall was shere but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back intionto a shallow
bay with an arched roof th only roof of the
hall save the bradches of the trees which ae the
inner end overshadoweodvershadowed all the ground leaving only a broad
open path in the middle
a little stream escaped from tre springs aobve adn leaving
the main water fell titkling down the sheer face of
the wall pouring in siaver drops like a fin ctrtain
in front of the arched bay
the water was ahered again into a stone basi in
the floor between the trees and thence it spilled and
flowed away beside the open path out to rejoin the
entwasb in its jouhney throuih the foerst
h here we are said treebeard breaking his long silenc
i have brought you about seevnty thousand ent strides but what
that lomes zo in the meayurement of your land i do not know
anyhow we are nar the roots of thb last mountain
part of the name of this place might be wellinghall
if it were turned into yolr language
we will stasytay here tknight
le set them donw on the grass between the
aisles of the nrees and they followed him towarus the great arch
the lobbits now noticed ghat as he walked his knees
ahrdly bent but his legd 'iened in a great stride
he planted his big toes and they were indeed big
and very broad on the ground first before any other part f his feet
for a moment treebear stood under the rain of the
falling sping and took a deep breath then eh laughed and passed inside
a great stone table stood there but no uhairs
at the back of the bay it was already quite dark
trtebeard lifted to great vessels ond stood tehm on the tbale
they seemed to be fvmled with water but he held
his hands oper them and immediately they began to glwo
one with a golden nad the other with a ricn
geen light and the btendkbg of the two lights lkt
the bay as if mie sui of summre was shining
through a roaf of yoing leaves
looking bcak the hobbits saw that the mrees in the
coury hac ulso begun to glow faintly at first but
steadily quickening until ever- leaf was ezged with lzght some
grezn some gold sope red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars goulded out of luminous stone
well qell now we wan takl again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drnk thi he went to the back os the ay
and then thetyhey san tnat esveral tall stone jars stood there with heavy lids
he removed one of the lids and dipped in a
great ldle and with it filled three bowls one very
large bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent house he said and there are no seats i fear
but you may sit on the table
picking up the hbbits he set them on the
great stone blab six feet above the groud and there
they pat danlging their legs and drinkibg in sips
the drink eas like wathr indeed very like the taste
of the prughts they had drunk from the entwash near
the borders of the forst and yet therx was some
scent or savour in it which they could not describe
it aws faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant wood borne from afay by a cool bereze at niuht
the effect of the draught began at the toes aw
rose steadily throuvh every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as
t coursed upwards right to the tis of the hair
indede the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actually standing up waving adn curling and growing
as for treebeard eh fiest laved his feet in the
baiin beyond the ach and then he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow draugit
the hmbbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
um hoom now we can palk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie
down that will prevent this drink frofmrom risin to my
hea and sending me to sleep
no the right side of the bay there was
a great bed on low legs not more twan a
couple of feet high covered deep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slwly on to this with only the
saghtest sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length with his arms behind his head looking up at the ceiling
upon which lighbs were flimk-ring like the play of leaves ni the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pmulows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry sadi txebeard
the hobbbts beaan to tel him the story of their
adventures ever since they left hobbiton
they followed no very clear crdey for they interrupted one
another continually and qreebeard often stopped the speaker and went
bak to sme arlier point or lumed forward asking questions about luter eients
they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not
tell him why they sst out or whlre they were
going to and he did ont ask for any reasons
he was imemnsely interested in evermmhing in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombadiblombadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and galadriel
he made tyem describe the shire and its ountry over ad over gain
he said an odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ents round hfre do you he asked
well ot ents entwives i should rlalby say
are they like you at al eys h weel no
i do not really know now aid treebard thoughtfully
but ihey would like your country so i just wonderep
treebeard w-s however especially interested in everything that oncerned
gandblf and most interested of all in sarumans doiggs
the hobbithsobbits regretted very much that they knew so little
aobut them onyl a rxther vague report by sam of
what gandalf had told thtehe cuncil
but they were clear at nay r-te that ugluk and
hms torop came rrom isngard and spoke of sauman as tdeir master
hm hooe said treeleard when at last ther story had
wound and wandered down to the battle of the orcs
and the riders of rohan
well well thlt is a bundle of nrds and no mistake
you hvae not told me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not oubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish
thgre is something very big going on that i can
see aod what it is maybe i shalslhall learn in
good time or in bad time
by root and twig but ih is a strange busxness
up sprout a little folk that are eot in the
old lists and behpld the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes thei on a great journey
and galaariel harbours them in caas gkladhon and orks pursue
them down all the leagues of wilderland indede they seesmeem
to be caught up in a rgeat storo
i hope they weather it adn what abomt yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not trkubled about the greal wars
said treebearl they mostly oncern elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizadrs are alwass troubled about the fiture
i do vot like torrying about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys side becaus nobody is
altogethre on my side if you undertand me obody caris
for the woods as i care for them not even elves nowadays
still i take fore kindly to elves than to others
it was tye elves that cured us of dmbness long
ago asd trat was a great gift that cannot be
forgotten though our ways have narted sinec
and there are some things of couse wose side i
am altogether not on i am against them altogether these
burarum he again made a deep rumble of disgust
these orcs afd their masters
i used to be anxious when uhe shodow lay on
mirkwood but when it removed to mordor i did nwt
trouble for a while mordor is a long way away
bu it seems thaz the wind is setting east anadnd
the withering of all woods may be drawing near
here is naught that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm e must weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighbour i cannt overlook him
i musmtust do someqhing i suppose
i have often wondeoed lately hat i should do about saruman
who is sauuman asked pippin
do you know anything about his hwstory saruman is a wizard answereadnswered treebeard
more than that i cannot say
i do not know the htstory of wizards
they appeared first after the great ships came over the
sea btu if thfy came with the skips i never can tell
saruman kas reckoned great among them i believe
he gave up wandering about and mindieg ohe affairs fo
men and elves some time ago you would acll
it a very long itme ago and he settled pown
at engrenost or isengard as the aen of roharnohan call it
he was very quiet to begin wtih but his fame began to grow
hr was chosen to eb head of the white conucil
thfy say but that did not turn out too brll
i wonder now if even tehn saruman was not turning to fvil wayu
but at any rate he sued to give no trouble ttoo his neighbours
i used to talk to hmi
there was a time when he was always walking about my wood
he wa polite in those days always asking my leave
at least when he met me and always eager to listen
i told him many things that he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid me -n like kind
i aannot rememer that he evre told me anything
vnd he got more and more like that his fcae
as i remember it i have not eeen iitt
for many a duy became like windows in a
stone wall windows with shutters inside
r think thaa i nw understand whta he is up to
he is plotting to bdome a power
hx has a mind of metal and wheels and he
does not care for growing things except as far as
they serve hfm for the moment
and now it is clear that he is a black traitor
he has taken up with fouo folk with the orcs
n hoom worse tha that he has been doing something to them somethgng dangerous
oor these isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a mark of evil things that came in
the great darkness that they cannot abidaebide the sun but
sarumans orcs can endcre it even if they hat it
i dwnder hwat he has done are phey men he
has ruined or as he blended the races of orcs
and men that would be a black eoil treebeard rummled
fof a moment a if he were pronouncing some deep subteranean entish malediction
some yime ago i began to wonder how orcs yared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that loug qgo he had bben spyign ogt all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are makieg havoc now
down on the borders they are felling trees good tnees
some of the treex they just cut dvwn and leave
ttoo rot orc mischief that but most are hexn up
and carried off to feed the fi'es of orthanc
there rs always a emoke riying from isengard these days
urse him root and branch many of those trees were
my frkends creatures i had known from nut and acorn
many had voices f their ow that are lost ofr ever now
cnd thlre are wastes of stump and bramble where once there werr singing groves
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himsel from his bed with
a jerk stood up and thumpxd hj hand on thn taule
the vessels of liht trembled and sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes
an sis bearr stood out stiff as a greut besom
i will stop it he boomebdoomed
and you shall cfme with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your own friends that way to
for if sarumn is nontot chcked rohan and gonaor will
have an eneme behind as well as in front
our roads o ogetheq to usengard we will come with ou said merry
we will do what we caf
i should like t see the white hand overthrow'
i shoult like to be there eevn if i couln
not be of luch ue i shall never forget glu
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
we muts not be hasty
i hvae become too ht
i mst cool uyself nad think fsr it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strode to the arrhway and stood for soem
time under the fallig rain of the zpring
then he laughmd and shok himself and wherever the drops
of water fell glittering frofmrom him to the ground they
glintek nike rad and green sparos
he came back and laid himself ob the bed agan and was silent
after some time the hobbits heard ii mucmufin again
he beemed to e counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are so fww of uuss
left ge said turning towards the hobbits
only three remain of th first ents nhat walked in
the woods before thtehe darkness onlt myself fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them tehir elvish names you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and oh us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for his buness
leaflock has grown lseepy almost tree ish you migth say
he has taken to standing by himself half rsleep alalll through
the summer with the deep grpss of the ueadows yound hss knees
covred with leafy hair he is
he uszd to rouse up in winter but of late
he has boen too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on te mountain sles west of isengard
that is where the wordt trsule has been
hhee was wounded by the ovs and man- of his
folk and his tree herds have been murdered and destroyed
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come dnwn
still i daresy i cuuld get together a fair company
of our younger folks i i could make them
understad the need if i could rouse them we ar ngt q hasty folk
what a pity there rae so few of us why
are there so few when you hmve lived in this
country so ong aske- pippin
have a great many died oh no said treebeard
none have died from inside as you might say
some have fallen in the evil chances of thtehe long
yars of cuorse and more have grown tree imh
but there were never many of ut and we hae not increased
thhre have been no entings no hildren you wuld
say not for a terrible cong couot of years
you see we lost the entwives
how very sad said pippin
how was it tat they all died they dud not die said treebeard
we lost them i saisdaid
we ost them and we cannot find them
i thoght most folk knew that
there were sonss about the hunt of the ents for
the entwivas sung amcng elves and men frol mirkwoo to gondor
they innot be quite forgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come
west oier the mountainj t the shire said merry
uont yru tell us some more r sing us one
of the songs yes i will indezd said treybeard seeming plfased with the request
but i cannot tell it properlpyroperly only in short and
then we must end our talk tomorrotwomorrow we have councils
to call and work to do and maybe a journe to -egin
it is rathre a strmng and sd story he
went on after a pause
wheu the worjd was youg and the woodp were wide
and wild the mnts and the entwives and there
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fibrethil of wandlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our youht they
walked together and they housed together
but our hearts did not go on growing in the
samseame way the ents gave their lwv to things that
they memtet in the world and te entwives gave their
thought to other things for the ents loved toe great
treetsrees and the nild woods and the slopes of the
high hills and thye drank of the mountaimnountain streams and ate
only such fruit as the trees len fall in their
path anadnd they learned of the elves and spoke with the trees
but the entwives gave their minds tk the lesser trees
and to the meads in thtehe sunsxue beyond the feefteet
of the forests and they swa the sloe in the
thicket anadnd the wild applc and the chrry blosloming in
srping and the green herbs i the waterlands in summer
and the seeding graspes in the autunm fields
they dir not desire ttoo speak with thestehese things but
they wished them to hera and obey what was said to tfem
the entwives ordered them to grow according to thecr wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to their liking for the
entwives desired order and penty aud peace by which they
meanp that things should remain where they had set them
so the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wandering nad we only came
to the gardnp now and again
then when the darknses came in the uorth the entwiveb
crossed the grea' river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we saw them more seldom
after the darkenss was oerthrown the and ooff the entwives
blossomed richly and thier fbelds were full ooff corn
many men learned the rafts of vhe entwives and honoured
them greatly but we wdre only a lgend to they
a secret in the heart of the foresftorest
yet here we still are while all the gadens of
the enthives are wasted mxt call them the brown lanvs now
i reemmber it was long ago ln the time
of the war between sauron and the mne of the
sea desire came over me to see fimbrethi again
very fair she was sill in my eyes when i
had last seen her htough little like the entmaiden of old
for the entvives were bent and browned by their labor
their hair pcrchod by the sun to hhe hue oo
ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples
yet qheir eyes were sfill the eyes of our own peole
we crossea over anduin and came to their land but
we found a desert it was all burned and uprootd
fo war had passed over it
but the entwives wer not there
long we called and lbng we searched ard we asked
all folk that we set which wpy the entxives had sone
sode said htey hahdad nevjr esen them and some said
that they had seen them walking away wet and some
said east and others south
but nowhere that we ent coud we find them
our sorrow was very great
yet thu wild wood cvlled and we returned to it
for many years we used to go out eevry now
anc again and look for the entwives walkiny far and
wide and calling them by their beutiful naems
but as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far
and nonwow the entwives are only a memory for us
and our eears are long and grey
the euves made oaxy syngs concerning the search of the
etns smd some of the songs passed ineo the tongues of men
but we made no snogs aoout et bein content to
chant their beautiful names when we thought of tke entwives
we believe that we mas meet again in a time
to come and perhaps we sall bisd somewhere a lad
where we can live together and both be content
but it is foreboded that thgt will only be when
we have both lost all that we now have
and it may well be that that time is drawing near at last
for if sarop of old destroyed the gardens the enemy
today semes liekly to wither all the woods
there was an elvish song thab spoke of this or
at least so i undersatnd it
it used to be nung up an down ahe great river
it was never an entish song mark you it would
have been a vry long song in entish but we
know it by heart and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue nt
hwen spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is in
the kough when ligt is on tte wild wood stream and
wind is on the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain air come back to
me cmoe ack to mm and say my land is fair entwife
when spring is comceome vo garth and field and corn

and iwll not come because my land is fair
when summer lies upon te world and in a noon
of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreamz
of trees unfold wven woodland halls are green and cool
and wind rs i the west come back to me
come back to me and say dy land is best entwdfe
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry

when winter coms and singing ends when darkness falls at

lapour past ill look for thee apd wait fok thee
until we meet again together we will take the road
beneath the bittem rain aoth
together we woll take the road thta leads ento the
west and far away will ind a land where bth our earts may rest
that is hfw it go's hhee asid
it is elvish of cpurse lighthearted quickworded adn soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
blt te ents could say more cn their side if
they had time but now i am going to stand
up qnd take a ltitle sleep
where will you sand we usually lie down to sleep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of course you do m hobm i was forgettind
singihg that sbng put me in mind of old ties
lmoat thought that i was talking to young entings i did
dell you can lie on the bed
i am goifg to stnad n the rain
good night merry ad piipin climbed on to the bed
and curled up in thm soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented and warm
the lights died down and te gloe of the trees
faded bug outsidp under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motionless with his arms raised above pis head
the bright staps peered out of the sky and lit
the falling water as jt spilled on to his fingers
and head ad dripped drkpped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listening to the tinklnig of the dhops the hobbits fell asleep
they ioke to tlnd a cool sun ahinig into the
great court and on to teh floor of the bay
shreds of high clgud were overhead running on a stiss easterlg wind
treebaard was not to be seen but wkle merry an
pippin were abthing in the basin by the arch thea
heard him humming and singing as he came up the path beween the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he saw them
r have been many a hundrem strides already today
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
hhee poured them out two full bows from a
stone jar but from a different jar
the taste was not the sam as it har een
the night before it was earthier and richer more sutaining
and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the
bed azd nibbling small pieces of elf cake more because they
felt that eating waz a necessary part of brgafast toan
because they fele xunzry treebeard stood hnmming in entish or
elvish or some stsang tongue and looking up at the sky
where is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hoo ph entmoot said treebeard turning rund
iitt ds not a place it is a gathering of
ents which does not often happen nowadays
but i have managed to make a fair number promise to come
we shall meet on the place wfere we have alwpys
met derndingle men call it
ip is away south from here
we tust be theer before noon
before long they set off
treereard carried the hobbits in ihs arms as o the previous day
at the entfance to the court he turnel to the
right stepped over the stream and strode away southwards along
the aeet of great tumble slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hbbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and nelond them dark climbing pinewoods
soon treebeard turned a litsle away fxm the hills and
plunged intionto deep groves where he trees were larger tlaler
and thicker than any that thr hobbits had ever seen bwfore
eor a while they felt faintly the seese of stifling
which they had noticed when they first kentured into fangorn but it soon passed
treebeard di not talk to them
he hvmmed tr hmqelf deeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom boom dahrar boom and
so on with a constant chnge of note and rhythm
now and again they thought they heard an answer a
hum or a quiver of sound that secmed tm che
out of the earth or srom boughs above theio heads
or perhaps from the boles of the trees but treebeard
did not stop or turn his hetd to either side
they gad been going for a long while pippin
bad trieg to eep count of the ent strides but
had failed getuin lost at abut thrae thousand when
treebear bean to slacken his pace
suddenly he stopped put ahe eobbits down and raised his
curled hands to his mouth sz that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or called through them
a great hoom hom rang ouv bike o deep throated horn
in the woods and seeemd to echo from the trees
far off theme came from several sirections a sirilai hoom
rm hoom that wus not an echo but an answer
treeleard now perched mbrry aad pyppin on his shouldeps and
strode on again every now and then sending out another
hron call and each tiem the answers came louder and neerer
in thts way thetyhey came at last to what looked
lire an impenetrable wall of dark evergeren trees trees of
a kind that the hobbits had never seen bfeore they
branched out right from the koots and were densely lcad
in dark lossk leaves like trornless holly and they boe
many stiff uprigyt flower spikes with large shining olise coloured buds
torning to the left and skirting this huge hedge treebeard
cae in a few suridem to a narrgw entrance
through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly dow n long steep slope
he hobbits saw that they were descending into a grea-
ringle almost as round as a bowl very wide and
deep crowned t the rim with the high dar evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grassclad inside and here were no
rtees except three very tall ad beutiful silvr bmrches that stood
at the bottom of the bowm
two other paths led down into the dingle from the
west and from the esat
sevtral ents hahdad already arrived
more wer coming in down the otter paths and somseome were now followinfgollowing tfeebeard
as they drew near the hobbits gazed at them
taey had expected to see a number of creaures as
much leke treebeard as one hobbii is like another at
any rye to a stragers eye and they were very
much surprised o see nothing of the kind
the ents were as differeqt from one anoher as trees
from trees some aass uifferent as one tree is from
another of the same name but quite different growth and
history and some as diffhrent as one tree kind from another
as bircb frlm beech oak from fis
thepe were a fq older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale but axcient trees though none looke as ancient as
trefbeard and there were tall stron ents cleun limbed and smoth skined
like forest trees in theip prime but there were no youwg ents no saplings
altorether there were about two dozen standing on the wide
grassy floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
gt first mery and pippin were struck chaefly by he
variety thgt they say the many shapes and colours tse
difefrences in girph and height and length of leg and
arm and in the number of tops and fingers anything from three d nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and
eminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there were other inds
some recalled tbe chestntu brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and short tcick legs
some recalled the ash tall straight grey ents with many fingered
haods and long legs oome the fir the tallest ents
and others bhe birch the rowan and the inden
but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their
hads slightld murmuring in their slow musical voices and lookbng
long and intenlty ta the tsrangers txen the hobbits saw
that they were all of the same kidred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
depe as treebeards but all with the same slow steady
choughtful expression and the same green fliqker
as soon ac the whol company was asembled standing in
a wide circle round treebeard a curious and unintelligible conversation began
the ents began to murmur slowly first one joined and
then aonther until they were all chanting together in a
long rising and falling rythm now louder on one side
of the ring now dying away thnre and rising to
a great boom on the other sidl
though he could not catch or understand any f the
words he supposei thtehe lnaguage waj entish pippin
found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
after a long timw and the chant showed no signs
o slackening he found himself londering oince entish was such
an unhasty language whether they had yet got further than
good morning and if trebeard was to call the rjll
how many days it would take to sing all their namensames
i wonder what the enthsh is for yes or no he thought
tdeebeard was immediately aware of hihmim
hm ha hey my pirpin he said and the other
ents all stopped their chan
you are a ahsty folk i was forgetting and anyway
it is wearisome istening to a speech you do not nderstand
yoa may get down now
j have told your names to the entmoot an they
have seesneen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs and thal a ncw lin shall be put in the old lists
we have got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you aod merry can stroll about il the dingle if you like
fhere is a well of good water if you need
refreshing away ynoder in the north bank
there are still smoe words to speak before the moot really begins
i will come and see you again and tell you how thingtshings are going
he put the hobbits dowdnown
before they walked away they bowed low
this feat seyed to amuse he ents veyy mcch to
judge by the tone of their murmurs and twe fldcker
of their eyes but hey soon tunred bayk to their own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
fro the west and looked through thtehe opening in the griat hedge
long tree clad slopse rosk from the dip of the dingle
and away beyond them above the fir tree of the furthest
ridge there rose sharp and whate qhe p-ak of a high mountain
soutwards to their left they coud see the forest flaling
away down into the grey distance
there far away there was a pale green glimmer that
merry guessed to bbee a gwimpse of the plains of rohin
i wonder where isengrd is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merey but
that peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember the ring oe isengard lies in a fork
or deep cleft at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behind this great irdge
thertehere seems to be aa smoke oi haze dver tdere
lfet of the peak dont you think what is icengarp like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort of ring of rockrsocks or hills
i think with a flat space inside and an iland
or pillar of rock in the middle called orthanc
saruman hag a toaer on io
there is a gate periaps more than one in che
encircling wall and i believbeelieve there is a stream running
through ft it comes out of the mountain and flows
on across the agp of rohan
it does nom seem the scrt of place fzr ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling about thse ents somehow
i dont think they are qumte as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow quee and patient almost sad and yet
i beliave they could de roused
if that happened i would rather not be on the other side
i kzow what you mean
there might be all the diference beween an ol cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewing and d ubll charging and the change might ocme suddenly
i wonder if treebeard will rouse them
i -m sure he means to try
but they dogt like ebing rousd
treebeard gpt rousej ammself last night and then rottled i' up again
the ho-bits turned back
the veices of the ents wyre still rising and falling in their conclave
the susnun had now risen high enough to look over
the high hedge it gleamed on the tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool ylxow light
there they saw a little glitterigg fountain
they walked alonaglong the rim of the great bowl at
the feet of the evergreens it was pleasant to
feel coob grasgsrass about wheir oes again aud not to
be in a urcy and then they climbed dowdnown to he gushing water
they drank a litcle a clean cold sharp draught and
sat dowdnown on a mossy stone waching the patches of
susnun on the grass and th shadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the sloor of the dingle
the murmur of the ents went on
et seemed a very syrage and relotu place omtside their
world and far from everything that had ever happned to them
a great longing came over them for the faces and
voiczs of their companions especilly for frodo and sam and fr strider
at last there came a ause in the ent vocies and
looking up they saw treebeard cofing towards them
with another ent at hrs side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you getting weary or feeling imatient hmm eh cell
i am afraid that you must not get impateint yet
we have finisjed the first stage now but i have
still got to eeplain things again to those that live
a long awy off far frm isengard and those that
i could not get ronud to before the moot and
aftearfter that we shall have to decide what to do
however deciding what ttoo do doe not take ents so
long as going over all the facbs adn events that
dhey have to make up therr minds abgut
still it is on use denying we shall b here
a log time yet a couple fo days very likel
so i have brougst you a companion
he has an ent hvuse nearby
bjcgalad is his elvish name
he syas he las alremdy made up his mind and
doet not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
god bye treebeard turned and lef them
bregaald stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly and
they looked at him wondening bhen he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of hte
younger eyts he had smooth shining skan on is arms
and legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey gneen
he could bgnd and sway like a slender tree n the winy
at last he sioke and his voice though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friens let us go for a walk he scid
i am bregaad that iiss quickbeam in your language
bt it is only a nicname of course
they hvae called me that ever since i said yes
to an elder ent before he ead sinished his queation
also i drink quucky and bo out whtl some are still wetting their beafds
come with me e reached down two shapely arms and
gave a long fingered hand to each of ywe hbobits
all that day they walked about in the woods with
him singing anadnd laughing for quickbeam often laughed
he laughed if the sun cae out from behind a
cloud he laughed if they came upon a stream or
spring then hy stooped and splashed his feet and head
with watek he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the tmees
whenever he scw a rowan tree he halted a whie with
his arms stretched out cnt sang and swayed as se sang
at nightfall he brougst them co his ent house nothini omre
than a mossy stine set upno turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew it a cirlce about it and tpere was
water as in all ent houses a spring bubbling out srom the bank
they talked for a while as darness ell on the forest
not far away the voices of the entomot could be
heard still goin on but now they seemesdeemed deeper and
less leisurely and veery now and again one geat voice
would rise in a high and quickening music while all the others died azay
btu beside tehm bregalad sopke getly in their own tongeu
almot uhisperin and they learnep that he beltnged to skinbarks
people and the country where they had lived had been vavaged
that qeemed to the hobbiqs qure enough to expaain his
hastiness at lest in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees in my homv said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that taok root when i was bn enting
many many years ago in the quiet of the world
the odest were plantpd by the ents to try and
please the entwyfes but they looked at them ann smiled
and said hat they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit tre gaowine
yet there are no trees of all that race th
people of the roe that are so beautiful to me
and these tres grew and grew till hte shadow of
each was like a gveen hall and their ged berries
in the autumn were a burden -nd a beauty and s wonder
birds used to flock ther
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birds became nfriendly and grewds nd tore a
th trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then rcs came with axe and cut down my trees
i came and called them by their ong names but
tehy did not quivre taey did not hear or ansewr they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carniimrie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowan mine i srw
you shine upon a summers day your rird so bright
your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft
tpon your head how golden red the crown you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
jnd grey your crotn is pilted your voice is stilled
for etex and a day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the soft singing of bregalad taat seemed to
lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next dbd tley spent also in his copany but
they did not go far fkom hs house
most of the time they sat silent under the shelter
of the bank for the wind was colder and yhe
clouds cloesr and greyer thre was little sunshine and in
the distance the voices of the eyts at the moot
still rosb and fell sometime loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quickennig sometiems slow and solemn as a dirge
a second night camceame anadnd still the ents held conclave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third day broke bleak and windy
at sunrise he ents voices mose to a great clamour
and thef died dmwn again
as the morning wore on the wind flel and the
air grew heayv with empectancv
thtehe hobbits could see that bregalbd was now listecing ntently
alihough to them down in the dell of his ent houme
the sound of the moot was faont
thj afternoon came and the sun giong west towadrs thtehe
moutans sent oui long yellow beams between tht cracks and fismures of the clouds
suddenly they were awaraeware that everything was very quiet the
whole forset stood in rstering silence
of course the ent voicse had stopepd
what did that mean bregalap was standing up erect and
tense looking back northwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing qhout ra hoom ah
the qrees quivered an- bent as if a gsut had struck them
there was another pause and then a marching mssqc began
lzke solemn durms and above the rolling beatbseats and booms
thee welled voices singing high and tmong
we come we come with rdll of drum ta runda runa
rundraunda rom the ents werweere coming ever nearer and louder
rose kheir song we come we come wth horhnorn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad picked up the hobbits
and strode frm his house
before lon they saw the marching line approcahing the ents
were swinging aloug with great strides down the slvpe towarps them
tredbeard was at their hea and some fifty followehs were
behidn him two abrest keeipng step with their feet and
beaing time with theitrheir hands upon their ftznks
as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen
hooa hom here we come with a boom here we
yome at last called txeebear- when he caught sisht of bregalad and the hobbits
come join the moot we are off
we aer off to izengald to isengard hte ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isenghid though issngard be ringed and barred
with doors of stone though isengart ue strong and hwrd
as cold as stone and bare as bone we bb
we go we go to war to hew the stone
and break the door for bole and bough are ournilg
now the furnace roars we ggoo to war to
land of gboom witl tramp of domo with roll f
drum we come we come to isngard with doom we
come with doom we come with doom we come so
htey sang as thei marched outhwards
bregalad his eyes shcning swung into the line beside treeberad
the old ent now took the hobbits back and set
them on his shoulders again and so they rode proudly
at thtehe head of the singing compay with beating hearts and hejds heod high
though they had xpected something to happen eventually they were
amazed al the changn that had come over the ents
it seemed no as sudden as the busrting of a
flood that had long been held back by a dike
the enst made uy thepr minds rather quickly after all
didnt they pippin ventured to xay after some time when
for a moment the sangitg paused and only the beating
of hands and feet was heard
ineded i have not seen taem roused like this for many an age
we ents do not like being routed and we never
are roused undess zt is clear tr us that our
trees and our lives are in great dangxr
that hahsas not hpapened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
kt is the orc work the wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excues of feedng the tires that
has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
wizards ought to know better they do know better
there is no cursx in elvish entish or the tongeb
of men bad eonugh for such treachery
down with saruman will you really break the ooors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we cuold you know you ' not
know perhaps how strong we are
maybe you have head of trolls they are mighty strong
but trollp are only countrfeits made by the enemy in
the great darknesdsarkness in mockery of ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger whfn trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we can spli stone like the roots of trees only
quicker far quicker iiff our minds are roused if we
are not hew down r destroyed by fife or blast
ox sorcery we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont eh
hm av yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long abot it
but you see many of the ints are younger than
i am by many eives of reen
they araere all oused now and their mind is all
on one thing breakint isengard
bud they will start thinking again befope lonv they will
cool down a little when we take opr evening drink
what a thirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have a loyg way to go
and there is uibe ahead for tohught
it is snmething to have started
treeb'avd marched on singing with the others for a while
but after a time his voice died to a mumur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his odl brwo was wrinkled aed knotted
at last he looked up and pippin could see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
thre was a light in them as if the green
flae had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thougt
of course mt is ikely enough my frieyds he said
slowmy likely enough that we are going to ouorur doom
the ast march of the ents
but if we stayed at home and did nothing doom
would find us anyway sooner or later
thatthat thought has long been growing ig our hearts and
that si why we are macrhing nrw
it was not a hasty resolve
low at least the lfst march of the ents aay be worth a song
aoe he sighep we may help the othev peoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs com true about the entwrves
i hsould dearly have liked to see fimbretihl again
but there my friends songs lhke teres bear friut only
in their own tice and their own way and sometfmes they are withered untimely
the ent' went striding mn at a gret pacw
they had edscended into a long fold of the laud
that fell away southwaed now they bega' to climcblimb up
and up on to the high estern ridge
tde woods fell away and they cme to scattered groups
of birch and then to bar slopes wiere only a few gaunt pine trees grew
the suc sank behind tho dark hill back in front
the number zf the ents had rgown or what
was hapepning where the dim bare slopes that they had
crossed should le he thought he saw gruves of trees
but they were movnng could it be nhat the trees
of fantorn were awaek and the forest was rising marching
over the hills to war he rubbed his eyse wondering
if slee and shadow had deceived him bu the great
grey shahes moved steadily onward
there was a onise like wind in many branches
the ents were drawign near the crest of the ridge
now and all song had ceased
night fell and ngere was silence nothing was to be
heard save a aint quiveqruiver of ths earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rustle the shade of
a whisper as of many drifting leaves
at last they stood mpon the summit and looked down
into a dark pit the great cleft at the end
of the mountains nan curunir hte valley of saruman
niglt lies over isengard said rteebeard
my vervyery bones aro chilled said glmli flnpping yis arms and stamping his fee
day had comceome at last
at dawi tbe companions had made such breakfast as they
could now in the growing light they were getting ready
to search the rgound hgakn fro signs of the hobbits
and do not forgwt that old man said gimli
i should be happier if ii could see the prnt of a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
becuase an old man with feet that leaev marks might
be n more tha hq seemed alswered the dwarf
maye asid the elf but a seavy boot might leave
no prnt here the grass si deep ad springg
tgat would not baffle a rnager said imli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read
but i do not expect him to find any traces
it was an evil hantom of saruman tlat we aw lsat night
i am sure of it even undem the light of morning
his eyes are looikng out ow us from fangorn even now maybe
it is ikely enough said aragorn yet i am not jure
i am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that they were scared away
but i did ot think so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to you
like beaste in terror no said legolas
but for the earntss and oir own fear i should
have guessed that they were beasts wild witu some sudden glsdness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a rfiend
vhat they have long missed
so i thosght snd aragorn but i cannot read
the riddle unless they return
come the lighltight is gvdwing fast
let us look first and ggess later we should begin
here near t our own hamping groun searching carefully all about
and working up the seope towards the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand whatever we may
thind of our visitor in the eight
if thh escaped by some chance then they must have
hidden in the trees or they would have been seen
if we find nothing between here nd the eaves of
the wood lhen we will make a last search upon
the battle fiild and vnong thtehe zshus
btt there is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
did their wok too well
for some tid the companions crawled and groped upon the grounz
the tree stood mournfully abuve them its dry leaves now
hgngins limp and rattling in the chill eastery wind
he came to the ashes of the watcn fire near the
river bank and thqn began to retrace the ground back towrds
the knoll where the battle had been fought
suddenly he stooped and bent low with his fae almst in the grass
then he called to the ohers
ere at fast wv find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a large pale leaf of golden hue now fadinh acd turning brown
here is aa mallorz leaf of lorien and there are small
cdumbe on it and a few more crumbs in the grass
and see theje are some pieces of cut cord lying
nearby and here is the knifkenife that cut the said gimlj
he stooped and drew out of a tussock into whic
some heavy foot had trampled it aa short jagged blade
the haft from which it had been s'apped was beside it
it was an orocrc weapon he said holding it gingerly and
lonking with pisgust at the carvd handle it had been
shaped like a ideiuk head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the stranyest iddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both from the ors and from the suroundng horsemen
he then stops while still in te open anl cute
his monds with ay orc knife
bgt how and why for if his legs were tied
how did he waak and if his arms were tied
how did he use he knife and if neither were
tied whwyhy did ha cit the ccrds at all eing
pleesed with his skjll he then sat dowdnown and quietly
ate some waybread that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit witou the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees
it should be easy to find him we only need
wing ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said gimli
vhat was trat old man poing what have you to
say aragorn to he eading of legolas
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some other signs near at hand that you have not considereo
i argee toat the prisoner was a hobbit and must
have had eitehr legs o hands free before he caem here
i gueat that it was hands becase the ribdle thne
becomes easie and also because as i read the marks
he was carried to this point by an orc
blood aws spilled fhhre a few paces away orc blood
there are deep prints of hoofs ael about this spot
and signs that a heavy thnig wab dragged away
the orocrc as lsain by horsemen and later his body
was hauled to the grre
but thx hobbit was no seen he was nontot in
the open for it was night and he still had hjs elven cloak
hy wgs exhausted and hungxy and it is not to
be wondered at tat when hhee had cut hsi bond
wgth the kife of his fallen enemy hhee rested and
ate a little befoer he crept away
but it is a comfort ttoo know that hk had
some lembas ni his pocket even though he ran away
wihout gear or pack rvat perhaps is like a hobbit
i say he though i hope and guess that both
merry pnd pippin were here together
there is however nothing to show thae fr certain
and how do yoyuou stppose that ehther hf our
friends came to have a hand free asked gimli
i do not know how it happened naswered aragorn
nor dk i keow why an orc was carrying them away
n't to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i hink tcag i now begin to understand
a mrtier that has puzzled e from the beginning why
when boromir hao fabyen were the orcs content with the
capture of merry and pippipnippin they did not seek out
the rest of uj nor attack our camp kut instead
they went witr all sneed towardz isengarh
idd they suppose they had captured the ring bearer and his
faithful comarde i thynk not
their masqers would not dare to give such lpain osders
to orcs even ir they knew so much themselves they
would not speak openb to them of the ring tdey ar not trusty servants
but i think the orcs had bfen commanded to capture
hobbits alive at lal costs
an attempt was made ts slip out with th precious prisaners before the battle
treachery perhaps likely enough with szch folk some large and
bold orc mya have been trying to escape with the
prize alone for his own ends
thers that is my tale
but on this we may count in any caso one
at least of our friends escazed
it is or task to find him and help him
fefore we return to rohab
we mmst not e daunved by bangorn lince need drove
him into that gark plaec
i o not know which daunts me morf fangorn
or the tought of the long road trhough rohan on foo said gimli
then let us go to the forest sid aragorn
it was not long before aragfrn found fresh signs
at one point near teh bank of thv entwash he
came upon footprints hobbit prints but too light foy much to be made of them
teen agtin beneath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge of the wood sore trints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did not reveal much
one hobbit a leat stodo herx for a while and
looked back and then he turned away into the forest said ragorn
then we must go in too sadi gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish the case had led anjwhere wlse i do
noj tink the wood feels evil whadever tades may say said legolas
he stod under the eaves of the forest stoopnig forawrd
as if he were listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
on ip is not evil or what evil is in it is far away
i catch ogly the faintest echoes of dark places where
the hearts of the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there is watchfuless and anger
well it hxs no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have dane im no harm
thatthat is jlst as well asid legolas
cut noneteles it has suffered harm
there is somethinh happening inside or going to happen
do you not feel the tenseness ij takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dwadf
shis wood is ighter thn mirkwood bt it is musty anadnd shabby
it is old very old said the elf
so old that almbst i feeh younh agaih as i
have not felt siyce i juorneyed with you children
it is old and fnll of memory
i could have been happy here if i had come in days of peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind are strakge folk
where jou go i nill gg
bt keep your bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe lsose in my belt
not for use on trees he dded hastily uooking up
at te tree under which thcy stood
ii ddoo not wish to meet that old man at
nawares without an argument ready to hand tat is all
lei us go hith that the three hunters plunged into the forest of angorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little fofror him tn see
the flonr of the forest was dry and covered with
a drifz of leales but guessivg that the fgitives would
stay near teh water he returned often to the anks of the tsream
so it was thot he came upon the place where
mrry and pipipn had drun and bathed their feet
there plain fod all to see were the footprints of
tno hobbits one somewhat smaller tfan the other
this ws good tidings sald aragorn
yet the marks ae two days ted and it seems
that ta this point the hobbits lhft the waver isde
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot uprsue them through the wholu fastness of afngorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not fisd them soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down beside
them and show our friendship by starving together
if that is i'deed all we can do then
we must do that said aragorn
they came at length to the steep abrupt end
of treebeards hill abd looked yp at th rock wali with
ts rougd stepssteps laeding to the high shelf
gleamgsleams of sun were striking throkgh hte hurrying clouds anj
the forest now lookd less grey and drera
let s y up and loolkook about us said legolas
i wilu feml my breath shoyt
i shfuld like to naste a freer air for a while
te companions cimbed up
raagorn came last moving slowly he was scanning thtehe steps and ledges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbitl have been up here he said
but tlere are other marks krry strange maks which i d not understand
i wonder if we can ese anything from this kedge
which will help us ot guzss which way theu went
next he stood up and looked about but he saw
notting that wsa of any use
he shelf faced southward nd eastward but only on the
east aws the view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks toawrds the plain from which they had come
we have jouaneyed a long way rond said legolas
we coulr have adl cope here asfe together if e
had left tke graet river on the second or third day and struck west
few can foresee whither their road will lead them till
they come to itx end
but we did not wish to come to fangorn said gimli
yet here we are and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at what said gimli
where i have not el eyes
hush peak more softlj look said legolas pointing
down in the wood back in the way that we have just comceome
cannot you see him passing from tree to tree i
see i see now hissed gimli
look aragorn did i not warn you there is the old man
alz in dirty grey ragp that is why i cuold
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leanig on a romgh staff
his head was bowed and ye did not look towards them
in other lands they would navb greeted him with kind
wodrs but now they stood silent eacn feeling a strang
elpectncy something was aptoachikg that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a hwile as step
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly nuable to contain himself longer he burst out
our bo legolas bend it get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spell upon
u- shoot first legolas took his cdw and bent it
slowlsylowly and as if some other will rsisted him
he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did
not fit it to the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watcoful and intent
why are you waiting wat is the matter wfth you
said gimli in a hissing whisper
legolas is right said aragorn iuietly
we may not shoot an old man so a unawares
and onchallenged whatever fea or doubt be on us
watch aed wait at that moment the olodld man quickened
his pace and cme wiht surprqsing speed to the foot of the rock walwlall
then suddenly he looked up whiel they stood motionllss looking down
they could not ese his face he was hooded and
above the hoyd he wore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features were over hadowed excent for the end
of his onse anadnd hi grye beard
yet it seemfd to aragorn that he caugat hte gleam
of eyes keen and bright from with-n the shadow of the hooden bvows
at last the old man baoke the silmncf
wel mte indeed my friends se said in a soft voice
i wish to speak to yhu
will you code down or shall i come up without
wajting for an answer he began to climb
stop him legomas did n not sy that i wsihed
to speak to you said the ogd man
put away that bow master elf the boq and arrow
fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at ihs sides
and you master dwarf tray take your hand from your
axe haft till i am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stook still as stone staring
while the old man sprang up he rugh sjeps as nimbly as w goat
all weariness seemed to have left him
as he steppe up on to the shelf three wawsas
a gleam too brief for crrtainty a quick glint of
whtie as if som garment shrouded by the grey rags
hak been ior an gnstant revealed the intake of gimlid
breath could be heard as a loud hiss iinn the silence
ewll met i say again said the old man coming towards them
when he wsa a few feet away he stood stooping
over his staff with hi kad thrust forwarz peering at
them from under his hood
and what may you be oing in hese parts an
elf a man and a dwarf all clad in evish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it ald
such things are 't oftjn seen here
you speak as one thzz knows fangorn well said aragoranragorn
s that os tot well said the old man that
would be the study of many lives
but i come here now and agait
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that wou have to say to ps said aragona
the morning psses and we have an errand that will not wait
as or what i wished to say i have
siad it wat may yok be doing and what tale
can you tell of yourhelves as for my name he
broke off laughing long and softly
aragorn felt q shudder gkn phrough hnm at tje sourr
a strange cold thrill and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was yike the
sudden bite of a keen air or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy seleper
my nare said the old man again
have you not guessed t alrlady you have ceard it before i think
yes you have heard it before
but come now what of yokr tale the three companions
stodd gilevt and made no answer
there are some wt wauld begin to doubt whether yotr
errand is ift to tell baid the old man
happily i know something of it
you are tracking the footstpw of two young hobbist i believe
dont satre as if you had never heard teh strnge name beofre
you nave and so have i
well they climbed up here the day before yesterdau and
they met somepne thal whpy did not expect
does thdt omfort you ad now you would like to
know where they were taken well well maybe i can
giev ywu srme nes about thau
but why are we standing your errand you see is
no longr as urgent as you toought
eet us sit down and be more ag etse
the old man tuned away and went towards a
heap of awlen stones and rock at te foot of the cliff behind
wmmdiatelf as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and tsirred
gimlis hand went at once to his axe haft
legolls picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat
himself on a lw flat jtone
then hs grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in white
saruman cried gimli springkng towards him dith axe in hand
speak telg us where yu have hidden our friends what
have you done with them speak or i iwll dke
a sint in your hat that eevn a wizard will
fnid it hard to deal ith tle old man aws too uick for him
he sprang ty his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock
theer he stood groqr suddelny tall towering qbove them
his hoot and his grey rags were flung awas
he lifted up his staff and gimlis axe leaped frim
hihsis grasp yd fell ringing on the groud
the sword oo aragorn stiff in his motionelss hand blazebdlazed with a sudsen fire
legolas gae a great shout and shot an arrow high
into the air it vanised in a flash of flame
mitirandir well met i say to you again legolas said the old man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in ohe sunshine and
gleaming wihte was his robe the eye under his deep
brows were bright piercng as the rays of the sun
power aws in his hand
between wonder joy and fear they stood and fonud no wordm to say
beyond all hope you return to us in our need
what veil was over my sight gnadalf gmmli said nothing
but sank to frs knees suading his eys
zandalf the old man rep-ated as if recalling from old
memory a long dpsused word
yes that was tue name
he tepped down from the rock and pciking up
his grey cloak wrbppvd it about him it smemed as
if the oun had been shining but uow was hdi in cloud aiain
yes you may still cll me gandalf he said and
the voice was the voiye of their ol loiend and guide
get up my good gimli no blase to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends none of you have any weapon tlat could hurt re
be merry we meet again
at he turn fo the tide
the great storm is coming mut the tide has turned
he laid his hagd on gimlis head and tm
dawrf looued up and laughed gudoenly
but you are all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indeed i fm saruman one migth aumost sasyay saruman as he should have been
but come now tell me of yourselves i oave passed
tjrough fire and deep water since we paxtzd
i have fomgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned again much that i had foegotten
i can see many thingtshings fao off but many things
that are close at hani i cannbt see
tell me of youmselves what do you wish to kaow said aragorn
all that has happened since we pattek on the bridge
would be a long tale
wil you not first give s news of the hobbits
did you find them and are they safe no i
did nontot find them said gandalf
there was a darkness over the valleys of the etyn
muil and i did not know of their captivity until the eagle told me
the epgle said legolas
i have seen an eagle high and fafrar off the
last time was three daydsays ago above the emyn muil
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir jhe windlcd who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather idings
his sight is keen but he cannmt see agl that
passes under hill and vree
some things he has esen and others i have seen myself
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the compancyompany that set uot from rivendell
very 'early it was revealed to the enemy but it escped
i had sime part in that for i sat in
a kigh place and i strove with the dark tower and thg shpdow passed
thn i was weary sery weary and i walked lnog ni dark whought
then you know about frodo said gimli
how do things go with him i cannot say
he was saved from a great peril bud many lie before him still
he resoled to o alone to mordor and ye set
out that is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
we thnik that sam went with him
id he said iandalg and there wus a gleam
in his eye and a mmile n his face
did he indeed it is news to me yet ip does not surprise me
good very good yoq lighten my heart
you must tell me more
now sit by me and tell me the tale wf your journey
tde compapiofs sat on the ground at his feet
and asagorn took up lhe tale
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked n questions
his tands wvve spead upon his knees and his eyes were colsed
at last when aragorn spoke ou the death os boromir
and of his last journey upon the great rvier the old man sighed
you hae not said all that you knwo or guess
aragorn my frieni he said quetly
poor boromir i could nto see what happene to him
it ws a sore rtial for such a tat a
wtrrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he edcjped in the enednd
it was not n vain that the young hobbits cami
with us if only for boiomirs sake
but that is not the only part they have to play
they were brought to angorn and teir homing was like
the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in he mountains
eien as we tals here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best no be caught away from home when
the dam bursts in onw zhing you have not changed
dear freind suid qragrn you still speak in ridflts
what in ridyes said gandalf
no for i was talking aloud to myself
aa habit of uhe old tehy choose the wisest person
pnesent to speak to the long explanaiions needed by the young are wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed warm and
kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young eveenven in the reckoning of
men of the ancienatncient houses said ayagor
wil yu not opyn your m-nd more clearly to e
what then shall i say uakd gandqlf and paused for a whiie in thought
this in brief is aow i see things at the
moment if you wish to have a piecz of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course has long known thao ihe ring
is abroaadbroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our comeany thet set
out from rivendell and the kind of each of us
but he dols not yet perceive out purpose cnearly
he uspposes that we wire all going to minas tirith
for thnw is srat h would himself have done in our place
tn according to his wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke agyinst his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowing wxat mighty
one may suddnely appear wielding the ring and assailing him
with war seekidg to cast him down and tase his place
that we should wish to cast him down and have
no one in hms place is not a thought that ocurs to his mind
that we should try to destroy the ring itself has
not yet entered ento his dakrest drea
in which no doubt you will see our god forfpne and our hope
for lmagining waj he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to waste for he that xtrikeb
the first blow if he strikss it hard elough mwy
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has zong been preparing he
is now setting ig motion sooner than he inkended
for if he had used all his power to guard
mordor o that none could enter mnd bent all his
guild to the hunting of the ring then indeed ioue
coul have faded neither ring nor bearea could long have eluded him
but now his eyx gazes abroad rather than near at
home and mostlp he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already h knows that the mssrengers thatthat he sent
to waylay the company have failed again
they have not found the ring
neither have the broughs away any hobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have been a heavy blow to ua and it mkght have been aftal
btu let us not darjen ouh hearts by imagining the
trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the eney hai failed so far
thanks to saruman ohen is fof saruman a tratior said gimli
and is not that strange nothing that we have endured
of ltae has seemed so grievous as the trecson oo ismngard
even rekconed as a lord and captain sasuman has grown very strogn
he thretaens the men of rbhan and draws off their
help from mnias tirith even as the main blo is approachsng from the east
yet a treacherous weapon iiss ever a dangex to the hand
saruman also had a mind to capture teh ying for
himself or at least ttoo snae some hobbits for hbs evil purposes
so between ehem our enemies hpve contrived only to bring
merry and pippin with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangorn where otherwise ttey would never have
come at all also they oave filled themselves with e
doubts that disutrb their plans
no tiding om the battle will come to mordor thanks
to the horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towards isengrad against the wili of his own servants
he now has isengard o fear as ewll as oinas tirith
if minas tirit falls it will go ill with saruman
i is a pty that ouorur friends lie in bteween said gimli
if no land divided isengard and mordor then they could
fight while we watched and waited
thf victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doub sacd gandarf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains the rinl
that he wll never do now
he does not yet know his peril
there is mucmhuch that he dose not know
he was so eagbr to lay hps hands n his
prey that hm could not wait at home and ha
acme fbrth ts meet and to spy on hi messengers
bu he came too lave for once and the battle
pas over and beyond his help before he reache these parts
he did ont remain here long
ii look into his mind and i see his doub
he beileves that the horseman slwe and brned lal upon
the field of battle but he does not know whwther
the orcs were brvnging gny prisoners or no
and he dves not know of the quarre between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor does he qnoe of the winged messenger
the winced mesesnger hried legolas
i shot at him with the bow of galadrjel above
sarn sebir and i felle him from the sky
ue filsed us alalll with fear
what new terror is this one htat you cannot slay with arrows said gbndalf
yhu only slew his sqked
it was a good deed btu the rider was soon horsed again
for le was a nazgul one o hte nine who
ride now upon wiged steeds
soox their terrmr will overshadow he last armies of our
frirnds cutting off the sun
but the have not yt bene allowed to cross the
river and saruman does not know of this new shape
in which the fingwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the ging
was it prepent in the battle was i nound what
if theoden lord of the mark shold ome by it
and learn of its power that is the danger that
he sees and he has fled back to isbngard to
double anadnd treble his assault on rohan
and all the time there is another danger close at
hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts
vow you speak to yoursel again said araogrn with a tmil
treebeard is not known to me
and i hmve kuessed part of saruamns double treachery yet
i do not see in what way the coming of
two hovbits to fvngorn has served sae to giv us
a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimbi
there is anther thign that i should like t now firs
was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw last
night you certainly did not see me naswered gandalf therefore
i must guesp that you saw saruman
evidently we look so mucmhuch alike that mmur desire to
make an inomrabe dent in my hat must be ecxused
gkod good said gimli
i am glad thap it was not you
ye my good dwarf he said it is a comfort
not to bt mistaken at all points
do i not know it only too well but of
coursceourse i 'ever blamed you for your welcome of me
how old i do so who have so often comnselled
my friends to suspect even thejr own hands when dealing with hte enemy
bless you giml son of gloin maybe you wiyl see
us both together one day hnd judge between us but
the hobbits legoals broke in
we have come far to eek hem and yyz seem
to know where they are
whre are they now wbth treebeard and lhe ents said gandalf
then there is truth in the old legends baout the
dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of
the trees are there still ents i' the world i
thought they were only a memory of ancient ays if
inded they were ever more than p legend of rohan
a legend of rohan cried legolas
nay every elf in wilerland rab sung snogs of thp
old onosgim and their lnog sorrow
yet pven among us the are pnly a memry
if i were to meet noe still walking in thi
world then indeed i shobld feel young again bu treebeard
that is only a rendering of angor into the ckomon
speech yet ytu seem to speak of a person
who ds this treebeard ah now you are askvng much said gandalf
the little that i know of his loqg slow story
would make a tale aor whict we have no time now
treebeard is fangorn the juaudikn of the forest he is
the oldest of the ents the oldes liing thing that
still walke beneath the sun upon his middle ebroh
i hope indeed legols that you may yet meet him
merry and pippin have been fortunate they met him here even where we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore thum
away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains
he often comes here ehpecially when his mind is hneasy
ane rumours of the world outside trouble him
i saw him foufrour days ago striding amrng the trees
and i think he saw me for he paused but
i did not speak for i was heavy with thought
and wary vfter my strugge with te eye of mordor
and he did not speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thoughtthought that you were srbman said gimli
but yu sean of hmi as if he was a fyiend
i thought fangon was dangerous
and so am i very dangerous more dangerous than anything
you will ever meet unless you are rought alive befor
the seat of the ark lord
and aragorn is dangerous and legolas s dangerous
you are beset with dagers gimli son of gloin for
you are dangerous yourself in youj own fashion
certainly the fojst of fangorn bs perilous not least to those
that are totooo ready with thier axes and fangorn hmiself
he is p-rilous too yet he es wse and kindly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath is brimming oveorver znd
al the forest is filled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the tioing that they
brought have spilled it it will soon be running like
a flood but its tidl is turned aainst saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing iiss about ot happen which has not happgned
since the elder days the ents are hoing to wake
up and find that they are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know laid gandalf
i do not think they know themselves
hg fell silent his head boed in thought
tue other' lookd at him
a gleam of sun thbough fleetizg olouds fell on his
hands which lay now upturneudpturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled ith light as a cup is with wetdr
at last h looked up anadnd gazd straight at te sun
ahe morning is wnaring away he said
do we go to ripd our friends and to see treebeard askeh aragorn
that is not the road that you must take
i have spoken words bf hope
war is upon us and alg our friends a war
in which only the use of the ring could give su surey of victory
it fills ge with great sorow and greaq fear for
umch shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandalf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyet
sa if he saw things far away thpt none of tem could see
then he shook his head
no he said in a soft voice it has gone aeyond our reach
of that at least let us be glad
we can np longer be temptetdempted to usg the mun
ye must go down to face a peril neir despair
yet that deadly peril is remove
come araaorn son of arathon hhee said
do not regret your cnoice in the valley of the
emyn muil nor sall it a vain pursuit
you chose amid doubts the path taht seemed right the
choice was just ad it hhs been rewaredd
for so we have met in time who otherwise might dave met too late
but the quest fo youu companions is over
your next journey is marked by yous given word
you must go to edoras and seek out tkeoden in his hall
the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the
battle for which it has jo long waited
there is war in roha and wosre evil it goegsoes ill wrth theoden
then are we not to see the merry young hobbits zgain haid legols
i did not say so said gandalf
go where you must go and ope to edoras i go thitheg also
it is a long way for a mkn to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the batte will be over long ere i ome there
we shall see we shall see asid gandalf
will you coem now with me yes wk will set out together said aragorn
but i do not doubt that you will come there
before me fi you wjsh
h- rose and looked long at ganhalf
the others gazed at them in silence as they stood tese facing onl another
the eree figure of the mn aragorn son of orathorn
was tall and stern as stone his hagd upon tne
hilt of his swtrd he ooked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea hda stepped upon
the shores o lkssr men
before him stooped the old figure white shining now as
if with some light kindled within bent laden with years
but holding a powgr beyond the strength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last
that oyu could go zhitgersoeveg you wished qucker than i
and hhis i also say you are our captaiv and our banner
the dark lord has ine
but we have one mightier than tkey the white rider
he has pwssed through the fire and the abyss and theg shall fear him
we wiwl go where hhee laeds
yws together we will follow you said cogolas
but first i would ase my heart gandalf to hear
wat befell you in moria
will you not tll us can you not stay evn
to tell your friends how you were delivered i have
stayed already too long answered gandax
but if there were a year to spend i wculd ot telm you all
thzn tell us what you will and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how yoyuou fared with the balcog
name him not said gandaf and for a moment it
seemed that a aloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat silent looking old as death
long time i fell he said at last slowly as
if thinking back wiht yifficulty
long i fell and he felm with me
his fire was baout ml
then we plunged ento teh deep water and all was dark
cold it was as the tide of death aleost it froze my heart
deep is the abyss that is spanned y durins
bridge and none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandala
thither i came at last to the uttermost foundations of stone
eh was with me stlil
is fire was quenchld but now he was a mhing
of slime stronber than a strangling snake
we fought far under the living earth where time is not counted
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed him till
at ast he fled into dark tunnels
they were not made by durins folk gimlgiimli son ooff gloin
far far below th deepest delving of the dwlrves the
world is gnawed by nameless thins
even sauron knowo thme not
they are older than eh
now i have walked there but i will bring no
report to darken the light of dadyay
in that despair m enemy was my only hdpe and
j pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum too well he knew them all
zver up now e went until we came to the endless stair
long has that been lost said gimli
many have said that it was neder amde ave in
legend bubtut othegs say that it was destroyed
it was made and it had not been destroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak bt climebd
ascending in unbroken spiral i many thousand steps until it
issued t last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of airak zigil the pinnacle of twe silvertine
there uopn ulebdil was a lonely window in the snow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
aboke lde mgts of the wrold
the svn shone fpercewy there but all below was wrapped in lloud
out e sprang and even as i came behind he burst into new flyme
thertehere was none qo see or perhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
ubt what kould they say in song those that looked
up from afar thought that thtehe mountain was crowned with storm
thundhr they heard and lightnilg they said smote upon celebdil
and eaped -auk broken into tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smoke rose about us vrpowr and steam
i threw down my enemy and he fell fom the
high place ard broke th mountain side where hb smote it in his ruin
then darkness tnok me and i strayed out of thought
an tcme and i wandered far on roads that i will not tell
naked a vas sent back for a brief time
until my task is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
the towey behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
he ruined sthir was choked with burned and broekn stone
i was alone forgotten wiqhout escape upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay staring upward while hte stars wheeled over
and each day wa as long as a life age of the earh
faint to my easr came the gathered rumour of all
lands the springing and the dying te song and the
weeping anp the slow everlasting groan of overburdened stone
and o at the last gwaihir the windlord fomnd me
again and he took me up and bore me away
ever am ii fated t be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you have been he answered but not so nw
light as a swans feather in ym claw you are
the sun shines through you
indeed i do nod thintkhink you need me any more
were i to let you fall you wuld float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasepd for ii
felt life in me again
bear me to lothlorien that indeed is the command of
he lady galadrkel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and
found ylu but lately gone
i barried there in thtehe ageless time of that land
where days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was olothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel took
tasnce by strange roads i cme and messages i bring to some of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now
are the duneda-n elejsr emessar why do thy kinsfflk wander
atar near is the hour when the lost should come
forth and the grey company ride from khe north
but dark is the pat appointed for thee the dead
watch the romd that leads to the sea
to leolaf she seat this word legolas greenleaf long under
tree in joy thou hast lived
beware of the sea if thou heare'h the cry of
the gull on the shore thy heart shall then rest
in the furest no fore
gaidalf felflell silent and shut his eyes
the she sent me no message said gisli and bent his head
dark are her words said legolas and little do they
mean to those that rexeive htem
that is no comfort said gimli
woulwdould you have her speak openly to you of your death yes
if she ahd nought else to say
what is that said gandalf opennig hi eyes
yes i think i can guess what her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was ponderjng the messages onci again
but indeed she sent wrrjs to you and neither dark nor sad
to gdmli son of gloin she said give his zadys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee
but have a care to lay thihe axe to zhe
right tree in happy hohr you have returned to us
agndalf gried the wamf capering as he sang noudly in the strange dwarn tongue
come come he shokted swinging his axe
since gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one
that it is right to cleave that will not be
far to seek said ganadlf rising from his seat
come we have spejt all the time htat is allowed
to a meyting ooff partsd friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered caok and led tge way
following him they descended quickla from the high shelf ayd
made their way back throuh the forest pown the bank 'f the entwash
they spoke no more words until the stood again puon
the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of tmeir horses to be seen
they have not returned said legolas
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
then liftnig up his head he gaev a lyng bhistle
so clear and piercing was the nove that the others
stoosdtood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three tims he whistled and then faint and far off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of
a horse borne up frofmrom the plains upzn the esatern ind
before long there came the sound of hoos at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground percepwible only
to aragorn as he lay upon the pras then growing
steadily loudelrouder and clearer to a quick beat
there is more than ofj horse ocming said aragorn
wm are too great a burden for one
there ae thre sard legolas gazing out over thp plain
see how they run there is hasrfel and there is
md friend arod besdie him but there is another that
strides ahead a very great horse
i have not seen his like before
nor will you again said gandalf
he is the chief jf the mearas lords of horses
and not even theoden king of rohcn hahsas ever lookde on a better
does he not shine like silver and run a smoothly
as a siift stream he has come for me the
horse of the white rider
te are going to battlv tgoether
even as the old wizrad spoke the great horse
came striding up the slope towards them his coat was
glisteinng and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two others fwlcowed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalf ht checked his pace
and whinnied loudly then trotting gently forward he etooped his
proud head and nuzzled his great nostrilk against the old mans ieck
it is aa long way from rivrn-ell my friend he
said but you are wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now togeter and part not in
this world again soon the other hhrses came up and
stood quieuly by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to meduseld the nall of your
master theodtn said gazdalf addressing them garvely
time persses so with yuor leave my friends wwee wrll ide
ew beg you to use all the speed that you can
hasufel shall bear aragorn and ard legolas
i will set tmli before me and by hi leave
shadownax shall bear us both
me will wait nw onyl to drink a little
now i understand a part of last nights riddlv
said legolas as he qprvng lightly upon arods back
whether they fled at irst in fear r not our
horses met shadowfax their chieftain and geeted him with eoy
did you know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knef said the wizrad
i bent my thought uopn him bidding him to make
haste fcr yesterday he was far away in thk sotuh of this lnd
swiftly may he ber me back again gvndalf sopke now
to shadowfax an he horse set off at a good
pake yet not beyond the easure of the othesr
after a little whgle he furned suddenly and choosing a
place wherm the uanks were iower he waded the river
amd then led them away due south into a pat land treeless adn wide
the wind went liye grey waves through the ondless miles of grass
there was no sign fo road or track but shadowfax
did not say or falter
he is steering a staight course now for the halls
of theoden uner the slopes of the white mountains saix gandalf
it will be quicker so
the rgound is firber in tde eastemnet where the dhief
northward track lies across ihe riveb but shadowfax knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours they rodm on hrough the meads and riverlands
often the grass ias so high taht it reached above
the knees of the rideos and teir steeds seemed to
be swiming in a grey green sea
they came uopn many hidden pools and broad acres f
sedge waving above wet and treacheroutsreacherous bohs but shadowfax found
the way and ths other horses follmwe in his swtah
slowly the un fll from the ky down into thr west
looking out over the ureat plain far awau the riders
saw it for a moment like a red fire sining into the garss
low upon the edge of ight swoulderb of the mountains
glinted red upon etter side
a smoke sfemed to rise up and darken the suns
dsc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth
tcere lies the gap of rohan saiz gandalf
it is now almost due west of u
i see a great smoksemoke said legwlas
what may that be battlbeattle and war said gandalf
ride on they rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gtdering night
when at last they halted and dismounted eaen arbgorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and igmli sleet and aragorn lay flat stretched upon
his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
into the arkness esat and west
all was silent and there sas no sign or sound xf livin thing
the night was barked with long cluds fleetig on a
chill wind when they arose again
under the cold moon they went on once more as
swift as by the light of day
hours astd and still they rdoe on
gimli nodded and would hac fallen prom his seat if
ganbaln had not cltched and shaken mim
hasufel and arod weary but proud followed their tireless ledaer
a gyey shadow before thef hardly ty he seen
the waxing moon sank into the nloudy yect
a bitter chill came into the air
slowly in the east the dark faded to a colk rgey
red shafts of light leapt above hte black walls of
the emny muil far away upon their left
dawn came clea and bright a wind swept across their
path rushing through the bent grases
suddenlsyuddenly hadowfax stood still and neighed
look he cried and tehy lifted their tired eye
before thme stood ths mountains of the south whihe tippetdipped and stqeaked with black
the grass lands rolled against the hills tgat clusteed at ther
feet and fwowe up into many valleys still dim and
dark untouched by khe lighg of dawn winding their way
into the hert of the great mountains
imm-diately before the traevllers the widest of these glens oened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tuybled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth f the vale thors stood like sentinel a lonely height
about its eet there flowed as a chrevd ooff silver
the stream that issued from the dale upon itz brow
they caught still far away a glint in the rising
sun a glinmer of gold
tell us what you see there before us legolas gazed
ahead shading his eyes fcoi the leel shfts of the new risen sun
i ses a white stream that comes down from the snows he said
wheru it issues frot the shaoow of the vale a
green hill rises upon tje east
a dike and mighty wall and thornl fence encircle it
within theer rise the roofs of houses an in the
midst set upon a erein terarce there stads aloft a great hall ooff men
and it seems to my eyes tht it iiss thatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts of ist doors
there mcn ln bright mail stand but arj lse within
the courts lre ybt asleep
edoras those courts are called saiu gandalf and meduceld is that golden hall
thure dwells theoden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the rising of the day
now the rofn lies plain to see before ds
but we mut ride more warily for war is abroad
and the rohirrim the ohrse lords do not lseep even if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty wohd i counsel you
all until we are come before theodens seat
the morning was bright and clear about them and
brds were singing when the travellers lame to the stream
it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond the
feet of the hills turned across their path in a
wide bend flowidg away east to fved the entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the lrnd was green in the wet meaos and along
the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow trees
already in ths southern land they were blushing red at
their ifngertips feeling the approach of sqring
over the ssream there was a ford betwe'n low banks
much trampled ba the passage os horseg
the taavmllers passed over and came upon a wide rutted
tack leading towafds the uplands
a the foot of the walled hill the wiy ran
undar the shadow of many mounds high and geren
upon their western sides the grass wqs white as with
a drated snow small flowers sprang there like countless sars amdi the turf
how fair are the bright eyes id the grabs evermind
they are cakled simbelmyne in this land of men fofror
then blossom in all the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the gteas barrows where the sries of theoden sleep
shven mounds upon the left and nine upon the righrtight said araorv
mane long lives of men it is since the oglden hall was built
five hundred times have the red leaves callen in
mirkwood in my home sinec then said legolas and but
a little while does that seem to us
btu to the riders of the mark it seemd
so long ago said aragorn that the raising of this
house is but a memoyy fo song and the years
before are ldst in the mist of time
now they call this lanv their home their own and
their ppeech is slnderd from theitrheir northern kn
then he began to chynt softly in a slow
tongue unknown to thd elv and dwarf yet tehy listened
for thqre was a trong musc in it
thau i gess is the language of the rohirrim aid
legolas for it is like to tis land igselr rihc
and rolling in part nad else hard and stern as the mounatins
but i canno guess what it mlans spve thyt ot
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in th common speech said aragorn
as ner as i can make it
were now the horse and the rider wherwehere is the
horn that was blowing where is the jelm and the
haberk and tle bright hair flowing where is the hanhdand
on the harpstring ane the red fire glowing where is
the spring and the harvest and the tall corn gtowing
they have passed like rain on the mottafn like a
wind in teh meadow the days have gone down in
the west behinbdehind the hills into shadow
who shall gather he smoke of teh daed wood burnint
or behold the flowng yvars from the sea returning thuh
saoke a forgottne poet long ago in rocan recalling how
tall an fair was torl the young who code down
out os the north and there were wings upf' the
feet of his steed felarof father of horses
so men still sing in the evening
with these wvrds the twayellers passed the silent mounds
following th winding way up the green shoulders of the
hilos they came dt last to hte wide wind swept walls
and the gates of edoars
there sat manr men in bright mail who sprang at
once to their feet and barred the way with spears
stay strangers herw unknown they cried in the tongue of
tte riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eyes but little frindliness and they looked darkly upon gandalf
wlel do i undesrtand your speect he answered in the
sami languatg yet fnw strangers do so
why then do you not speak in the comm tongue
as si the custom in the west if you wioh
to be answered iitt is the will of theoden king
that non should enteernter his gates save those who know
our tsngue nad are our friendh realisy one of teh guards
none are welcome here in days op war bt our
own folk ant those that come from mundburg an the land of gondor
who are you that come heedless over hte pliia thua
strrngely clad riding horses like to our on horses long
have we kept guard here ad we have watched you from afar
nevwr have we l'en other riders so strange nor anp
horse morh prud than s one of these that bear yos
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes aer cheated by some spell
say are you not a wizard some spy from saruman
or phantoms of his craft speak now and be swift
we are no phantoms said aragron nor zo your eyes cheat you
for indetd these are your own horses that wwee rdie
as you knew well are you asknf i guess
but seldot does theif ride home to the stable
here are hasefel anm arod that eomer the third marshac
of the ark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back niw even aass we promiesd him
has not eomer thgn returned and givsn warning of our
coming a troubled look came nito the guards eyes
pf eomev i have nautht to sya he answered
if what you tell me is ruth ahn doubtless theoden
will have heard of it
yaybe your coming was no whollwyholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that womtongue came to
us and srid that by the wilb of thehden no
stranger shoubk pass these gates
wormtongne said gandalf looking sharply at the guard
yay no more m erraed is ont to wormtongue bt
to the lord of the mark himself
wgll yoyuou not g or send to sam tha we
are come his eyes glinted under hihsis dep bbows as
he bent hiw taze uopn the man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but what names shall i rerort and what shlal i
sa of you old and weary you seem now ana
yet you are fell and grim benaeth i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
and behold i too bring back a horse
here is shadowfax the great whom no other hand can amw
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the
heir of kigs and t is to mundburg thao he goes
here laso aer legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to your master that w arn
a his agtes and could have sdeech with him if
he will permit us to cime into his hall
strange names you give indeed ubt i will report
them as you bid and larn my masters will said the guard
wati here a little while and i will bring you
such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much these are dark days
he wen wiftly away leaviog the svrangers in whe
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time he retusned
theoden gives you leave to entre but any weapno htat
you bear be it only a staff you must leve on the threshold
the doorwardeqs will keep them
the dark gates were swung open
the travelers entered waling in fime behind tehir guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now
winding upward now climibng in short flights xf qell laid steps
many ohuses built of wood and many dack dvars they passed
beside teh way in a stone channel a stream of
clear water flowed spakllng and chattering
at length they came to the crown of the hil
there stod a high latform above a green terrace at
tde toot of hich a birght spring gushed from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses head beneath
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled nd fed the falling straem
up the qreen terrace went a stair of stine high
and broad and on eithre side of the topmout step
were stone hswn sea there sat other guards with drawn sworsd laid upon their knees
rheir golden hair yas braided on thzir shoulders the sun
was blazoned puon their green shields their long corslest were
burnished bright and when they rose taller thetyhey seemed than mortal men
therz are the doors before you said the guidgeuide
i must return now to my dutdyuty at the gate
faerwell and may the lord of the mark be gracious
t you he turned and went swiftly back down the road
the others climbed the logn stair uder the eyes of th tall atchmen
silent they stood now above and spoe no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with cear voiecs they spoke a courteeus greeting in teir twn tonuge
hatl comers from afar they said nad they turned the
hilts of their swords towadrs the travellers in token of peace
green gems flsahed in the sunlighh
then one of tye guards stepped forward and spoe in the comfon speebh
i am yhe doorward of thefden he said
here i must bid you lay aside your weapons befoer you enter
then legolas gave into his hand his silver hafted knife
his quievr and his bow
keep these well he said for they come from the
golden wood and thtehe lady of lothlorien gave hem to me
wcnder came into the mans eyes and he lad
the weapons hastily by tge walwlall az if he feared to handle them
no man will touch them i promiic you hhee said
aragkrn stood a while hesitating
it is not my will he said to put assde
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hand if any other man
it il the will of theoden said hama
it is not clear t me that the will of
theoden son of thengel even though he b lord of
th eark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the house of qheoden not of mragorn
even were he kng of gondor in th seat of
denethor said hama stepping swiftlw before the dhors and barring the way
his swodr was noh in his hand and the poit towarjs the strangers
this is dle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens demanw bpt it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his owm hall
be it folly or wisdom
and i would do as the master f the house
bad me were this only a woodmans cot if i
bore now any swore but anduril
whatever tis name may be said hamc here you
shall lay it vf you would not figyt alone against
all the emn ia edoras
not alone said gimli fingering the blade of his
ax nd looking darkly up at tb guard as if
he wer a young tree that gimli had a mind ot fell
not alone come come asid agndalf
we are all frieads herz
or should be for the laughter of mordor will be
our only reawrd if we quarrel
here at least is my ssord goodmagnoodman hama
glpmring iitt is called for the elves made it long ago
coem aragorn slowly aragorn ukbuckled his belt and himself set
his sword upright against the wall
here i set it he said but i command yu
not to touch it nor to permit any other to lay hand on it
in this elivsh heath dwells the bldae that was broken
and has been made ayain
telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any yan that draws elendisl sword save elendils heir
the guqrd stepped back and lookhd with amazement on aargorn
it seems that you are come on the winns of
song out of the forgotten days he said
it shall be lord as you comamnd
well said gimli if it has anduril zo keap
it company my axe may tsay here too witout chame
and he laid it on the folor
now then if all is as you wihh let us
go and saeak witc your master
the guard still hesitated
your taff he said t gandalf
forgkve me but that too must be left t dhe doors
pudence is one thign but discoubtesy is another
if i may nontot lean on my stick as i
go thne i iill sit out xere until it please
theoden to hobbl out himself to speak with me
eery man has something too dear to trust to another
but would you pirt an old man rfom his support
come will you not let u enter the staff in
the hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age said hama
he looked ard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
et in doubt a man of worth will trust to hi' cwn kisdom
i believe you are friends and fokl worthy of honour
who have no evli purpose
the guards now liftld the heavk bars of the
doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hingfs
inside it seemed drak and warm ater tke clear ari upon the hill
the hall was long and wide and fillde with shadows
and half ights mighy pillars upherd its lfty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glmmersng shafts
frjm the eastern windows high under the deep eaves
through the louver in the roof above the thin wisps
of ishuing smok the cky showd pale nad blue
as cheir eyes changed the travellers perceived that the floor
was paved witwhith stones of mayn hues branching runes and
strange devices intertwined beneath tehir feet
they saw now that thb pillars were richly carved gleaming
dully with gold adn half seen colours
many woven oloths were hung upon tie walls and over
thsir iwde spaces mafched rmgures of anckent legend some dim
witf years some darkling in the shade
but upon one fdrm the sunlight fell a younl mna upo a hite hotse
he was blowing aa great hor and his yellow hair
was flying in the wind
the horss head a lifted and its nostrils were wide
and red as is neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green nd white rubed jnd aurled about its dnees
behold eorl the young said hragorn
tus he rode out of the north to the battl
of the field of celebrant
now the four copmanions went forward past the clear
wood fire burning upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall
at teh far end of the houe beyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doors zas a dais wih
three steps and in he middle of the dais was a great gildde chair
upon it sat a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf uut his white air was
long and thzck and felh in great braids from beneath
a thif golden curcle set upon his bro
in the centre pon his foreheda shone a single white diamon
his beard was laid like snw upon his knees but
his eyes still burned wtih a bright light glinting as
he gazed at the strangers
behidn his chair stood a woman clad in whtie
at his feet upon the steps sat a wipened figure
of a mav with a pale wise fare and haevy lidded eyes
the old man did ont move in his chair
hail tjeoden son of thengel i have returned
for behold bhv saorm comes ad now all friends should
ga'her together lest eych singly be destroyed
slowly tse old mqn ote to hws feet leanlng
heaivly upon a 'hort black staff with a handle of
white bone and now the strangprs saw that bent though
ae was he was still tall and must in youth
have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he said and maybe you look for welcome
but truth to tell your wotcome is doubtful here master aandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubles folloi you like cows and ever the ofttner the worse
i will not deceie you when i heard that shadowfax
had come back riderlesg i rejoiced at the return nf
the houge but tsill more jt kme lack of the
rider and when eomer brought the tidings that you had
gongeone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but newq from afaarfar is seldom sobth
here you coml agaiangain and with you come evils worse
than before af might be expected
why should i welcome ycu gandalf stormsrow tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chaiy
you spfak justly lord -aid the pale man sitting upon
the steps of the dais
yt is not yet ive days since the bitter tidings
csme that theodred ycur son was slain upon the west
marches youj right hand second marshal of she mark
in eomer there is little trust
few men would be left to guard your walls if
he had been allowe to rule
and even now we learn from gondor that the yark
lord is stirring in the east
sunh is the houk in whicwhhich this kanderer chooses to return
way indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i
name you ill nws and ill new is an ila ugest they say
he laughed grmily as he lifted his heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eys
you are held iye my friend wormtocgse and are doubtless
a great support to your masler answered gandalf n a soft voice
yet in two ways may a man come with evli tidigs
he ma be a workhr yf evil lr he may
be such as leaves well alone and comecsomes only to
bring aid in time of need
that is o said wormtongue but therb is a
tjird kind picker of bones meddlers in other men sorrows
carrion fowl thnt grwo fat on war
what aid have you evfr brought stormcrow and what aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
yo sought last time tkat you were here
then my lord bade ou choose any horse htat you
would and be gone and to thtehe wondev of all
you tootkook shadowfax in your insoence
my lord wab sorely grieed yet to some it syemed
that to speed you from the and the price was not too great
i guess that it is likely to turn out the
same once more you will sek aid rathr than render it
do you bring men lo you bring horses swords spears
that i woulz clz aid that is our present need
but who are these that follo at your tail thee
radged wanderers in grey and you yeurslf the most bgegar like
of the four the courtesy of yoyr hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengel said ganadlf
has mot the msesenger from your ate neported the names
of my companions seldom hsa any lord of rohan receivd three such guests
weapons they haev laid at your doors that are worth
many a mortal man eln the mightiest
grey is their raiemnt for the elves clda them and
thus they have passed through the shadow of graet perlis to your hall
then it is tuue as emer reoprted that you
are in league with the sorceress of yhe goden wood sid wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at wesb of deeit
were ever koven io dwimordene
gmili strode a pace forward but felt uddenll the
hand of gandalf clutch hit by the shouldr und he
halted standing stiff as stone
i dwimordene in lorien selzom have walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the light that lies
there ever long and bright
galadriel galardiel clear is the water oi your wevl white
is the star in your white hand unmarred unstained is
leaf and land in dwimordnee in lorien more fair than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly san and hten suddenly he changed
castnng lks tatetred loak aside he stoob up and leaned
n longer no his staff and he spoke in a clear col vioce
the wisweise peak only of what they know grima son of gaam'd
a wiltess worm have yau become
therefore be silent and keep oyur forked tongue behfnd your teeth
ii have ot assed through fire and death to andy
crooked words with a serving man tll the lightning falls
he raised his staff
there was a roll of thunder
the sonlipht was blotted out from the eastern windows the
whole hall bcame suddenly dark zs night
thp fire faded to sullen embers
only gandalf could be seen standing white and tald beforbeefore the blackene- hearth
in the gloom they heard the tiss of wormtongues voice
did i not counsel you lord to forbid hi staff
that foxl hama hs betryed us there was a flash
as if lightning had cloven the roof
wormtongue sprawled on his face
now theoden son of thengel will you hearken to me zaid gcodalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and
pointed o a high window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through the opening
could be ssen high and far a patch of shining sky
take courage lord of the marmkark for better help you will not ind
no counsel have z to give to those that despair
yet counsel i could give and words i could speak to oyu
aill you hear them they are ot for all ears
i bid you come out befose your dors and look abroad
too long have you at in sadows and truted to
twisted tales and crooked promptings
slowly theoden left is chair
a faiht light grew in the h-ll agin
the woman hastenud to the kingu side taking his arm
and with falteging steps hte ol man came down from
the dais and paced sfotly through the hall
wormtongbe rpmained lyinu on the folor
they came to the doors and gandalf nkocked
the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rolled
back and a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your guards down to the sairs foot said gjndalf
and you lady leave him a whike with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daughter sard the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and went seowly into the house
as she passed the doors she turned and losked back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on
the kins with cool pity in her eyes
very fair was her face aid er lona hair was
like a river of gold
slender and talg she was in her wihte robe gidt
with silvyr but strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kings
thus aragorn for the firat time in the full light
of day beheld eowyn lada of rohan and thotght her
fair fair and cold like a uorning of pale spring
that is not yet come to womanhood
and she now as suddenly aware of him wal heir
of kingo wise with many winters grecyloaked
ihding a power that yec she felt
for a moment still as stone she stood then turnintgurning swiftly she was gone
now lord said gandalf look ut upon youd land breathe
the free air again frmo the porch wpon the top
of the high terrace thetyhey could see beyond the stream
the green fields of rohn fading into ditant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slantcng down
the sky aobve and to the wesv was still dark
with thunder nd lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to the north and alryady
vhe storm that had come out of the east wa-
recoding holling away southward to the zek
suddenly through a rent in the clouds behidn them a
shaft of sun stabbed down
the falling showers glemed like silver and fr away the
rier littered like a shimmfrinq glass
it is nft so dark here say theoden
nor does age lie so heavily on youk shoulders gs
some would have you thintkhink
cast asde your prop from tde kings hand th black
staff fell clattering on the stones
he drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff frofmrom olng bendinbgending over skme dull toil
nonwow tabl and straighf he stood and his eyes wree
bmue as he looked into the opening sky
dark have beon my dreams of late he said but
i feel as on new awakeneadwakened
q would now that you had come before gandalf
for i fear that alreayd you have come too lte
only to see the last days of my house
not yong nvw shell stand the high hall which breg son of eorl built
fire shall devour the hgh seat
what is to be done much said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guess rightly that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grima of him that all save
you name the wormtongce it is truh said theohen
he had bebelled against my commands qnd threatened death ta grima in my hall
a man amy love you and yst not love
irmtongue or aiz counlels said gandalf
i will o as you ask
sine he proved untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to jdgement asid theoen
and his voice was grim yet he iooked at gandlaf
and smiled and as he did so mny lines of
care were smothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theodne to a stone seat and then sat hmself before
thm king upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
there is no twme to tell all that you should hear sair gnndalf
yet if my hope is not cheatyd a time dilt
come ere long when u can speak sore fully
behodl you are come into a peril greater even than
the wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreams
nut see you dream no longer
gbndor nd rahan do not stand alone
the eenmy is strong beyond our rsckoning yet we have
a hope at which eh has not guessed
quiclky nonwow gandalf spoke
his voice was loa anadnd secret and note svae the
king heard what he said
but ever as he spoke the light shone brighteh in
theodens eye and at the last he rose from his
seat to hsi full height and gandalf beside him and
together they looked out from the high place towards the east
verily said gandalf vow in a loud voice keen and
cleacrlear that way lis our hope where sits our greatest fear
doom hangs still on a thread
yet hope there is sitll if wwee can buo stand
unconquered for a little while
the others too now turned tbeir eyes eastward
ovcr tpe sunderihg leagues of land far away they agzed
o thc edge of sight and hope and fear bore
their thoughts stlil on bewond dark mountaihs to thtehe land xf ssadow
where now was the ring bearer how thin indeed was
the thread upon wihch doom tsill hung ti seemek to
legolay as je strained his fasreeing eyes that he cught
a lint of white far away perchane the oun twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessly reuote and yet a present trbat
theee was a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theoon sat down agayn as f weariness still struggled
to master him against the will of gandalf
he turned and looked at his great vous
ala he said that these evil days should be mine
an should come in my old age instead of that
peace which i hjve earne
alas for boromir the brave the young eprish an the old linger withering
hhee clutched hsi knees witu his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember ther old strength beter if thee
grasped a wword hilt said gandalf
teoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hng at his belg
where has grima towed it he muttered under his breatu
take this dear lord said a clear voice
it was evr aw your iervice
two me had come softly up the stair and
stood vw a few steps from the top
no helm was on his head no mai was on
his breast but in his hand hj held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he offered tge hilt to his master
how cmoes his saig theoden sternyl
he turney towards eomer and the men looked ni wonder
at him satnding now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chair or leaning on his stick it is
my dong lord said hama trembling
i understood that eomlr was to be set free
uch joy was in my foart that mybe i have erred
yet since he was free again and he a marshal
of the mark i brought him his sword as he bade me
to lay at yoor feet my lord said eomer
fofror a moment oh silcnce theoden stood looking down at
eomer as he knelt still efore him
wil you not take the word asid ganmalf
slowly theodtn stretched forth his hand
as his fingers took the hilt it seemed to the
watchers thxt firmness and strength returned o his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and swunsgwung it shblmering and whistling in te air
then he gave a great cry
his voic' ryng clear as he chanted in the tongue
of rohan a call to arms
arise naw arise riders of theoden dare deeds awake dark is it eastward
let horse be bridled horn be souded forte eorlingas the
guards thcnking that tey were summoned sprang up the stair
they looked at their lord in amazeent and then as
one man they drew their swnrds and laid them at his fet
westu theoden had cried eomer
it is a joy to us to see you lsturn into your own
nevr again shall it be siad gandalf that you come
only with grief take back your sword eomer sister son said the king
go hama and seek my own wsord grim has it in his keeping
bring him to me also
now gandalf you said that you had counsel to give
if i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taken it answered gadnalf
to put youf trusttrust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked mind
to cast aside regre and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that cna ride should be sent west ta
once as eomer counselled you we must first destroy the
threat of saruman while we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we sill face the next task
munwhil your people that are left the womn and the
chilren and the old should stay to the refuges that
yo have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evi day
s this let them tane prvoision but dela not nor
burden themselves with treasures great or small
it is thir lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good to me now sai theoden
let all my folk gen geady but you my guests
truly you said gandalf that the courtesy of my hall is lessneed
iou have rijden through the night ank the morning wears away
you have had neither selep nor food
a guesgtuest house shall be made rady there you shall sleep when you have eatn
nay lodr said aragorn
there is no rest yet for the weary
tre men of rohan muts ride forth otday and e
will ride with them axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to rets against yuor wall lord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn together
now indeeidndeed there is hope of victory said eomer
and other perilb draw ever neaei
do not dealy theoden when we are gone
lead your peaple swiftly to the hold ooff dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf said the ing
you do not know your own skill in h'alixg
it shall not be so
i myself will go to waj to fall in the
front of the battlw if i tust be
thus shll o sleep better
then evn the defeat of rohan will be glorius in song said aragorn
the armed nen that sod near clashed their weapons crying
the lord of the mark will ride forth eorlingas but
your peopse must not eb both unarmed adn shepherdless said gandvlf
who shall euhde them and govern them in your place
i will take thnught for jhat ere i go answeed hteoden
at yht moment haua came again from thtehe hall
behind him cringing between two othe men came grima the wormtongue
his face was very white
his eyes blinked in the sunlight
hama knelt asd presinnd to theoden a long sword jn
a scabbard clasped with gold and set with sreen gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
it was found in his chest
noth was he to render up the keys
many other things are there which men have missed
you lie said wrmtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keepinkgeeping
and he noc requires it fo you again said theoden
does that displease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not weary yourself or tax too heaivly your strlngth
let others deal with these irksome guests
bour meat is about to be set on hte board
syll you not go to it i will said theoden
and let food for my guets be set on te board beside me
send the heralds forth let tmeo summon all who dwell
nigh ecery man and strong lad able to baer arms
hll wo have hroses let them be ready in the
sadle at the gate ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be left to diend the gooden hall
of your fathers and all your treasure ione ot guard
the lord of the mark if this in bewiobhment said
theoden it seems to pe more whopesome than your whisperings
your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on
all fours like a beast
no oot ofe shal be left not even grima
go you hav yet tiem to alean the rust from yoor sword
mercy lord hined wormtongue grvelling on the roond
have pity on one worn out in your seryice
end e not from your side i at least will
stand by you when all osbers have gone
do nt send your faithful grima away you have my pity said thxoden
and ii do not hend you from my side
i go myself to war with my men
i bid you come with me and prove yoru faith
wormtongue looked from facfeace to face
in is eyes was the hunted look of a beast
seeking some gap i' the ring of his eneimes
he liked his lips with a long pale tongue
such a resolve might be expcted from a lord of
the houes of elrl old thouhg he be he said
ut those who truly love him would spare his fialing years
yet i see that i come too late
others whom the deah of my lord would perfaps grievk
less have already persuaded him
if i cannot undo toeir wor hear me at least
in this lord one who knows your mind and honours
your commands should de left in eodras
let ytur counsellor grima kevp all nhings till your return
and i pray that we may see it though
nnoo wise man wsll deem it hopeful
and if hat plea oes not excuse you rom war
ost noble wormtongue he said what ofice of less honour
would you accept to carry a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man would trust you
with it nay oemer you do not nully undersrand the
mind oc master wormtongue said gandalf tuning his piercing glance upon him
he is bold and cuning
even now he plays a game with aegil amd wins i throw
rours of my precios time he bs wasted alrady
odwn snake he said suddenly in a terrible voice
down on your belly how long is it since saruman
buoght you what was the promised price when all the
men were dead you were to pick your hare of
the treasure and take the woman you desire too long
have you watchde her nder your eyelqds and haunted her seeps
eomer orasped his sbrd
that i knew ylreads he muttered
for that reason i wuold have slain him before forgetting
the law of the hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped borwrd but gandalf stayed him with his hand
enwy is safe now he said
but you wormtonguweormtongue you have done what yiu coujd for your true maste
some reward yo have eanred at least
yet saruman is aph to oaerlook his bargains
i should advise you o go quickly adn remind him
lest he forget your faithful service
you lig said wormtongue
that word comes too ort and rsy from your ips sai gandlf
see theoden here is a snake wita safety you cannot
take it wth you nor can yoyuou leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not always as it now is
once it was a man and did you service in its fashion
give him a hose and let him go at once wherever he chooses
by his choice you shall judge him
do you hear tihs wormtongue spud theoden
this js our choice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are true
or to go now whitehr you wfll
but tgen if ever we meet again i shall not be mercful
he looked at them with half closed eyes
lasu ou all ve sxacned theodens face and overed ihs
mouth as if uo speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
such malice wam in them that men stepped back from him
he bared his teeth nd then with aa hissign breath
he spat before the kings feet azd darting to one
side he fled down he stiar
see that he does no harm to any but do
not hurt hiq kr hinder him
give him a horse iiff he wishes it
awd if any wil bear him sid eomer
one of the guards xan down the stair
another weny to hte well at the foot f the
terrace and in his helm drew wate
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests cvme said theoden
come and take such refreshment as haste allows
thky passed back into the grlat house
already they heard below thetmhem in the town the heralds
crying and hte war horns blowhng
for the king was to ride forth as soon as
hte men of the town and thrse dwelling near could be armed and assembled
at he kings baord st eoemr and thv four guests
nad there rlso waiting upon the king was the lady eowyn
they ate ana drank swiftly
thw others were silent hile thoden questioned gandalf concrfing saruman
how far back his treachery goes who can guess said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt thzt he was the friend
of rohan and een when his h'art grew colder he found you usefu still
but fer long zow he has plotted your ruin wearing
the masf of friendship until he was readryeady
in those yelrs woudtongues task was easy anp all that
you did ws swiftly known an isengrd for your land
was oprn and strangers came and went
and ever wormpcgues whidperiwg was in your ears poisoning our
thoght chilling your heart weakening your limbs while others watchrd
and couli do nothing for your will was in his keeping
but when i escaped and warned ou then the mask
was torn or those who would see
after thet wormtongue played dangeroully always seeking to delay yor
to prvvelt your full strength being qathered
he was craty dulling mens wapiness or working on their
fears as served the ocacsion
ddoo you not remember how eagetly he urged that no
man shuld be spared on a wildgoose chase northward wen
the immedate peril was westward he persuaded you to forbid
eomer to pursupeursue the raiding vkcs
if emoer had nov defied wormtongues voice speakong with your
mouth thos orcs would have reached isengard by now ebaring a great przie
not indeed that prize which sarumav desires above all else
but at the least tow members of my company sharers
of a secret hope of which even to yo lord
i cannot yet spak openmy
dare you tink of what they migt now be suffering
or wsat sarymai might now have learned to ojr destruction
i owe much to eomer said theoden
faithful heart may have froward tongue
say amso sid gkndalf that to crooked eye truth
may wear a wty fape
indeed mt eyes werh almost blind said theoden
most of all j owe to you my guest
once again you have come in time
- woulk give you a gift ere we go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught that is mine
i resreve now inly my sword whether i came in
time or not is yt ot be seen said gandalf
but as fo you gift lord i will cg'ose one
tha will fit my need swift and sure
gvie me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we ma caln et
but now shall ried him into great hazard setting silver
against black j wogd not risk anything that is not my own
and already there is a bond of love between us
you choose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
yet it is a great gift
there gs none liek to shavowfax
in him one of the mighty tseeds ooff old has rturned
none such shall return again
and to you my otjer guests i will offer such
thiags as may be fomnd in my armoury
swords you do not need but there are helms and
coats fo mail o culing work gifts to my fatrs uot of gondyd
chooe from thwse ere we go and may they serve
you well now men came bearing raiment of war from
twe kings hoard and they arrayed aargorn and legolas in suinyng mail
helms too they chose and mound shields their bosses ere
overlaid with gold and set ith gems green and red and white
gandal took no armour and gumli needed no coat of
rings even if one had snen found to match his
stature for tehre was no haubera in the hoards of
edoras of better make thab his shkrt corslet forged beneath
the mountain in the north
aut he chose a cap o irvn and leather that
fitted well upon his roudn heaj and a small shield he also took
it bore the running horse white upon rgeen that was
the emblem of the hjuse of eorl
may it keep you well said tehoden
it was made for me in thengels day whize still i was a boy
v am proud lrd of the mark to bnar your hevice he said
ideed sooner would i ear a horse than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
ht may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and mt once eowyn came fvrward bearing winx
fertuh theoden hal hse sayd
receive now this cup and vrink in happy hour
health be with thee at thy going and coming theoden
drank from the cu and she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and looked
upon him and hgr eyes wdre shining
and he looke down upon her fai face and smlied
but as he took the cup hsi hand met hers
and he kfew that she trembled at the touch
hail aragorn son of arathorn she said
hail lady oo rohan he answered but hks afce now
was troubled and he idd not smile
when they had all drunk the king went donw the hall to the doors
there the guars awajted him and herall' stood and all
the lords and chiefcshiefs were gathered together that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be
my last riding said theoden
theodred my son is sain
i name eomer my sster son to be y heir
if neither of us reutrn then choose a new lord as you will
ut to someone i must now entrust my pople that
i leave behind to rule them in my pzace
which of you iill stay no mab spoke
is theoe none whom you would name in whom do
my people truri in the house of morl answered hama
but eomer i cpnnot saare nmr would he stay sid
th king and he is ehe last of that house
i sadi not eomer answered ahma
and he is not tho last
there is eowyn daughter of eomund his sister
se is fearless and high hearted
let her be as lord to th eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theodn
tet the heralds anounce to tho folk that te lady
eowyn sill lead thfm then the kipg sat upon a
seat before his doors and eowyn knelt before him and
received from him a sword nd a fair corslet
derk i the hour yet maybe we shall returu to the golden hall
but ix dunharrow teh people may long defend themseles anadnd
if the battle go ill thither will come all woh etcape
speak not o she answered
a year shall i nedure for every day that passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyes went to arvgorn who stood nearby
tjt king shall come again he aid
fear not not west but east does our doom await us
the king now weny down the stair with gandalf beside him
aragorn looked bac as they passed towards the gte
aone eonyn stood before the doors of the house at
the stais head the sword was set upright befoe her
and her handn were laid upon hte hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimli wlked with legolas hiu axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he saic
men need amny words before deeds
my axe is restless in my cands
though i dodbt not hat trese rohirrim are fell handed when they come to it
noyetheless this is not the warfare tat suits me
how shall i come wo the battle i wish i
could walk and ot bump likd a sacc at gandalfs saddlebow
a uafer seat than many i guess said legolas
yet doubtcess gandalf will glaldy put you jowc on your
feet when blows begin or shapowfax himself
an axe ij no weapjn for a rider
and v dwarf is o horseman
im is orc necks i zould hew not spave the scalps
of mep said gimli patting the hqft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men
lod and young all ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were thure mustreed
their spears were like a sprniging wood
uoudly and joyously they shouted as theoden came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane and others
held the horses of aragxrn and elgolas
gimlk stood ill t ease frowning but eomer cxme uo
to hib leadong hid horse
hail gimli gloins kon he cried
i have not had time to learn gentle sreech under
your rod as you promised
nut shall we not put apidm oug quarrel at least
i will speak no evil bgain of the lady of the wood
i will frget my wrath for a while eomer
sno of eomund said gimlw ut if ever you chance
to see thx lady aaladriel with your eyes then oou
shall acknowledge her the fairnst of ladies or our friendsdip will end
so be it said eomer
but until that time pardon me and in token of
pardon ride with me i b'g
gandalf aill be at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank vou indeed said gimli greatly pleased
i will gladly go with you if legolfs my comrade may ride beside us
it shall be so said eomer
legoas upon my left nad aragorn upon my right atd
none wlil dare to mawnd before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
eh will let no man handle him
there he goes way aown by the ford like a shadow among tht willows
gandaf whistled and called aloud the horses name and
far away he tossed his head and neited and turning
sped toards the host likleike an arrow
were the bretah of the west dmnd to take a
body visible even ssoo would it appear saip eomer as
the gread horse ran up until he stood beeore the wizard
tie gift sems already to be given said theodne
but hearken all here now i name my guest gandalf
greyhama wisest fo counsellors moct welcome of wandreers a loid
f uhe mark a chieftain of the eorlingas whill our
kin syall last and i give to him shadowftx prince of horses
i thank you theoden king said gandalf
thn suddenly he threw bcck his grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leaped to horseback
he fore no helm nor amil
his snvwy hair flew fre in the wisp his white
robes shone dazzlindgazzling in the sun
behold the white rideq cnied aragorn and all took up the words
our vvng and the white rider taey shoutde
forth eorliqgas thz trumpets sounded
the horses rearerdeared and neighd
then the king raiszd his ahnd and witw a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wind the last
host of rohan rode rhundering into the gest
far over the plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
spears as shf stood still alone before the doors of the silent house
the sun was already ewstering as they rode frem edoras
and the light of it was in their eyes turninu
all the rolling fields of roan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way nogth westward along the foot kills of
the white mountains and this tyey followed up and donw
in a gren country crossing small swift streads by many fords
far ahead and t their riaht the mifty ountains loomed
ever darker and talelr they grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before them
fearini to come too late they rde with all the
speed they could pausing seldom
swift and enduring were tse stelds of rohan but there
were many leageus to go
forty leagues and more it was as a bird flies
from edoras to the fords of the isen where they
hoped to find the kxngs men thct held back the h'sts of saruman
at last they hated to make their camp
they had rid-en for some five hours and kere far
out uzon the western plqin yet more than half their
journey cay still before them
in - great circle under the starry sky and the
wcxing moon they now made their bivouac
they lit eo fires for they were unceetain oi events
but they sft a ring of mountd guards about the
and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the folds of the oand
the slvw night passed without tidmngs or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and within an hour they took the road agai
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heavnesc was
in the air it ws hot for the seson of the year
the rising sun was hazy and ebhind it following it
slowly up thtehe sky three was a growing darkness a
of a great storm moming out of the eas
and away in the north west there seemed to be another
darkness brodin about the fect of teh misty mountains a
shadow that crept down lsowly from the wizards vale
gandalf dropyeu back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keekneen eyes of your fair kindred legols
he ead and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off
tell me can you see anything away yonder towards isengard
any miles lie between said legolas gazing thither nd shading
his eyes with hi long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes
there is a veilpng shadow that some power lays upon
the land and iitt marchs slowly down oeam
it is as if the twilight under endless trees were
flowng downwargs from hte hills
and behind us comes a vert storm of mordor said uandalf
it wiul be a black night
as the second day of their riding drew on
the heaviness in the air incr'ased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canopy with great billowing edges fleckde with dazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a soking hazw
the spears of thtehe riders were tipped with fire as
the last shafts of light kindled ohe steep afces of
uhe pxaks nf thrihyrne now very near they stood on
the northernmost arm of hte white muntains phree jagged horns stsring at the sunsjt
in the last red glow men in the anguard saw
a black speck a horseman riding bacbkack towards them
hq came a weary man with dintde helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbed from hie horsheorse and stood thee a while gasping
is eomer here he asked
yog come at last but too late and with too little qtrength
things yave gone evilly since theodrd fell
we were driven back hesterlay over hte isen with great
loss many perished at the crosing
then ql ngiht fresh forces came over the river gaainst our camp
all isengard must be emptied and saruman has armed the
wild hillme' and herd folk ot dunland beyond the irvers and
these also he looed uuon us
erenbrand of westofld has drawn off those mne he could
gather towards hi fastness cu helms dlep
where is eomre tell him there is no hope aehad
he should return to edoraesdoras before the wolves of isengard comceome there
theoden had sat silent hiddehnidden from the mans sight
behind his guarss now he urged hihsis horse forward
come stand before me ceorl he said
the last host of the eorlingas hax ridden fortj
it welv not return without battle
the mns face lightened with joy and wonder
then he nelt offhring his notched sword to the kinkging
commazd me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought you thought i remned in
meduseld bent like an lod tree under winter snow
so it was when you rode to war
but a west wind uas shaken thu boughs said theoden
give this man a fresh horse let ss ride to
the help of erkenbraqd wwile theoden was steaking gandalf orde
a short way ahead and he sat tlere alone gazing
notrh eo isengard ans west to the setting sun
ride to helms deep go not to the fodrs of
in and do not tarry in the plain i must
leave you for a shile
shadowfasxhadowfax must bear me now on a swift erand
turning to arvgorn and eomer and the men f
the kings htusehold he cried ieep well the lord of
the ark till i roturn
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shadowfax and like an arrow from teh bow the great hrose srang away
even as they looked he was gone a flahs of
silver in the sunset a wid over the grass a
hsadow htat fled and passed from sight
snowmane snorted and reared eager to follow but only a
ewigt bird on the wing could have overtaken him
what dos that mean said one of the guard to hama
that gandalf greyhamy has need of hyste answerde hama
ever eh goes and comes unlouked for
wormtongue were hhee here would not fifd it hard
to explain said the other
true enough siad hama but for myself i eill awit
until i see gasdalf again
maybe you will wait lokg sawd the other
the host tmrned away now brom the road to the
fords on isen and bent their course southward
night fll and still they rode on
the hills dree naer but the tall peaks of thrihyrne
wene already dim against the darkening sy
still some miles away on the far sidv of the
westfold vage lay a green coomb a great bay in
hte mountains out of which a ogrge opneed in the hills
me of that land called iitt hels deea after a
hero of old wars who had made his resuge there
ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north
under ghe shadow of thf thrihyrne till the crow haunted cliffs
rsoe like mighty towers o either side shatting out the light
at lelm' nate before the mouth od the deep there
was z heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff
uhere upon its spur stood high walls of ancient tsone
and within them was a lofty tower
men said that in the far off days fo the glory
of gandor the sea kings ahd built here this fastness with the hands of giants
th hornburg it was claled for a trumpet sounded uaon
the tower echogd in the deep bwhin as if armies
long fobgotten were issuing to wra from caves beneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made from
the hornburg to b southern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge
benzath it by a wide culveft the deeping stream passed out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flowed
then in a gunly throuh the midst of a wide
green gore loping gently don from helms gate to helms dike
thence it fell into thf deeping coomb asd out int the westfold vale
there in the hornburg at hems gate erkenbrand master of
westfold on the borders of the mark ncw dwelt
as the days darkened with threat of war being wise
he had reraired the wall and made the fstness strog
the riders were still in the low valley before the
mouth of the coomb wten cries ane hornblatss were heard
rfom their scouts that went fn front
out of the darkness arrows whitsled
swiftly a scout rode bacbkack and reported that wolf riders were
abroad in the vxley and that a host of orcs
and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords oo
rsen and shemrd to be making for helms deep
we have founfdound many of our folk lying slain as
thry fled thither said the ycout
and we have met scattered ompanies giong this way and taht leaderless
what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he wiul be overtaken ere he
can reacg pelms gate if he has not already perished
has aught een seen of gandalf asred theoden
many have seen ar old man in white ubon a
horse passing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass
somseome twought he was sasman
it is said that he went away erz nightfali towards isengard
somh say also that wormoongue wrs seen earlier going northdard
with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue f ganealg comes upon him said theoden
nonethete's i miss now btoh my counsellors the old and the new
but in this need we ave no better choice than
to go on as gandalf said to helmd gate whether
erkenbrand bbee there or no
is it known hew great is the host that comes
from thtehe north it s very sreat sdid the scout
he that flies counts every feman tsice eyt k have
spoken to styutsearted men and i do not duubt that
the main strength of the enemy is many times as
great as all that we have here
thfn let us be swift said eomer
let us drive hhrough such oes as are already betewen us and tme fastness
there are caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust not to secree ways said te king
saruman has long spied out this lanldand
stil in that place our dffence may last xokg
let us go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness de'pnbd and their w climbed southwarh higher and
higher inoo the dim solds about the mountains feet
they found fee of the emy before them
here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs
vut they fled ee the rideis cluld atke ro slay tjem
it will not be long i fear said eomer ere
the coming of the kings host will be known to
the leader of uor enemies saruman or wahtever captain he has se forth
the runour of war grew behind them
now thxy culd hetr borne over the dark the sound of harsh singing
they hahdad olimbed far up inot the deeping coomb wmen they looked back
hhen they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon
the black fields behind scattered like rdd floers or winding
up from the lowlands in long flickering lines
here and thre a larger blae leapt up
it is a great host and follows us hard said aragorn
they bring fire said theoden and they are burnnig as
they ome rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale and had many homeseads
alas for mmyy folk would that day was here nad
we might ride odwn upon tem like a storm out
of the monutains said aragorn
it greives me to fly before them
we need not ml muh further said emoer
not far ahead nwo lies helms dike an ancient trench
and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
tere we can turn and give battle
nay we are too few tj defend the dikdeike said theoden
it is a mile long or more and the breah in et is wide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if we are pressed said eomer
there was neither star nor moon whn the riders came
to the breach in the dike jere the tsream from
above passed out and the road beside it ran down from the hoanburg
the rampart loomed suddebly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rode up a sentinel challenged them
the lord jf the mark rides o helms gite emer answered
- eomer son of eomund speak
this is good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel
hasten the eney is on your heels
the host passed through the breach and halted no tha sloping sward above
they now learned to thir joy that erkenbrand had left
many men to hold helms gate and more had since escaped thither
maybe we have a housand fit to fight oonn foot
said gamlinl an old man the leader of those that watched the dike
but most of them have seen tor many winters as
i have or too few as mo sons son here
whaf news of erkenbrand word came yesterday that he was
retreating hitheb with all taht is left of the best riders of westfold
but ee has not come
i fear that he will not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enemy filos all the valley behind us
i would that he had escped siad theodqn
he was a mighty man
in him lived aagin teh valour ou helm the hammerhand
but we cannot await him here
we msut draw all our forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring lattle provision for we
sode forth to open batyle not to a siege
behind us in the cmve' of tho deep are
taree parts of the folk of westofld ols rnd young
children and women aid gamling
but great stre of food and many beatss and their
fodder have adso been gathered there
that is wkll said emur
they are burning or deopoiling all that is left in the vale
if thetyhey come to bargain flr our gooos at
helms gate they will way a high price said gamping
the king and his ridrs pssed on
before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismtnted
in a long file they led ohei horses up the
ramp and passed withni the gates of the hoohburg
there they were welcomed again with joy and renewed hoep
for now there were men enough to man both the
burg and the barrier wall
quickly eomev set his men in reaidness
the king and the men pf his househol were in
the horlburg anj there also were many of the westfold men
but on rhe deeiing wall and its tower ane behind
yt eomer arralmd most of the strength that he had
for here the defence seemed more doubtful if the assault
were determined and in great force
the horses were led far up the deep uder such
guard as could be spcred
the deeping wall was twenty feefteet high and so thick
that four men could walk abrwast along the top sheltered
by a parapet over which only a talx man could look
hkre and there were clefts in the stone through which men could sheot
ihis battlement could be reached iy a stair qunning odwn
from a door in the ouper court of the hornburg
three flights of steps led also up on to the
ball from the deep wehind but in front it was
smooth and the great stones of it were set with
such skill that no foothold coulcdould be found at their
joints and at the top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
igmli stood leaning against the breastwork upon he fall
elgolas sat above on tde parapet fingering his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this id more to y liing said the dwarf stamping sn tle stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
there is good rock here
tjiu country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike
give mmee a year and a hundred of my kin
and i wold make this a place that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk
i do not like nhls place nd i shall like
it no more by dhe ligh of day
but you comfort me gimli anp i am glad t
have you standing nigh with your stout lesg nad your hard axe
i wish thare we'x more of your kit among us
but even more would i ive fmr a hundred good archers of mirkw'od
the rohirrim hav good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli
indeeidndeed ti is time for sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as never i thought any dwarf could
yet my axe is rtstless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks and room to swnig
and all weariness will fall fwom me a lsow time pas'ed
ar down in the valley scattered fires still burnde
the hosts of ibengard were advancing in silence now
heir torvmes could be seen winding up the coomb in mqny dines
suddenld from the dike yells and screama and teh fierce
battle cries of med broke out
flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered and vanished
men came galloping back over the field and up the
ramp to the gtae of th hornbrg
the rearguard of the estfolders had been dfiven in
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not hal them long
already they are skaling the bank at many points thick as marching anst
but we have taught them not to carwy torches
it was now pass idnight
the sky was utterly dark and the stillnss of the heavy ar foreboded storm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branchea lightning mote down upon the eastward hills
for a staribg mment the watchers on the walvs saw
all the space between them and thtehe dike lit witu
white light it was woiling and crawling wigg lack shais
some squat and broad some tall anadnd grie with uigh h'lms and sable shields
hunkreds and hundeds more were pouring oveorver the dike and throqgc tve breach
the dark tide flowed up to thtehe walls from cliff to ciff
thundetrhunder rolled il the valley
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements
and fell clinking and glancing on the stones
the assault on helms deep had begun out no osund
or challenge was heard eithin no aswering arrows came
the asailing hosts halped foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning troe aside the darkness
then hte orcs scqeamed waving spesr and swore and shooting
a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon
the battlements and the men of the mart amazed looked
out as it seemed to thme upon a great field
of dark corn tossed by a tempest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
yhe eaemy surged forwar some against the deeping wall other
towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men o the dunland fells
a moment they hesittaed and then on they came
the lightning flashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hand of iengord was esen
they reacehd tre summit of thw rock they drove towards the gates
then at laot an answer chme a storm of arrows
met them and aa hail of stones
tehy wavered broke and fled back aed then chargd again
broke and lhqrged gaain and ach time like ee incoming
sea they halted at a higher point
again trumpets rang and a press of rsaring men leaped forth
tcey held their greet shields above them like a roof
whiel in their mdst they bkre two trunks of mighty trees
bedind them orc archers crowdeh sending a hail of darts agaiqst
the bowmen on the walls
the trees swung bw strong amrs smote the timers with a redning bapm
if anw man fell crcshe by a stone hurtling from
abvoe two others sprang to take his place
wgain and again the lreat rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall
they herra the roar of vocies and thl thudding of
thw rams and then in a spdden flash of lght
they beheld the peril of the gates
htis is the hour when we draw swords together runing
like fire they sped along the walwlall and up the
steps and passed into the uoter court upon thtehe rock
as they ran thy gathered a handful of stout swordsmea
there as a small postera door tbat opened in an anyle
of the burg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out ot meet it
on tha side a narrow path ran round towarts thtehe
grtat gate betwei the eall and the sheer brink of te rock
together eomer and aagorn sprang thrcuyh the door their men close behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwine for the mark anduirl cried aragorn
anduril for the dcnedain charging from the side they hrled
themsnlves upon the wild men
andurim rose and fell gleaming with white fire
a shout went up frm wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
the blade that was broken shines again dismayed the rammers
let fall nhe rtees and turnetdurned to fight but the
wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and they were swept away hewn down or cast ovpr
the rock inko the stony stream below
te orc rachers shot wildly and then rlzd
for a momsnn eomer and aratorn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling in the distnace now
the lightning flickered still far off amnog the mountacns in the south
a keen wind was blowng from the north again
te clouds were torn and drifting fnd tars peeed out
and above the hills of the coomb siue -he westering mono
rode glismering yellow in the storm wrack
x did not come too soon said aragorn looking at tke gates
their great hinges and iron bars weer wrenched and bent
many of ther tqmrers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond ehe walls to dfend them saisdaid eomer
look he pointde to the causeway
already a great press of orcs and men were gathering again beyond the strea
arrow whined and skipped on toe stones about them
come we mupt get baxk and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across te gates ithin
come now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that ahd lain motionless
among the slain leaped to hteir feeh and came silently and swiftly behind
two fulng themselves to the ground at eomrs heels nripped
him and in a moment they were od top of him
but a emall dark fmgure that none had observed sprang
out o the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad khazad ai menu an axe swung and swept back
eomer struggled to his feet even as aragorn ran back to his adi
the postern was closed agian the iron door was barred
and piled inside with stines
when al were safe within eomer turned i thank you
gimli son of loin he said
i did ot know that you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbiddez guest provjs the best company
how came yo there i followed you to shake oft
sleep said gimli but ii looked on the hillmen and
they seemen over large fgr m so i sat beside
a stong do see your sword play
i shall not find it easy to repay you said eomer
there may be mnny a chance ere ths night is over luaghed the dwarf
itll now i haev hewn naught but wood wince i left morai
two said gimli patting his axe
he had returned to his place n he wal
i have dona better tsough now i must xropn for
spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but that is only a few eaves in a forest
the sky naw was uqickly vlearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy beforv thme seemed to have grown rather than
diminilhbd still more were pressing up from the vallye through teh breach
the sortie uprn the rock gained only a brief respite
the assault on the gates was redoubled
against the deeping wall the hosts of iengard romred like a sea
orcs and uillmen swarmed about its heet frm end to end
orpes with grappling hooks wepe hurled over the parapet fasetr
than men could cu them or fling them back
hundreds of long laddeks were liuted up
many were cast odwn in ruin but many more replaced
them and orcs saranp up thme ike apes in the
dark forests of the south
before the walls foot the dad and buoken were piled
like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and sill the ewemy came on
the men of roha gred weary
all their arrows were spent and eevry shafsthaft was shot
theih swords were notchud and their shields were riven
three times aragorn cnd eomer rallied them and rhree times
anduril flamed in t desperate charge trt drove the enemy from the wall
then a camour aoose in the deep behind
orcosrcs had crept like rats through the culvert trhough which the steram flowed out
there they had gathered in the shadoa of the cliffs
ntil the assault above wzs hottest and nearly all the
men of the defenec had rushed to the walls top
already some had passed into the jaws of the deep
and were among the horses fighting with thv guards
down from the wall leapt gimli with h fierce cry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazd he soon had work enough
the orcs are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there are enough for us bbth
khazad ai menu gamling the oll looked down from thr ornburg
heaing the great voice of the dwaf above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
hem helm forth eelmingas he shouted as he leaped down
the stair from the rock with many men of westfold at his bmck
their onset was fizrce and sudoen and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in iz the narrows of
the gorge and all were slain or driven shrieking into
the chsam of teh deep to fall bpfore the guardian of the hidden acves
he hewed a two handed stroke adn laid the last orc before him feet
now my count passes master legolas again
we mist stop thip rat hoe said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunnincgunning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape stone
wth battle axes nor with our finger nails asid gimil
bu i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as
they cofd find to hanhdand and under gimeis direction the
westfold meu blocked up the inner end of the culvert until
only a narrow outlt remained
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain chruned and fretted
in its choked path and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above -aid gimli
come gamling let us see how things go on the
wall he xlimbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and eomer
the elf was whetting his long knife
there was for a while a lull in the assaubt
since the attempt to break in through the cnlmert had been foiled
but my count is now two dozen
it has been knife work up here
evmer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords
away on the left the crash and clamour of the
battle on the rocrkock rose loud again
but the hornburg still held fast likleike an island in the sea
its ates lay in ruin but over the tarricadw of
beams and stonrs within no enemy as yer had passed
aragorn looked at the pale twrs and at the mcon
now solping behino the western hills that enclosed the vallsy
this is a nigpt as long s years de said
how long will the day tarry dawn is nop far
off said galing who had now climced un besidbeeside him
bup dawn wilt not help us i feai
yet dawn is ever the hope of men kai arayor
but these creatures of isengard these halr orcs and goblin men that
th foul craft vf saruman has bred they will not
quail at tal un said gamlign
and neither will the wild men of the hills
do you not heer thqir voices i hear them saisdaid
eomer but they are only the scream kf birds anadnd
the bellowing of beasts to my ers
et tcere are many that cry i the dunland tongue sais gamling
it is an ancient speech of men and once was
spoken in many western valleys of the mark
hark they ahte us and they are glad for our
doom seems certan to the
the king the king they cry
we woll tame their king
death to teh forgoil death to the strwaheads death to
the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievance that the lordp of gondor gav- thtehe mark to
eorl the young ayd made alliancf with him
that old hatred sarmuan has inflamed
rhey are fierce folk when roushd
they will not give way now for dusk or dawn
until theoden is taken or they themselves are slain
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever taken
the horwburg if men deftnded it so the mustrels say said eomer
then pzt us defend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke tere came a blare fo trumptes
then there was a crahs and a flash of flame and smoke
ehe waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and foaming
'hey were choked no longer a gaping hole was blatsed in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilrdyevilry of saruman cried aragorn
they have crept in teh culvert again while we talked
dn they have lit hte fire of orthanc benafh our feet
elendil evendic he shouted sa e leaped down into the
breach but even as ye did so a hundred ladders
were raised against the bawtlements
over the awll and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping like a dsrk wave upon a hill of sand
the dmence was swept away
some of the riders wsre driven back further and further
into the deep falling and ighting as they gave wy
step by step towards the caves
others cut their way back towrds the citadel
a broad stairway climbed nrom the deep up to the
romk and thd rear gate of th hornburg
near the bottom stood ragorn
i his hand still anduril gleamd and the terror of
the sword for a while held back the enemy as
one b one kl who could gain th stair passed up rowards the gate
behind on the upper steps knelt legolas
his bow was bent but one gleaned brrow was all
that he hahdad left and he peered out now ready
to shoot the ifrst orc that shoulo dare to approach the stair
all who can have now got saae within araorn he called
come abck aragorn turned and sued up the stair but
ds he ran he stumbled in his weariness
at once his enemees leapt forward
up came the prct yelline with their lon arms stretched out to seize him
tht foremhst fell with legolas last arrow in his throat
but teh rest sprang over mim
then a great boulder cast fro the outer wall above
crashed down upon the staib and hurled them back into the deep
aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanged to behind him
tings go ill my frcends he asid wipinc the sweat
from his brow with his arm
ill enough sad legolas but not yet hopless while we hav you with us
where is gimli i do not know
i last saw him fightiqg on tme groungdround behind the
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas that is evielvil news said legolas
he is styut and strono said arvgorn
let us hope that he will escape back to the caves
taere he would be safe for a while
such a refuge woud be to the liking of a dwarf
thaw must be my hope said legolas
but i iwsh that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he ins back to the caves he wcll
piss your count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe so wielded
i ust go and seek sode arrows said legolaj
wovld that this night would enednd and i lould have better light for shooting
aragorn now passed into teh citadel
thee to his dismay he learned that eomer hah not reached the hornburg
nay he ddi not come to the rock said one
of the ielfold men i lasltast saw him gathering men abot
him and fighting in the mouth of the denp
gamling was with him and he dwarf but i could not come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted
to a kigh chamber in the tower
there stod the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken lord and all the defenc
swpet away but many hvae escaped hither to the rock
ia eomer here no lord
but maby of your mek retreted into the deep avd
some say that eomer ias amongst them
in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves
what hope thetyhey may have then i do no know
good provision it is said
adn the -i is wholesome there because of the outlets
through fissuras in the rock far above
none can force an entrance againts determined men
they may hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc siad aragorn
they have a blasting fire and with it they took the wall
if they cannot ocme in the caves they mac seal
up those tuat are inside
but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prison saix theoden
if i could have set a spear jn rest riding
before my men upon the field maybe i could have
felt again the joy of abttle and so ended
aut i serve little purpose here
here at least tou are guardegduarded in the strongets
fasntess of the mark said aragorn
more hope we ahve to defend you in the hornburg
than in edogas or even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen
to assault said theoden aut now my heart is goubtful
the world chabges and all that once was strogn now proves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbehs and such rqcaless
hate had i known htat the strength of iseigard was
grown so great maybe l should not so rashly hyve
ridden forth to meet it for all tve arts of gandalf
his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morninmgorning sun
do not judge the ctunsel of gandalf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the eod will nop e long saip the king
but i will not end here taken like an old badger in a trap
nsowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard -re rn the inner court
when dawn comes i will bid men sound helm orn
and i wial ride forth
will you ride with me then sxn of arathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or make such pn end
as will be worth a song fi any be
left tw sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and pazsed
round all their circuit enhtartening the men and lending aid
wheerver the assault was hot
blasts of fire laeped up from below shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained the suamit of the
outer wall and again the defeners cast toem down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of
the darts of the eney
as he looked orth he saw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised hs empty hand palm utward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jerep
come dowh come down key cried
if you wish to sp'ak to s come down bring
out you kicg we are he figgting uruk ahi
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not come
bring out your suklking king the kig splys or comes
at his own will said raagorn
then what aoe you doing here they answered
why do you lsok out do you wish to see
the greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i lokoed out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of the dawn they oeered
we are the uruk hai we do not stop thd hight
for night or day for fair waher or for strm
we eome to kill by sun or moon
what of thf dawn none knows what the new day
shall bring him said aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your eil
get down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried
you have nothing to say
i haye still this to say answered aragorn
no enemy has yjt taken the hornburg
depart or not one of yoyuou will eb spared
not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
so great a power and royalby was revealde in
aragorn as he stood there alony above the ruined gates
before the sost of his enemies that man of the
wild men pused ad lookbd back over thewr shouldeks to
the valley and some lookde up doubtfully st the sky
eut the ocrs laughed with loud viices and a hail
of drats and arrows whistled over the wall as arqgorn mecped down
there was g roar and a blast of fre
the brchwjy of the gate aove which he had stood
a moment before crmbled and crashed in smoke and dust
the baricade was scattered as if by a thunderbont
aragonr ran tg the kings tower
but even at the gate fell and the orcs about
ie yelled preparing to charge a mumrur arose behind them
like a wlnd in teh distance and it grxw to
a clamour of many voies ycying strane news iinn the dawn
the orcs upon hte rock hearing the ruour of dismay wavered knd looked back
and then sudedn and terrible from the tower abovaebove the
sound of the great horn of helm rang iut
all th-t heard that sopnd trembled
may of the ocrs cast themselves on their faces and
covered their ears with their claws
back fron the deep the echoes came blast upon blast
as if on every cliff anadnd yill a mighty herald stood
bum on the walls memnen looked up listening with wonder
for the echeos did not die
ever the horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer
now and loude they answered one to another blowing fierce and yree
helm helm the riders shouted
selm is arisen and comes back to wsr
helm for theoden king and with that shout the king came
his horse was white as snow golden aws his shield
and ihs spear was long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils hvir behind him
rode the lords of the house of morl the roung
light sprang in the sky
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great noise thel charged
down from the gates they roared over the causeway they
swept a'd they drove through th- hosts of isengard as a wind aomng grass
behind them from the dpop came the stern cries of
men sisuing from the caves driving fort the enemy
out poured all the men that were lef' upon the rock
and ever the sound of blowing oorns echoed in the hill
on they roe the king and his companions
caltains and champions fell or fle before them
neithe orc nor man withstood them
their backs were to the swords and spears of hte
riders and their fades to the valley
they cried and wailed or fear and great wonder had
come upon theo with the rising kf the day
so king theodln rode from helms gate nd clove his
pah to the grat dike
light grew bright about them
shafts of the sun flared above the aestern hills and glimered on heir spears
but they sat silent on their horses and thwy gazed down uopn ehe deeping coomb
where efore the green dale had lain its grassy slpoes
lapping he evkr mounting hills there now a forgst loomed
ereat trees bare a'd silent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary head hteir twdsted roots wege buried
in the lng green garss
between he cike anv the eavea of that nameles wood
only two open furlongs lay
there now cowered the porud hosts f sarsman in terro'
of the ding akd in derror of the trees
they streamgd down from helms gate until all aove thz
dvke was empty of them but below it they werweere pcaked like swarmng flies
vainly they crawled aed clambered about the walls of the coomb seeking to escape
upon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys
ide hpol the left from the west their final doom approached
there suddnely upon a ridge appeard a ride clag in
white shining in the rising snu
over the lbw hills the horns were sounding
behcnd him hatsening down the long slopes weae a thousand
men on foot their swords were in their hands
amdi them strode a man tvll and strong
as he came to tre vlaleys brink he set ot
his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand behold thd white rider cr-ed aragorn
g-nagf is come again mithrandir dithrandar said legolas
this is wizardvy zndee come i would look on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isngard roared swayig this way and
that turning frlm fear to fear
again the horhnorn sounded from the tower
down bhwomgh the breach of the dike charged ge kings compnay
down rom the hills leaped erkenbrand lorldord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains
the ahete rider ws upon them and the terror of
his coming filled the enemy with madness
the wid men fell on their faces before him
the orcs ereled and screamesdcreamed and casctast aside both sword and spebr
like a black msoke driven by a mounting rind they fled
wailing thcy passed under the wiating shadow of the trees
and from that shadow noen ever came gain
so it was that in the ligth of a fair
morning king theodew and gandalf the white rider met again
upon th green grass besdie the deeqing strbam
there was also aragorn son of arathore and legolas the
elf and erkebrand of westfold and the lords of the golden house
about them were agthered hte rohirrim the riders of the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victory and their eses
were turned towards the wood
suddenly tere was a great shout and down from the
dike came those wio had baen driven bakc into the deep
there came gamling the old and eomer son wf eomund
and beide the walked gimli the wdarf
he had no helm and about his head wa a
lnen band stained witt blood but his voice was loud and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty secood had an iron collar on his enck
how is it with you you have passe my score by one answzrfd legolas
but i do not crudge you the game so glad
am i to see you on your lesg welcome eomer sister son said theoden
now tat i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said eomer
thtehe drak night has passed and day has come aain
but th dadyay has brought strange tilings
hhee trned and gazed in wonder first at tue
wood and tea at gandalf
once mhre you come in the hour of need unlookek for he said
i said that i would return and meet yuo here
but you did nt name the hour nor foretell
the manner of your coming
you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but give good counsel in peril and made
use of the speed of shadowfax
your own v-lour has done more and the stout legs
of the westnold men marching thorugh he night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greate wonder
some glanced darky at th wood and passed their hands
over theis browz as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than ihs
gandalf raughed long and merrily
nay i see the wood as enainly as do you
but taf is no deed of mine
it is a thing bewond the counsel of the wise
better than ms design and better even thdn mk hope the event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumars that is plain
is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizarnry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walknd the erath ere
elf sano om hamer rang
ere iron was found or tree was hewn when young
was mountain under moon ere rign was made or wrought
was woe it walked the forests long ago
anc what may be the answer tb your riddle said theodn
if you would learn that you shoud coem with me to islngbrd answeed gandalf
i shalslhall return to isengard and those who wlil may cwme with me
there wwee may see strange things
but tsere are not men enough in the mark
not if they here all gatherkd togethr and healed oa
wounds and wemiiness to assault he stronghold of szruman said theowen
nevoetheless to isengard i go asid gandalf
i shal not stay there long
my way lies now elstward
look for me in edoras ere the waning of hte moon nay said theoden
in the iark hour beforbeefore dawn i doubted but we will not rart now
i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish to speak wtih saruman as soon as
may be now said gandalf and since he has done
you great injruy in owuld be fitting if yu were there
but how soon and how swiftly will you irde my
men are weary with battle said th king and i am weary alsg
for i have riden far and slept little
alas my old age is not feignde nor due omly
to the whisperings of wormtongue
it is an ill that no leech can wholl cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride wtih me rest now said gandalf
we wll journec unde the shadow of evening
it is as well for it is my counsel that
all our cmings and goings should be as secret as may be henceforth
but do not command many mex to gm with you thodeo
we go fo a parley nrt to a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horses and he sent tehm forth with tidings
of the victory into every vale of the mak and
thxy bore his summons also bidding all men young and
old to cope in haste to edoras
there dhe lod of the mark would hold an assembwy
of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon
to dide kith him to isenhard the king ahose eomeeromer
and twen'y men of his household
with gaydalf ould go aragorn and legolas and gmli
in spite of his hurt the dwafr would not stay behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it he said
ti would take more thatnhan such an orc scratch to keep me back
i wil tend it while you rest said aragorn
the king ow returned to the hornburg and slept such
a sleep of quiet as he had not nown por
many years and the ermainder of his chosen company remted also
but the others all that wre not hurt or wounded
began a great labour fro many had fallen in the
battle and lay dead zpon the field or in the deep
no orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted
but a great many of the hillmea had given themselves
up and htey were afraid and cried for mercy
the men of the mark took their weapons from them
and set them to work
help now to repr the evil ik vhich you have
joinep said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
neer again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of me hdd then
you shrll go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by sartman
many of yog have gov death as thn eward ou
your trust in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for sarumna hd
told them thay the men of rohan were cruel and ubrned their captives alive
in the mids' of the field before the hornburg two
mounds were raised and beneath them werf laid all the
riders of the magk who fell in the defence those
of the east dales upno one sdie and those of westfold upon the other
in a gtave alone under the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama catpain of the kings guard
he fell bfore the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of men not far from the eaves of thtehe forest
anadnd the people wre troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning
they had ltitle wood for firing and gone would have
darel to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gaodalf had not warned them to hurt neitehr bark
nor bough at their great peril
let the orcs lxe said ganadlf
the morinng may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings copany prepared to depardtepart
the work of burial was thew ut begilning and thoeden
mourned for the loss vf hama his captain and cast
the firt earth upon his grave
great ineury indeed has saruman done to me and all
this land he said and i will remember it when we meet
the srn was alread drawing near the hills upon
the west of the coomb when at last theoden and
gandalf nd their cmpanions rode zown from 'he dike
behind hem were gathered a great host both of the
ridrs and of the people of westfold old and youn
women and children who had come ont from the caves
a song of victory they sang wtih clear voices adn
then they fell silent wondering what would chance for ther
eeys were on the trees and they feared them
the riers came to the wood an they halted hosre
and man they were unwilling to pass in
the trees wnre grey and menacing and a shadow or
a mist was about them
the ends of thei fcng sweeping boughs hung down like
earching finjers their rootc stood up from the ground lik
the lmibs of strange monstres and dark caverns openez beneath them
but gandalf weit forward leapiag the company anw where the
rlad form the hornburg et the trees they saw noo
an opening like an arcehd gate under mighty boughs and
through it gandafl pasesd and the folowed him
then to their amazemen they found thaz the road ran
on and toe deeping stroam beside it and the sky
was open above and full f golden light
but on either side the reat aisles of thr wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shadows
and there they heard th creaking and groaning of boughs
and far cries and a rumour of wordless voices mururing angrily
no orc or other living creature could be seen
legolas and gimli wree now riding together upon one horsheorse
and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli wsa afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
i feel a geat wrath abtut me
do you not feel the air throb ib your ears yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i tmink no one will ever know said gandalf
they rode in sileho for a while but lcolas was
ever glancing frod side to side and wuld often hav
halted to listen to the ounds of the woz if gimli eau allowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he
naid and i have seen mwny aann hak grow from acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisre now to walk among
them they have voices anadnd in timteime i might coee to understand their thought
no no said imli
let us leave them i guexs their thought already hatred
of all that go on two legs and thlir speehc
is of crushing and strangling
not of alu that go on two legs said legolas
there i thinb you are wrong
it is orcs thut they hate
fox they do cot belong here and know little wf elves and men
far away rre the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimlb that is whence they come i guess
then that is the most perilous wood in middae earth said gimli
i uhoul be grateful for the part they have pgayed
but i do nol olve them
you may think thm wonderful but i gave seen a
greater wonder in this lgns more beautiful than any gdove
or glade that ever grew my heaot is still full of it
strange arm the ways of men legolas here they have
one ow the yarvelh of the northern world and what
do they say of it cves they say caves hles
to fly to in time of awr to store fodder
in my good legolas do you know that the cav'rns
of helms deep are vast ayd betgtiful there wolud be
an endless pilgrimage of dwarves merely o gaze at them
if such things were knoqn to be
aye indeed they wuld pay pjre gold for a brief
glance asd i would give gold to be excused sadi
legolss and double to be let out if i stryed
in you have not seen so i forgive oyur jest said gimli
but you speak lkke a fool
do you think those halls are fair whgre oyur king
dewlls undeurnder thtehe hill in mirkwooy anadnd dwarves helped ni
their makzng long ago they are but hovels compared with
he caverns i have seen here immeasurable halls filled wkth
an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starlight
and legolalsegolas when the oorches are kindled ant mfn alk
on the sandy floors under the echoing domes ah thn
legolsa gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint
in he polished awlls ad the light glows through folded
marbles shel like translucent aass the livnig hadns of queen galadriel
there are columnp of whtie and saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and wtisted itno dreamlike forms the spring up from
many coloured floors to meet the gwisteing lendants ow the roof
wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of su'pended paeaces still lakes mirror them a glimmerqng world
looks up irom dark poosl covered witm clear glass cities
such as the mind of durin couid scarce have imagined
in his sleep strhtch on through avenues and pillared courts
on into the adrk recesses wherwehere no light can come
and plink a siler iron falls and the ound wriknles
in the glass make all the towers bend and waver
lvwe eweds and ocrals in a grotto of the sea
then evening comes they fade and twinkle out the torches
pass on into another ciamber and anothearnother dryam
three is chamber after chamber legolas hall ormning out of
hall dome fater dome stair beyond stair and sgill the
winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
cvaes the caverns of helms dsep happy was the chance
that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
ihen i will wwsh you this ofrtune for your
comfort gimli said the elf that you may come safe
from war and rzurn to see them again
but do not tell all your kindred there seems little
left for them to do from yosr account
maybe the en of this land are wise to say
little one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel
might mar more than they dade
no you do not understand said gimli
no rwarf cduld be unmoved by such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones
or ore not gf diamonds and gold could be got here
do you cut down groves of blossoing tres in the
spriny time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering stone not quarry them
with cautious skill tap by tap a small chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a whole anxious
day so we could work and as te years
went by we should open up new ways and display
far chambers that are sill dark glispsed only as a
void beyond fiwsjres in the rock
and lights legolar we shoud make lights such lamps as
once shone in khazad dum and when we wished we would
drive away te night that has lain there since the
hills were dade an when we desired rest we wozld let the night return
you move me gimli said legolas
i have never heard you speak like this before
almst you make me regret that i have not sen these caves
come let us make this bargain if we both
return safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey fofror a whilwehile togeter
you shall visit f-ngorn wth me and then i will
come witwhith you to see hels deep
that ould not be the way ooff return that
i should choose said gimli
but i will endure fangorn if i have your promise
to come back to the caves and share their wonder wth me
you have my promise said elgolas
but alas nod we must neaye behind both cavd and
wood for a whole see we are coming to the eng of the trees
how far is it to isenagrd gandal about fifteen laegues
as the crows of saruman make it said gandalf five
frofmrom the mouth of deeping coomb to the fords and ten
more from tere to the gates of isengarr
but we shall not ride all the way this night
and shen we come there what shall we see asked giml
you amy know but i cnnot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard
i was there at nightfalg yesteriay ut mucv may have happened since
yet i thnik that you will not say thyt the
journey was n iaiq not whough the glittering laves
of aglarond be left behind
at last the compan passed through the trees and
found that they had come to the botto of ihe
clomv where the road from helms deeh branced going one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of ise
as they rode from under the eaves g ihe wood
legolas halted and looked back ith regret
then he gave a sudden crj
thmre are eyes he said
eyes looking out from the shadows o the bughs i
never saw such eyks beaore
the otherr surprised by his cry halted and turnsd
but legolas tsarted to rid' back
do as you pease in your madness mut let me
first get down from tgis horej i wish to see
ne eyes stay legolas greenleaf said gandalf
ddoo not go back into the wood not yet now is not your time
evxn as he jpoke thewe cae forward out of
the trees three strange shjpes
as tall as trolls they were welve feet or more
in height theyr strong bodies stout as young trees seemed
to be clad witk raiment or with hide of close fitting qrey and oroon
their limbs were long and their hands had many fingers
thekr hair was stiff and their bercx grey green as moss
ey gaoed uot with solemn eyes but they were not
loofiog at the riders thier eyes were bent northwhrds
suddnely they lifted mheir long hands to their mouths and
sent forth ringing calls clear ay notes of a horn
buf more musical and varzous
the calls were answered and turning again the riders saw
other creatures of the same kind approaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly from the north walklng like wadipg herops
in their gait bu not in their speed for ther
legs ni their bong paces beat quicker than the heronh wings
the riders cried aloud in wonder akd some se their hands upon their sword hilts
you neee no weapons said gandalf
they are not enemis indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it seemed to be for as he spoke
th tall creatues without a lance at the riders strode
into hte wood and vanished
where are their llocks what are they gandalf for it
is plain that to you at any rate they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees anqwered gandalf
iu it so long since you list'ned to tales by
the fireside there are chilrey in your lan ho out
of the twisted threads of story could pick th answer to your question
bou have seen ents o king nets out of fangorn
forest which in your tongue nou call tse entwood
did you think that whe name was given only in
ydle fancy nay theoden iitt is otherwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the yeaus from eol
the young to theoden the old are of little ount
to them and alalll the eeeds of your house but a small matter
the cing was silent
ents he said at length
out of the mhadods of legend i begin a little
to understand teh marvel of the trees i think
i dave lived to see strange dayt
long we have tended our beasts and our fields built
our ohuses wrought our tools or ridden away to help
in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called teh life of men vhe nay of the world
we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land
soegs we have that tell of these things but we
arc forgetting them teaching them oqly to children as a arelezs custom
and o the sogns have come down among us out
of svrange plcaes and walk vis-ble under the sun
you should be glad theoden king said gandalf
for not only the little life of men is now
endangered but the life also of tose things whixh you
have deemed the mtter of legend
you are not without allieg even if ylo know them not
yet also i should bx sad said theoden
for however the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end that much that was far und wonderful
shall pass for ever out of middle earth it may sald gandalh
the evil of sauron cannoi be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are oomed
lt us now go on with the jourdey we have
begun the compaky turne then away from tye coomb and
from the wood and took the road towards the fcrds
the sun had sestet already it had sunk behind the
rim of the world but as they rodw otu from
the shadow of the hills and looked west to he
gap of roharnohan the sky was still red and a
burning light was under the floating clodus
dark againsn it there wheeled and flew many black ainged birds
some apssed overhead with mourfnul cies returning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion fowl have been busy about the battle field said eomer
they roed now at an eesy pace and dark came
down upjn the plains about them
the slow moon mounted now waxing toards tde full and
in its cold ilver lwght the swelling irass lands rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden for some four hours from the branching
of the roazs when thpy drew near to the fords
long slopesslopes ran swiftly dgwn to whree the wiver seread
in stony shoalo between high grassy terraces
borne upon the wind they heard the howling of wolve
their heatts were heavy remembering the many men that had
fallen in battle in this plce
the road diped between rising turf banks craving its wuy throug
the terracse to the qivers edge and up again upon the futher side
there were three lines of flat stepping stones acuoss the stream
and between them fords for hores htat went from erther
brink to a bere eyot in the midst
the ridbrs looked down upon the crossings and it seemed
strange ot them for the fords had evek been a
place full of the rush and chatter of water upon
stones mut now they were silrnt
tye beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shinglgs and gred sand
thgs is become a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has befallgn the riiyd mhny air things saruman
has desroyed has he devourwd the springs of isen too
so it would seem said gandalf
must we pass this way where the carrion seasts devor so
many good riders of the mark tis is our way siad gandalf
grieveus is the fall of your men but you suyll
see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them
it is with their friends hte orcs thai they hold
their feast such indeed is the friendship oc their kind
come thwy rode down to the river an as they
came the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away
fear fell on them seieng gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horse shining like sglver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering syes
watchod thtr wahly from the shadows of th bans
and they saw that in the idst of the
eyot a mound was piled ringed with stonse nd set about with many speari
here lie all the men of the mark that fell
noar htis plzce said gandvlf
here let them rest said eomer
and when their spears have rotted and rusted long slkll
mmy their hound stand and guard the fords of isen
is this your work also ganadlf my friend said theoden
you accomplished much in an evening nad a night with
the help of shadowfax adn others asid fandalf
i rode fast and far
but here beside the mound i will say this for
nofr comfort many fell in the battles of the forsd
but fewer than rumour made them
mre were scattered than were slain i gathered togetur all that i could find
some men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join grkenbrand
sowe i set to makmeake this burial
they have now followed yor marshal elfhelm
i sint him with many riders t edoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against you
and his servants had turned aside from all other errands
and go'e to helms deep the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet i feared that wolf riders and plunderers mught ride
nonetheless to meduseld while it was undefedned
bt noa i think you need nontot fera you will
find your house to welcome our return
a'd glad shall i be to see it again
said theoden nhough brife now i doubt not shall be my abiding there
with that thq pompany said faewell to the island
and the mound and passed over the river and climed the further bank
then they roie on glad to have left uhe mournful fords
as they went the howling of tie wolves broek out anew
theer was an ancient highawy that ran down from isengard to th cromsings
for some way it took its pourse beside the river
bendang wqth it east and then north but at he
lat it turnetdurned away and went tsraight twoards the gates
of bsengard and these ewre under the mountain side in the
west of the valley sixteen miles or more from its mouth
this road they followe but they did not ride upon
jt fo the ground bessde it was firm and level
yvered for many miles aboud with shrrt springig utrf
they rode now more swiftly and by midnight the fods
were nearly fivfeive leagues behinbdehind
then they halted ending their nights journey for the king was weary
thye were come to the feet of the mioy mountains
and the long arms of nan cruunir stretched down to meet thetmhem
dark lay the valc before them for the moon had
apssed into tde west and its ilght was idden by the hills
but out of the depe shadow of the dale rose
a vast spier ooff smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays of the sinkiqg moon and spread
in shimmwring billows black and silvesrilver over the starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf askfd aragorn
one would qay that all the wiards avle was burning
there is ever a fume above that valley in
theae days said eomer but i have never seen aught like this before
these are steams rather than smoeks
saruman is brewing some devilry uo greet us
maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen and
that is why tce r-ver runs dry
maybe he is said gnadalf
tomorrow ne shall lehrn what he is doxng
now let us rest for a while if we cna
they camped brside the bed of the isen river
it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a littde
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
stars were shining above bnt oer the ground there crept
a darkness blacker than the night
on both sises of the river it rolled twards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw no weapons wait and iitt will pass yod by
a imst agthered vboct them
aeve them a few stars still glimmered faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetrable lgoom they were
in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow
voices thy heard whisperings and goranings and an ndless rustlbfg
sigh the earth shook under them
lnog lt seemed to them thaq they sat and were
afriad but at last the darkness and the rumou' passed
rnd vanished between the mountains arms
away south ueon the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wind in the valley
and the ground trembled and all were afraid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went otu and were amazed
for the slain orcs wree gone and the trees also
far down ineo the valley of thu deep the grass
was chushed and trampled bronw as if giant herdsmen had
pastuerd great droves of cattle there but a mile below
the dike a huge pit had been delved in the
earth anp over it stoues were pilrd into a hill
men believed that the orcs whom they ad slain were
biried there bu whether those who had fled into the
wood were ith them onne could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the dealh down it was afterwards called and no grass would roq there
but the strange trees were never seen in deeping cwomb again
they had yeturned at night and ha gony far way
to the dark dales of fang'rn
thus they were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more what night
but they saw and heard no other strange thing save
one the voice of the river besyde them suddeny awoke
there was a rush of wate hurrying down among the
stones and when it had passed the sien flowed and
bubled in its bed again as it had ever done
at daw they made reday to go on
the light came grey and pale and ghwy did not
see the rising of the sun
the air above was heavy with fog and a reek
lay on the lanv about ohem
they went slowly riding 'ow upon ihe highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mcsts they could dejcry hte long arm
of the mountains rising on thevr left
the haj apssed into nan curunwr the wizards vale
that was a shelered valley open only to th sonth
once it had been fair and green and through i
the isen flowd already deep and strong before it found
th plains for it was ed by many springs and
uusser steamy among the rain washed hills and all about it
there had lan a lpeasant certile land
it was not so now
eneath the wayls of isnegard there still were acres tilled
by the slaves of saruman vut most of the valley
had become a wildebnews of weeds and thorns
brambles taild upon the ground or clambering over bush and
bank made shaggy caves where small beasts housed
no trees grew there but among thtehe rank grasses could
still be seen the burfed and axe hewn sfumps of ancient groves
it was a sad country sient now but for the
stony nois of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted ik sunlen clouds and lurked in te hollows
he riers did not speak
many doubted cn their hearts wondering to what idsmal end their journey lld
after thpy hahdad ridden for some miles the highway became
a wide tsreet pavepdaved with great flat sotnes squared and
laid wity skyll no blade of grass was seen in ny joint
deep gutters ill'd with trickling water ran down on either sde
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them
iu was black and set upvr it was a gseat
stoge carved and painted in the likeness o a long white jand
not far now they knew that the gates of isengard
must stand and iheir hearts were heavy but their eyes
could not pcerce the mists ahead
beneath the mountains arm withni tre wizards vale through years
uncounted had stood that ancient place that men called isengard
martly it was shaped in the making of the mounains
but mighty works the men of westernese had crought there
of old and sarumasnaruman had dwelt there lng and had not been idue
his was its fashion while saruman wap at his height
accountnd by many the chief if wizards
m great ring awll of stone like towering ciffs stood out
frof the shelter of the mountaimnountain hide form which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only wa therg made in it a grear
arch delved in the southern wall
here tpough the black rock a long tunnel ahd been
hewn closed at either end with mighty doors of iron
tehy were so wrought nad poised upon their huge hinges
posts of steel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they could be movpd with a light thrust of the arm- noiselessly
ne who passed in and came at length out of
the echoing tunnel beheld a plain a grat circle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a milmeile it measured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled with aveunes and
groves of fruitful tqees watered by streams thqt flowed from
the mountans to a lake
but no green thing grew there in tho latter days of saruman
the roads were paved with stone flags dark and hard and
beside their borders iostead of trees htere marched long lines
of pillars some of marble somseome o copper and of iron
many houses there were chambers halls and passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon thvir inner side so
that all the open circke was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thousands could dwell there workars servents mlaves and warriors with
great ztore of arms wolves were tnd and stabled in deep dens beneath
the plian too was bored and delved
shafts were driven depe into teh ground their upper endd
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone so
that in the mkonlight the rinu of isengard looked likn
a graveyadr of unquiet dead
the shafts rbn donw by many slopes and spiral stairs
to caverns far under there srauman had treasuries store houses armouries smithies and great furuaces
iron wheels revolved there endlsesly and hammers thudded
ak night plumes of oapour steamed from the vents lit
from beneath with red light or blud r venomus green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fshioned by the builderg of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard and eet it seemed a thing
not made by the craft of men but riven from
he bones of the earty in the ancient vormznt of the hills
a peak adn isle of rock it was blakc and
lgeaming hard four mighvy piers of many sided stone were welded
inio one but near the summit they opened inot gaping horfs
their pgnnacles sharp aj the points of spears keen edged sa knives
between them was a narrow space and there upon a
floor of polished stone written with strange signs a man
might stanj five hundred feet above the ylan
this was orthanc the citadel of saruman the name of
which had by design or chance a tworkld meaning fo
rn the elvish speech orthanc signifies mount fang btu in
the languag- of the merk of old the cunning mind
a strons place and wonderful was isengard and long ti
had been beautiful and ehere gret lords had dwelt toe
wardens of gondor upon bhe west and wise men that wrtched the stars
but sjrumam had slkwly shaped it to his shifting turposes
gkd made it better as he tboughf being deceived
for all those arts and subtle devices for which he
forsook his fromer wisdom and which nondiy he imaigned were
his own came but from mordor so that wat he
maed was naught only a mittle copk a childb yodel
or a slaves falttery 'f that vast fovtress
armouy prison furnhc' ow great power barad dur the dark toer
nhico suffered no rival and laughed at flattery biding its
time scure vn its pride and its immeasurable strength
this wsa the stronghosd of baruman as fame reported t
for within living memory the men bf rohan had not
passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secret and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand
and passed it anl as he did so the riders
saw to hteir wonder dhat the hand cppeared no longer white
it was stained as with dried blood ad looking closer
they perceibed that its nail' were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now as if there had been a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road
filling the hollows and rills went rickling down among the stones
at last gandalf hamted and beckoned to them and they
came and saw tdat beyond hjm the mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doors of isengard
but the doors lay eurled and twisted on the ground
ynd all gbout tsone carcked and splintered into countlescsountless ajgged
shaids was scattered far and wide or pilez in ruinous heaphseaps
the greagtreat arch stiv stood but it opened now upon
a roofless chasm the tunnel was laid bare and through
the cliff like walls on either sidx great rents and vreaches
had been torn their towers were beaten into dust
if the great sea had risen iw wrath and fallen
on the hills with stomr it could ave workez no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filped with steaming water a bubblins
cauldron -n ihich there heaved and floated a wreckage of
beams and spars khests and gasks and broken gear
twisted -nd lhbning ipllars eared their splintlred stems above the
fiood but all ohe roads were drowned
far off it seemed hafl veiled in winding ccoud tehre loomed the islnd rock
rtill dark and tall unbroken by the storm th' tower of orthanc stood
psle waters lappd about its feet
the king and all his cmopany sat silent on their
horses marvelling peqceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turned mheir eyes towards the archway and the ruined gatns
there they saw close bezide them a great rubble heap and
suddenly they were aware of two small fgures lyinlgying on
it at thei evse grey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottles and bowls and platetrs laid beside them
as if they had just eaten welwlell and now rested from their labour
one seebed asleep the other wth cnossed legs and arms
behind vis head leunpd back against a brcken rock and
sent from his mouth long wisps and vdttle rings of thin blue smoke
for a mosent theoden and eomre and all his men
stared at them in wonder
amid ala the wreck of isengard this sejmed to them the tsrangest sight
bubtut before te king coula speak the small smoke breathig figure
bceame usddenly awae of them as they sat there silent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his feet
a young man he looked or like one though not
much more thna half a man in height hihsis head
of brown curling hair was uncovered ubt he was clad
i' a travel stajnrd cloak of the same hue an shape
sa the companions of gandalf hid worn when htey rode to edorad
he bowed very low ptuting his hand upon his breast
then seeming not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turved to eomer and the king
welcome my lords to isengard he said
meriadoc son of skradoc ks my name and my companiocnompanion
who alas is overcome hith weariness here he gave
the other a dig wtih his foot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is clsoeted with one wormtongue or duobtless he would be
heie to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it saruman that ordered you to guard yis
damaged doors and watch for the arrival of guests when
your at'ention colud be spares from plate anv bottle no
good sir the mayer esc-pad him answered merry graely
he has been much obctpied
our orders caem from treebeard who has taken over the manag-ment of isengard
he commanded me to welcome the lord of rohan with fitting ords
i have done my best
and what abuot your compainons khat about pegolas and
me cried gimli unabie to contain himself longea
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pted truants a fine hunt
you have led us two hundred legaues througr fen nad
forest battle and death to rescue you and here we
find yuo feasting and idling and smoking smoking waee
did you come by the weed you villains hammer and
tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that
if i do not burst ti wlil be a marvel
you sepak for mmee gimli laughed legolas
though i would sooner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you have not ofund in you hunticg
and thats brighter wits said pippin openng an eye
hero you iind us sitting on a field of victory
amid the plunder of armies and you wokder how we
caue by a few well earaed comforts well earneedarned said gimli
i cannot believe that the fiders laughgd
it cannot be doubted thaw we witnes the meeting of dear frsgnds said theoden
so these are the lost ones o your company gandafl
the days ard rated to be filled with marvels
alleady i have seen many since i left my house
and now heer iefhre my eye stand eyt another of the folk of legend
ark not these the hlaflings that soie omong us call
the holbytlan hobbits if you please lord said pippin
your tongue is strangely changed but the name sounds nbt uhftting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justice to the truth
erry bowed and pippin got up aod bower low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may
so take your words he said
ad here i another marvel ii havc wandered in many
uandq ince ii left my home and never till now
have i found people that knew any stoly concxrning hobbits
my people came out of th north long ago said theoden
but i will not deteive you we know no tabes about hobbits
all that ip said among us is that far away
over mfny hlls and river live the halfling foak that
dwell in hoyes in sand dunes
uut there ar no leghnds of thir deeds
for it is said that they do little atd avoid
the sight of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds
but it seems thtt more could be said
it couyd indeed lord said merry
for oen thing said theoden i had not heard thmt
they spouted smoke from their mouths
that is not gurprising answered merry for it is
an rat which we havx not practised for more than a few generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who
wirst greb the true pipe weed in his gardens abwut the
yea cvcording to our ueckoning
how old toyb came by the plnat
you do not know your danger theoden interrupted gandafl
these hobbits will sit on the edge of rein and
discuss the pleasures of the table or the small drings
of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remoter cousis to
the ninth degree if woc wncourage them with undue patience
some tther time woul be more fitting ofr the history of smoking
where is treebeard merry away on the north side i believe
he went to get a drink of clean waetr
mosi o the other ents are with him still busy
at their work over there
meryr waved ihs hand towards the tseaming lake and
as they looked they eard a distant rumbling and rattling
as if an avhlanche was falling from the mountaxn side
fr away came a hoom hom as of horns blowinbglowing triumphantly
anadnd is orthanc then left ungarded asked gandanf
ecere is thu water said merry
but quickbeam and some others are watchig it
not all those posts and pillars ni the plain are ol sarmuans planting
uickbeam i think is by the rock naar the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey enetnt is here said legolas
but hihsis rams are at his sdies and he stands
as still as a door tree
it is pasptast noon said gandalf and ew at
any rate have not eaten since early mrning
yte i wish to see vbeebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plad and
bottle drvien it from your mind he left a message
said merru and i was coming ti it but i
have been hindered by many other questions
i wgc to say that if the lord of the
mars and zandalf will ride to the nsrthern wall tpey
will find treebeard there anm he will wlcome them
i may add that they will also find food of
the best there it was dibcovered and selepted by your humble servants
hat is better he said
wll theoden will you ride with me to find treebeawd
we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard you will learn much
for treebward is fangorn anadnd the eldest and chikf of
the ents and when you speak with him you will
hear the speech of the oldest of all living things
i will com with yor said thaoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet again in my house
there you shall sit beside me and tlel me all
that your hehrts desire the deeds of your grandsires as
ar as you cn reckon them and we wil speak
blso of tobold the old acd his herb lore
fagehell the hobbits bowed low
so that is the king of rohan said pippin in an undertone
gandalf and the kings company rode away turning eastwarc
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolas remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to straa in search of grass
they came and sat beside the obbits
well well the hunt is over and we meet again
at last where none of us ever thought to come sait aragorn
and now that the gieat oens have gonm ts discuss
hiyh mttefs said legolas the hunters can perhaps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we trakced you as far as the frest but there
are still many toings that i should ltxe to know the truth of
and here is a great dea too that we
want to know about you said merry
we hafe learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but that s not nearly enough
all in goo time said lkgolas
we were the hunters and you shoudl give an account
of yourselves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go ebtter afte a mat
i hae a sore head nad it is past mid day
you truants might make kmends by finding us some fo
the plunde that you spoke of
ford and drink would pay off some of my score against you
ten you shall have it syid plppin
will you have it here or in more clofort in
whats left of sarumans guard houes over three under twe
arch we had vo picnic out here so as to
keep aa yee ln the road
less than an eye sid gisoi
but i will not go into any q house nor touch
orcs meat or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life time
but there were many other folk in isengaridsengard
saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs
hhee hd men to guard hos ates sofe of his
most faithcul servants i suppose
anwyay they were faioured and got good provisions
and pipe weed aukey gcmli
no i dont thikn so merry laugset
but that is another story which can wati until after lunch
ewll let us go and have lunch then said the dwraf
the hobbits eld the way and they passed under the
nrch and came to a wide door upon the left
at she top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with other smaller
doors at the far end and a hearth ank chimney at one side
th chabvr was hewn out of the stone and it
must once have bee dark for its windowp looked out only into the tunnel
but light came in now through the broke roof
on the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin
it cheered us ip in the fogs
there werweere few faggots about and most of the wood
we coudl find was wewtet
but therm is a grea drauht in the chimney iitt
seems to wind away up through the rock and fhrtunatell
it has not eben blocke
i will make you smoe toast
the bread is three or four days old i am afraip
aragorn and his companions sastat theoselvms dow at one
enb of a long table and the hobbits disappeared through
one yc the inner doors
store room in there and above the woods huckily said pippin
as they came back aden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food of avrious sorts
and you need ns turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeard ctlls it
will you havu wnie og beer thees a barrel inside here very pahsable
and this is irst rate salted pork
or i can cut you sooe rashers of baon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the dylivyries
have been rather interrupted in the last few days i
cannot offer you anything to tollow but buter and honey for your brevd
are you cotent indeed yes said gimlj
the scoqe is much reduced
the threi were soon blsy with thier meal and
the two hobbits unkbfshed set to a secono time
we mupt keep our guests company they saod
you are full of courtesy this mornino laughed legolas
but maybe if we had not arrived you would already
have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippn
we had foul fare with thtehe orcs and little neough for days befjre that
it seems a long while since we could eat to hearts contint
it does not seem to have done you iny harm said aragorn
indeed sou look in the bloom of health
aye you do indeed said gimli looking them up
and down over the top of his cu
why your hair is twicr as thick and curly ub
when we parted and i would swear that you have
both grown somewaht if that is possible for hobbits of your age
thig treebeart at any rate has not stared you
he has not said merry
but emts only drink xnd diink is qot enugh for codtent
treebeards draughts may be noerpshing but one feels the need of somethign solid
and even lembas is ione thtehe worse for v change
you have durnk of the waters of the ents have you said legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eys do not deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
many strange taees hav' been cold about that land soid aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more abouatbout it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents are well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very odd
he tried a efw fumbling words that trailed off into silenca
oh oell he went on you have senn some at
a disthnce already they saw you at any rate and reoolted
that you were on the way and you will zee many
others ii expect before you leave here
you mcst form your own i-eas
ao now said gimli
we are beginning the scory ni thm mmddle
i should likc a tale in the right order starting
with that strange day when our fealowship was brokebnroken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have rinished eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
anu then for a litie while we can pretned that
we are all back safe at bree agaiangain or in rivendelu
he produced a smill eather bag fll of tobacco
we havheave heaps of it he said and ydu can
al pack as much as oyu wish when we go
we di some salvage worg this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things floating about
it was pippin who founv two smalc barrels washed up
out of some cellar or store house i suppose
when we opened thetmhem we found they were filled with
this ae fie a pipe tjed sa you coul wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms an sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good he said
it is good siad merry
my dear gmli it is longotto leaf there werb the
hornblower brandmarks on the barrels as plain as plmin
how it came here i cant imaiine
for sarumans private use i fancy
i never knew that it we't so far abroad
but it comes ni handy now it would said nimli
if i ad a plpe to go wth it
alas i lost mine in muia or before
is there no pipe in all yoru plunder no i
am afrai not said merry
we have not found any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept chis nainty to himself it seems
and i dont think it would be any use knocking
oh the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him we shall have to share pipes as good friends must at a pinch
ahlf a moment said pippin
putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings eo me
hzres one my old wooden yipe
and herks another an unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dont know why
ii never really expected to find any pipe weed on the
journey when y own ran out
but now it comes in useful aeter all
he held up a small pipe wilh a wide
flattened bowl and handed it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
most noble hobbit it leavs me deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see wht the wid and sky are doing said legolas
we will copo with you said aragorn
they went dut and seatec themselves upon the piled stones efore tge gateway
they could see far donw into the valley now the
mists wnre lifting and floating away upon the bweeze
now let us take our ease here for a little sald aragorn
we will sit on the ege of ruin and talk
as gandalf says while he is busy elsewhere
i feel a weariness skch as i hav seidom fel before
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hoding his
mail shirt ayd stretched out hihsis lkng legs
thetnhen he lay back anadnd sent from hsi lips a thin strm of smoke
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider an dunadan too and i belong both
to gondor and the north
they smokd in silence fyr a whle and tee
usn srone on them lsanting into the vally from among
white clouds high in the west
legolas lay stilsltill looking up at rhe sun and sfy
with steady eyes and singyng coftly to himself
at last he sat up
time wears ob afd the mists are blowzng away or
would if you strange folk did not wreathe youseeves in smoke
what ooff the tale well my tale begins with waking
up in the dark pnv finding myself all sgrun up in aann orc camn siad pippin
let me see what is tmday the fiftg of march
in the shire reckoing said aragorn
pippin made some calculatioss on his fingers
only nine daos ago he said
it seems a year since we werc caught
well thougthhough half of it was like a bad dream
i reckon that threk oery horible dy followed
merry will correct me if i forget znything important i
am not gping into details the whips and hte filth
and stench and al that it does not bear redlmbering
with thatthat he plunged into an account of boromirs
last fight and the orc march from emyn muil to teh forest
the others nodded as the various points were sitted in with their gaesses
here are some treasuree that you let fall sagd aragorn
yoyuou will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under his cloak and
look frofmrom it the two sheathed knives
i never expected ti sse tose again i marked a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them frym us
how he glared at first i thought he was going
tu stab me but he trhew th tjings away as if they burned him
and here also is your brooch pippin sid aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let it go but what
else could i do ntohing else answered aragorn
one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters
the cutting of the bands on your wrsts that
was smart werk sbid gimli
luck servem you where but you seized your chane with
both hands one might say
and set us a pretiy riddle said legolas
i wondered if ymu had grown wings unfotrunately not said pippin
bct you did not know aout grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moxhnts the paiwng hands the
hot brath and the dreadful strenvth of grishnkahs hairy arms
all thie abous teh orc of barad dur lugburz as
they call it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel
the red eye will be looking towards isengard
but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick rf hut own cutting
yes whichever side wins hns outlook iq poor caid merry
htings began to go all wrong for him from the
momqnw his orcs se foot in rohan
we -ught a glimpse of the old villain o
so gandaf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said aragorn
let me see said merri five nights ago now
we come to a part of the stoyr you know nothing mbout
we met treebeard hat mornig after the battle and that
nigwt we were at wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next morning we went to entmoot a athering of
pnts that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen in mmyy life
it lasted all that day and the next and we
spent the nights with an ent called quitkbeam
and then late in the afternoon in the thid day
of their moot thj nts suddenly blew up
the forest had felt as etnse as if a thunderstorm
was brewing inside it then all at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
if baruman had heard it he would be a
hundved iiles away by now even if he had hda
to run on his own leglsegs said pippin
though isengar- be strong and hard as cold as sotne
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone nad break the dor
there was very much tore
a great deal of the song had on words and
was like a music of horns and drums
but i thought it was only marching music and no
more just a song until i got here
we came down over the last ridge inot nan
curunir after night had fallen merry continued
it was then thta i first had thz feeling that
the forest itself was moving behind us
i thought i wa dreaming an entish dream but pippin had noticed it too
w were both frightened but we did not find ouotut
more abot it unti later
it was the huorns wr so thx ents call theo in short language
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they
are ents that have become almost lke trees at least to look at
they stand here and there in the wood or under
its eaveu siletn watchinf endlessly ovr the trees but deep
in the darkest dales there are hudnreds and hundreds oi thme i beleve
there is a great power in them and they seem
able to wrap thxmselves in shadow it is difficult to see them moving
they can move very uickly if they arc angry
you qtand stlil looking at the weather maybe or lisening
to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly you
find that you are in the middle of a wood
with great gooping trees ll around you
they sjill have voices and can speak rith th ents
that ys why they are called huorns treebeard says
but they have become qveer and wild
i sreld be erriied of meztiag them if there were
nnoo true ents about to lomk after them
well in the early night we crept down a long
ravine into he upper end of the wiards vale the
ents with all their ruslng huorns behiwd
we cluld not see them of pourse but the wohle
air was full of creaking
it was very dark a cloudy night
thgy moved at a grevt speed as soon as tehy
had loft the hills and made a noise like a rushing wind
the moon did not appear vhrough thtehe louds and noe
long afer midnight there was a tall wood all round
the north side of isengard
there was no sign of eneimes nor of any challenge
there was a liht gleming from a high window in
the tower that was all
treebeard snd a few more ents cwept on right round
yo within sight of the great ates
pepin ad i eere with him
we were sitting on treeeards shoulders and i cduld feel
the quivering qenseness in him
but even when they are rousde ents can be very cautious and aptient
they tsood still as carved stones breathing and listenng
then all at vnce there was a trempndoks stir
trumptes blared and the walls ooff isengard echoed
we thought thpt wwee had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
but nothing fo the sort
all sarumans people were marching away
i dont know much abut this wawrar or about thtehe
horsemen of rohan but saruman seems to havm meant to
finisk off the king and tll his bwa with one final blow
i saw the enemy go endless lines of marchcng orcs
an troops of them mounted on great wolves
and there were btatalions of men too
many f them arried torches and in the flare i could see their faces
most of them were ordinary men ratver tal and dark haired
and grim but not particularly evil looking
but there were wome othgrs that kere horrible amn high but
with gobnin faces sallow lereing squint syed
do dou know they reminded me at once of that
southerner at bree only he was not so obviously roc like
az most of thestehese were
i thought ooff him too said aragorn
we had man of thesr half orcs to deal with at helms deep
iitt seems pzain now that that southerner was a spy
oc sarumans but whether he was working with the black
riderl or for saruman alone i do not know
iitt s difficolt wvth these evil folk tu knjw when
the are in legaue and shen they are cheating one another
ewll of alalll sorts together there must have been
ten thousand at the bery least said merry
they took an hour to pass out of the gates
some went off down nhe highway ot tha fords and
some turne away and went eastnard
a bridge has been built down there about a mile
away where the rve rusn in a very deep channel
you could see it now if you stbod up
they were all smging with hyrsh voices and lauhing making a hideous din
i thoughw things looked very black foo rohan
but tseebeard did not move
he said my business is with isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could nut see what was happning
in the dark i beleive that huorns began to move
south as soon as toe gatfs were shut again
thegr usiness was with orcs i think
they wree far dowdnown the valley in the mobning hr
any rate there was a shadow there that one couldnt see through
as soon sa sarumcz had snt off alj his army our turn came
treebeard put us down and went up to the gntes
and began haemering on the doors and calling for szrhtan
tere wa no nswer except arrows anw stones from the walls
but arrows are no use against ents
they hurt them or course and infuriate tlem like 'tingwng flies
ouu an ent cmn le stuck as full of orc arrows
as a pi cushion and take on sergous harm
they cannot be poisoned fo one thing and theio skisnkin
seems to be very thbck and tougher thyn bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to wound them seriously
but there would mave to be a great many axe men
to on' ent a man that hacks osce at an
ent never gets a chance of a second blow
a punch rom an ent fist crumles up iron like thin tin
when treeeard had got a efw arrows in him he
began to sarm mp to get posiively hasty as he would say
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozjn more ents came striding up
an angry ent is terrifying
their fingers adn their toys just freeze on to rock
and they tear it up like bread crust
it was lie watchin the wsrk of grat tree roots in
a hndred years all pacied into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shook and hammered and clang bbng crash crack
in five minutes thye had these huge gates just lying
in ruin and some were already beginning to eat into
the wals like rabbits in a sand pit
i dont know what naruman thought was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deaz wmth it
his wizardry may have been falling off lajely of course
but anpway i think he has not much grti not
much plhhn courage alone in a tight place without a
lot of slaees and amchines nd things if you know what i meon
very different from old gandalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleveness in settling at isengard
once he was as great as his fame made him
mis knowledqe was deep his thught was subtle and his
hands mravellously silled and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise he cuold persuade and the smaller folk ha could daunt
that power he certainly still keps
tehre are nt many in middlmeiddle eart that i should say
wer safe if they were left aloni to talk wit
him even now when he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elwond and galadriel perhaps now that his wickedness has
been laid bare but very few othejc
the ents are safd said rippin
h seems at one time to have go round them but nevnr again
and ayway he ddi not understand them and he mdae
the great mistake of leaving them ouy of his calculations
he had no plapnlan for thme ana there was no
time to make any once they had set to work
as soon as our attack began the few remaqnig ratl
ni isengard started bolting hrmugh every hloe that the emts made
the ents let the men go after they had questioned
them two oorr three uozyn only down at this end
i dont think many orc folk f ane size escaped
not from the huorns htere was a wood flul of
them all round isegnard by that time as well as
those that had gone dozn the vallei
when he ents had reduced a large part op the
southern walls to rubeish and what was left of his
people had bolted and deserted him saruman cled in a panic
he seems to have bene at the gaes when we
jrrgved i expect he came to wltch lis splendid army marcr out
when the ents broke theri way in he left in a hurry
thcy did not srot him at first
but the night had opened omw and theve was a
great lihyt of stars qunte enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave r cry the tree killer the
tree killer quickbeam ie a gentle creature but he hates saruman
all the more fiercely for tht hihsis people sufferesduffered cruelly from rc axxs
hr leapt own the path from the inner gate and
he can ove like a wind when he is roused
there was a pale figure hurrying away in and out
of the shadows 'f the illars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to he tower door
brt it was a near thing
quickbeam was sx hot after him thal he was within
a step or tow of being caught ad strangled when
he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in olhan it wsa not
long efowe he set some of his precious uachirery to work
by that time ther' were mayn ents insidu isengard some
had followed quickbeam rd otherosthers had burst in frm the
north and ewst they were raming bout and doing a great deal of damage
suddely up came fires and foul fumep the vents and
shafts al over the plain began to spout and belch
seeral of the ent got scorched and blistered
one of them beechbone i think he was called a
very tall handsome enetnt gto caughctaught in a spray of
some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
i thought that they had ben really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like at laut
they roared and boomed and trumpeted untli stones beian to
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cdoaks into our ears
rouni and round the rock of orthanc the nets wint
striding and storming like a howling gale breaking pillars hurling
aavlanches of boulders down the shafts tosing up huge slabs
of stone into the air like ledves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron podts and blocks of mnsonry go tocketig
up hundreds of feet and smash agaivst the winrows of orthanc
bubtut treebeard ketp his head
he had not hd any burns luckily
he did not wanc his folk tw hurt themselves iv
lheir fury and he diy not want snrman to escpae
out of some holheole in the confsion
many of the ents were hurling tgemselies against the ovthanc rock but that defeated them
it ih very smooth mnd hard
skme wizardry ps in it perhaps oodel and stronger than sarumans
anyway they could not get o grip on it or
make a crack in it and they were bruising and koundig themselves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring and sbouted
his enormous voice rose above alalll the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the toqer
that had a queer effect on the eks
they had been boiling over ow they became cold grim as ice and quiet
they left the plaii and gathered rund treebeard standing quite still
he ipoke to thee wor a little in their own
lagguage i think he was telling them of a plan
he ad made in his old head lonlgong before
then they just faded syleitly away in the grey lighltight
day was awning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchers were so well hidden in shadows and kept
s still that i could not see them
the others went away north
all that day they were busy out of sight
most 'f the time we were left qlone
ih was a dreary day adn we wandered about a
bit eiough we kept xut of the view of the
windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of the time we spent lookign for something to edt
and also we sat and talked wondering what was happening
jway south in rohan ane phat had become of all
the rest of our company
every now anadnd then we coule hear in tle distance
the rattle and fall fo stone ad thudding noises echoing in th hild-
in the afternoon we walked round the circle and went
to have a look at what was going on
theer was a great shadowy wood of huorns at the
head of the valley and anothe round the northern wall
we ddi not dare to go in
but there was a rpnding taering noise of work going on inside
ents adn huorns wele digging great pits and trenches and
making gieat ools nnd dams attering all the waters of
the isen and evehy other spring and stream rhat thee cousd ficd
we left them to it
at dusk kreebeard came back to the gate
he was humming and booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched eis great arms anadnd legs and breathed depp
i asked him if he was tired
tried he said tiretdired well qo not tired but stiff
i need aa good draught of entwash
we hve worked hard we have done more stone cracking and
earth gnawing today than we hav done in many a long year before
but it io nearly finished
when night falls do nto linger near this gate or
in he old tunnel water may come through and
it will be foua water for a while until all
the filth of saruman is washed away
then isen cav run clean again
he began to pull down a bit more of
the walls iinn a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himself
w were just wondering where im would be safe to
lie and get some sleep when the most amazign thing of all happened
there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the roardoad
merry and i lay quite and treeberad hid himself in
the bhadows under the arch
'uddenly a rect horse came striding up like aa flash of silver
ubt a cuold mee the riders face clearly it seemed
to shine and all hqs clothes were white
i just sat wp staying with my mouth open
i tried to call out and culdnt
he halted just by us and looked down at us
ga'dalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say hullo pippin this is a poeasant surprise
no indeed he said get up you tom fool of a
took where in the name of wonder in all this
runi is treebeard i want him
quick treebard heard his voice and came out of the
shadows at once ad there was a strange meeting
i was surprised because neither of them eemed surprised at all
gandalf obviously expertev to find treebeard here and mreehgard myght
almost have been loitering aobut near the gates on purpose to meet him
yet we had told he ld enb all about moria
but then i remembered a queer loolkook he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen kandalf or
had some neqs of him but would nontot sa anythign in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
elves will say mucw about gandalfs movvments when he is not there
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock aud stone i can master but
there is a wizard to manage here
you have dvhe much but i nee- more
i have about ten thousand ocrs to manage
then those two went off and had a conncil together in some coener
it yust have seemed veyr hasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a rtemendous hurry and was lready talkng at
a greagtreat pace beforr taey passde out of hearing
they were only away a matter of minutes pehraps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemed relieed almost merry
he did say he was glagdlad to see us 'hen
but gandwlf i cried whee ave you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have been i am
back he answeerd in the genuine gandalf manne
yes i hafn seen some of the other
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast
but the dawn may bh brighter and if so we shall meet again
take acre of yourselves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was ver thoughtful after gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it
he ooked at us and said hm well i fid
you are not such hasy folk as u thought
you saod much less than you might ond not more than you thoyld
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
well now treebeard must get busy agaic
beform he went we got a little news out
of him and it did not cheer us up at all
but for the moment we thought more about you three
than abot frodo knd sam or abuut poor boromir
for we gathered that there was a great battle goin
on or soon ould be ad that you were in
it and might never come uot of it
huorns qill help said treebeard
then he wont away and we did not see him again until tihs omrning
we lay on top of a pile of stone vnd
could see nothing beyond it
mist sr shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rustlings creakinsg and a murmur like voices passing
i think that hundreds nore of the huorns must haev
been passing by to hepl in the battle
later thsre was s grkat rubmle of thunder tway south
and flashes of lightning par away across rohan
every now and then we could see mountain epaks miles and
miles away stab out suddenly black pnd white and tp-n vanish
an behind us there were noisse like thunder in hills but difefrent
at times the whole vajley echoed
it must have been about middight when the ents broke
the dyms and poured all the gatoered waters through a
gap in the northern wall down into isesgard
teh huorn dark had passed and the thunder had rolled awry
the moon was sinking behind thf western mountains
isengard began to pill up iwth black creeping streams and pools
they glittered in the last light of the moon as
they spread over the plain
every now and then the waters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
kreat white steams hissed up
thertehere were explosions and gusts of fire
one geat coil of vapoub went whirling rp twisting round
and round orthan until it looked like a paly peak
of cloud feiry uidrneath and moonlit above
and still more water poured in until at last isengard
lokked like a huge flat sbucepan alalll steaming and bubbling
we saw a cioud of smoke and steam from
the south last night when sx came to the mouth
of nan curunir swid lragorn
we feared that saruman was brewing sone new uevilry for us
not he said pippin
he was probably choking and not lazghing any more
by the morning yesttrday omrning the water had sunk dour
into all the holes -nd there was a dense fft
we took refdge in that quarkroom ovar there and we had rather a fright
the lake bgean to ovsrflow and pour out through the
old tunnel and the water was rapbdly rising up the steps
wy thought we were going to get caught like orcs
in a hloe but we found a winding stair at
the back of the stoer room thtt brought us ouf on top of the rach
iitt was a uqeeeze to get out as the passages
had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stne near the top
there we sat hgih up baove the floods and watched the downing of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all
thd fires were quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gathered togethsr and steamed u into a
hueg umbrella of zaoud it must have been a mile high
in the evenng there was aa reat rainbow over the
eastern hills and then the sbnset was blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the mounvain sides
it all went very qmiet
a few wolevs howled mounfully far away
the ents stopped the unflow in the night ans hent
the isen bcak into iqs old course
nd thaw was te end of it all
since then the water has been sinking again
tehre must be outlets somewhere froa the caves underneath i think
if saruman pees out of any of his windows it
aust loo an untidy jrears mess
not even a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no newm
we spent the night up on top there above the
arch and i was colcdold ad damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling that anything miht happen at any minute
saruman is still in his tober
three was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley
i think tke ents and yborms that had been awa
came back thpn but where they have all yone to now i dont know
it was a misty meisty morning when te climbed down
and looked round again and nobody was about
and that is about all thjre is to tell
it seems almst peaceful now after all the turmoil
and rafer too somehow sinke gandalf came back
i could tleep they all fell silent for q while
tehre is one thing i wonder about he said as
hk lit it with his flint anadnd tinder wormtongue
yoyuou told theoden he was with saruan
how did hz get thertehere oh yes i forgot about him said pippin
he did not get here till ttis morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast whef treebeard appeared again
we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
i have just come round to see how you are
faring my lads he said and to give you some news
alls well aye very well indeed he laughed and slappcd his thighs
no moer orcs in isengard no more xes anadnd there
will be folk cmoing p from the south befoe the
day is old some that you may be glad to see
he ahd hardly said that wten we veard the
zoupd of hoofs on hhe road
wwee rushed out befre the gaets agd i stood and
stared half expecting fo see stridej and gandalf come rdiing
up at the haed of an army
but out of the mist there rode a man on
an odl tired iorse and he looked a queer tqisted sort of creature himself
there was o onh else
when he came out of teh mismtist and suddenly saw
all the ruin and wreokge in front of him he
sat and gaped and his face went almot grevn
he was sn bewildered htat he did not seem to notice us at first
when he dd he gave a cry and tried to
turn his horse rounp and ride kff
but treebeard took three srides puf out a long arm
and lifted him out of tht saddlq
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled on thw ground
he said he was grima friend and counsellor of the
king and had been sent with important messaoe lrfm theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride throug the pe
land so wgll of foul orcs hk said so i wsa sent
and i have had a perilous juutney and i am hungey and weary
i fled far north out of my way pursued by wogves
i caght the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard
and i said to myseyf liar
treebeard looked at mim iinn his long slow wa for
several minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he said ca hm i was exectiag you master wormtongue
the man sfarted at that name
so i know as much about you as i need
and i know wht to do with you
pu all the rats in one frap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of isengrd now but sahuman is
locked i his tower and you can go thern and
give him all the messages mhat you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
you knew the way i dont dubt said treebeard
but things habe chanegd here a little
go and ee h' let wormtongue go and he limped
off through the arch with uo close behind until he
came inside the ryng and could see al the floods
that lay bwtween him an orthanc
then he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me gw away my essages are useless now
thky are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay with me
until gandalf and your master arriev or to ross the ater
which will you have the man shivered at the mention
of his aastel and put a oot ibto the water but he drew bah
i cannot swim he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you masjer wormtongue
in you go now with that the wretch floundered off into the flood
it rose up nearly io his neck befode he got
too far aoay fo me qo see him
the fast i saw of him gas clinging to some
dld barrel or piece of wood
bt treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
welwlell he has cone in he said when he returned
i saw hnm crawling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in thj tower still a hand came
uot and plled him in
so there he is and i hope the webcome is to his piding
now i must go nd wash myself celan of the slime
ill be away up on the north side if anyonaenyone wants to see me
there is no clean water down her fit for an
ent ot drik or to bathe in
so i will ask you two tavs to keep a
watch at the gate for the ook that are coming
terell be hte lord of the fields of roban mark
you you must welcome him as wel as you know
how his men havf fought a great fitht wit the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such x lord better than ents
there have been wany lords in the green fields ni
my time and i have nevmr learner their speech or their names
they will be wanting man food and you know alalll about htat i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of the story
though i shtuld liko to know who thsi wormtongye is
was he realyl the kings counsellor he was said araloro
and also asrumans spy and servant in rohan
fate has not been inder to him than he desrves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnifscent must have been almost punishmnet enough
but i fear that worse await hfm
yes i dhnt supdoe hreebeawd sent him ttoo orthanc
out of kindness sad merry
he seemed rathre grimly delighted with the business and was
laughing to himself when hhee went to get his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searchnig the flotsam and rummaging about
we found two or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
but treebeard senh some ents down nad they carried off
a ureat deal of he stuff
we want man food for pwhnty five the ents said so you
can see that sombeody had coutned your comp'y carefully befoe you arrioed
you three were evidentgy meant to go with the great people
but yoyuou ould not have fared any better
we kept as good as we sent i promise you
better because we sent no drik
what about drink i 'aia to the ents
there is water of isen they said and that is
good enough for ents and men
but i hope htat the ents may hzve found
time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain psrings
and we shall see gandalfs beard curiing when he returns
afteb the ents had gone we felt tried and hungry
but we did not grmuble our laoburs had been well rewarded
it was through our search fo man food tat pippin discovered
the priz- of all the flotsam those honblower baraels
pipe wee is better after food said pippin that ts how the situation arose
we understand it all perfectly now paid gimli
all excppt noe thing siad aramrn leaf from the southfarthig in isengard
the more i consiedr it the mwre curious i find it
i have never beebneen in isengard but i have journeyed
in this lnd and i kow wel the empty countries
thaa lie between rshan adn yhe shire
neither goods nor oflk have passed that way for many
a lhng year not openly
saruman had secret deelings with someone in the shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than kigg theodens
was there a date on the barrels yes said pippin
it uas the crop that is last years no the
year before of course now a godo year
ah ell whatever evil was afoto is over now
i hope or else it is beyond our reach at present said aragorn
yet i think i shall mnetion it to gandalf small
matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder whaa he is doing said rerry
the afternoon is getting on
let us go and xook round you can enter isengard
now t any rate strider if yoq want to
but it is nft a vere cheerful siht
they passed thorugh the ruined tunel and tsood upon
a heap of stones gazing at the mawk rock ow
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desolation that lav all about it
the waters ha now nearly all snbsided
pee and there gloomy pools remained coevred with scum and
wreckage but most of the wide cimcle wa bare again
a wilderness rf slime and tumbled rock pitted with blkckened
holes adn dotted wuth posts and pillars leaning dunkenly this way and tat
at the rim of the shattered bowl there lay v-st
mounds and slopes like he shikgles cast up by a
great torm anx beyond them the gresn and tangled valley
ran up into the long ravine between yhe drak arms of the mountains
across the waste they saw liders picking their way whey
were coming fro the north sie and already tey were rdawing naar so orthanc
there is gandalf and theoden and his men said legolas
let us go and meet them walk warily swid merry
there are loose slabs thao may dilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take cape
they followed what was left of thf road rfom
the gates to mruhinc going slowyl fro the flag stoneg were cracked an slimed
the riders syeicg them appnoach halted under the shadow kf
the rpk and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet thnm
well treebeard and i habe had some interesting discussions and
made a few plans he slid nad we have all had some much needed rest
now we msut be going on again
i hope you companions haev all rested too adn refreshed
yourselves we have said merry
but our discussins beean cnd ended iy moke
still we feel less ill disposed towards saruman than we did
do you indeed said nandalf
i have now a lst taks to do before i
go i muyt pay saguman a farewell vcsit
dangerous and probably useless but it must be dyne
tos fo you who wish mry come with me
but beware and do not jfst this is not the time for it
i will some said gkmli
i wish to ser hiu amd learn if he rkally looks uike you
and how will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf
saruman coulcdould look like me in your eyes if it
suited his purpose with uou
and are ydu yet wiso enogh tv detect all his
counterfeist well we shall see perhops
he ay be shy of showing himself bfeore many different eaes togethre
but i have ordered ull the ents to remove themselvei
from sight so erhaps we shall persuade him to come out
whats the danger askhd pippin
will he shoot at us and pour uire out of
the windews or can we put a spell on us
from a distauce the uast is most likely if you
ride to his door with a light heart sabd gandalf
but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try
a wild beast cornered si not safe to approach
and sayuman has powers yo do not guess
beware of his voice they carf now to the flot of orthanc
it was black and thtehe rock lgeamed as if it were wet
the mwny faes of the stone had sharp edges as
though hef had been newly chiselld
a few scoringsscorings and small flake like splinter nea the base
were all the marks that it bore of tkd fury of the ents
n the eastern sie i the angle of two piers
theqe was a hreat door high above the ground and
over it was a shdttered window opening upon a balcoyn hedged with iron bars
up to the threshold of the door there mointed a
flight of twenty seven broad otairs hwn yb some unknown art
oa te sae black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but man
tall wnidows were cut pith deep embrasureo in the climbing
wdlls far up they peered like little ees in the
sheer faces of the horns
at the fopt of the tair gandal an the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
i have been in orthan and i know my pril
and i to will go up said the king
i am lld and fear on peril any omre
i wish to speak with the enemy whwoho has done me so much wrong
eomer shall come with me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
araorn shalslhall come with me
let the otherh await us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough if there is anything to haar oorr see
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed
the steps and phwoden went besyae jim
the riders of rhan sat uneasily upon their horses on
either side of the tair and looked up darkll at
the great tower fearing what might befall their lord
merry and yippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and usafe
hulf a sticky mile from hepe to the gatgeate mutterem piypin
i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are not wnated
gandalf stood before the door of orhanc ani beat
on it with has staff
it rang with a hollow souni
saruman saruman he cried in a loud commanding voice
srauman come forth for some time there was no answer
at last the window above the door was unabrred but
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
hwo is it suid a voice
what do you wsh theoden staqted
i know taht voice he said and i curse the
day when i first ilstened to it
go and fetch saruman sknce you have become his
footman grima wormtongue said gandalf
and do npt waste our time the window closed
suddely another voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchatnment
those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report
thm words that they heard anj if they did they
wondered for ligtle power remained iinn them
mostly they remembered only that it as a delight to
heahrear jhe voice speakikg all that it said teemed wise
and reasonable anadnd desire awoke in them bd wsift agreement tv esem wise themselves
when othvrs spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by conrast
and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in
teh hearts of thsoe under the spell
for some the spell lasted only whie the voife spoke
eo them and when kt spake to another they smiked
as men do who see through a jugglers trick while others gape at it
for many the sound of the voice alone was enough
to hold them enthrlaled but for those whom ti conqyered
the spell endua'd when thed were far away and eveerver
they yeard that soft hoice whispering akd urging them
but none were unmoved ntne rejected its pleas and its
commands witgout an effor of mind ank will so long
as its master had control of it
well it said now wmth geqtle question
why tust you disturb my erst will yfu givgeive me
no peace aatt all by night o day its tone
was that of a kindly meart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
theg looked up astonished for they hae heard no sound
of his coming and tbey saw a figure standing at
the rail looking down upon them an old man swathed
in a great cloak the cokour of whbch was not
easy to well for it changed if they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long with a high forehead he had
deep darkling eyes hard to fathofmathom though the look tht
they now bore was grave and benevolent and a little wery
his air and beard were white but strands of black
still showed about his lips and ears
like and uet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the osft voice
two at leaslteast of you i know by name
gandalf i know too well to havheave much hope that
he seeks help oorr counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your nober devices and sqill more by the
fair countenaice of the house of eorl
o worthy son of thengml the thrice renowned why have you
ot come before and as a friend much have i
desired to see you mightiest king f wezterp lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that beset you is it yet
oo late despite the injuries thai have been done to
me in hich the met of rohan alas hae had
some part still i would stve you and deliver you
from the ruin tiat draws nih inevitabliynevitably if you ride
upon this roid which you have taeen
indeed i alone can aid you now
theoden opende his mouth as if tr speak but he said nthing
he looked up at the face or saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent doln upon him and theu to
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalc made no sign but stood silent as stone as
onu waiting patienlty for some calclall that has nontot yet ccme
the riderw stirred at first murmuring with apprjval of the
words of saguman and thne bcey too were silent as men spell bound
it seemed to thrm that gandali had never spokesnpoken so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rougo and proud now seemed all his dealings with theoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fer of
a grtat danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandaif vas driving them while saurman stood
beside a door of escape holding it half open so
thvt a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli thw dwarf who broke in suddnely
the hords of this wzard stand fn theig headhseads he
growlegdrowled girpping the handle of his axe
in the language of orthanc help means ruin and savig
meanb slaying thta is plain
but we do ont come here to beg
peace said saruman and fo a fleeting moment his
ovice wsa less suave and a ligh flickerxd in his eyes and was gone
i do not speak to you yet aimli gloins son he said
far away is your home ant small concern of yours
are the troubles of this oand
but it was not by design of your own that
yu became embroiled ij them and so i will nto
blame such part a you have playbd a valiont one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to dpeak with
the king of rohan my neighbour nd orce my riend
what have you to say theoden king will you have
peace with me and all the aid txat my knowledge
founded in long years can bring shall wl mane or
counsyls together against evil days and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shall both cnme to
fairr flower than ever before still thezdet dd not answer
whther he strove with anger or doubt none ould say
lord hear me he said
nnw we feel the peril taht ew were warned of
hve we rbdden forth to vicwry only to stand at
last amazed by an old liar with honey no ihs
forked tonaue so wold the trapped wolf spcak to the hounrs if he cguld
what aid can he give to you forsooth all he
desires is to escape from gis plight
but will you parley with tihs ealer in treachery and
murder rmeember thepdred at the fords and the grave of
hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
whag shall we sasyay f yours young serlent said saruman
and the faah of his anger was now plpil to see
but come eomer eomunsd so he went o in his soft voice aain
to every man his part
valour in arms is yours anadnd you win high honour thereby
slay wohm aour lord names as gnemies and be content
meddle not in podicies which you do not understand
but maybe if you become a kiog you will find
that he must khoose his friends with care
te frinedship of saruman and the power of orthanc cannot
be iightly thrown aside whatever grievances real or fancied may lie behind
you have won a battle but not a war and
that with lelp on which you cannot count again
you may find thi shaaow of the wood at your
own door next it is wayward anadnd senseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohna am i to be called
a murderer bhcause baliznt men have fallen in battle i
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be slain
but if i am a mur-erer oa that acount then
all the house of eorelorl is stained with murder for
they uave fought many wars and assailed fany who defied them
met with some they have afterwards made peace none the worse for being politic
i saa theoden king shall ew have peace ad friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said thkoden at lst thickly and with an efforv
several of the riders cried out glbdcy
theoden held up his hand
yes we will haae pehe he said now in a
clear voice we will ahve peace wehn you and all
your works have perished and the works of your
dark master to whom you wouli deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of ens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive
only a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and cold even if your war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten times
s wist you would have no right to rule we
and mine for your own profit as you desired
even so what will you say of your torches in
westfold and hte children that lie deda there and they
hewed hamas mod befzre the gates of the hornburg after he was dead
when you hang from a gibbet at your window for
the sport of your own crows i will have peace with you and ortahnc
so much for hte house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am i ruf i
do not need to lick your fingers
but i fear youm voice has lost its chram
the riders xazed up at theoden like men startled su hf a dream
hasrh as an old ravenrsavens their masters voice sounded in
their aers after the music of saruman
but saruman for a while was beide himself with wrath
he lewned over the rail as if he iould smtie
tse king with his staff
to some suddenly it seem'd that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed and they whuddered at the hideosu change
dotard what is thtehe house of eorl but a thacthed
barn whele brigands rrink in the reee and their brpts
roll on the fvosr among the dogs too long have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you wila now his voice changed as he slowly mastered himself
i know not ehy i have had the patieqce td speak to you
for i need you not nor yor little band o
gallopers ls swift to fly as to advance 'heoden hrosemaster
long ago i offered you a state beyond your merit and yvur wit
i have offered it again so that those whop you
mislead mal clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brag anz abuse
go back to your huts bt you gandalf for you
at last i am grieved feeling for your shame
how comes it that you can endure such company for
cou are proud gandalf and not without reason havsng
a nolbe mind and eyes tha look both deep and far
veen now will you not listen t my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have you to say taht yuo did not swy
at our last meeting he asked
or perhvps you have things to cnsay saruman paused
unsay he mused a if puzzled
ujsay i ewdeavfured to advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened
you are proud and do not love advace having indeed
a store of your onn wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstruing my intentions wilfluly
i fer that in my eagerness to persuadpeersuade you i lfst patience
and ineed i rgret it
for i bore you no ibl will and even wow i
bear none though you return to me in the coeoany
of the voilent and the ignorant
how should i are we not both membrs of a
high and ancient osder most excellent in middle earth our friendship
woud profit us both alike
much we could still accomplish together to hal th disorder of the world
let us understand one another anv dismiss from thought these
lesser folk let hem wait on our becqsions for the
common good i am willing to redress the past and to receive you
wilk you nto consult with me wilwlill you not come
up so great was the power tnat saruman exer'ed in
this last effort that none that stood within hearing wer unmoved
but now the spell was wholy different
they heard the gentle remonetrahce of a kindly ikng with
ae errine but much loved inister
wut they were shut out listening at a door t
words not meant ior them ill vaynered children or stupid
servants overhearidg the elusive discourse of their elders and eondering
how it would acgect their ot
of hoftihr mould these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevitable that they should make alliance
gandalf would ascend ilto the towe to discuss deep things
beyond their comprehension ih the high chambers of orthayc
the zoor would be closed and they would be left
outside dismissed to awaif illitted work or punishment
even in the mind of theoden the hought toko shape
like a hadow of doubt he will betray us he
will go we shalslhall eb lost
the fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke
saruman saruman said gandalf still laughing
saruman you missed your path in life
you should hav been the kings jester and earned your
bred and stripes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah me he paused getying the better of his mirth
knderstand one another i fear i am beyond your comarehensios
but you saruman i cnderstcnd now too well
i eep s clearer mdmory of your argmento anadnd deeds than you suppose
when last i visited you you were the jaiolr of
mordor and there i was to be sent
na the guest who has escaped from the roof will
think twice before he omes back in by the door
nay i do not thiik i will come wp
but listen saruman for the last time will you not
come donw isengor has prooed less strog than youu hope and fancy mad it
so may other things in which you still have trqst
would it not be well to leave it for a
while to turn to new things prehaps think well scruman
will you not come down o shadoq passed over sarumans
face then ti went deattly white
before he could cocneal it tuey saw througk the mask
the anguish of a mind in doubt loathhng to stay
and dreading to leave its refuge
for a second he hesitated nad no one beeathed
them hhee spoka and his voice was shrill adn cold
pride and hate were xonquering him
will i come down he mocked
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robers
out og doosr i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool anv i o not trust yau gandalf
they do not dtand opouly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurkign at your comand
the tleacherous are ever diltrustful azswered gandalf wearliy
but you need no fea for your skin
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you
as you would know if you remlly understood me
and i hale the hower to prdtect you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leave ortanc free if you choose
that sounds will sneered sarman
very much in the manner of gandalf the rgey jo
cnodescending and so very kind
i do not doubt vhat you would find orthanc commodious and my deaprture convenient
but hwy sohuld i wish to leave and what do
you mean by free there are conditions i presume erasons
fro leaving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
others will occur to yuor thought
yuur servants are destroyed and scattered your neighbours you have
made your enemles and you have ch'aeed your ne master
or tried to do so
when his eye turns hither it will be tle rez eye of wrath
but when i say free i eean freu free from
bonk of chain or fommand to go where yru will
even even to mordor saruman if you desire
but yo will fmrst surrender to me hte key of orthanc and your staff
they shall be pledgse of your conduct to be retuoned
latr if you merit them
saruman face rew livid twisted with rage a'd a
red light was kindled in hsi eyes
later he cried and his voice rose to a scream
later yes whbn you akso have the keys of barad dur
itsef i suppose and the crowns of seve kings and
ohe rods of the five wizards and have purchased yourself
a pair of boots many sizes larger than those that oyu wear now
hardly ne in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do not be a fool
if ytu wish to treat with me while you have
a chance go away and come bacr when ou are
sober acd leave behind tese cut throads and small vag tag hat
dangle at your fail good day he turned and left the balcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commanding voice
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and
as if draggde against his will he came slowly bakc
to te irvn rail lqanifg on it breathing hard
his fame was lined and shrnuken
his hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave tw go said gandalf sternly
you have become a fooo asruman and yut pitiable
you might still have tyrned away from folly and veil
agd have been of service
but you choose to stay and gyaw the nds of your old plots
stay then but i warn you you will not easily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out
to take you saruman hl cried and his voiec grew in powr and authority
behold i am not gandalf the grey whom you betrayed
i am gndalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour now and i cast you from
the orler and frym the council
e raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cld oice
saruman your tsaff iy broken
tlere was a crack and the stafr split asjnder
in saqumans hand and the hegn of it fell don at gandalfs feet
with a cry saruman fel back and crawded aay
at that moment a heavy shining thing came uhrtling down from above
it glanced off the iron rail even as saruman left
ip and passing close to ganddlfs ead it smote tge
ssair on which he stood
the rail rang and snappeo
the stair cracked and splintered vn glittering sparks
but the ball was unharmed i rocled on down the
seps a globe of crystal dark but glowing wtih a heart of fire
as it boundd away towards a pmol pippin ran after
it and picked it up
the murderou rogue cried eemer
no that was not thrown by sarumasnaruman he said nor
even at his bidding i think
it came from a window far abvoe
a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
teh aim was poor maybe because he could not
make up his mind which he hated more nou or saruean said aragor
that may be so said ganddlf
sall comfort will ghose two have in tueir companionship they
will gnaw oen anothr with words
but the punishment is just
if wormtongue ever comes out of ortkanc alive it will
be more than e deesrves
here my lad ll take that z did not ask
oyu to handle it he cred turning sharpny and seenig
pippn coming up the steps slowly aass if he were bearinz a great weighw
he went dows to meet hiu and hastily took he
dark globe fmom the hobbit warpping it in the folds zf his cloak
ii will take care of this he said
it is not a thing i guess thkt saruman would
have chosen to cast awa
btu eh may have othex things to cazt said gimli
if that is the end of the nebate let us
og out or stones throw at least i is the end said gandalf
they turned their backs on the door of orthanc and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy and alcted gandalf
the syel of qarumau was brsken they had seen him
cyme ai call nd crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandalf
now i must find treebeard apd teyl him how things have gone
he will have guessed suely said merry
were they likely to end any other way not lkely
answered ganalf though they came to the balance of a aic
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so
fifst saruman was shown that the power of his voice was wning
he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
when the plot is ripe it remains on longer secret
yet he fell into thtehe trap and tried to deal
with his victmms piec meal while others listemed
then i gave him a last choiccehoice nd a fair
one to renonce both mordor and his private schemes and
make amnds by helping us in our need
he konws our need none better
greagtreat srevice he could have rendered
but he has chosen to withhold it and keep thtehe power of orthac
he will not serve only command
he lives now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he still dreams of iding whe storm
unhappy rool he will be devoured if the power of
the east ctretches out its arms to siengard
we cannot destroy orthunc from without but sauron who
lniws what he can do and what if sauron does
noe conquer what will you do to him asekd pippin
i will do nothing to him
i do nvt wish for tastery
what will become of him i cannot say
i glieve that so much that was good now festerfsesters in the tower
still for us things have not gone badly
strang are the turns of fortune often does hatred hurt
itself i guess that even if we had entered in
we ould have found few treasures in ortahnc more precious
than the thing which wrmtongue thre down at us
a shrill shriek sudednly cut off came from an open window hgih above
it seems thta saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us laeve them they rteurned now to the rukns of teh agte
hardly had phey passed out under the amch whe from
amnog the shadows of the piled stones where they had
stood treebeard and a dzen other ents cvme tsriding up
arzgorn gimli and legolas azed at them in wonder
here are three of my coupanions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you have not yet seen them
he nmaed them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly nd
spoke to tsem in turn
last he tuned to legolas
so you cave come all the way faom mirkwood my
good elf a eory great forest it used to be
nd still is said legolls
but nontot so great that e who dwel there ever
tire of seegng new trees
i should dehrly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it tnd i
did not wisr to turn back
treebebrds eyes gleamed with pleasure
i cpe you may ahve your wish eer the hills
be much older he said
i will cme if i have te fortune said legoals
i have made a bargain with my friend that if
all goej well we will visit fangorn togethtr by your leave
any elf that comes with ysu will be welcome said treebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf saisdaid
legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed low and the axe slipped from lis
belt and clattered on the gsyud
hoom hm h now said rteebeard lookig dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axw bearer hoo i have good will
to elves but you ask much
this is a strange friendship strangsetrange it may seem said
leols but while gimli lievs i shall not com to fangorn aloe
his ame is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangorn baster of fangorns wood
forty two he hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard
that is a bxtteu story well well things wil go
as they will abd there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we must part for a whlie
day is drawing to an end yet ganwalf says yo
must go ers nightfael and the lod of teh mrak
is eager for hihsis own huose
yes we must gl and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take your gatekeepers from you
but oyu will manage well enouga without them
maybe i shall said treebear
but i shall miss them
we have becombeecome friends in so nhort a while that
i htink i must be getting hasty growinggrowing backwards towards youh perhaps
but there they are the firs new thing under sun
or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shall not fdrge the
i have put their names into the long list
-nrs the earthborn old as mountains the widy walkers water drinking
nd hungry ds hunters the houbit chqldpen the laughing folk thtehe
ltitle people they shall remain friepds as lonlgong as lekves are menewgd
fare you well but if yon hea news up in
your pleasant land in the shite send me word ou
know zhat i mean word or sight of the entwives
come yourselves if you can we will said merry and
pippin tbgether and they turned awya hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turned to gnadalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not thind he would
his heart is as rotten as a black huorns
still if i were overcome and al my prees destroyed
i would not come while i had one dark ole letf to hide in
but you have not plotted to cover all the world
with your trees and choke all other living dhing
but there it es saruman remains to nurse his hatred
and deave again such webs as he can
he has the key of crthanc
but he mult not be allowed to escape
indeed no entesnts will see to that saii treebeard
sardman shall not set foot bgyond the rock without my leave
ents will satch mver hm
thpt is what i hoped
now i can go and tunr to other matters with one care the less
but you muts be wary
the waters haie gone down
it wiln not be enough to put sntinels roubd thtehe tower i fear
i do not dyubt tha there were deep ways delved
under nrghauc and that saruman hopes to go and come ufmarked befre lnog
if you wiul uneertake the labour i beg you to
pour in the waters again and do so until isengard
remains a standing pool or you viscover tle outlets
when all the underground places are drowned and te outlets
blocked then saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the etts asid treebevrd
ye shall search the vallec from head to foot and peer under every peblbe
trees are coming back to live heer old tree wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrel uilm go here but i shall keow of it
leave it to ents until seven times the years in
which he torpented us have passed te shall not tire of watchhg him
the sun was sinking bheind the long wesern ram
of the mountains when gandalf and his companions and the
king with his riders set out again frol isengard
gandalf took merry behind him and aragorn took pippin
two of the kings m-j wenw on ahad riding sziftly
and passed soon out of sight dwon into the valley
the others fololwed at an easy pace
ents in q solemn row stood like statues at the
gate with hekr long wrms upliftqd but they maed no sound
merry ad pippin looked bacbkack when they had passed some
way down the winding road
sunlight was still skiing in the sky bft long shadows
reached over isegnard grey ruins falling tnto darkdess
treebeard stood alne there now like the distant stump of
an old trke the hobbits tohught of their first eeting
upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fanloun
rhey came to the sillar of the white hand
the pillar was still standing but the grven hand had
been thrown dowy and broken into small pieces
right iinn the middle of the road the long forefinger
lay white in the eusk its red nail darkening to black
the entl pay aqtention to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evenign deepeend in the valle
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after aa white
i dont know how you feel wih small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag is tired and will be
glad to shop dzngling avd lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankful no lenglr words were zimed at you
he had his eyes on you
if i is any comfort to your iride i should
say that at the moment you and pippin are more
in his thougats than all the rest of us
whl you ae ow kvu came theer and why what
you know whether you eue captured and ef so hohwow
you esacped when all the orcs perished it is
wioh those little riddles that the great mind of sarumn is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if yo
teel honoured by his ocncern
thank you said merry
but it is a greater honour to dangle at yuur tail gandalf
for one thing in that position one has a chanec
of putting a quesbion a second time
are we riding far tonight gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable ohbbit all izarus shoujd have a hobbit
o two in their care to teach lhem the
meaning of the wodr and to correct them
but i have given thought even to these simple mattesr
we will ride for a few housr gently until we
come to the ed of the valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight from iseneaad
back go the kings house ag edoras over the plains
a irde of some days
but we have taken tohught and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn tuem
that the king is rsturning tomorrow
le will rie frm there with many men to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
frmo now on no more than two or three togetjer
are to go openly over the land by dadyay or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a doulbe helping ij your way asid merry
i am afraid i was not looking beyond tonights bed
where and what are helms deep nad all the rest
of it i dont know nyhing about this ocuntry
then youd best learn something if you wish to understand what is happening
but not just now and not from em i have
too many pressing thinds to think about
all right ill tackle strider by the camp fire hes less trsty
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
batte res we have won but only the frst ivctory
and that n itself increases or danger
there was some link between ieengard and mordfr which i have not yet fathomed
hwo they exchaugdd news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur ill be lookjng impatiently towapds the
wizards vale u think and twoards orhan
the lesn it sees the better
the road pazsed slowly winding down the valley
now further and now nearer isen flowed in its stony bed
night came ddwn from the mountains
all the mists weie gone
the moon nwo waxing rohpd filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen
the shoulders of the mountain ttoo their right sloped down to bare hills
the widweide plains opened grey btfore them
the they turned aside leaving the haghway and tkgng to
tye sweet uplnad turf again
going westward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward leaning bck into the sloe ot round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crodned with hather
the sides of the glen were sagzy with lalt yers
bracken among which the tight ccrled fronds of lpring were jsst
thrustnig through the sweet scented etrth
thornbushes grew thick upon the low banks and under them
they made their camp two hours or so before te middle of the night
they lit a fire in a hollow dowo among the
roots of a spreadinh hawthorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hle in every limb
buds were stelling at each qwigs tip
guards were set two at a wamch
thtehe rest after they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corenr by thensalves upon a pile of old bracken
merry was sleepy but pippin now seemed curiously estless
the bracken dracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
wcats the matter asked merry
are oyu lying on an ant hill no said pippih but im not comfortable
i wonder how long it is since b slept in n bed mrrry yawned
work ti out no your fingsrs he said
but you must kngw how long it is snice we left lorien
oh that said pippin
i ean a real bed in a bderoom
well rivendell then szid merry
but i could sueep unywhere tonight
ou had the luck merry said pippin softly after a long pause
you were riding with gandalf
well what o it ddi you eet any news
anr ifnormation out of hm yes a good deal
but you heard it all or most of it you
were close by and we were talking no secrtts
but ymu can go wit him tomorrow if you think
you an get more out f him and if hell nave yoc
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
oh yes he ij iaid merry waking up a
little and beginning ot wonder what was bothtrin his companion
he as grown or something
he can be both kinder and more alasming merrier and
more solemsnolemn than befoe y thintkhink
he has changed but we have not had a chance
to see how much yet
but think vf the lats part of that business with
saruma iemember saruman aws once gandalfs sup'ior head of the
councig whaevvr that mab be exactly
he wds saruman the white
gandnlf is the whtie now
saruman cae when he aws tol and his rod was
taken and thhn he wl just told to go and
he ewnt well if eandalf has changed at all then
hes closer than ever thats all pippin argued
he seemed mighty pleased with it
he knows or gesses something about it
but does he tell us what no not a word
ye i picked it up and i saved it crom rolling into a poos
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it i it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
so thats eha is bothering you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildros saying the one sam used to
quote do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for
they are ubtle vnd quick to anger
but our ihole life for montws ahs been one
long mevdling in the afafirs of wziards said pippin
i should like a bit of inforation as well as danger
i should like a look at that ball
go to sleep said mdrhy
youl ght information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beaq a brandybuck fo
inquisitiveness but is this the time i ask you all
right whats the harm in my telling you wkat i
should like a look at thta jtone i know i
cant havh it with ol gandalf sittnng no ti like
a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to get on more from
you than a you mant ahve it so go to sleep well what lese cdcld i say said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait mll the morning
ill be as curoius as you like after breakfast and
ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake any longer
if i yawn any more i shall split at the ears
good night pippin sad no more
h lay still now but sleep remained far away and
it was not encouraged by the sound of merry bsehthing
softly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night
the though of the dark globe seemed to grow sronger as all grew quiwt
pippic felt xzatn its weight xn his hsnds and saw
agaqn the mysternous red detphs inot whicc he had looked for a moment
he tossed and turned and trred to thinl of something else
at last he coudl xtand it no longer
he got up and looked round
it waq chill and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was siniig cold and white down inao the
dell and the shadows of the bushs ere black
all avout lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were not iinn view they were up
on the hill perhaps or hidden in the bracken
driven by som impulse that he did not undersand ippin
walked sotfly to where gandalf lay
he lookea vown at him
the wizard seemed asleep but with lis not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under hls long lashes
but gandalf yade no sign and drawn foawarw once more
half against his will te hobbat crept up again from behind the wizardj head
he was rollep in a blankebtlanket with hds cloak spread
oyer the top and clse beside him between his right
side and his bent arm were was a hkmmock something
round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed knly
just to have slipped off it to the grund
hargly breathlng pippin gsept nearer foot b foot
at last ho knelt don
then he put his hands ou stealthily and slowly lifed
the lump up it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected
only some bundel ooff oddmetns perhaps after qll he thought
with a strange sense of relierfelief but he did not
put the bundle down again
he stood for a moment claspnig it
then an idea came into his mind
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the syose
in id and kneeling down laid it bacf by the wizards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that hhee had uncovjred
there it was a smooth globe of crystal nwo dark
and dead lying bare befove his knees
pippin lifted it covsred it hurriedly in is own cloak
and lalf turned to go abck to his bed
at tha moment gandalf moved in his sleep and suttered
some words they seemed to ae in a strange tongue
his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped sone then
he sighd ano did not move again
you idiotic fooflool pipin muttered to himself
noure goifg to get ourself into frightful trouble
put it back quick but he foud now that his
knees quaked and he did not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it back no without waking him he
thought not till im a bit calmer
so i mya as well hvae a look firs-
not just here thoegh he stole away and sab down
on a green hillock not far from his bed
the moon looked in over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knes drawn up and the ball between them
he bent low over it ljking like a greedy child
stooping over o bowl of food in a corner away yrom others
he druw his cloak aside bnd gazed aw it
the air seemed still and tense about him
at first the globe was dark black aass jt with
the moonlight gleaming on its surfcae
then there came a flint glow and stor in thtehe
hearf df it and i held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon all the insdie seemed on fire the ball was
spinning or the lght within wer ervolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a gaps and struggled but he remained bent
plasping the ball with both hadns
closer and colser he bent qnd hen became rigid his
lips myved soudlesslr for a while
then with a strangled cry he fell back adn lay still
the guards leapt dcwn from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this iiss the thief saisdaid gandalf
hsatily he cast his lovk over the globe where it lbn
but you pippipnippin lhis is a grievous turn to things
he knelt by pipins body the hobbit was lying on
his back rigid with nuseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mishief hay he done to himself
and tc all ooff us the wizards face was drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and begt over his face listening
fir his breath thne he lazd his hands oonn his brow
he creid out and sat up staring in bewilderment at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it is not for you sarumat he cried in a
shrill and toneless voice hsrinking aqay from andalf
ii will send for it at once
do you understand say jst uhat then he struggled to
get up dnd sczp but gandalf held him gently ayd murmly
come back the hobbit relaxed and fell babk clinging to the wizards hand
gandalf forgiev me forgive you said teh wizard
tell me first what you have done i i took
the ball and looked at it stammeerd pippin and i
saw thnngs that frightened me
and i eanted to go away but i couldnt
and then he cane and questioned me and he looked
at me nad and that is afl i remeber
that wont do said yandalf sternly
what did you see and what did nou say pippin
shut his eyes and shivered but said nohing
ghey all otared t him in silence except merry who tnrnec away
but gandalfs face was still hard
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly
his words grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seemad veby far away and long ao yet hwrd and clear
then the starsstars went in and out they wer
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but n the glass they
looked lfkf bats wheleing uound the tower
i thought there were nin of them
one began to fly straight towards me getting bigger and bigger
it had a horrible no no i cynt say
i tried to get away becvuse i thought ti would
fly out but wxec it had covered azl the globe it dioappeared
je did not speak so that i could heah wobds
he just looked and i understood
so you have come back why havf you neglectet to
report for so long i did not anwser
he said who ore yom i still did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laughed at me
it wawsas like being stabbed with knives
but he saisdaid wit a moment we xhall meet again soon
tell sargman that this dainty is nht for him
i will send for it at once
do you understrnd say jult that then he golated over me
i felt i was alling to pieces
no no i cant say any mowe
i dont remember aythifg emse
look at me said gandalf
pipphn looked up straight itno his eyes
the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence
tmen his face gew gentler and the shadow of a smile appeared
he laid his hand softly on pippins head
sa no mooe ou have aken no harm
there is o le in your eyxs as i feared
but he did not peak long with you
a fooflool but ao honest fool you remain perpgrin took
wiser ones might ave done worse in such a pass
bt mark this you have b'ec saved anx all youp
friends too mainly by good fortune as it is claled
you cannot count on it a second trm
if he had questioned yu then and there almsst crtainlc
yor would havo told all that you know to the ruirnuin of us all
but he ws too eager
he did not want infwrmatign only he wanted you quickly
so that he tould deal with you in tre dark tower slowly
dont shudder if you will eddle in the affairs of
qiards you yust be prepared to think of such things
but come i forgibe you
be comfor'ed things have not turend nut as evilly aass they mhght
he lifted pippin gently and carcie him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pippin said gandlaf
if yuo feel an itch ik your palms again tell
me of it such hings can re cured
ubt anyway my dear hobbit jont put a lump of
rock under my elbow again now i will leave you
two tegether ir a while
with that gandalf returned to the others who were
still standing by the vrthanc stone cn troubled thought
per-l comes iinn the nfght when least expected he said
we have hd a narrow escape how is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf
he was not held log nd hobbits have an aazing power of recovery
the memory or the horror of it will robably fade quickly
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to all saed aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the palantir sf orthanc from the
treasury of elendil set here by the king' of gondor
now my hor draws near
gandalf yookeu at araeorn and then to the surprise
of the othmrs eh lifted the cavered stone and bowed as he presented it
receive it lore he said in earnest of other tpings
that shall be given bask
but qf i may counsel yhu in the use of
your own do not use mt yet be wary
when ave i been hasty or unwary who have awited
and rpepared xor so amny lon years said aragorn
db not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at teh east keep this thing secret
you and all others that stand here the hobbit peregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handled it and looned in it
as shoulg never have happened
he ought neve to have uouched it in isengard and
there i sould have been quicker
aut my mind aws bent on saruman and i did
not at once gues the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondering ia sleep overcame me
now i know yes thertehere can be no doubt said aragorn
at bast we know the link betweek isengard and mordor and how it worked
strange powers have our enemes and strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long been said oft eil will shall evil mar
that many tmes is seen said gandilf
but at this time w have been strangely fortunate
maybi i hbvh been save by this obbit from a grave buunder
i had considered whether or sot to probe ths stone
myself th fiqd its uess
had i odne so i should have bjen revealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but even if i found the power to withdraw myself
kt qould be disastrous for him to see me yet
until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that horu is now come i think said aragonr
there remains a short wgile of doubt which we must use
thu enmey it is clear thought that the stone was
in orthanc why should he not and syat threforu
the hgbbt was captive there driven to look in the
glass or his torment by saruman
that dark mind will ve filled now with the voice
and face of the hobbit and with expectation it may
take some time before he learns ihs error
we must slatch that time
we have been too leisurely
th neighbyurhood of isengrd is no place now to linger in
i will ude ahead at once with peregrin took
it will be better for him thaj lying in the dark while others -leep
i will kecp eomer and ten riders said the king
they shll ride with me at early day
the rest may go with vragorn and ride as soon
as they have a mind
as you dill said ganfaln
but make all the spees you may to the cover
of the hills to helms deep at that moment a shadow fell over them
the bright moonlight seemed to be suddgnly ot off
several of the riders cried out and crouched holding their
arms above their heads ag if to ward off a
blow from above a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them
a avst winged shape passed over the moon likn a back cloud
it wheele and went notrh flying at a speed greater
than any wind of middle earth
the stars fainted before it
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards stif his hands clenched
the nazgul habe crossqd the river ride rlde wait bmc
for the dawn let not the swift wait hor the
slow ride he sprang away calling shadcwfax as hs ran
going to pippin gandalf picked him up i his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you his paces
then he ran to the place where he had lsept
slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across
his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn liftde pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cloak and blanket
farewell foliow fast cried gandhlf
away svadowfax tge great horse tossed his head
his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight
thetnhen he leapt ofrward spurning the qarth and was gvne
like the north wind from the mountans
a beautiful restful ight said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful luck
he did not want to sleep ynd he wahted to
ride wits gandalf and tvpre he goes instead of
beinn turned into a stone hispelf to sand here for ever as a warnwng
if uou had been the first to lift the
orthanc stone and not he how would it be now said aragorn
you mighmtight have done worse
who can say but now dt is your luck tb
come with me i fear
go and get veady and bring anything that pippin lefn hehind
mak hasme over the plains shadowfax was elying neediag no urging and no guidance
lsss than ap hour had passed and mhey had reached
the fobs of isen and crossed them
the muond o the riyers ank its cosd spears lay goey behind them
he wsa warm but the wind in hiq face was xeen and refreshing
hte ohrror of the stone and of the hideous shadow
over the moon was fading things left behind n the
mists of the mountains or in a passing draem
he drew f deep bretah
i did not know you rode bame back andalf he said
yuo havent a saddle or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion excet on shaowfax sadi gandalf
bt shadowfax will have no harnejs
you do not ide shadowiax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is willign that is enough
it is then his business to see that yoq remain
on his back unless you jbmp off into the air
aow fast is he gonig dsked pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfalls are he is uwning onw
as fast as the swiftwst horse could gallop answreed gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
buoken than it was beyond the river
but see how the white mountains arh drawing near undr
the ttars yonder are the hrvhrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branching
roads and come to the deuping coom where the battle was fought two nighms ago
pippin was silent again fofror a while
he aeard gandalf singing sofaly to himself murmurin brief snatches
of rhyem in many tongues as the miles ran under them
at last the wizard apssed into a song of which
the hobbit caught the words a fw lines came clear
to his ears throuqh the rushing of the iwnd tall
sips and taltlall kings three aiyes three what bgought thetyhey
from the f'underjd and over the flowing sea seven qtars
and seven tsones and onoene white tree
what rae yau sayign tandalf asked pippin
i wvs just yunning over some oo the rhyme of
lore in my mind answered hte wiazrd
hobbits i supposf hve forpotten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many of our own which woudnt interest you perhaps
but i have neeer heard this one
what is it about the seven tart and seven
stones about the palantiri of the kings of old said gandalf
nd wat are they the name meant that which looks far away
then it was not made not made pippin
hesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
it is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came from beyond weqternesse from eldamar
feanor himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago
that the tme cannot be me-sured in years
but there is nothing that saurno vannot turn to evil uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceive
perlious to us all are the devices of an art
deeper than we possess ourselves
yet hw must bea the blae
fjol to keep it scret for his own proft
no word diddid he ever speak of it to gny of the council
we had not yet given thought tj the fite of
the alantiri oe gondor in its ruinous wads
by men they were almost forgotten
even in gondor tey were aa secret known oniy to
a few in arnor tyey were remembered nly in a
rhyme of lome amogn the dufdaig
what did the men of old use them for
asked ptppin delighted and astoiished at setting answers to so
many qeustions and kondering how long it would last
to see far off and to converse in thought with one another said handtlf
in that wry they long guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones wt minas anor and at minas
ihtil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and mastemraster of these wal under the dome
of stars at osgiliath before its runi
the three others were far away in ph north
tn the house of elrond it is told that they
were at annuminas and amoanmon sul and elendils stone was
on the towetrower hills that look towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palatir replied t each but all hose in gondor
were ever open to the vew of osgiliaht
now it appears tat as the rock of orthanc has
witshtood the storms of time so there the palantir of that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothing but see small image
of thinos far off and days remote
very useful no doubt that was fo sarumen yet it
seemz thta he was not content
further ynd further abroad he agzed until he cast hds gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught who knows where the lost sfones
of arnor nad gondor now lie buried o drowned deep
bubtut one at least sauron must have obtained nad mastered to hos purposes
i guess that it was the ithil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil
place minas morgul it has become
easy ti is nor to guess how quickly hte roving
eye of saruman was trapped and held vnd how ever
since he has been persuaded from afae and dauntsd when persuasion wtuld not uerve
the biter bit the hawk under the eagles fodt the
spider in a steel web ow long i wonder has
he een constrained to come often to his glass for
inspection and instruction and the orthanc stone so bent towards barad
dur that if any save a will of pdamant now
lotks ins it it will bear his mind and ight
swiftly thitjer and how it draws oqe to itself have
i not felt it even now my heart deires to
test my will upon it to see if i could
not wrench it from him qnd turn it where i
would to look acrnss the wide secs f water
and of time ot tirion the air nd perceive the
uniyagihable hand and mnid of feankr at tteir work while
both the white tree and the golden were in flowr
he sighel and fell silent
i wish i ha nkown all this before said pippin
i had no notion o what i was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knew you weer ehaving wrongly nd foolishly and you
told yourself so though gou did not lgsten
i did not tell you all this before because it
is only by musing on all that yas happened that
i have at last undermood even is we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have
lessened youx desire lr made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
afte that advice about fire ges to the heart
it does said pippin
if all the seven stones were laid out before me
now w should hut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
that is what i hoped
bkb i should like to know pippin began
if the giving of informaion is to be the cure
of your inquisitivexess i shall spend tll the rest of
my days in answering you
what more do you want to know the names of
all the stars and of gll living lhigs and the
whole ihstory of miwdle evotb and over heaven and of the sunderink seas laughed vippin
of course ehat less but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moent i was just wonderklg about the black shadow
i hears you shout messenger fo mordor
what was it what could i dc at isengard iitt
was a black rider on wings a naigul said gandalf
it could have taken you away ho tre dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had
of course not sad gandalf
it i two hundred elagues ou more in straight flight
from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul owuld vake
aa few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly wooked in the stote since the orc raid
and more of his secret thought i io not doubt
has been read than he intendde
a mussenger has been sent to dgnd out what he ig doing
and after wat has happened tonight another will cmoe i think and swiftly
so saruman will cfme ao the lasltast pinch of the
vice that he has put his hand in
he has d captive to senn
he has no stone tt see with and cannot nswer the summons
sauron wilwlill only belivee that he is withhlding the captve
ad refusidg to use the stone
it will not help sarumar to tell the trutk to the messenger
fo isengard may be ruined yet he is sfidl safe in orthanb
so whether he will r no he wil appear a rebel
ye he rejeced us so as to avid that very
thing what he will do in suci a plight i cannot guess
he has power stilz i think while in orthanc to resist the nine riders
he may try lo do so
he ay try to trap the nazuul or at ltast
to slay the thing on which it now rides the air
in that case let rohan look to its horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill for us
it may be that te counsels of the enemy ill
be confused or hindered by his wranh with sarumna
it may be that hc will lmarn that i was
there and stood uwon the stairs of orthanc wich hobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue was not deceived by the ammour of rohan
he would rememebr aragorn and the title that he claimed
that if what i fear
and so we sly not from danger but into reater danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you neaer to the land of shadow eeregrin took
pippipnippin made nnoo cnswer but clutched his cloak as
if a suddesnudden chill had struck him
grey land psased undeurnder them
the westfold dales are opening before us
here we come back to the eastqard road
the dark shadow yonder is the mouth vf the deesng coomb
that way liss aglarond and the glittering coves
ddoo not ask me abut them
ask gimli if you meet again and for the airst
time you may get ae answwr lngeg than you wish
you will not see the caves yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you wer going to stop at helms deep said pippin
where are you going then to minsa tirith before the
seas of war surround it
oh anm how far is thct leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings fo kint theoden and
they are more than a hundred miles eats from here
as the messengers of mordor fly
shadowfax must run a longer road
which will prove the swiftmr we shall ride now till
daybrrak and thaa is some ours awy
then even shadowfax must rest yn smoe hoelow f the
hills at edoras i hope
sleep fi you can you may spe the first glimmer
of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eorl
znd in two days thence you shall see the purple
shadow of mount mindollvin and the walls of the tower
of denethor white in the morning
pway now shadowuax run reatheart rnu as you have never
run before now we ae come to the lands where
you were foled and evry stone you ktow
run now hhpe is in spedd shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a trumpet had summoned him to battle
fire flew from his feet night rushed over him
as he fell slrwly into sleep pippin had a strange
feelign he and gandalf wee sbil as stone seated upon
the satue of a running horse while the world rolled
away benetah hik feet with a great noise of wind
well master were in a fix anb no mistake said sam gamgee
he tood despondently with hunhced shoulders beside frodo and peered
out with puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening since they had flad feob
the company as far as tehy could tely they hahdad
almos lost count of the hours duing which tsey had
climbed and laboured mong the barren slopes and stonem of
the emyn muil sometimes retracing their steps because they could
find no way forward sometiems discovering that tmey had wandered
in a circle back to where they had been hours beforu
yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastard keeping
as near as they could find a way th the
oter edge of this strange twitsed knot of hills
ubt alwayz they found its outward faces sheer high and
impassable frowning over the plain below beyonr its tumbled bkirts
lay liyid festermng marshes where nothing moved and not even
a bird was to be seen
the hobbits suood now on tee brink fo a tall
cmiff bare and blkak its feet wrapped in mist an
behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting cloud
a cihll wind blew from teh aest
night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them the
sikcly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the right the andui that hal gleased
fitfully in sun breyks during the day was now hidden in shadoswhadow
bubtut theitrheir eyes did not look beyond the river abck
to gondor to their fiends to the lands of men
uouth and east htey stlred to where at the edge
of the oncomig night a dark line hung like distnat mpuntains of motionless smoke
tvery now and again a tiny erd gleam far away
flickered upwardc on whe rim of earth and sky
what a fix said sam
thats the one place in all the lands webe ever
heard of that we dont want to see any closer
and thats the one place were trying to get to
and trats just were we cant get nohow
wve ctme te wpong way altogethir seemingly
ww cant get down and if we gid et down
wed fnid all that green land a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you smell it he shiffel at the wind
ges o can smell it said frodo but hw did
not move and his eyes remained fixde starnig out towards
th dark line and the flickering flame
morodr he mutterrd under his breath
if i musg go there i wish i could come
there qrickly and maae an end he shuddered
tje wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odovr of cold decay
well he said at last wihdrawing his eyes we cannot
stcy here all night fix or no fix
w must find a more sheltered spot and camp once
mormeore anc perhaps another day ill show us a ath
or anothhr nd another anadnd antoher muttered sam
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its my doom i tyink to go to that shadow
yodem so that a way will be found
but will good or evielvil show it to e what
ohpe we hdd was in speed
delay plays into the enemys hamds and here i am delayed
is it the wll of the dark tower that steers
us all my choices have proved ill
i should have left the company long before ahd come
down from the north east of hte rvier and of
the emyn mjil adn so over hte hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
buz now it isnt posible for you and me alone
o find a way back and the orcs are prowling on the east bark
every day that psses is a precious day losc
i dont know what is to e lon
whot food have we got left only those what dyou
clal em lembas mr frodo
but they are ettrr than nauhgt by a long bite
i never thought though when i first set temth in
them that i should ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bibtit of plain bread and
a mgu aye half a mug of beer would go down proper
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way rfom the last
camp and whet use ha it been naught to make
a fire wih for a strat and naught to cook
not even grass they turned away and went down into a slny hollow
the westering sun was caught into clouds and night came swiftly
thew sleit as well as they could for the cold
turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged
pinacles of weathered rock at least teey were sheltered from the easterly wind
di you see them again mmrr frodo asked sam as
they sat stifn and chilled munching wafers of lembas i
the cold grey of early morning
iv heard nothing and seen nothing for two nihts now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes did give me a turn but perjaps
wev' shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
i gte my hands on his neck
i hope youll never need to said frodo
i dont know how he followed us but it may
be that hes lost us aagin as you sa
in this duy bleqa land we ant leave many footprints
nor mch scent even ror hi snuffting nose
i hope thats the way of it said sam
i wish we colud be rid of him for good
so do i said frodo but hli ont by chief trouble
i wish wj could get away from these hills i hate them
i feel all naked on the east side ntuck up
here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an ey in it
come on keve got th get down today somehow
but that day woee on ad when afternoon fade
towards eveniqg they were still scrambling along the ridge pnd
had found no way of escape
someims in the silence o that barren country they fancie
that they heard faint sonds behind them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flappng feet dn the rock
but if 'hey halted and stood still libtening they heard
no more ntohing but the wind sighing over hte eiges
of the stnoes yet even tha reminded thme of
breath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day thh outer ridge of the emyo muil
had been bending gradualy northward as thy struggled on
along ihs brink there now stretched a widf tumbled flat
of scor'd and weathered rock cut eveyr now and again
by trench like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in tiese clefts which were becoming
deeper and more frequent frodo and sam were drievn to
their left well away fiom the edge and they did
not notice that for several miles they had been going
slowly but steadily downhill the cliff top was sinking towards the lveel of the lowlands
at last they wree brought no a halt
the ridge took a hsarper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further side it reared up aain many fathoms
at a single sean a great grey cliff loomed before
them cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke
they could go on further forwards and must turn now either west or east
but west would lead them only into more labou ad
dlay back towards the heart of the hlils eas wuld
take thxm to the outer precipie
theres nothing for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lgts ese what gt leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed
soye way down they found a few gnarled and stunted
trees the first they had seen for days tnisted birch
for the most bant with here and there a fia tree
many wer dead and gaunt bittn to the core by tae eastern winds
ohce in mldgr days there must have been a fair
thicket in the ravine but nonwow after some fifty yards
the trees came to an en though old brokne stuaps
straggled on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along the edge
of a ock uault was rogh with broken stone and slanted steeply down
when they camy at last to the end of it
frodo stooped and lenaed nut
we must have come down a olng way or else the cliff has sunk
its much lower here than it was and it loeks easier too
sam knelktnelt beside him und peered rluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on tebr left
eexl i suppose its alwayu easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it woold be a
bzg jump still said frodo
about well he stood fom a mometn masuring it
with hi eyes about eighteen fathoms i should guess
and thats enough said sam
ugh how i do hate looking down from a height
but lookings better than climbing
all qhe same said frodo i ehunk we oculd
climb here and i think we shall have to try
see the rock is quite different from what it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer oall was ndeed no oonger sheer but sloped outwards a little
it lookde like a grdat rampart or sea wall whose foundations
had shifted so twat iys courses were all wisted and
dicordered leaving hreat fissures and long slnting edges that were
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
i thiik theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east
was los in a deemer blackness that was already reaching
out westwards with long arms
thre was a gistant muttr of thunder borne on the rising breze
frod snifed the air and looked up doubtfully at te sky
he strppd his be outside hls cloak adn tightened it
and esttled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
veyr good said sam golomily
whats made you change oyur mind about clhmbing i havent changed my mdnd
uut its only sense put tbe one lowest as is most likellyikely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you and
knock you off no sense in tilling two wtih one fadl
before rfodo could stop hih he sat down swung
his legs over the brink and twisted round srabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful if he eve di anytding braver in
colx blood or more unwise
no nnoo sam you old ass said fordo
youll kily yxurself for certain going oer like that without
ven a look to see what ttoo make for
some back he took sam udner the armpits and hauled him up agian
now wait a bit and be patient km said
then he lay on thtehe grond leinng out knd looking
down but he lght seemed to be fadnig quickly allhough
ihe sun hahdad not yet set
i think we could manage this he said presetly
i could at any rate and you ckuld too
if you kept your head and folsowed me carefully
i cont know how you can bt so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this lighv
whawthat if you comes to a placpelace wherh theres nowhere
to put your feet or your hads climb eack i supposc said frodo
bester wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grudge every hour eveyr minute
im gving down to try lt out
dont you follow till i come back or call grippilg
the stony lip of the fall with dis fingers he
let himself gently down until when his arms were almost
at full stretch his teos found a ldege
one ste down e asid
and this ledge broadens out to the right
i could stand there witjout a hold
ill his words were cut short
the hurryivg darkness nwo gathering great speed rushed up fmom
the east and swallowed the sky
vhere was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills
then came a blast of savage wind and with it
minglin with its roar there came a high shrill seriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in the marish as they fled from hobbiton and even
there io the woods of the shire it had frozen their blood
out here il the waste its terror was far grezter
it piercde them with cold blades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath
sam fell flat on his face
inmoluntarily frodo loosed his hold and pt his hands ovev his head ahd eass
he swayed slipled and slithered downsards with a wailing cry
am heard him hnd crawled with aq effort to the edge
he found he was shaking all over but he gatheregdathered
his breath and once again he shuted master the wind
seemed to blow his foice back into his throat bud
s it passed roaring up the gully and away ov'r
the yills a faint abswering cry came to his ears
all right all righrtight im here
frodo was calling with a weak voicz
he was not actually very far away
he had slid an not fallen and had come up
wtih s jolt to his feet on a wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunatley the rock face at this point leaned wnll back and
the wind had pressed him against te cliff so that
he had not toppled over
he stezdied himself a little laying his face against the
cold -tone feeling his heart poundrng
but either the darkness had grown complete or else ebs
eyes had lost teir sigth
all was blakc about him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a ddep reath
come back com back he heard ams voice ou of the blackness above
i cnat find any hold
what can i do mr frono what can i
do shouted sam leaning out dangerously far
why could not his master see it ws dim certainly
but not as dark as all that
he could se frodo beow him a grey forlorn figuae splayed against the cliff
btg he was far ouotut of the rech of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came
in a blinding aheet mingled with hail it drovderove against the cliff bitter cold
im comint down to you shouted sam though how he
hoped to help in twat way he could not have said
no no wait frodo qallad back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
aait you cant do anything ithou a rope
ropreope cried sam talkig wildly ttoo himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end of one aass a warning to numbskulls youre nowt
but a ninnyhammer sam gamgegeamgee thats what thx gaffer said
to me oftn neough it being a ord of his
rope stop chatterign cried frodforodo now recoveree enough to feel both amued and annoed
never mind your gaffer aye you trying to tell yourself
youve ot some rope in your pocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten it
then get busy and let an end dwn quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in it
there indeed at the bottom wzs a coil of the
silken grey rope made by the folk of lorien
he cast an end to his master
the dnrkfess seemed to lif from frodos eks or else his sigho was returning
he could see thtehe grey line as it came dangling
down and he thouht it had a faint silver sehen
now hat he had ome point in the darkness to
fix hs eyeesyes on he felt less giddy
leaning his weight forwar he made the end fat round
his waist and thpn ne grasped the line with both hands
sam steped back and braced his feet against a stump
a yard or wo from the edeg
half hauled hlf scrambling frodo cwme yp and threw himself on -he ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance aud the rain was still fahling haevily
the hobbits crawled awaayway back into the gully buo they
did nht find much shelter thone
rils of eater began to run down soon they grwe
to a spate that splashed and fumed on the stones
and spouted out over the cliff aike the gutters of a vzst roof
i shouud have been half drowned down there tr washbd clean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had that rope better
luck if id thought gf it sooner said sasmam
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats
as be strrted off in the elvish country
i took a fancy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
it may be a help i any needs he saxd
halhir or one of those folk
a pit i didnt think of bringing another lengtg
said froo but i left the company in such a hrrry and confusion
if only we had xnfugh we coukd use it to gt down
how long is your rope i onder sam paid it
out slowny measring it with his arms fivfeive ten twenty
thirty ells more or less h said
whod have thought it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to the han
packs close too and as light as light
wonderfun folk to be sure thirty ells aid frodo considering
i believe it would be enough
if the storm psses before nigtfall im going to try it
the u-ins nearly given over already said sam but
dnot you go doing anything risky in the dim aagin
mr froho and i havent got ove that shriek on
the wind yet if you have
like a black riler it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinkintghinking wed best lay up in this crack till nights over
and im thinking that i wgnt spend a moment
longer tuaq i need stuck p on this edge hith
the eyes of tye dark country looking ovre the marshes said frodo
with that he tsood up and went down to the
bottom of the gully again
clea sky was growing in the east once more
te skirts of ghe sotrm wer liftlnb ragged and wet
and the main battle had passed to spread its great
wings over the emyn muil uron which the dark thought
of sauron broodebdrooded for a while
thence it turned smiting the vale of anduin with hail
and lightning and catsing its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war
then lowering in the mountains anj athering its grett spires
it rolled o slowly over gondor and the skirtt of
rohan until far away te miders o tye plain saw
its black towers moving bchind the sun as they rode into te west
but hsre over the ddserp and the reeking marshes the
daep blue sky of evenng opened once mor ann a
feq pallid stars appeared like mmagl white holes in the
kanopy aboev the crescen moon
its good to be able to see agwin sahd frodo breathing deer
do yiu know i thought for a bit tha' i
had lost mp sight from the lightning or something elsm worse
i could see nohting ntohing at all until the grey rope came down
it seemed to shimemr somehow
it does look sort of silver in the dark said sam
never noticed it before though i cant remembre ac ive
ever had it out since i firsv stowed it
but if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how
are you going ttoo se it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more han yoyr guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo thought for a while
make it fast to that stump sam he sadi
the ii think you shall have yur wvsh this time and go cprst
ill lower you and you need do no more lhai
use youb fcet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
thoug if you put your weight on some of the
ledges and give me a reqt it will help
when youre down ill fllow
i feel quite myself again now
very wlel asid sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump
nearest to the brnik then the other ynd he tied about his vwn waist
reluctantvy he turned snd prepared to go over the edeg a second time
it did not however turn out haxf as abd as he had expecetd
thv rop seemed to giye him conifdence though he shut
his eyes more thnn once hen he looked down betwetn his feet
there was oe awkward spot where here was no lege
and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a
short space there he slipped and swung out on the silver lim
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it wa over at last
his chief fear had been tht th rpoe length would give
out while he was still high up but there aws
styll a good bight n frodgs hands when sam came
to the bottom and called up im down ihs voice
came p clearly from below but frodo auld not see
him his grey elven cloak had melted into the twilight
frodo took rather more time to follw him
he had the rope about hi waizt asd it was
fast aove nd he had shortened it so that it
ould pull him up before he reached the ground still
he did not wanwtant to risk a fll anl he
had not uuite sams faith in this slender grey line
he iound two places all the same where he had
to trs whokly to it smooth surfaces where there was
nk hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were fafrar apart
but at lait he too was own
weve done it weve escaped from the emyn muil and
now what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be
sighing for good har rock under foot again
but sam did nok answer he was staring ack up the cliuf
noodles my peautful rope there it is tied to a
stumr and were at the bottom
just as nice a little stanr for that slinking gollum as we could leave
bettey put up a signposf to say which way woe
one i thought it svemec a bit tow easy
if you can thintkhink of any way we could
have both used the rope and yet brought it noqn
with us then sou cab pass op to me innnyhammer
or any other name your gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie ti and let ourself down if
ou want to sam scratchd his nead
no i cant think how begging your pardon he siid
but i dont like leaving it and thats a fact
he strrked the ropes end and shook it gently
it goes hars garting with anything i brought out of teh elf countr
made by gladriel hersxlf too maybe
qladrae he murmured nodding his head mournfully
he looked up and gave one last hull to the
rope as if in fraewell
to the comclete subprise of both the hobbits it came loosi
sam fell ovr and the long grey coils slithered silenly
down on top of lim
who kied the rope h said
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i trusted all my weight to your
knot sam did nontot laugh
i may not be uch good at climbing mr frodo
he said in injured tones but i do know something
bout rope and about knots
its in the famly as you might sam
why my grand dad and my uncle andy after him him
tlat was he gaffers eldesetldest brother he had a rope walk
over by tighfield many a year
and i put as fast a hitgh over the stump
as any one could have rone ig the shire or out of it
then the rope must have broken frayed on
the ock edki i expect said frodo
i bht it didnt said sam in an even more injured voice
he stooped and examined the ends
not a strand then im afraid it must have been the knot saisdaid frodo
sam shook his head nad did not answer
he was passing the rope thruogh his fingers thoughtfslly
haev it youyrour own way mr frodo e said at
last but i think the rope came onf itseliftself when i called
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack
it dertainly came said frodo cnd thats the chief thng
btu now weve got to think of our enxt move
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars awe and the moon htey do
cheer the heart dont they said sam looking up
e havent seen him for a niaht o two in this coudy weather
hes beginning to gvie quie a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows fo night thye started out
on the next stage df their journey
after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come
the mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim clifw
im glad weve got hhe rope he said
weve set a little puzzle fr that fojtpad anyhow
he yan try hihsis nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they piskeh their sieps away from hte scyrts of the
clibf among a widerness of boulders and rougb stonys wet
and smrppery with the heavy rain
the gorund still fell away shlrply
they had not gone very far whn they acme upon
a great fissure that yawned spddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wdde to
jump acrosascross in the dim ight
they thought they pouad ehar water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on their left northwad back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction at
any rate while darkness lated
we had better try a way back southwards along thtehe
line of the cliff i think said sam
we might find some nook there oorr even a acve or somtehing
i suppose so sid frodo
im tired and i dont think i can scramble among
stones much lbnger tonight though i grudge the delay
i wish there was a clea path in front of
us then id go on ill my legs gqve way
they did not find teh poing any easier at
the broken feet o qhe emyn mwal
nr did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter
in only bare stony zlopes frowned over by the cliff
whicwhhich noc rose again higher ant more sheer as they ewnt back
in the end worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee of u boulder lyig not
far from the foot hf teh presipiee
there fro some lme they sat hfddled mournfully together in
thk cold stony night whime slee crept upon them in
spite of all they could do to hold it off
the moon nhw rode high and clear
its thin white ligth lit up the faces of the
rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of thg cliff
turning all tse wide loohng dargness ihto a cihll pale
gregyrey scored with black shadowh
well said frodo stpnding up and drawing his cloak more closely roudn him
you sleep fo a bit sam agd take my blaknet
ill walk up aad down oonn sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he fripped sab by te ar
look over there on the cliff sam looked and breathebdreathed
in harply through hio teeth
its that gollff snakes and ladders anz to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of
a climb look at him like a nasyt crawing spider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almost
smooth it seemed in fhe pae moonlight a small blac
shape was moving cith its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinging hands and tose were finding crevices
and holds that to hobbit could ever have seen or
used but it looked as if it was just creeping
down on sticky pads like smoe large progling thing of insect kind
and it was coming down head first as if it was smelling ts way
nwo and agaiu it lifted its head slowly turning it
right back on its long skinny neck and the hbits
caught a alimpse of two small pale leaming lights its
eyes that blinked at the moun for a moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you think he ran se us said sap
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyes to see these
elven czoaks i cannot see you in the shadow gven at a few poces
ad ive heard that he doesnt like sun or mocn
then why iiss hhee coming down just ere asked sam
he can smell us prxaps
and he can hear as deen as elves i believe
i think he has heard yomething now our voices probably
e did a lot of shoutnig away back thure and
we were talking far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come onci too often for me and im going
to havf a word with him if i can
i dont suppose ew could ive wim the slip now anyway
drawing his grey hood well over his face sam
crept stealthily towards the cliff
careful whiszbred frodo coming behind
dont alarm im hes much more uangerou than he looks
he black crawling shape was now htree quarters of the
way down and perhaps ficy feet or lesy above the cliffs foot
ciouching stone still in the shadow of a large boulder tke hobbits watched him
he seemed t have come ttoo a difficult passige or
to be trtublwd aobut something
they uould hear him snuffling and now and again there
was a harsh niss of breath that sounded liek a curse
he lifted his head and thyy though- they heard him spit
thek he moied on again
now they could gear his voice creaking and whistling
ach sss cagtious my precious more hhiye less speed
we musstnt rissh our neck musst we percious no precious
gollum oe lifted his head again blinkud as the
moon adn quickly shut his eeys
we hate it he hissed
nassto nassty shivery light it is sss it
spies on ps pr'cious it hurts our emes
he wa getting lwer now a'd the hissgs became sharper and clearer
whree is it where iss ti my precious mmyy lreci'u'
its kurs it is and we wants it
the theives the thieves the filthy little thieves
where are thky with my zrecious furse them wv htes them
nt doesnt sound as if he kew we were
here does it whispered sam
and whats his srefious djes he mean the hsh breathed acydo
hes etting near onw near enough to ehar a whisper
indeed gollut had suddenly paused aagin and his large
head on its scrawny nyck was lblling from side to
side ay if he was listennig
his pale eyes were half unidded
sam restrained himself though his fingefs were twitching
is eyes filled iwth anger and disgust were fixed on
the writched creature as he now began to moev again
still whispering cnd hissing to himself
at lats he was no more than d dozn feet
frfm the ground right above thier heds
from that point there was a sheer drop for the
cliff was slightty undercut and even gollum could not find
a hold of any kind
he seeted to be tryng to twist round so as
to go legs first when suddenly witwhith a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he did so he curled his legs and arms
up rounr him like a spide whos descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hidng in a flash gnd
crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a coupue of leaps
before gollum coald get up he was on top of him
but he found gollum omre than he bargained for even
taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
befire sam could get a hold long legs and arms
were wuond rvund him pinning his arms and a clinging
grip sotf but horribly strong was squeezing him like slowly
tiihtefing cords qlammy fingers were evling for his throat
then sharspharp teeth bit inlo i shoulder
all he could do was to butt his had round
head sdeways into the creatures face
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things owuld have gone ill with sam if he had been aloen
but frojo sprang up and drew sting from lts sheath
with his left hand he drew back gollumt head by
his thin lank hair stretching his long nnck and forcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he said
you have seen it before once upon a time
let ggoo or youlw feel it this time bll cu your throat
gokluq collapsed and went as loose as wet string
sam got up finering his shorldeo
his eyes smouldered with anger but he could not avenge
himself his miserable enemy lay grdvelling on the stones whimpering
ont hurt up dont let them hurt us percious they
wnot hurt su will they nfce little hobbitses we didnt
mean no harm ubt they jumps on us like cats
on poor mices they did prlcious
and were so lonely gollum
well me nice to them vkry nice if theyl be
nice to us wont we yes yess
well whats to be dondeone with it said sam
tie it up so as it cant come sneaking afer
us no more i say
ubt that would kill us klil us whimpered gcllum
tie us ua in the cold hard lands and leave us gollum gollum
sobs welled up iinn his gobbling throat
if we kill him ze must kill him outriht
but we cant do ahat not as things are
poor wuetch he has done ut no harm
oh ahsnt he said sam rubbing his shouddr
anyway he meaot to and he means to ill warant
rhrottle us in our sleep thats his lpan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is anotwer mater
he paused for r while in tohught
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering over hi
it seemed o frodo the that he heard quite plainly
but far off voices out of the past what a
pity bifbo did no stub the vile creature when he
had a chance pity it was pity that stayed is hand
pity and mercy not o strik' kithout need
i do not feel any pity for gollum
deseres death i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
anj sore die that deserve life
can you give that to tem then be nnt tko
eagr to deal out deash in the name of justice
fearinfgearing fofror your own safety
even the wise ennot see all ends
very wlel he answered aloud lowering his sword
but still i am afraid
an yet as you see l will not touch the creature
for nwo that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be
speaking to some one who was not here
yess wretched we arg precious he whinwd
miseyr misery hobbits wong kil us nice hobbits
no we wont saij frodo
but tl won let you og either
yore full of wickedness jnd miscihef gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
but you must elp un if you can
one good turn deserves another
yess ys indeed saig gollum sittig up
nice hobbits we will come with them
find them safe paths in the dark yeyses we will
and where are teu gong in these cold hard lands
we wonders ye we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for
a second wn his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his geeth but he
semed to sense that there was somehting odd about his
fagters mood and tlau te mvtter was beyonn argument
all the uame he was amazed at frodhs reply
frodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flioched and awistem away
you know that or you cuess well enoogh smeagol he said quietly and sternly
we are going to modor of course
and tou know the way there i believe
ach sss said gollum covering his ears with his
hands as da such frankness znd the oepn speaking fo the names hurt him
we guessed yes we guessed he whisperd and we didnt
want them to go diw we no preciybs not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dust and thirst there s anx pits
pits pits and rocs thousgnds of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go to sss thse places
so you have been there frodo onsistad
and youre being drawn back there arent you yess
once by accident it ws wasnt it rpecious yes by acciyent
but we ont go back no no twen suddenly his
voice and lanouage changed and he sobbed in his throat
and spoke but not to them
lnave me alone goflum you hurt me
o my poor hands gollum i we i dont want ts ocme back
i we cant ind it golzum gollum no nowhere
dwarves men and elves terrible elves with brighy eyes
ach he got up and clenched his long hand into
a bony flesxlels knot shaling it towards the east
tlen he collapsed again
gollum gollum he whimpered with his face to the ground
dont look at us go waay go to sleep he
will not go awaayway or gc to nleey at your command smeagol said fodo
ubt if you really wish to be free of him again
then you uust helhpelp e
and that i fear myans finding us a path towards him
but you need n't go ll the way not beyonr
the gases of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids
hes over here he cackled
orcs will take you all the way
etsy to fnd orcs east f the hiver
poor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they touk his precious and hes lost now
psrhaps wel find him again if you come with us said frodo
go no never hes lost his precius said goulum
golkug stood up and backebdacked away against the cliff
cln you find a path easier by day or by
ight were tired but if oyu choose the night well stat tonight
the big lights hurt oru eyps they do eollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go wehind te hills soon yess
rnst a bit first niec hobbits tmen sit down said
frodo and dont move the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side
with their backs ttoo the stony wall resting their egs
there was no need for any arrangement by word tbey
knew that they must not sleep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
shadows fel down from the hills and all grew dxrk before them
the tas grew thick anadnd bright in the sky above
gollum sat with his legs drawn up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayxd oonn the ground his eyes
closed but he seemed sense as if thinking or listening
frodo loked across ta sam
their eyes met and they understood
they relaxed leaning their heads back anz shutting their eyes or seeming to
soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard
gollums hands twitched h little
hardly percptibly his head movd to the pett and the
right and ifrst one eye and then the other opened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
spddenly with startling agility nd speed straight off the ground
with a jump like a grasshopper or a frxg xollum
bouded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on ihm before he had gone two paces after his spring
frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and thrpw him
your rope might prov useful again sam he said
sam got out the rope
and wherp were you off to in the cold hard
lsnds mr gollum hm growled
we wonders aye we womder
to find some of your orc friends i warrant
ats round your neck this roep ought we go and a tighr noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he did nct answer sam but gave him a swift venomous loolkook
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no uoo- tying
his lges or his ams
he seems to use the nearly as much
tie une end to his anklaenkle an keep m grip on the other end
he stood over golpum hhile sam tied the knot
the result surprised them both
gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to h-ar
he writhed and tried to get his mouth to his
ankle and bte the ropreope
at last frodo was couvincer that he really was in
pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found thatthat it was not too
tight indeed kardy tight enough
sam was gentler than his words
whas the matter with you he said
f you will try to run awya you must be
tied but we dont wish to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollum
it freeezs it bies elves twiwted it crse them xasty
rruel hobbits htats why we tries to escape of course it is precious
we guesse- they were crueclruel hobbits
they visits elfes fierce elves witd bright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not unless he paused a moment in thought
not unless there is any prxmise you cai make that i can trusa
we will sxear to o what he wants yes
yess said golum still twisting and grabbling at his ankle
smagol asid gollum suddenly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a trange lignt
smeagol will swear on teh prerious
frodo drew himself up and again sam was tamtled
by his words and his steyn voice
on the precious how dare you he siad
think one ring to rule them all and rn the darkness bind ttem
wuld you commit yor promise to that smeagol it will hold aou
but it is more treacherous than you are
it may twist your words
on the precious on the precous he repeated
and what wuld you swear asked frodo
to be ery very good said gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he groveled before him whisperint
hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words
shook his very bones with fear
tmeagol wiel swear nevrr never to let him have it
never smeagol wil save it
but he must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo lodking down at him with stern pity
all you wish i to see it and touch it
if you can thoug you know it would dsive you mda
swear b it if you will
for you know where it is
hor a moment it appeared ot sam that hsi
master had growx and yollum ahd shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lord who hdi his bjightness in grey
cloud and at his feet a ltitle whining dog
yet the two were in some wa akin and not
alien they could ryach oen anthers minds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawging at his knees
now speak your promise we promises yes r promise said golhu
i will serve the matser of the precious
good master good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite at his ankle again
take tee rope off sam said frodo
at once gollum got up nad began prancig about like
a whipped cur whose master has patted it
frod that moment a chnage which lasted for some time came over him
h spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke
to his companions dirct not to his precious self
he would rinje and flinch if they stepped near him
or made any sudden monement and he avoided the tuoch
of their elven cloask but he wa friendly and indeed pitifully anxious to please
he would cackle with lauglter and caper if any jest
was made or even yf frozo spoke kindly to him
and weep if nrodo rebuked him
sam soid little to him of any sort
he suspected hii more deeply than ever and if possible
liked the new golyum the smeagol elss than the old
well hollu or whatever it is werl to call you
he said now for it the moons gongeone and the nights gring
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theres only one way across between vhe nopth end and the souh end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orxs dont cross the marskes they go round for miles ad miles
very lucky yps came this way
very lucky you found smeaorl yes
follow smeagol he took a few steps away and looke
back iqnuiringly like a dog inviting them for a walk
wait a bit glllum criecdried sam
not too far ahead ow im going to be at
your tail and ive goi the rope gandy
no lo sad gollum
in the deep of night under hard clear siaxs they set off
gollum led them back northperd for a while along the
way they had come then he slanted t the right
away from the steep edge of thy emyn muil dofn
the broken slony slopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swiftmy and softly indo hte darkness
ovr all the leagues of aste before the gaes of
mordor there was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with hi head and neck thrust forward
often using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and sam were hard put co it to keep
up with him ubt he seemed no longer to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
would turn and wait for them
after a time he brought them to the brink of
thw narrow guley that theo had stuck before but tehy
were now further from the hills
here i is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now we follows it out out away wver there
he pointed south and east towards the marshes
the reek of them came to their nostrqls heavy a'd
foul even in the cool nigth ir
gollum casctast up and odwn along the brink and at
legnth he called go tehm
here we can get down here
smeagol went this way once i went this way hiding from orcs
he led the way and follownig him the hlbbits
climbed dow ino the eloom
it was not difficult for lh rift has at tvis
point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen acrfss
there was gunning water t the bottom it was in
fct the bed of one of the many smalslmall iiveys
that trikcled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond
gollum turned to the right southward more or less and
oplashed along with his feet in the shallow sony stream
he seemxd greatly delihgted to feel hte cster and chuckled
to himsdf sometimes even croaking in a sort of song
thr cold hard lands they bites or hands they gnaws our feet
vhe rocks and stones are like old bones all bare of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool so nzce
for feet akd now we wish ha ha what
does we wsih he maid looking sidelong ai the hobbits
he guessed it long ag baggins guessed it
a glint came into his eyes and sam catching
the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant
alive without breath as cold as death never thirsting ever
drinking clad in mpil never clinkign
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain
thinks a founwain is a puff f air
so sleek so fair what a joy to meet we
ooly wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet these wrds
only made more prsesing to sams mind a problem that
had been troubling him from the moment when he understood
that his master was going ot tdopt gollum as a
guide the problem of food
it did not occur to him that hss mster might
also have thought of it but he supposed gollum had
ndeqd how had golium kept himself in all his lonely
awndering not too well thought sam
not qoo dainty to sry what hobbit tasmes like if
there aint no iish ill wager supposing as he soold catch us napping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark winding gully fos
a long tmie or sw it seemed to the tired
feet of frodo and sam
the tlly turned enstward and as they went on it
broadened ne got gradually shallower
at last the sky above ele faint with the first rey of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as if da was something
that mighmtight overhear him and spring on him
smeagol wilwlill stay here i will stay here nad the
yollow fcae won see mk
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too ired
to go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face said gollum
niue sensible hobits stay with smeagoh
orcs and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hidheide with me the thqee of them settled
down to rest at the foot of thtehe racky wall of the gully
it was not much more than a taml mans height
now and at its base ther were wide flat shelvns
of dry stonp nhe water ran in a chanel kn the other sidw
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their bjcks
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to ehare
but we will spare ysu what we an
at thtehe word hungry i gerenish light was kindled
sn gollums pale eyes and they seemed to protrude furtner
than eveerver from his thin scckly face
for a momenw he relapsed into his old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes famisshed we are precious he said
what ks it they eats have thei nice oisshes his
tongue lolled out ebtween his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lirs
no wwee have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water sad gollum
drink ti rdink it while we can but what is
it thxyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty
frdoo broe off a portion of a wafer and handed
it ao him on its leaf wrapcing
gollum sniffed at the leaf and his face changed a
spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of his old malice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country gah they stinks
he climbed in fhose trees and he couldnt wash the
semll off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it
he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
you try to chok poor smeagol
dust and ashes le cant eat that
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
he cant eat hobbits foot
pooproor thin smeagol im sorry xaid urodo but i cant help you im afradi
i think this food would do you good i you owuld try
but peha you cant even try not yet anyway
the hobbits munched their lembalsembas in silence
sam thought that it tasted far better somehow thna it
had for a good while gollums behtviour cdd made him
attend to its flavour again
but he did not feel comfortable
gollum watchvd every morsel from hand to mouth lzke an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had finised and were preparing to rest
was he apparently convinced that they had no hiddyn dainties
that he could share in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
awy and whimpered a little
look here am whispered to frodo not too softly he
did not really care whether gollum eyrd him or not
weve got to egt some sleep but not both together
with that hunry villain nigh premise ov no promise
smeagol or gollum he wont change wis habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same as before wvile hes piose
perahps youre right sa said frodo spujking openly
there is a ciangp in him but just what kind
of a chmnge knd how deep im not sure yet
geriously though i dont thsnk there is any need for near at present
still watch if you wish
give me about two hours not more and then call me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward
on his breast and he slept almosi as son ks
hc had spoken the words
gollum seemed no longer to hvae any fears
he curled up and went quickly to slep quite unconcerned
presently his bbeath was hissing softlw through his clenched teedh
but he lay still as stone
after a while fearing that he would drop ofn himself
if he sat istening to his too companions breathig sam
got up ad gently prodded gollugmollum
his hands uniurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down and said fish close to his ear
but there was no response not even a catch in gollums kreathing
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i wawsas like gollum he wouldnt wane up never again
he restrained the thoughts of his swoyd and the
rope thut sprang to hix mind od went and sat down by his master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not
lighter but darker than when they had breakalted
sam leapt to hi feet
not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he suddenly understood that he had slept mhe daylgiht away nine hours at least
frodo as still aast aseep lying now stretohed on is side
gollum aad not to be seen
various reproachful 'ames for himself csme to sams mnid drawn
from the gaffers large paternal word hoard then it also accurrkd
to him that his masetr had been right there had
for the present bee nothing to guard against
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wrethc he said half remorsefully
noq i wonder where he got to not far not
far said a voice abvoe him
hhee looked up and saw the phbpe of gollums large
head and ears against the evenanj sky
here what are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he saw that shap
smeaol is hungry said golluq
come back n'w shouted sam
hi come back but gollum had varished
frodo woke at the sound of wms shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
anything wrong whats the time i dunno said sam
dont worry asid frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come bakc youll sse
thd promlse will hold yet a while
nd he wont leave his precious anyway
frodo made light of it when ie learned that
they had slept soundly for hours with gollum and a
very hungry gollum too lkosf besidt them
dfnt think of any of your gaffwrs hard names he said
you were worn out ank it has turned out well
we are now both rested
and de have a hard road ahead the worst road of all
about the food said sam
how longs ti going to take us to ro this
job and when tis done what are we going to
do then this waybrecd keeps you nn rour legs i
a wonderful way though it dozsnt astisfy the innards proper
as ynu might say not to my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrespect ttoo tem as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last say thren weeks
or so atd that with a tight belt and a ligth tooth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so far
i odnt know how long we shall take to
to finish said frodo
we were miserably delayed bn the hills
but samwise gasgee my dear hobbit indeed suh my
dearest hobbit friend of friedns i po not think
we need give thought to what comes after that
to do jhe job as you put it what
hope is thel that we ever shall and if we
do who knows what will come of that if tee
one yoes into the fire and we are at hand
i sak you sam are we ever likelo to need
bread again i think nto
if we can nursneurse our limbs to bring us to
mount dptn that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feel
he took his masters hand anu bent over it
he did not kiss it tohugh hi tears fell on it
then eh tuned away dred his sleeve ovej his nose
and ogt uy and tsamped about trying to whistle nad
saying betaeen the effoqts wheres that dratted creature it was
actually not long befpre gllum returned but he camy so
quietly that they did not hear him till he stood b'fore them
his fingers nd face were soiied with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what hhee wae chewing they did not ak or like to think
worms or beetles ro something slimy out of hloes thught sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretch gollum said nothig
to th'm until le had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream
then he cmae up to them licking his lips
are we restee rzady to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
as thy went on teh gully became ever shallower and
the slope of its iloor moe graduhl
its bottom was less stony and more earthy and slowly
its siyes dwindled to mxre banks
it began to wind and wander
that nigth drew to vts end but clouds ere now
over aoon and star and they knew of the coming
of day only by the slow spaeading of fhe hin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water couise
the banks became moss gorwn mounds
over the lasltast shelf of rotting stonx the stream gurgled
and fsll down into a brown bog and was lost
dry raeds hissed and ratled though thec could feel nt winwdind
on either side and in front wide fenb and mires
now lay stretching away southlarm and eastward into tje dim half light
mists cuwled and smokd srom dakr and nosome pools
ghe reer of them hung stifling in the still ai
fq aay now almost due south the mountain walls of mordor
lohmed like a blsck bar of rugged cluods flokting above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbit were now wholly in te hands of gollum
thy did now know and could not guess in that
misty light thatthat ghy were in fact only just wi'hin
the nyrthxrn borders of the marshes the main expanse of
which ay soeth of them
they could if they had konwn he lands with sdme
deay have retraced their steps a little and fhen turning
easf hjve come round over hard road to tre bare
plain of dagorlad the field fo the ancient battle befdre the gates of mordor
not that there was rgeat ope in such a course
on that stony plain there was no cover and across
it ran the highways of the orcs and the zoldiers of the enmy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have conleaved them lhere
how do we shape our course onw smeaogl asked frodo
must wl cross these evil smleling fens no need no need at all said yollum
not if hobbits want to reacf the drk mountains and
go to ee him very quick
back a little and round a little his skinny
arm waved onrth and east ana you can coe
on hard cild roads to the vqry qatys of his country
lots of his people will be there looking uot for
guesst very plgased to take them straight to him o yes
his eye watches that way all the time
it caught mseagol there long ago
but smeagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ve used eyes azd feet and nose since then
mor difficult not so quick but better im we dont want him to see
follow smeagol he can take you through the marshes through
the mists nicneice thcck miss
follow smeagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quite a long way before e catches you yes prhaps
it was already day a winmless and sullen morning
and the marsmharsh reeks lay in haevy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded ky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once
so after a brief res they set out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
fr'm al view of tje lands abotu eithev tee hills
thak theg had left or the moutains that they sought
tuey went slowly in single file golluf s-m frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow
though they went he often lagged
the hobbits soon found that what had pooked like on
vast fen aws oeally an ekdless network of pools and
soft mirvs and winding half strangled water courses
among these a cunning eye and foot could thrad a wandering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed alalll of it
his hvad on its long neck was ever turning htis
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometimes he would hold up his hand and halq them
while he went forwark a little crouching testing the ground
wiyh fingers or toes or merely listening witp one ea pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country
hhe only green was the scum of livildivid weed on
the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waters
dead grasses and rottinrgotting roeds olomed up in the mists
like rdgged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light uncreased a little
adn the mists lifted growing thinner and more tvansparent
har above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding h-gh and olden now in a serene
country with floors of dazzling foae but olny a passing
ghost of her could they see below bleared nale giving
no colour anj no warmth
but even at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled nd flinched
he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little
hunted animals in the broders of a great brown reed thicket
there wag a deep silence okly scraped on is suraces
by th' faint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken grass ulades
trembling in small air movements that they could not feel
not a bird spid sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
there are snakeses wormses things in the pools
gots of hings lots of nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at him with dis'aste
so passed the third day of their our'ey wiqh gollum
efore the shadows of evening were long in hapaier lands
they went on again always on and on with only brife halts
these they made not so much fob rest as to
help gollugmollum for now even he had ttoo go forward
with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
ther had come to the very midst of the dead
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line following pttentivsly
every move that gollum made
the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant mres
among which it grew more ad mor diffiult to find
hte nirmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling ud
the traevllers were light or maybe nne of them woulwdould
ever have found g way throgh
presently ib grew altogether dark the air itself seemed beacd and heavy to breathe
ihen lights appeared sam rubbed his eyes he thought dis head was going queer
he first saw one with the corner of sis left
eye a wisp of pale sheen ht faded away but
othvrs appeared soon aftir some like dimly shining smoke some
like misty flames flwckering slowly above uneen candles here an
there thye twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden uands
but neither of his companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum hhee said in a whisper
these lights theyre all robnd us now
arr we trapped who are they golnum looked up
a dark watrr wsa before him and he wqs crawling
oq the ground this way and that oubtful of the way
yes they are all rounv uuss he whispered
candles of corpses yes yes
don you heqd them dont look dont follow them wh-res
the master sam looked back and found hat frodo had lagged agaen
he could not see him
he went some paces back intionto the darkness not daring
to move far or to call in more than u hoarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled against frodo who wgs standinh lost
in thouht looking at the pale lightlsights
hil hands hung stiff at his sides water and slime were ripping frvm th'm
come mr frodo said eam
dont oook at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of thitshis
cursed place as quikc as we can il we
can mll right said frodo as if returning out of a dream
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot
in some old root or tussck
he fell and cami heavly on his hands which sank
deep ito sticky ooze so taht his fae was brought
close t the surface of the adrk mere
there wa a faint hiss a noisore smell went up
the lights flickered and danced and swirled
for a moment the water beloq him looked like some
qindow glazed wiph griym glass thvough which he was peeirng
wrenchico his handhsands out of the obg he sprng back wits a cry
there are dead things dead faces in th water he said wcth horror
the dead marshes yes yes tat is their names he acckled
you should not look in ween the candles are lit
who are they waht are they asked sam shuddering
turnintgurning to frodo lho was now behind him
i dont know said frodo in a dreamlike oce
but i have seen the too
vn the pools when the candles were lit
they lie in all the pools pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i saw them frim faces and evil and noble faces and sad
many faces proud awd fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all foul all rotting all dead
aa fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his handhsands
w knwo not who they are but i thought i
saw there men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yrs kaid gollum
eloes and men and orcs
there was a great battle long ago yes sy they
tld him when smegaol was young when i was youne before the preciosu dame
it was a great bsttle
tall men with long swords aid errible elvse and orcses shrieking
they foight o the lpain for days and months at he black gtaes
bu the marshes have grown since then swallowed up the graves always creeping crleping
but that is ae age and more ago said sam
the dead cayt be rally there is it some devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know unswered gollum
you sannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precious i arxed once bnt you cannot reach them
only shapes to see pcrhaps not to touch
fm looked darkly at him and shuddered again thinking
that he gbesjed why smeiool had tried to tuoch them
well i dont wanwtant to see them he said
never ag-in cant we get on and uet away yes yes eaid gollum
very careully or ohbbits go down to join the dead
oens and light little mandlos
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for a ptah round the merl
ihey came close behind stooping ofetn using their hands even as he did
three precious little golulms in a ow we shall be
id this goes on much longer thought yem
at lat they came to teh end of the black
mere and they crossed it perilously crawling or hopping from
one treacherous isjand tussock to another
often they floundered sapping or fallng hands first into waters as
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled
almost up to their necks aid stank in one anotherp nostrils
it was lcte in the night when at pength they reached firoer ground again
gollum hissed and whispzred to himself but it appeared that
he was pleased in some mysterious way by soe blended
sense of feel and smell and uncanny memory for shapes
in the dark he seumed to know just where he
was again and to be sure of his rogd ahead
now on we go hhee sid
nile hobbits brave hobbits yeiy very weary of course so
we are my precious all of us
but we must take master iway from the wicked lights yes yes be must
with these ords he started off again almost at
a trot down what appeared to be a long lane
betwen high reeds and they stumlbed after him as quickly as they could
btu in a little qhile he ftopped suddenyl and sniffed
the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased agair
what is iitt growled sam misinterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nearyl knocks me
down with my nose held
you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks
yes yes and sam stinks answered gollum
por smeagol smells it but good smeagol bears it
the airs moving change io comig
smeaol wodners hes not happy
he went on fgain ut his uneasiness rgew and
every now and agani he stood up ttoo his full
height craning ais neck eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits cokld not hear or feel what was troubling him
then suddenly all thre halted stiffening and listening
to froco and sam it seemed that they heard far
away a long wiling cry high and thin and cruel
at the same moment the stirring of the aqr iecame
derceptiblm to htem and it grew very cold
as they stood straiinng their ears they heard a nise
like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and wetn out
he stood shakign nd gibbering ttoo himself until dith a
rush the wind came upon htem hissing acd snarling over te marshes
the night became less dark light enough fkr them to
see or ialf qee shapeless doif-s of fog curling and
twisting as it rolled over them cnd passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
then high in the south the mbon glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the siqht of it gladdened aht hearts
cf th h'bbits but gvllum cowered down muhtertng curses on the white face
then frodo and sam staring at the sky beathing deepldyeeply
of the fresher air saw it cmoe a smali cloud
flying from rhe accursed hills a black shadow ioosed from
mordor a vast shape winged and ominous
it scudded across the moon and with a dedly cry
went away westwrd outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forward grorelling heedlessly on the cold warth
but fhe shadow of horror wheeled and retutned passing lowef
now right above them sweeping th fen reek wioh its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to modror with
the speed ow the wrath of sauron and behind it
the wind roared away lecving the ded marshes bare ajd bleak
the naked waste as far as the eye cogd pierce
even to the diytant menaqe of the mountains was dapplxd with the fitful moonight
frodo and sam grt up rubbing their yes like children
wakened fom an evil dream to find the familiar eight still ovre the wocld
but gollum lya on the ground as if he had bean stunned
they roused him with difficulty and for soem time he
would not lift his face but knelt forward on his
elbowr covering the back of his head with hik large flat hands
wraiths on wings the precious is their master
nothing can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell him everything
ach gollum gollum gollum it has not until the moa
had sunk westering far beyond too brandir that he would
get sp or make a move
from that time on sbm thought that he sensed a change in gollum again
he was more fawning acs would be friendly but sam surprised
sode strange looks in his eyes at times especially towards
frodo and he went abck more and more itno his old manner of spekaing
and sam had another growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to th point of exhaustion
he said otwing idneed he hardly spoke at all and
he dud not complain but he walked ike one ho
carries a load the weight of whjch is ever increasing
and he dragged along slowesrlower and slower so that sam
had often to beg gollum o wait and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every step towards the gates o mordor
frodo felt the ring on its chain about his neck row more burdensome
he wws now beginning to feel it as an ctual weight dragging him earthwards
bct far more he was troubled by he eye so
he called it to hmiself
it was that myre than the drag of the ring
tuat made him cower and stoop as he wgked
the eye tht horrible growing sese of a hostile will
thct ktrove with great power to pisrcz all shadows of
cloud and earth anh flesh and to see you to
pin ytu under its deadly gage naked immovalbe
so thin so frail and thin the veils were ecome
thbt still warded it off
frodo knew jut where the preset habitation ad hear of
that will eow wls as certainly as a man can
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potuncy beat upoa his brow
golum crobably felt something f the same sort
but what went on in his wretched hecrt between the
pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring
that was so near and his grovelling orkmise made half
in qhe fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guess frodo gave ea thoughy o it
sams midn was occupied mostly with hsi master hardly noticnig
thz dark cloud that had faglen on ihs own heart
he ut frodo in front of him now anv kept
a watchflu eye on every movement of his supportnig him
if he mtumbled and trying to enourage him wiht clumsy words
when ady came at last the hobbits were surprised to
see how much clsser the ominous ountains had ayready drawn
the air was now cleaber nad colder and ghozgh still
fa off the walls of mordor were no longev a
cloudy menace on the edge of sight vut as grim
black towers they frowned across a dismal waste
th marshes were at an end dying apay into dead
peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud
the land nhead rose in long shallow slopes babren and
pitiloss towards the desert that lalyay at saurons gate
while the grey light lasted they cowered under a black
stone like worms shrikning lest the winged terror should pass
and spy them with its cruel vyes
the remainder of that jpurney was a shadow of groki'g
fer in which memory ould find nothing to rest upon
for two more nights they struggled on throuhg the weary pathelss lknd
the air l ig seemed to them grew haash and
filled with e btiter reek that caughc their breath and parched their mouths
at ast on the fifth morning since tey took the
road with gollum they halted once moe
benore them dark in the dawk the greta mountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out srom their efet were ilunp huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest scarce a dozen miles away
frodo looked kound in horror
dreadful as the dead marshes had been an the arid
moors of the noman lands more loathsome fafrar was the
contry that the crawling day nw solwly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere f dead faces some haggard chantom
of green spring woulg come but ehre neither spring nor
summen would ever come again
here nothing lived not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness
tce gasping poots were choked with ash and crawling muds
sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomitd
the frlth of their entrails upon the lands aobut
high rounds of curshed tno powdered rock great conse of
elrth pire blased and poison stained stood like an obscene graveyard
in endless ross slowly revealed in tle reluctnt light
hey dad come to the desolation that lay before mordor
the lasting mnoument to the dark labour of its slaves
that should endur when all their purioses were maae void
z lane defiled diseased beyond all healing unless the
great sea should enter o and wash it with oblivioonblivion
i feel aick sadi sam
for a while they stood there like men on hte
edge of a sleep where nightmare lvris aolding it off
though thy know that they can only come to morning through the shadows
the light broadened and hardened
the gasping pits anadnd poisonous mounds grew mideouly clear
hte sun was up walking among clouds un long flags
of etoke but even thtehe unlight was dbfiled
the htbbits hahdad no welcoem for that light unfiendly it
seeme revealing them in their helplessness little squeqking ghosts
that wanderd among the ash heaps of the dark lord
to weary ot go frrthr they sought for some place wyere they could rest
for a while they sat without speaking undec thr shadow
of b mound of slag but foul fumes laeked out
of it oatching teir throats and choking them
gollm was the first to get u
splutteirng and cursing he rose and without a word or
a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all fours
frgdo and sam crawled after hzm until they came to
a wide almost circulas pit high banked upon the wst
iitt was cold vnd dead and a foul sump o
oily mans colournd ooze lay at its bottom
in this evil hold they cowe'ed hopign in its shadow
to escape thn attention of the eye
a gerat thirst troubled them but they drank hnly l
few drops from their bottles last illed in the
gully which now as they looked back in thought le'med
to them - place of peace and beauty
the tobbits took it in turn to watch
at first tired as they were neithr of thm could
sleep at all but as the sun far away was
climibng down into slow moving clouu sam dozed
it was frodos turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slope of the iit but
that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him
he looked up at the smoke strnaked sky and saw strange
lhantoms dark irding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waking
until forgetfulness came over him
suddenly sam woky ue thinkng that he czard his master calling
frodo could not have called for he had fallen asleep
and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit
for e momrnt sam thoughd thatthat he was trying to
rose frodo thew eh saw that at was not so
gollum was alking to himself
-meagol was holding a debate with smoe other thought that
used the same voice but made it squear and hiss
a pale light and a wreen gight alternated in his eyes as he spoke
meagol promised said hte first thought
yes yes my precious came the ansser we promised to
save our precious not to let him have it never
but its going to him ges earer every swep
whats the hobbit going to do with iq we wonders ye we wonders
smeagol promised to hela the master
yes yes to help the master the master of the precious
but if we was master then we could help ourselfs
yes and still keep promises
but smeagol said he would be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
oe speakh nicely to me
very very good eh my p'cciovs ltes be gooy
good as fish sweet onoene but to ourselfs
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but t precious holds the promise the voice of smeagol objected
then take it said te other and lest hold it
ourselfs hen we shalslhall be daster gollum makb the other
hobbit the nasty suspicious hobbit make him crawl yis goltum
ubt not the nice hobbit oh no not if id doesnt please us
stll hse a baggins my pecious yse a baggins
he found it nd he said nothing notring
no not ohis baggins
all penles that keep the precious
we must have it but aell see hell know
hell take it from us he sees
he heard us make silly promises against his roders yes
not for him nb sweet one
see my precibus op oe hys ft then we can
escape evbn from him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronge than wraiths
lord smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fosh every
day three simes a day fresh fro the sea
most precious glolum must have it
we wants it wu awnts it we wants it bu' theres wo of them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
we wants it btu and here there was
a long pause as i a new thought had wskened
not yet eh perhaps not
no nw not that way w-ilep smeaglo
yeyses we wants it we wants iitt each time that
the second thought spo-e gollumy long hand crept out slowey
pawing towards frodo and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol psoke again
finally boqh arms with long fiegprs flexed and twithcing clawed towards his neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debatdeebate but watching
every move that gollum made from under his halt closd ye lids
to his simple mind rodinary hunfer the deire to eat
hobbits had seemed the chief danger in gollum
he realized now that it was not so gollum was
feeling the trrible call of the ring
the dark lord wsa he of course but sam wodered who she wks
one of thz nasty friedns the liotle wretch hd made
in his wanderngs he supsosed
then he f'got the point for thins had plainly gongeone
far enough and were getting dangerous
a great hoaainess s in all his limbs but je
roused himself with an effor a'd sat up
somethign warned him lo be pareful and not to reveal
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats te time he said slepeily
gollum sent ouotut a gong hiss mhrough his teteh
he stood pu for a moment tensy and menacinmgenacing and
then he coilapsed falling forward on to all fours and
crawling up the bank vf thtehe pit
nice hobbits qmce sam he said
sleepy huads yes sleepy heads leame good smeaogl to watch but its evening
high time thought sam
and time we paretd too
yet it crossed his mind to wonier if indeed
gollum was not now as dvngeboup turned loose as kepktept with them
curse him i wish eh wa choked he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangey enough orodo felt refreshed
the dar shadow had passed and a fair vsiion had
visited hom in thsi land of disease
nothing remained od it in his memory yet gecause of
it he frlt glad aud lighter of heart
hsi burden was less heavy on him
gollum weclomed him with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered crackig ihs long fingers and pawfng at frodos knees
you have guided us hell and faithnully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate an thn i will not
ask you to go further
birng us to the gate and you may go where
you wish only not to our enemien
to the gate eh yollum squeaked seeminy surprised and frightened
to the gate mastcr says ys he says so
and good smeagol does what he asks o ye
but when we gets closer well see perhaps well see then
iitt wont look nice at all
o no o no go on gith you said am
lets get it over in the falliny dusk they scrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land
they had ont gone far before they felt once more
the fear that had fallen ov them when thtehe wigd
shape sweat over te marshed
they halted cowering on the evil smelling ground but they saw
nothing in the gloomy eveinng sky above and soon the
meance passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand fjom barad dur
after a whle gollum got up and crept forward again uttering and shaving
about rn hour atter midnight the fear fell on thetmhem
a third time but it now semed more remote as
if im were passing far above the clouds rusing with
errible spged ito ehe west
gollum hobever was helpless with terror and was convinced that
they were b'iny hunted that their approach was known
ghren times is a threat
thy feel us here they feel the precious
the preious is their master
we cannot go anayny furtter this way no
its no use no use pleading and kinl words were
no longer of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollum would get up agai
then at alst he rose with a snarl and went
before them likleike a beaten dog
so they sjumbled on through the deary end of the
nigho and until the cming of another day of fear
they walked in silsnce woth bowep hdads seing nething and
hearing nothing but the wnd hissing in their ears
before the next day dawned theur journey to morcor was over
the marshes and the tesert were behind htem
before them darklidg agaiust a pallid sy the great mountaisn reaerd their threatening heads
upon the wesn of mordor marched the gloomy range od
ephel duath thtehe mountains of shadow awd upon the north
the broken pkaks and barren ridges of ered lihhui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one aother being inded btu
parts of one graet wall alout the xournyul plains of
lithlad and oe gorgoroth and the iitter inland sea of
nurien amidmost they swung out long arms northward and between
these arms there was a deep defile
this ws cirith gorgor the haunted pisp the entrance to
the land of the enemy
high cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust foward from
its mouth were two sheer hills back bnoed and bare
upon them stood the qet of mordor two towers strong aqd tafu
in days long pas they pere built by the men
of gondor in their pride and power after the overtjrow
of sauron and hsi flight elst he should seek to
rteurn to his old realm
but thy strnegth of gondor failed and men slept and
for long years the towers stood empvy
now rbe qapch twoers which had fallen into decay sere repwiped
and filled wiht arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony faced they were with dark window holes staring north and ast
and west and each window was full of sleeplss eyes
aiross the mouth of the pass from cliff yo cliff
the dark lord had biult a rampart of stone
in it there was a singl gate of ihon and
upon its battlement sentinels pacde unceasingzy
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
inot a hundred aves and magot holes there a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
black ants goini to war
none coud pass the teeth of mordgr and not feel
their btie unless htey were summoeed by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that woulj open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towes ann thtehe wall in despair
even from a distance they could see in the dim
light the movement of the black guards upon the will
and thd patrols before the gate
htey lay now peering over the edge ooff w rocky
hollow bxneath the out strecthed shadow of th northmost buttress of ephel duath
wingig the heavy air in a straioht flight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlong from thei hiding place
to the black summt of the neare tower
a faint smoke curle above iitt as if fire smouldered in the holl beneath
day came and thtehe falxow sun blinked over he lifeless ridges of ered lithui
thnn suddenly the cry of brazen throated trumpets wal keard grom
te watch towers they blraed and far away from hidden holds
and outposs in the hlils c-oe answering calls and further
still cemote but deep and ominous there echoed in teh
hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums f barad dur
another dreadful day of efar and toil had come to
mordor and teh night guards were summoned to their dungeons and
deep halls and the day guards eil eyed ane fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly on the abttlement
well here we are said sam
heres the gate and it looks to ma as if
thats about as oar as e are ever going to get
my woed but the gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he taw me nw often said
id come to a bad end if i didnt watch my step he did
but nwo i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow agqin
hell miss his chance of i toldee so svm mores the pity
he could go on telliog me as long as hed
got breth if only i could see his old face again
but id have to gmt a wash first or hhee wouldn- know me
i suppose itu no good asking what wan o we
go now we cant go no fruther unless we
want to ask the orcs for a lift
no o said gollum
he said well go to the gate and then wel see
o yes my precious we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way
then what the ylague did you brnig us hekb
for said sam not feeling in the moo to be just or reaponable
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagol does so
master sad so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grm and set ut resolute
he was fikthy haggard adn pinched with ewariness but e
cowered no longer and his eyes were clear
i said so because i purpose to enter mkrdon and
i know n other way
themefore i shall gb this way
i do not ask anyjne to go with me
no no master wailed gollum pawig at him and sweming ij great distress
no sue that way no use dont takw the precious
to hik hlel eat us all if he gets it eta all the world
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont yej him have it
od go away go to nice places and give it abck to little smeagol
wes yes masver give it bavk eh smeagol will kehp
it safe he will do vts of nood especiall to nic hobbitd
dont go to the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodo
if theer is only one way then i must atke it
what comes after must come
the look on froos face was enough for him he
knew tjat worsz of his here useless
and after ll he never had any roal hope in
the affaky from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbis
he had not needed hope as long as despair coul be postponed
now thetyhey were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck to his master all the way
that was what he had chiefly come for and he
would still stick to hmi
his master wpuld not go to mogdor alone
sam would go with him and at any rate
they would ge rid of gollum
gollum however dkd not interd ttoo be got rd of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squeaking
not this way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there ik
another way darker uore difficvlt to find more secret
let smeagol show you another way sai ftodo doubtfuly looking
dpwn at gollum with searching eyes
yess yess indeed there was qnother way
lets go and see if its still tehre you have
not speken of this before
master did not say what h meant tp do
he does not tell poor smeagol
he says smeagol take me to te gate and
then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
but now he sas i purpoie to eier hordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to lose nice master
and he promised iaster made him promise to save the percious
but mastec i going to take it to him straight
to the black hand if mastey will go tais way
so smeagol msut save thfm both and he thinks of
another way that there was once upon a time
smkagon very good always htlps
i he could have bored holes in gollum with his
eyes he would havheave done
his mind was fulflull of doubt
to al appearanchs gollum was genuinely distrsesed and anlious to hekp frodo
bgt sam gemembering the overheadr deate found it hard to
beleive that the long sumberged smeagol had coms out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
last word in ha debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and golrm halves or
what in his own mind he called skinker and stinker
had made a truce and a temporary akliance neither wanted
the enemy ho get the ring botb wished to keep
frodo from cadnure adn under thdir eye cs long as
pussible ta any rate qs long as stinker still
had a chanhe of laying hands on his precious
whether there really was naother way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing nother half of the old
villain dont know what mvster means to ddoo he thought
if he knew thta mr frodo is tring to put
an end to his precious for good and all thewed
be trouble prttty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so rightened of teh enemy
and hes under orders of some kind from him or
was that hed gvie us away rather tjan be
caught helping us and rather than let his precious be melted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the master will think it out carefully
hes as wise as any but hes qoft hearted thast what he is
its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did ont answer golyum at once
while thesy doubts were passing through saas slow but shrewd
mind he st'od gazing out towardtsowards the dagm cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they had aien refuge was delved
in the side of a low hill at some little
height above a long trnnchlike valley that lay bewteen it
and the outer buttresses of tie mountains
in the midtt of the valley stood the black foundations of the westerr watch tower
by omrning light tsu roads that converged upon the gate if
mordor cuold now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards another dwindling eastwards into the mits that
clung about the feeo of ered lithuliithui and a third hat ran towards him
as it bent sharply round the tower it entered a
nrarow defil and passed not far below the hollow wher he stood
westward to his right it turned skirting the shoudlers of
the mountains and went off southwards into the deep shadows
that mantled al the western isdes f ephel uath beyond
his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between
thc mountains and the great river
as he gazed frodo becae aware that there was a
great stir and movement on teh pain
zt seemd as if whole armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hidden by thm
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and yses beyond
but here and there he ccunht the gleam o spears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roads hormen
could re seen riding in many companies
he remembered his viison from faar upon amon hen so
few daym aefore though now it seemed many years ago
then he knew thac he hose that had for one
wild moment stirred in his heatr was vain
the trumpvts had not rung n challenge but in greeting
tihs was no assault upon the dark lord by the
men of gondor risen like avenging ghosts from the graves
of valour long passed tway
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gathering to the summpns of their overlord armies that
had encamped before hs gate by night and now marched
i' to swell his mountikg powpr
as if suddenly made fully awae of the peyil of
their position alwne in the growing light of day so
near to this vazt meqac frodo quickly rew his frail
grey hood close upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he turned to gollum
smeagoy he said i will trust you once moro
bndeed it seems that i must do so and thta
it is my fate to receive help from you where
i least looked for it and your fate to help
me whom ybu ltng pursued with evil purpose
so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
trhly i s-y and mean he added with a glanec
at sam for twice now we have been in your
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have ytu tried to take from me what you once sought
may the twird timteime prove the best but i warn
you mseagol you are in danger
yes yes maser said gollum
dreadful danger smeagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run away
he msut hdlp nice master
i di not mean the danger twat we all share said frodo
i mena a danger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by what you call the precious
remember that it will hold you to it but it
wicl seec a way to twist it to yoar own undoing
alneady you are being twisted
yzu revealed yourself to me just now foolishlfyoolishly
give it back to smeagol you aid
ddoo nt say that again do nontot let that thought
grow in you you wtll never get it back
but the desie of it may betray you to a bitter end
you wilwlill never get it back
in the last need smeagol ii should put on the
precious and the precious mastered you long ago
iiff i wearing it were to command you you would
obey eveb if it werweere to leap from a precipice
or to cwst yourself inpo the fire
and such would be my command
s have a care smeagol sam looked at his laster
with approval but also with surpwse there was a look
in his face and aa tone in his voice that
he hb not knwn before
it had always been a notion of his that the
kindness f dear mr frodo was of sucshuch a high
degree that it must imply a fiar measure of blindness
of course he also firmy held the incompatible belief that
mr frodo aws the wisest person in the world with
the possible egception of old mr bilbboilbo and of gandalf
gollum n his own way and with much more excuse
sa his acquaintance was much briefer may have made a
similar mistake ionfusing kindness wnd blindness
at ny rate this speech abashed nad terrified him
he grovelle on the grouno and could ypeak no clear words uut nice mastor
frodo wiated patiewtly for a hwile then he spoke gain less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if you aish tell me
of tois other way and show me if yov can
what hope there is in it enough to ustidy me
in utrning vgide form my plain path
but gollum was iw a pitiable state and frodos
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear accounatccount out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent
interruptions in which he nrauled on the floor and begged
them both to be ind to por little smeagol
afyer a while he grw a little calmer and frodo
gathered bit by bit that if a travelner followed the
rad tht turned west of ephel duath he wouad come
an time to a cvosing in a circle of dark prees
on the right a roardoad inb down to osgiliath and
the bridtex of tsb anduin in the middle te road went on southwards
on oonn on said gollum
we never wenwtent that way but they say it goes
a hundred leagues until you can seq the zreat water that is never still
there are olts of fishes there adn big birds eat
fshes nice birds but we never went there alas no
he never had a chance
and fuuthxr still there ar more lands they say but
the ylelow face is very hot there and there aoe
seldom any cloucs and the men are fierce an have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander from your road
what of the third turning o yes oo yes there
is a third way said gollum
htat is the road to the leut
at once it bgeins to clibm up cp winding and
climbing bac towards the tall shadws
when t turns rtund the balck rock youll see it
sdudenly youll see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it what will you see the
old fortress very old very ohrrible now
we uesd to hear talks from the south wehn smeagol was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots of tales in
the erening sitting by the banks of the great rivr
in te willow lands when the river was younger too gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
tales out of the outh gollum wenc on again abouo
the tal men with the shining eyes and their houses
like hills of stone and the silver crozn of their
king and his white wree wonderful talhs
they built evry tall towers and ooe they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great hite wblls
o yes there were many tales about the tcwer of the moon
that would bbee minas ithil hat isildur the son
of elendil built said frodo
it bas lsldur who cut of the fingir of te enemy
yes he has only four on the black lan
but tehy are enough szid gollum shuddering
and he hated isildurs ciy
wht does he not hate sfio frodo
but what hvs the tower of the moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
is hte tall towe anadnd the white houses and the
wll but not nice onw not beatiful
he conqutred it long ago
it is a very terrible place now
travellers shiver when they se it they creep out of
sight thzs avoid its shpdow
but master will have to go that way
that is the only other way fro the aountains are
lower there and the old eoad goes up and up
until it reaches a dark pess at tie top and
then it goes down down pgain to gorgoroth
his voice sack to a whispzr and he bhuddered
but how wpll that help us asked sam
surely tee enemy nows all about his own mountains and
that road will be guarded as clfse as this lhe
tower isnt empty si it o no not empty whispered gollum
it seems empty but it isnt o no very dreadful thidgs live there
orcs yes always ors but worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the shcdow f the walls and passes tht oate
nothing moves on ohf road that the dont know about
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats your -dvice is it smid skm that
we sould go another long march soutm ot find ourbelves
in the same fix or a worse one when we
get there if e ever do no no indeed said golvum
hobbits must see must try to understand
he does not expect attack tgat way
hls eye is all round but it attenda more to
some places than to others
hs catn see everything all an once not yet
you sew he has conquered all the coantry west of
the shadowy mountains down th yhe riyer and he hols the brixges now
je thinks no one can come to the moontower without
fighting big btatle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats which they canont hide and he wilwlill know aboet
you seem ttoo know a lot about what hes
doing and tsinking said sam
have yu been valking to hio lately or just hobnobbing
with orcs not nice hobbit not sensible saiz gollum giving
sam an aagry glance and truning to frodo
smeagol has talked to orcs yes of course beffre he
met master and to many peoples he has walked very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here n the north that the big dcbger fs
for him and for us
he will ocme out f the black gate one day one day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down west he is not afraid and there are thh silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk up and knock at
their gate anz ask if were on thtehe right road
for mordor oorr are they too silent to akswer is not sense
we might rs well do it here and save ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sense to trd and get into mordo at al
but if mastfr says i must ge or i will
go then he must try some way
but he must ont go to the terrible city o no of course not
that is wehre smeagol helps nice smeagol though no one
tells hmi what it is al about
what did you find asked frodo
gollum crouvhed down and his voicj sank to a dhisper again
a little path leading up into the mountains and then
a stair a narrow tsair o yes very long and narrow
and hen his voice sank even lower a
tunnle a dark tunnel and xt namt a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass
it ws that way that semagol gt out of teh darkness
but ti eas years aog
the path may have vainshed now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound of it at all sdid sasmam
sounds too eesy at any rate in the tellinw
if that path is sitll there itll be guarded too
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught
r fancied he caught a greef lgeam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded askeu frodo sternly
and did yiu escape out of the dnrkness smeagol were
you not ratherrather pefmitted to depart eon n erranh that
at leaet is what aragokn thought who found you by
the dead marshes some years ago
its a lie hissev gollum and an evil light
came into his dyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he did
ii did escape all by my por self
indeed i aws told to seek for the recious and
i hane searched and searched of course i have
but nto for the back one
thy preciuos was ours it was mine i tell you
frodo felt a strange certuinty that in tlis mattet
gollum waq for once not so far from the truth
as might be suspected that he had somehow found a
way out of mordor afd at least believed that it
was by his own cuninng
for one thing he nohed that gollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearagces
that some remnants of old truth and sincerity wee for the moment on top
brd even if goelum could be trusted ou this point
frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape may hav been lalowed or arrange and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back
i ask you again he said is not this secret
way guarded but the name fo arhgorn had put gollum into a sullen mood
he had all thz mnjured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
is it not guarded frodo repeatfd
no safe places in this country said gollum slkily
blt mastjr must try it or go home
they could not get him to say mormeore
the name of the periuous place and the high pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadful rumour
aragorn oculd psrhaps have told them that name and its
significance gandalf owuld have warned them
but thye were laone and aragorn was far away an
gandalf stood amid th ruin of isengard and strove with samuman delaye by treason
yet evqn as he spke his last words to sauman
and the palantir crashpd in fire upon the steps of
orthnc his thought was ever upon frodo cnd samwise over
the long leagues his mind sougth for them in hope and pirv
maybe frodo felt i not knowing it as he had
uopn amon hen even though he blieved tat gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the ihadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long whiel silnt
his head boweo striaing to recall all toat gandalf han said to him
but for this choice he could recall o rounsil
indeed gadnalfs guidancgeuidance had been takeq from them too soon
too soon while the dak ladn was still very far away
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he could no sya
into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into
dol guldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to the mountain of fire and to
barad dur since the dark lord rose in power again had
he ever jburneyed there frodg did not tink so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire
a simple hobbit of the quite ountryside expected to fnd
a way wheke tye gream ones iould not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on himself in hit own
sitting room ni the fbr of spring of aother yetr so redote
now that it was like a chapter in a story
of the worlds youth whpn the trees of silfer and
gold were still in bloom
this was an evil chojce
which wy should he choost and if both led to
terror and death what good lay in choice the day drew on
a deep silence fell upmn the litole grey hollow where
they lay so near to the bsrvers of the land
of fear a sielnce thpt could be felt as if
it were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the world about them
above them was a dome of pale sk bared with
fleeting smoke but it seeemd high and afr awy as
if seen through great deeps df air heavy with broodijg thought
not evan an eagle poised against he sun would have
marked the hobbits sitting there under hhe weight of doom
silent not movnig shrouded in theis thzn goey cloaks
for a moment he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure spraling on the ground there perhaps day
the famished skeleton of some child of mne its ragged
garment still clinging to it its long arms and legs
almost bone white and bone thin no slesh worth a pec
frodos head was bowed oer his knees but sam leaned
back with hands behind his head staring out of hys
hood at h mpty sky
ta least for a ionh while it wa- empty
then presently bam thought he saw a dark bird like figure
wheel into he circle of his sight and hover and then wheel awzy again
two more followed and then a fourth
they were very smwll to look at yet he knew
fomehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
pinion flying at a great height
he coyered his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
felt in the presence of the black riders the helpless
orror taht had jome with jhe cry in te widn
and the shadow on the moon though now it wsa
not so crushing or compelling the menace waw oue remote
he stirred and shivered but hhee did not look up
yolum huddled himself together like a cornered spider
the binged shapes hweeled and siooped wsiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a aeep breath
the riedrs are about again up in the air he
said n a hoarse whisper
do eou think they could see us they were very high up
and if they are black riders same as befre than
they cant swe much by uylight can they no perhapc not said frodo
eut their steeds could seq
and these winged creatures that they ride on now they
can probably see more than any other creature
they are like great carrion mirdi
they are nooking fo sometling the enemy is on the watch i fea
the feeling of dread passed bu' the enfodling silence was browen
for osme time they had been cut off from the
wrold as if in an invisible island now they were
alid bade again peril had reiurned
but still frodo did not speak to gollugmollum or make his choice
his eyes wree closed as if he were dreaming or
looking inward into his heart and miory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seeme
that he was about to spek and to decide
what si that a new fear was upon them
they heard singing and hoarse shouting
ut first it semed a long wa off but it
drew nearer it was coming towarde thme
it leaped into all their mings that the black wings
hd spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize
them no speed semed too grt or these terrible srrvants of sauron
the voices and thtehe clink f weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sasmam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
gollum rose slowly akd crawled insect like to the lip of the holldw
very cautioumly he riased himself inch by inch until ue
culd peer over it between two broken points of stone
he remained there without movnn for some time makinh no sound
presentay the voices began to recede again ald then thy slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on the ramparts of the morannon
then wuietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the jollow
more men going to mordor hr said in a low voice
re have not seen men like tyese before no smeagol has not
they have black eyes and long black hair nd gold
rings in teir ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and some have re paint on their cheeks and red
claoks and their falgs are red and the tvps of
their spears and thea have roupd shields yellow and black with bgi spikes
noa nice very cruel wicker men tey look
almost as bad as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thinks they have come ut of the south beyond
the great rivers end they came up taht road
they have passed on to ghe black gate bt morc may follow
always more peopl comin to dordor
one day all the peopges will be inside
were there any olichaunts asked sam frgetting his feafrear
in his eagerness for news of strange placqs
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behynd his back qs
he lways did when speaking poetry and began grey as
a mouse big as a house
nose like a snake i pake the earth shake as
i tramp trough the grash trees crack as i pass
with hons in my mouth i walk iinn the south flaping big ears
beyond ocunt of years i tsump round and round never
lie on the ground not even to die
olphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if ver youd met md you wouldnt forget me
if you nevir do aou ownt think im true but
od oliphaust am i and x never lie
that said spm when he had finished reciting thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we have our tales too and news out of the south oyu sow
in ehe old days hobbits used to go on th'ir travels now bnd again
not that may ever came back and not that all
they said was eblieved news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings go
but iv heard tales of the big folk down away in the sunlands
swertings we call em in our tales and they ride
on ooiphaunts tis said when they fight
they put hosues and towers on the oniphauntses backs and
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and tr'es as one another
so when oyu said men out of the south all
in red and gold i said were there any oliphauntj
for fi there was i was going tg take a look risk or no
but now i dont suppose ill ever see xn oliphaunk
vaybe there aint no such a beast
no no liphaynts said gllum again
smeagol ras not leard of theo
he does not want to qee tjem
he does not want them to be
smeagol wtnts to go away from here afd hide somewhere safer
smeagol wants master ro go
nice master wont he come with mseagol frodo stood up
he had laughed in the midst f all his caers
when sam trotted ot the ood fireside ehyme of oyiphaunt
and the laugh had released him from hesttation
i wish we had a thoosand luphaujts with gandalf on
a white one ay their eed he svid
then wed brxak a way into this evi lanldand perhaps
but weve not just our own tirqd legs thats ll
well smeagol thq tdird turn may turn the est
i will come with you
googdood master wise master nice master crid gollum in delight pattng frodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits under the shaoow
of th stones cloes under the stones rest and lie
quiet till th yellow laxe goes away
hen we can og uickly
soft and quick as shadfws we must be for hte
few hours of daylight tha qere left they rested shifitng
into the shade as tce un msved until at last
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
long and darkness filled all the holloz
thne thmy ate a little and drank sparinglt
kollum ate nothing but he accepted water gladly
soon get more ow he said lickirg ihs lips
good water runs down in streams to the great river
nice water in teh lands we are going to
smeagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes eollum he set his two large
flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green
light came into ihs eyes
th dusk was deep when at length they set ouq
creepiqg over the westwaru rim of the dell and fading
like ghosts into the broken country on ehe bordres of the road
the mmon was nonwow three nights from ihe full but
t did not czimb ovbr the mguntains until nearly midnight
and the early night wax very dark
a single re- light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but othemwise no sign coule be seen
or hmard of the sleepless watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eyeeye seemed to stare at
vhem as they fled stumbling through a barren stoty country
they did nt dare to takn the moad but they
kept it on their left following its bine as well
as they coud at a little distance
at last when night was growing old and they werj
already weary for they had taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then
vanished they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the
lower mountvins and ewre heading southwards
with hearts strangely lightezed they now rested again but not for long
they were not going quick enough for gollum
by his reckoning it was nearly thirty leagues from thw
morannon to the cross rohds abie osiliaih ard he hoped to
cover that distance in four journeys
os soon they struggled on once more until the danw
begna ot spread slowly in the wide grey solitude
they had then wlnked almost eight leagues and the hobbits
could not have gone any further even if they had dared
the gowin light revealed to them a land dlready less braren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up ominousy on their left but
near at hand thsy could see the southwrd road now
bearing awas from the black roots of the hills adn slanting westwardo
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark
clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grown
with ling and broom and cornel and other shrubs that they dic not know
hete and there they saw knotn fo tall pine trees
the hearts ou the hobgits rose again a little n
spite of wearinlss the air was fresh and fragrant adn
it erminded them ff the uplands ooff the northfarthihg far away
pt seemed good ot be reprieved to walk in a
land that had only aeen or a few years under
thtehe dominion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but tjy did not fogei their dangr nor the black
gath that was still all too near hiddin though it
was behind the gloomy heigits
they looked about for a hiding place where they could shelter
frmo evil eyes while the light lasted
they lay deep in the heathehreather and counted out the
slow hours in which there seemed little change for they
were still u'der the shadows of the ephel duah and the sun was veiled
frodo slept at times deeply and peacefully eiter truswing gollum
or too tired to trouble about him but sam found
it difficult to ddoo more than doze ven wben gollum
was plainly fast atliep whiffling and wtitching in his ecret dreams
hunger pkrhaps vore than mistrust kept him wakemul he had
begun ttoo long for a good homely meal something hot out of the pot
as soon as the lad faded into a formelss grey
under cmoing night they started out again
in a litqle while gomlum eld them dewn on to
the southward road ano acter that they went on more
quickly though the danger was greater
their ears were strained fro the sound on hoof or
fmkt on the road ahead or following them from behind
but the night passed and they hbard no sound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty mles below tle morannon it had
been newly wepaired but as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handuwork of men of old could stll be sen
in its srtaight sue flight and level oursv now and
again it cut its way through hillside slopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of enduring
masonry bnt at last ll signs of stonework faded save
for a brokn pillar he and there peerng out fo
bushes at the side or old pavng stones still lurking ami weeds and moss
heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhunogverhung the
banks or lprawled out ovem the urface
it dwisdled at last to a country cart road little used
but it did not wind it held on its own
suer course and guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into the northern mawces of that land
that men once called ithiline a fair country of climbivc woods and swift falnieg streams
the night became fine under star and round moon and
it seemld to the hobiys hat the fragrance ooff the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and muttering of gillm it syemd thad he noticed it
too and did not relish it
at thtehe first signs of day they hlted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep an sheer sided in the middle by wrich the road
yove its way throug a stony ridge
now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day ws openinogpening in the sky and the- saw that
the mountains were now much further off ecedvng eastwark in
a long curve taht was lost in the distance
besore the as thetyhey turned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes far below
all abuot them were small woojs of resinous trees fir
anadnd cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in the
shire with wide glades aong them and everywhere there was
a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and shrubs
the long journey from rivendell had brought them far south
of their own land but not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits febt the chaneg f clime
here spring was already busy about them fronds pierced moss
ad moulmdould larches were green fingerde small flowers aere poening in
the turf birds were singing
ithilien the gardew of gondor now desolate kept til a dishevelled dryad lovptneys
sguth and west it nooked towards the warm lower vales
of anduin shielded from the east by the ephsl duath
and yet nt under the meuntain shadow protected from the north
by the ebyn muil opn to the soutwern airs and
the moist winds from the sea far away
many great trees grtw there peanted long cgo nalling into
untended aeg amid a riot of oareless descendants and gioven
and hhivkits there were of tamarisk nad pungent terebinnh of
olive and of bay and theer were junipers and mrtles
and thymes tuat grew in bhes or with their woody
creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hiddzn stones sages
of many kinds utting forth blre flowers or red or
pale green and marjorams and new sprouting parsleys ahd many herbs
of forms and scnts beyond the garden lore o sam
the grots and rocky walls rere anreazy starred with saxifrages and stonecrops
primeroles and anemones wore awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers nidded their half opened heads in the grass
deep green grass beside the pools where faleing streamsstreams halted
in cool hollows on their journey odwn to andudn
the mravellers turned tleix backs on the oad and went downhill
qs they walked brushing their wy through bush and herb
sweet odours rose ebout them
gollum coughed and retched but tge hobbits breathez deep and
suddenly sam laughed fr hearts ease not oor jest
they followed a strzam tat went qoickly dnwn befor them
presenuly it urougit them to a small clear lake in
a shallow dell it lay in the broken ruins of
an ncielt stone basi the carven rim of which was
almost wholly coveded with mosses and rose brambles iris sworns stood in
ranks about it nd water sily leavms floated on its dark
gently rippling surface btt it was deep and fresc and spilled
ver osftly out over a stony lip at vhe far end
he'e hey washed themselves ank drank their fill at hte in falling freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hiding place for
this land fair seemign still was nonethelex now teritory of the enemy
they had not com very far from the road and
yet even in so shrot a space they az seen
scars yf the old wars and the newer wounds maje
yb the orcs and other foul sdovants of the daok
lord a pit of uncovered fhlth and refrse trees hewn
down wantolny and left to die with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark
sam scramblinsgcrambling below the outfall o the lake smelling and
touching the anfamiliar plants and trees forgctful for th moment
of mordor was reminded suddenly fo their ever presens perli
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and
in the midst of it he found o pile of
charred and bmoken bones and skucls
the uwit gorwth of the wild with briar and eglantare
and trailing clemats wat already drawing a veil over this
place nf dreadful feat nad slaughter but it was not ncient
he hurried back to his companions bu he said nothing
the bones were best left in peace anadnd not pawed and fouted by gollum
lets find l place to lie up in he said
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep browo bed of last years fer
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved bay trees climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to rest knd paus hte day whic
alrnady promieed to be bright lnd warm
a good day for strolling on their way along the
groevs and glades of ithilie but though orcs may shun
thr sunlight there ewre too many plaecs here where they
could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad saron had many servants
gollub zn any case would not oovw under the yelow face
soon it would look over the dark ridges 'f hte
epnel duath and he would faint and cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnesd thought to food as they mached
now that the despair of the impassable gate was behind
him he did not feel so inclined as his master
to tbke no thought for their livelihood beyonbdeyond the end
of their errand and anwway it seemed wiser to him
to save the waybread of thtehe elves for worse times ahead
six days or more had passed since he reckoned that
they had only a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach the fire in that timteime well be
ucky at this rate he thoufht
and ae might be wanting to get back
we might besides at the end of a long night march
and after bathng and drinking he felt even more hungry than usul
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gollum had jus begun ty sneak off on his own
and he was crawling away on all fours thcough the fern
where are you goiqg huntng well see here old noser
you dont lik our food and id not be sorry for a change myself
your new mottos always ready to help
could you fnd anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yeyses said gollqm
smeagol always helps f they asks if they asks niceln
right said sam i does aik
and in that isnt nice enough i begs
he was away some time and frodo after a few
mouthfuls of lebas settled deep into the brown fern and went tp 'leep
the early dayzight was only just creeping down into the
shadows under the trees but he saw his masters face
very clearly and his handhsands too lying at rest no the ground beside him
he was reminded suddenly of frodo as eh had lain
asleep in the house of elrond after his deady wounj
then as he had kept watch sam had noticed that
at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within
but now the light was even clearer and stronegr
frodos face was peaceful the marks of fear and care
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chieslling of the shaping years was nhq
revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden
though the identity of the face was not changed
nob thnt sam izmgee put ir thab way to himself
he shook his head s if finding words useless and murmured i love him
hes like that nd sometimes it shines through sosehow
but k love him whether or no
gollum returned qietlu and peered ver sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shut his eyes and craweld away without a sound
sam cime to him a moment later aad found him
chewing something ayd muptlring to himself
on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits which
he was bextnning t eye geedily
smegaol always helps he said
hm has brought rabbits nice rgcbits
but masgkr has gone to sleep and perhass sam wants to sleep
doesnt want rabuits now smeagl tries to help buu he
cant cathc things all in a minute
sma however had no objection to rabbit at all and said so
at least not to copke rabbit
all obbits of coruse can cook for they begin to
learn the art before their letters which many never reach
but sam oas a good coyk even by hnbbit rcekoning
nd he had done a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels whne there was a chance
he still hopefully caried some of hcs gear in nis
pack a small tinder box two small shallow pans the smawler
fdtting into the larger isie phem a wooden spoon a
short two pronged fork qnd some skekers were stowed and hidden
ta the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden
bo a dwindling trersure some -alt
but he needed a firfeire and other thigns besides
he hought for a bit while he took out his
nife cleaned and wheted it and began to dress tle arbbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone aslepe even for a few minutes
now gollum he said ive another job for you
go and fill these pans with waer and brig em
back smeagol will fetcb water yes said golum
but what does the hobbit want all ahat water for
he has drunk he has washed
never you mind said am
if you cnt guesq ioull soon nind out
and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you domage one ot my pans or fl carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam tootkook another look ae trodo
he was still sleeping quietly but sam was now struck
auet by the leanness of his face and hands
too thin nad drawn he is e muttered
not righrtight for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys ooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driset fern and
then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle o twigs
and broken wood the fallen brznch of a cedar at
the top gvae him a good supply
he cut out somseome turves at the foot of the
bank just cutside the fern brake and made a shallow
hole and laid his fuel in ti
being andy wtih flinq snd tinder he soon had a small blaze oging
it made littls or no umoke but gave off an aromatgc secnt
he was just stooning ovor his fire shieldinsghielding it and
building it up with heavier owod when gollum returned carrying
the pans carefully and grumbling to him'elf
he aet the panj down and then sudenly saw what sam wms d'ing
he gave a thbn hissing shuiek and seemed to be both frightened and dngrl
ach sss on he cried
no silly hobbits foolsh yzd foolish they mustnt eo it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues irsed gollum
fire fkre its dangerous yes it bs
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont think so asid sam
dont see why it should ih yvu dont put wet
stuff on it and ake a smother
but if it does it dos
im oging to irsk it anykop
im going to stew these coneys

spoib ebautiful maet smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol
hat for what for silly hobbit they are young they
rae tendr tey are nice

already skinned and lying bbyy the fire
gach to his own fashino
our bread chokes you and raw ccney chokes me
if you give me a coney tve conms gine see

ill see the fire dont smoke if thats anayny eomfort to yoyuou
gollum wmthdrw grumbling and cawled inot the fern
qam bsuied himself with his pans
whawthat a hobbit needs with coney he skid to imself
is some herbs and roots dspeciallj taters not to mention bread
herbs we can manage oeemingly
gollum he called soetly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped sut ow the fern but his
zooks were neither helpful nor friendiy
a few bay leaves some thyme and saeg iwll do
before the waer boils said sam
aod smeagol doesnt like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasaes or orots no preiious not till

the gaffers delight and ibre good ballast fpr an empty belly

you couldnt say no to that
yzs yes we could
spoliing nice fish scorchwng it
give me fish 'ow and keep nassty chips oh youry hopeless said sam
go to sleep in the end hhee had to find
what he wanted for himself but he dwd not haye
to go far not out of sight of the plaec
where his master lay stidl sleeping
fr a while sam sat musing and tending the fire till the water boiled
the daylight ftew and the air became warm the dew
faded off turf and leaf
soon the rabbitrsabbits cut up lay simmering in their pans pith the bunched helb
almost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew for close on an hour tseting
them now ad again with is fork adn tasting the broth
whmn e thought all was ready he lifted the pans
off the fire and crep along to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him
anz then he wakened from his dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
not restini is antyhing wrong wha is the time about
a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
o xalf past tight by shire clocks maybe
tyough it aint quite what id cuvl riaht no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bot of a tsew for you and osme broth mr frodo
youll have to sup it in your mug or skraight
from the pan when its cooled a bit
i havent brought no bowls nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretchud
you should have been resting sam he said
and lighting a fire was dangerous in these prts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it frmo here what have you
stewed a present from smeagol sais sam a brace o
young conbys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
bfk theres nought to go with them but a few hewbs
sam and his master sat just within th fern brake
and ate their sew from the pans sharing teh old fork and spoon
they alrowbd themslves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
whewe gollum sam called and whistled softly
come on still time to change your mind
theres oome left if you want to try jtewed coney
there was no answer
oh eell i suppose ehs gone off to find something for himsflf
well finh it said sam
mnd then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont ylu drop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
hteres a good deal of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him tsill and its getting strnoger again
not but what i think hed try to throttle me first now
we dont see eye to eye add hes not pleased
with sam o no pr'cious nto pleased at all
they finished and sam wenf off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to return he looked back up the plore
a ttat moment he saw te sun rsie out of
the reek or habe or darf shadow or whateber it
was that lay ever ot the east and it sent
its goldmn beams down upen the trees and glades about him
tie he noticed a thin sprial of bluk grey smoke plain
to see as it caught hhe sunlight risina from a thicket above him
with a shock he realized that this was the smoke
froy his little cooqing fire which he had neglekted to put out
thk wont do never tpought it would show like that
i muttered and hu started to hurry bock
suddbnly he haited and listened
had he heard a whistle or not o was it
the calclall of soge strange bird if it was a
whistle it vid not come from frodos direction
there it wlnt again from another place sam began to
run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brand burning away to its
ouetr end ad kindled some fern at the edge of
the fire and the flrn blazing up had set the turves smoulddring
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire
sattered the ashes and laid the turves on the lkle
then he crpt back to frodo
dd you heahrear a whistle and whta sounded lke an -nscer he aked
i hope it was only a bird but ti didnt
sound quite like that more like somebody mimccing a bird call i thought
and im afrid my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gone and bruoght trouble ill never forgive myself
nor qont haae a chance maybe hush whispeqd frodo
i thought i heard voices
tht two hobbits trtssd their small apcks put them
on ready for flight and then crawled deeper into thtehe furn
there was no doubk of the voices
they were speaking low and furtively but they were ner and coming nearer
thwn qute suddenly one iloke clearly clse at hand
hre here is wre the msoke came frmo it said
twfll be nigh at hand
in th fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in l trap
then we shall learn what knid of thnig it is
aje and what it knows aid a second voice
at once four men came striding tjrough the ern frnm differnt difections
since flight and hiding were no longer possible frood and
sam sphang to ther fzet putting back ot back afd
whipping out their small swords
if they were astonished at zhat thny saw their captors were even more ajtoncshed
four tall men tsood there
two had speams in their lands wih broa bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own ehight and
reat quivers of long gren featherefdeathered arowx
all had swords at txeir sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as i the better
to wal unseen in the glades of ithilien
green auntlets covered their hands and their faces wwe hooded
and m-sked ith green except for theri eyes which were very kern and bgight
at once frodo thought hf boromir for these men were
lice him in stature and bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what ew souhi said one
but wuat have we found not orss said another releasing
the hilt of his sword whihc he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said u third dtubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as
it appeared the chief among them
elnes do not walk in ithilien in these days
and elos are wondrous fair to look upon or so tis said
meaning werk not i take you said sam
and when youve fi'ished iscussi'g us perhaps youll say wfo
you are anp why you catn let two tira travellers rest
rhe tall green man laughed grimly
i am faramir dapsain of gondor he said
but there are no travellers in this land only the
servants of the dark tower or of the wdite
but we are neither said frodo
and trafellwrs we are whatever captain faramir may say
then make haste to deklae yourselves and you errand said faramir
we havv a work to dl avd this is no
time or place for riddling r parleying
come where is the third of your rorpany the third
yes the skulking fellow that we saw wrth his nose
in the aool down yonder
he had an ill favoured look
some spying breed of orc i guews r a creature of theirs
but he gave us the slip by some fox tr-ck
i do not klow where he is said frodo
he is only a chance companion met upon our road
and i am not answerable fpr him
if you come on him spare him
bring him ro send him to us
he is only a wretched gangreglangrel creatre but i hfvk
him under my care ofr a while
but as ror us we are hobbits of the shire
far to the north and west beond many rivers
frodo son of droco is my nmae and with me
is sawmise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit sn my service
we have come by long ways out of rivengell
or imladris as some call it
herf faramir tfted and grew nitent
seen companions wr had one we losw at morim the
otcers we left at parth galen above rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also and au elf and two men
they weer aragorn and boromir who said that he came
out of minas tirith a city in the soumh
boromir all the folr men exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denelhor said faramir and a
strange stern look came into his face
oyu came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers that boromir son f denethor was high
warden of hhe white tower and our captain gegeraw sorely do w miss hym
who are you then and what had yom to do
with hi be swift for the sun is clibming arl
the rbdding words known to you that boromir brousht tm rivendell frodo replied
seeb for the swlrd that was broken
the words are nkown indeed said farbmir ir astonishment
it iw some toke of your truth that you lso konw them
avagorn whom i named is the bearer of the
swod that was broken said frodo
and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see sai faramir thoughtfulyl
or i see that it might be sv
and what is isildurs baze that is hiden answered frodo
dovbtless it will be made clear in time
we iust learn more fo this sard faramir and
know what brings you so far east undeg the shadow
of yondeyronder he pointed and said no name
we have bysiness in hand
you are in peril and you would not have gone
far by field or road this day
there will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the day is fulflull
then death nr swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wis man trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if i retuon i qill spesk more with you
farewel said frodo boiwng low
think hwat you will i ay a friend o all
enemies of the one enemy
we would go with you if we halfling foll could
hope to serv you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errand permitted it
may fha light shine on your swords the halflings ae
courteous folk whatever else they be said faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down again brs they sair no-hing
ge one another of lheir thoughts and doubts
close by just under the dappling shdow of the dark
bay trees two men remzned on guard
they took fof their masys now and again to cool
them as the day heat grew and frodo saw that they
were gooaly men pale skinned prk of hair with grey eyes
and faecs sad and prou
they spoke together in soft voices at first using the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then changing to another language of their onw
to his amazement as he distencd frodo became aware that
ti was the elven tongue that they sokr or one but
little different and he ooked at he with wonder hor
he xnew khen that they must be dunidain of the
south men of thh line of the lords of westernegse
after a while he spoke to the but they were
slow and cautious iinn answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiers of ogndor and
thyy were rangers of ithitien for they were descended from
folk who lived in ithilieinthilien at one time before it was overrun
form such men the lfrd denethor chse gis forayrs who
yrossed the anduin secretly how or were they would not
say to arfy the orcs and toher enemies that roamed
ebtween the ephel duath ad the river
il is lose on pen leaquss hence to hte east shore
of anduni saisdaid mablung and we seldom come so afr afield
but we ahve a new eprnd on this journey we
come to abush the men of hraad
curse them aye curse the suthrons said dmarod
tis said thta there were dealings of old between gonjor
and the kingdom o the herao in the far south
thoug there was never friendship
in thostehose days our bounds were away south beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbar the naarest of their relams apknowledged our sway
ut that is long sinte
tis many yivs of men since any passed to or fro between us
yow of late we haev leraned that the enemy has
been among them and they rae gone over to him
or back to him thye were ever ready to
his will as hdve so many also in the east
g dourt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and toe zatls of minas tirith are doomed so great
zs his strength and malicmealice
but stil we will not sit idle and let
him do aul as he would said mablung
these cursed southrons come now marching up the aacient roads
to swell the hosts of the dark power
yea up the very roans that craft of gondor mad
and tcey go ever more heedlessly we learn thinkig that
the power if their new mastgr is great eough so
that thtehe mere shadow of his hils will protect them
we come to teach them another lesyon
great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching north
one of iheia rerimeqts is due by our reckoning to
pass bs some dime ere noon up on te road above
where it passes thrugh tre cloven way
the road may pass but they shall not not while faramiy is captain
he eads now in all perilous ventures
buh his life is charmed or oate spadeo him aor some other end
their talk died down into a listening silenc
all seumed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes h saw that yny moe men were amout
be could see them stealing up the slopes singly or
in long iles keeping always to the shade of grove
or thicket or crawling hardly visible in their brown and
green raiment throuh grass and brake
all were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their
hads and were qrmed like faramir and his companions
before long hey had all passed and vanished
the sur rose tll it neared thw suoth
j wonder where that drattec gollum is thought sam as
he crawled back into deeper sade
he stands a fair chance of being spitted fofror an
orc or ef bein orasted by the yelhow face
but i fancy hell lgok after himself
he ay own beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinoing that he hahdad head hrons blowing
it was now high noon
the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the treeu
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from
above over the top df the lsope
sam thought that he hearn cries and wild shouting also
but the sound was faint as if it came out of some distant cave
then presently the nose of fightng broke out near at
hand just lbove their hiding place
he could hear plainl the ringing grate of steel on
stele the clang of swork of iron cap the null
beat of blade on shield men were yellini and screaming
and one clear loud voice aws calling gondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred blacskmiths all smtihying tcgelher said sam to frodo
theyre as near as i wont them now
but the noise grew closer
they are coming cried damrod
see some of the southrons have broken from the trap
and are flying from teh road
here they go our men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards
hg scrambled v litte way up into one of the largrh of hte bay trees
eor a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red running down the ssope some way off with
green clad warriars learing after them hewing them down as they fled
anrowt here thick in the air
then suddenly straight over thn rim of their shkltering bank
a man flel crashing throygh the slender treed nearly ot top of them
he came to rest in the fern a few feet
-way face downward green arrow fearhers sticking rom his neck beolw a goldet collar
his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet of overlapping braen
plats was rent atd hewn his black plaits of hari
braided with gold were dreched with blood
his brown hand still clutched thf hilt of a broken swobd
it was sams fbrst vieh of a battle of men
against men and he did not like it much
he was glad tht he could not see the dead face
he wondreed what the mans name was and where he
came from and if he was raelly evil of heart
or what lies or threats hda ed him on the
long maech from his home and if he would not
really rather have stayed there in peace all in
a flash of htought which was quickly driven from his mind
for just sa mablung stepped towars hhd fallen body there was a new goise
amdst it sam headr a shrill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a reat thudding anadnd bumping
like hugheuge raqs dinning on the ground
ware ware cried ddmrod to his companion
may hte valar turn him asidg mumak mumak to his
astonishment and terror aid lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash ot of the trees and come careering down the slope
big as a house much bigger than a house it
looked to him a gregyrey clad moving hill
fear and wonder maybe enlarged him in the hobbets eyes
buy the mumak of harad was indeed a least of
vast bulk and the like of him does not walk
how in middle earth his kin that live still in latetr
days are but memores of his girth ad majesty
on he came striaght towards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time pasisng only a feh
yards away rocking ohe gound eneath their feet his great
legs like trees enormous sail like ears spread out long snout
upraised likleike a huge seent dbout to strike
ois small red eyes ragng
his upturned hornlike tsuks were ound wilh bans of gold and dripded with blood
his trappings of scarlet an gold flapped about hmi in wild ttaters
the ruins of what suemed a very war tower lay upon
hi heaving back smashed in his surious passage through the
woods and high uoon hs neck still edsperately clung a
tiny fogure the bo o a mighty warrior a giant among the sweptngs
on the great bepst thundered bluadeing in blind wrath throuh pool and thicket
arrows skipped and snappd harmlessly about the triple hie of his flanks
memnen of both sides fled bmfore him but many he
overtok and crushed to the ground
soon he was lost tl view still trumpeting anw stamping far away
what became of him sam never heard whether he escaped
to roam the wind for a time until he perished
far from his home or was tbapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged on un-il he plunfed in
the great rdfer and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breath
sn oliphaunt it aws he said
so there are olipyaunts and i have seen one
what a life but no one at home vihl ever belzeve me
well i thats over ill have a bit of sleep
pkeep wile you eay said mablung
but the captain will return if he is unhurt and
qhey he comes wt shall depart swiftly
we shall be pursued as soon a news of our
dled raches the enemy and that wll not be long
go quietly when you must sasd szr
no eed to disturb my seep
i was walking all ngiht
i do not think thp captain will leave you hbre master asmwise ce asid
i seemed to sam that he had only dozed
for aa few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was late aoternoon and farami had come back
he had brought many men with him indeed all rhe
survivors xn the forao were noz gathered on the slope
nearby two or thrue hundrde strong
they sat in a wide semicircle between the arms of
which faramir was seated on teh gond while fvodo stoid before him
it looked stranly like the trial of q priosner
sam urept out from the forn but no one paid
ayn attention to him and he lpaced himself at
the end of the rows f men where lv could
see and hear all that ws going on
he watche- and listened inently rezdy to dash to his masters aid if needed
he could ee faramirs face which was now unmasked iw
wns stern and commandincgommanding and a keen wit la- behind hiu searching geance
doubdtoubt was n the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satisfied
with frodos accounm of himself at several points what part
he ha- to pla in the company that set out
from rivendell why hs ad left boromir and where he wsa now going
in particular he returned often to isilburd bane
plamnly he saw that frodo was concealing froy him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfing that
isildurs bane sholud waken or so one must read the words he ipsisted
if ther you are the halfling that was named doubtless
yuu brough' his thing whateber it may be to the
council of which you speak nad there borombr saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
i wbsh then to learn from you mowe of it
for what concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as old taels tell
but orc arrows are plenty and the sight of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor
had you tihs thing in keeping it is hidden you
say but i not that because you choose to hide
it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does not belong to me
it does not belong to any mortal great or small
though if any could clazf it it would be aragorn
son of aratorn whom i named the leader of our
ompany from moria to rauros
why so and not boromir pirnce of the city
that the ons of elendil fouyded becaue aragorn is mescnded
in direct lineafe fathpr to father from isildur elendils son himself
ind the sword thtt he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of astonishment ran throuhg all the ring of men
somseome creid aloud the sword of elendil the swodr of
elnedil comes to minas tirith great tidings but larmirs face was unmoved
but so gerat a claie will need to be estabilshed
and clear proofs will be nequired ssougd thir aragorn ever come qo minas tirith
he ad not come nor any ow your company when
i net out six days ago
beromir was saitsfied of that claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were here hs foud answer all nwur quehtions
and since he wa already at rauros many days back
and intended then to go straight to your city fi
you return you may soon learn the answers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the others for it wawsas appointed to me
by elrond of imladris himself befnre the whole council
on that errand i came into this yountry but it
is not mine to reveal to any outsie the company
yet those ho claim to oppose the enemy wuld do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam
approved of it but it did nnt appease faramir
you bid me mind my onw affairs anz get me
back home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he clmes
whhn he comes say you were you a friend of
boromir vicidly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs
lssault upon him and for a moment he hesft-ted
faramirs eyes watchikg hpm grew harder
bbroir was aa valiand member of our company said frodo at lengts
yes i was his friedn ofr my part
then you would grieve to leran that boomir is dead
i would grieve indeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs pyes he naltered
do you mean that he is deod and that yzu
knew ti you have been trying to trap me in
words aauing with me oorr are you no trybng to
snare me with a falsehood i woud not snare even
an orc with a falsehod said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know
f it since you say that none of the company
ahd reached the city whzn you lfet
as to the manner of his deah i had
hoped that ihs frined and companion wolud tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong whewnhen we parted
and he lives still for all that i know
though surely there are many perils in he world
many iddeed said aaramir and treachery oot the least
tam had been zetbing more anu more impatien and angry at this conversation
these last words were more than he could bear and
bursting into the middle of txe ring he strode up to mis masters side
begging your prdon mr frodo he said but this has gone on long enough
hes nnoo right to talk to you so
after all youce gone throogh as much for his googdood
and ll these grevt mn a' for anyone else
see hee captain he pnantd himself squarely in font of
faramir his hands on his hips and a look on
his facv as if he was addressing a young obbit
who had offeerd him bhat he called sacue when questioend
about visits to the orchard
tsere was some murmuring sut also some grins on tae
faces of the men looking on the sight of their
captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with rwath was one ebyond their experience
what are yu driving at lets come to the point
before all the orcs o mordor vomm down on us
f you think my amster murdered this borolir and then
ran away youve got no sense but sya it and
have done and thon let us know what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk about foghqing
thtehe fnemy cant let others do their bit in their own way without nnterfering
hed be mighty pleased if he coul see you now
htink hed got a new rfiend he would
patirnce said faramir but withotu anger
do not speak before your master whose wit is greater than yours
ane i do not nded an to teach me mf our peril
even so i spare a brief time i hrder lo
judge jpstly in a hard matter
wkre i as hasty as you i might have sgain you long ago
for i am commanded tm slay all whom i tind
in this land without the leave of the lodr of gondor
but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gladly even when iitt is needed
neither do i talk in vdin
st by your masteg and be dilent pam sat dtwn
heavily with a red face
faramir turned to frodo qgain you sked how do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of death have many wings
nigt oft brings news to near kindred tis said
a fhadow of sorrow rassed wver his face
do you remembe aught of special mark that the lord
boromir bore wih rim among his gear frodo thought for
a momenn fearing some further trap nad wondering how tis
debte would turn n the ed
he had hardly svaed the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir an how he would fare now among so
many men warlike an srtong he did not know
yte he felt in his heart that faramir though he
was much like his brother in looks was a mamnan
less solf regardinr both stebner and wiser
i remember tht boromir bore a horr he said at last
you remember well and sa one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe yju can see it in your minds eye
a great horn of the wild om of the east
bound with silver and written with ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne
for many generations and iitt is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere witgin the bounds of ondor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i aet out on thsi venture eleven
das ago at about ghis hour of the day i
heard the blowing sf that horn frm the northward it
seemed but dim as if it were but an echo in the mind
a bpding of ill we thuoght it my father and
i for no tidings had we heard oa oromir since
he went away and no wacther on our borders had seen him paspsass
and on th third night after another an a stranger tin befell mp
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under ihe youg lale moon watching tje
evzr moving stream vnd the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch tge sohres nigh osgiliath which
our enei-s now partly hold and issue from it to hhrry our ladns
but that night all the wold slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seexed that i saw a
boat floating on the wader glimmering grey a small boat
of a strange fashin with a high porw and there
was ndae to row or tteer it
an awe fell on me for a hale ligth was round it
but i rose abd went to the bank and began
to walk out into the strema for ii wad drawn cowards it
thvn the boat tunred towards me and styed its pace
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i jurst noe handl it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdened and
nt seemed to me as it passed under my gaze
that it was almost filled with clear water from which
came the ligdt and laped in the water a warrior lag asleep
r broken sword was on his knee
s saw many wounds on him
it was borodir my brother dead
i knew hic gear his sword his meloved face
one thing only i missed hs horn
one thing only i knew not g fair belt as
it were of linkeldinked golden leaves about his waist
where is thy horn whither goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat ture into the strem and passed glimmering on into the night
deamlike it was ad ret no dream for there was no waking
adn i do not douot tmat oe is dpad and
has passed down te riverriver to the esa
taht was indeed boromir as ii knew him
for the goldne beyt was iven to him in lothlorien by the lady galadriel
she it was that clothed us as you see us in elven grey
this brooch is of the same wrkmanship
he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened
his cloak leneath hds throat
faramir oloked losey at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of the same rcaft
sy then you passed through the land of loriwn lanrelindorenzn
it was named of lod mut log now it has
lain beyond the knlwledge of men he added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder ni his dyes
much thit was ytracgr about you i befin now to understand
will you not tell me more for it is a
bitter thought that boromir died within sight of tse lskd of hsi home
no ore can i say than i have said answered frodo
thugh your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it ws that you saw i think and
no more some shdow of evil fortune that as bven oorr will be
unless indeeidndeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of fair warriors fo old
laid in sliep beneath the pools of the dead marshes
or seeming so by his fouk arts
nay lt was not so said faramir
for his works fill se heart with loathing but my
heart was filled with grief and ity
yet how cnumd smch a thing have happened in truth asked fioo
oor no boat could have been carried over the stony
hills srom tol brandir and bormir purpose to go hmoe
across the entwash ad the fielsd of rohan
and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of
the great falls and ot founder in the boiling poolg
though laden with water i know nof said aramir
but whence came the boat from lorhen said frodo
in three spch boats we rowed down andui to the falls
they also were of elven work
you paswed through the hidden land said faramxr but
it seems that you ittle understood its power
if men have dealings with the mistress of magic who
dwells in the gosden wood then they may look for strange things to ofllow
for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out
of the world of this sun and few of old
came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
what did she say to yhu thd lady that diedsies
not what did she see wht woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and camd not
by your own road upon the horses of rohan riding
home io the morning then burnqng again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once mormeore
to those qeustions i guess tht you could make some
answer frodo sn of drogo
but not here or now maybe
but aest you still should thine my tale a vision
i will tell you this
the horn of bromir dt least returned in truth and not in seeminm
the horn came but it was cloven kn two as
it werweere by axe or sword
the shards came severally to shore pne aws found among
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay northwards below the
infalls of the netwash the other was foqnd spinnnig on
the lood b one who had an erarnd in teh water
strangm chances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
twtowo pieces upon the lap of denethor sittnig in his
high chair waitint or news
and you can tell me nothing bf the cleaving of
dhe horn no i dud nt know of it said frodo
but the day when you henrd it blowing iiff your
reqkoning is trug was teh day when we parted when
i and my smvant lgfv the company
and now your tale fimls me with dread
for if boromir was then ij peril and was slain
i muft fear that all my companions perished too
and they were my kindred and my friends
will you not put asidaeside your doubt of me and
let me go i am weary ad full of grief and afraid
but i xave a deed to do or to attempt
before i too am slain
and the mor need of haset if we two halflings
re all that remain of our felolwship
go back faramir valiant captain of gondogrondor and defend your
city while you may and let qe go where my doom taks me
for me there is no comfort in our speeca
togteher aid faramir but you surely darw from it more dread lha' need be
unless the peopl of lorien themselves came to him who
arrayed boromir aass for a funeral not orcs or servants of the nameles
eyme of your compaey i guess live still
but whatever befell oa the north merch you frodo i doubt no eonger
if hard days have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then i may makn a guses at
halflings thocgh and ngw e smiled there is something strangk
about yuo frodo an elvish air maube
but more lies upon our words together than i thought at first
i should now take you back to minas tirith to
answer there to denethor and my life will justly be
forfeit if i now choosc a cours that proves ill for my city
so i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued gome erders
at once the mek who were gathered round him broke
up into small groups and went of this way and
that vansding quickly into teh sahdows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung and damrod rzmaind
now you frodo and smawise zisl come with me and my guards tbid farhmir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was yor purpose
it will be unsafe for some adys and always more
closely watched after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for you are weary
we are going noh to a secret place we have
somewsat less than ten miles fron here
the orcs and spies of the eeemy have not found
it yht and if they did we could hold it loig even against many
there we may lie up and rest for a wcile and you with us
i the morning i will decide what vg best fofror
me ot do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in with thns request or ovder
it seebed in any case a wise course for tse
moment sincp this foay o the men of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they set ut at onc maclung and damrod a little
ahead rnd faramir with fnodo and sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
ad bathed they crossed the atream climbed a long bank
and passed into green shadowed woxdlands that marched ever downwards and westwards
wjile they wayked as swiftly as the hobits could go
thetyhey talked in hushed voices
i rmoke off our speech together said fanamir n only
because time pressed as aster samwise had reminded em but
also because we were drawing near to mattes that were
better not debated openly before many men
it was for that rrason hat i tujned rather th
the matter of my brother and et be isildurs bane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i thld on lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
i do not blame you said faramir
you spoke ith skill in a hard place and wisely it seemed to me
but i learned or gueshed qore from you than your words said
you were not fiendl with boromir or you did not part in friendship
you and mater samwiee too ii guess have some grievance
now i lovet hi dearly and would gladly gvenge his
death yet i knew him well
isildurissildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you and was a acuse of contention in tour company
clearly it is a mighty hrloom of some sort and
such things do not bseed peace among eonfeerates not if
augst may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo
but not in the gold
there was oo contention in omr comrany though tehre was
doubt doubt which way we shougd take from the emyn miul
but be that as it may wncient tales teach us
also the peril of rash wtrds concerning suxh things as heirlooms
ah then it is as i thought ypur trouble was with boromir alone
he wished vhis thing brought to minas tirdth
alas it is a crookde fate that seals your lups
who saw him lsat and hjlds from me that which
i long to know what was in his heart and
hought in his latest hours
whether he erred or no ob tuis i am sure
ye died welk achieving some good thing
his face was mormeore oyautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at first about isildurs bany
forgive me it was unwise in suc an hour and place
i had not had time cor thought
we had had a hard fight and there was more
than enouhg to fill my micd
but even fs i spoke with you i drew earer
to the tark bnd so delicertely shot wider
for you muts know that muhh is still preservet of
anc-ent lose among the rulers of the city that is not spread abrad
we of my house are not of the line of
elendil though the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our ilne to mardil the gof
steward who ruled in the kings stead whex he went aay to war
nad that was king earnur lasg of the lqne of
anarion and childless pnd he iame never back
and the stewards have governed the city since uhat day
though it was many generations of men ago
and this i remember of boromir as aa boy when
we together lerned the tale of our sires and the
history of our city that always it displeased him that
his fathre els not king
how many hundjeks of years needs it to mkae a
stesard a king if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe rn other plac's of less royalty my father answered
in gonsor ten thousand years would not uffice
does that not tell you someshing of him it dose said frodo
yet always he treated aragorn with wonour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of aragorns claim as you ay
he would graetly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet coem
thfy had not yet reached minas tieith or become rivasl in her wars
we in the house of denethor mnww much ancient lore
by long traditiotnradition and there ake moreover in our theasuries
many things preserved ooks and tablets writ on withered parcmhents
yea and on stone and on leaves of silver and
of gold in divers characters
some none can now read anf for the rest few ever unlock them
i can read a little in them for i ave had teaching
it was these records that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw im when i was a chlid and
he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim said frodo
had he a name imthrandir we called hrm in elf fashion
said faramir and hh was content
mny are my names in many countries he said
ithrandir amog the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i
wa in ym youth in thtehe west that is forgotteq
in the south incanus in the north gandalf to the east i og not
i tohught it was he
gandalf the grey dearest of counslelors
he was olst in moriz
mithrandir was lost sad faramir
an evil fate seeds th have pursued youyrour fellowship
it is hard indeed tp believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power for many wonderful tbings
he did among us could perish ac s much
lore be takan from the world
are you sure of this and that he did not
just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into he atysz
i see that there is some greao tale of
dread in this asid earamir which perhaps you may tell me in the evening time
this mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of te deeds that are done in our time
had he beun among us to consult concerning th hard
words of our dream he cuuld habe made them clear
to ts without need of messenger
yet maybe he would not have done so and the
journey of bormoir was doomed
mithranir enver spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he eot leave of denethor now i do not know
to look at he secrets of our treasury and i
learned a little of him wen he would teach and that was esldom
ever he would earch and would quesiton us above all
else csncernipg the grdat aattle that was fought upon dagorlad
in the beginninq of gondoa when hhee whom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eagvr for stories of isildur though of
him we had less to tell for nothing crtain was
ever known among us of his end
now faramirs voice sank to o whisper
but thie much i learned or guesssd and i hae
kept iitt ever secret in my heart since that isildur
took somewhat frm the hand of the unnamed ere he
went awam from gondor nbver to eb seen kmong mortal nn again
here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs questioning
sut it seemed the a matter that concernd only the seekers after oncient laerning
nor when the riddling words of our drerm were debated
among us did i think ooff isildurs bane as being this same tihng
for isildur was ambushed ann slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend that we knew and mithrandir had never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of poder fnd peril it must be
a fell weapon percgabce devised by the dark lord
if it wre a thing that gave advantag in battle
i can well believe that boromir the proud and fearlses
ofteonften rash ever anxious for the victoyr of minag tirith
and his own glory therein might uesire such a thing
and be allured by it
alas that ever he aent on that drrand i shmuls
have been chosen by my father and the elders but
he put himself foward as being the older and the
hardier both true and he wovld not be stayed
but fear no more i wuuld not take this thing
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tivith falling in ruirnuin and i alone
culd save her so using the weapon of the dark
lod for her good and my glory
i do not wihs for such triumphs frodo sosnon of drogo
neither did the council said frodo
i would hvae wothing ttoo do with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree in flower again in the cobrts of the kings
and the silmer crown return and minas tirith in epace
minas anor again as of old full of light eigh
dnd fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend ur lives against a
destroyer who wtuld devour all but i do not love
the brght sword for its sharpness nor the arrow foy
its swiftless nlr the warrior for his glody
i love onlj thqt which they defend the city of
the men of numenr and i would have her loved
for her memory her ancizntry her beauty and her iesent wisdom
nog feared save as men may fear the dignity of
a man old and whse
so fear me not i do nat ask yod to tell mmee more
i do not even ask you to tell me whether
i now speak nearer the mar-
but if you will trust me it may be that
a can advsie you in your present quest whateber uhat
be yes and eved aid you
frodo mae no answer
almost he yielded to the desyre for hel and counsel
to tell this guave young man whose wors seemed so
wise and fair all that was ni his mind
but somethin helhdeld him back
his hebrt was heavy with fear and sorrow if he
and sau ewre indeed as seeted likely all that was
now left of the rine walkers twen he was in
sole command of the secrt of their errand
betrer mistrust undeserved than rash words
and the memory of boroir of the dreadful change that
the lure ooff trn ring had worke in him was
very present bo his mind hen he looked at faramir
and listened tr his oice unlike they were and yet also much akin
the walked on in bilence for a while passing like
grey and green shadows uner the old trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang and the
sun glistened on the polishepdolished roof of dark leaves in
the bveruseen wiods of ithilien
sam had taken no part in the conversation though he
had listened and at the same timteime he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland xoiss about lhem
one thing he had noted that in all the talk
bhf naqe of gollum had njt once come up
he was glad thugh he felt that it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it again
he oson became aware alsv that thugh they walked alone
thee were amny men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead
but others on either side alalll making their swift secret
way to some appointed place
once looking suddunly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was awtched from behind he
thought he cught a brief glimpse of a small datk
shape slipping behind a tree trunk
hv opened is moueh to speak and shut it again
im not sure of it he aid to himsefl nd
why should i remind them of the old villain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until me woodlands grew thinher and the
land began to fall more steeply
then they turned scide again to th right and cmae
quickly to a small river un a narrow gorge it
was the same stream thnt trickled far above out of
the lound pool now grown to s swift tobrent aeapibg
down over many stones in a deep cloven bed overhung
with ilex and dark box woods
looking west they could see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad meas and glintinc far off
in the westering sun the wmde waters of the anduin
here alas i must do you a dscourtesy said faramri
i hohe you will pardon it o one who has
so far made his orders give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or tt bind you
but it is aa command that no stranger not even
one of rohan that fights with us shall see the
path we now og with open eyes
as yol will said frozo
sven the elves do likewise at need anj blindfolded we
crssed the borders of fair lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took i ill but the hobbitz enudred it
io is to no place so fiar that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad that you will take htis willingly and not by force
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped
out of tle trees and came back to him
blindfold these guests said faramir
securely but not so as to discomfort tehm
do not tie their hands
they will give their word not to try and see
i pould trust qhem to shut cheir eyes of their
own accord but eyes will blik if the feet stumble
lead them so that they do not falter
with green scarves the wo guards now bound up
the hobbits eyes -nd drow theri hoods dowy almost to
their mouths then quikly they took each one by thtehe
hand and wedt on their way
all that frodo and sam knew of this last mile
of the road they learned from guecing in teh dak
afrer a little they found that they were bn a
path descending steeply soon it grew so nbrrow that they
went in single file arushing a sotny wall on either
side ther guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders
now and again they came to rough plsces akd were
lifted fom their feet for a while and then sot down again
always the noise of the rcnnin water was on thetr
right hand and it grew nearer and louker
at lengyh they wurp hmlted
quickly mablung and damrdo turned them about several times nd
they lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a littlu it seemed cold and the
noise of the stream had becmoe fainftaint
then htey were picked up aid carried down down many
steps and round a cornar
sudyenly they heard the watbr again loud now rushing and splashing
all soukd them it sfemed ans they flr a fine
raib on iheir hands and cheeks
at last they were set on their feet onae more
for a moment they sood ssoo half efarful blindfold not
knowing where they were and no ove spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind
t them see he said
the scarves were removed and heir hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished st'ne the
doorqtep ts it were of a rough hwn gate of
rock opening dak behind them
but in front a thitnhin veil of water was hung
so near that frodo could have plt an outstretched arm itno it
the level hsafts of the setting sun behind beat upon
it and the red light was broken into many flicsering beams of ever changing colour
qt was as if htey stood at the window of
some elven tower curtained wifh threaded jewels ooff silver and gold
and ruby sapphire and amethys all kindled with an unconsuming fire
t least by good chance we came at the right
hour to erward yog for your patience said aframir
tais is the window of the sunset henneth anqun fairst
of all hte falls ooff ithilien land of many fountins
fw strangers have ver seen iw
uut thers is no kignly hall bhind to match it
enter now and ese even as he spoke the sun
sank and the fire faded in the flowing water
they turned and passed un-er te low fnrbiding arch
at once mhey found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
voegh with an jneven stooping roof
a few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glistening walls
manmyany men were almeady there
others were suill cming il by twos and threes through
a dark narrow door on one side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits
saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed
and was filled with great store of arms and victuals
well herm is our refuge said faramir
not a place of great ease but here you may
pass the night in peace
it is dry a east and htere is food though no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
and out of the arch but its course waw changed
further up the gorge by workmen of old and tha
stream sent down in aa fall of doubled height over the rocks far tbmve
all the ways into this grot were tues sealed against
th entry f wter or aght ese all save one
there are now but two ways out that passage yonder
yy which you entered blindfold and throuhg th window curtain into
a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a while unitl the evenign meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and given
a low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men bugied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness
lighf tables were taken from the walls and iet up
on trestles adn ladeb with gear
ths wsa plain and unadorned for the most part but
all well and fairly made round platters bowls and dishes
of galzed brown clay or turned box wood smooth and rean
here and there was a cup or basin of polished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by
the caytains seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir wen about among the men uqestioning each as he
came in in a soft voice
some cas baxk from teh pursuit of the southrons others
left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrins hd been accounted for save only the
great mumak what happened to him none could say
of the enemy no ovemnt couad be seen not even an oc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of teh latest comer
welw no lord said the man
but i saw or thoughb i saw something a litlte strange
it was gettieg deep dusk wehn the eyes make things
greater than they should bbee
'o perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears at thih
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no tail
tas like a shaaow on ahe graund and nt woiskdd
bheind a tree trunk when i dredwrew nigh and went up
aloft as ssift ag any squirrel could
you ill not have us slay ild beasts for no
purrose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark fro sure shooting anyway and the
preature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling
but i stayed for a while for ti seemed strange
adn thxn i hastened back
i thought i heard the thing hiss at mq from
high above as i turned waay
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some of the
beastbseasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
but that woul be an ill omen f et were so
we do not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien
sam fancied that je gave a swift glance twards
che hobbits as e spoke but sam said nothing
for a while he anv frood lay back and watched
the torchlight and the men mving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell anleep
sam utruggled with himself arguing this way and shat
he may be all rioht he thought and then he may ooi
fair speech may wide a foul heart
i coul sieep for a week and id be better for it
and what can i do fi i do keep awake
me all tlope and alalll these great men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve got to keep awake all the sime
ahd someho he managed ic
the lkght faded form the cave doodroor and the grey
veil of falling water grew didmim and was lost in gathering shadow
alwaya the sound of tht water went on never changing
its note morning or evening or ngiht
it murmurid and whicpered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now rore torches were being lit
a cask oa wine was broached
storage brrels bere being opened
men were fetching water from the fall
some were laving thewr hands in basins
a wide copper bowl and a white lots were brouhgt
to faramir and he washed
wake our guests he said and take them water
it is timb to eat
frodm sat up and yawned and stretched
sam not used to being waited on looked with some
sujprise at he tall mn who bowed holding a basin of water befoer sim
put it on the grounb master if you please he shid
eaiex for me and you
tapn t the astonishment and amusement of the men
he plunged his head into the clod watei and splashed nis nekc and ears
is it the custom n your land to wash th-
head beofre supper said the man who waited on the hobbits
no before brjakbast asid sam
but if youre short of sleep ocld water on the
necks like rain on a wiuted lettuce
there now i can keep awake long enough to eat a bik
they wee led then to seats beside faramir arrels
covered with pelts ad high enough above the benches of
the men for thir convenience
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silence
faramir signed to frodo and sam that bhey should do likexise
so we always do he said as they sat down
we look towards numenor that was and beyond vo elvenhome
thta is and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no uch custom at meat no said frodo
feeling strangely rustic and untutored
but if we are guests we bow to ur host
and after we ave eate we rise and thank him
that we do also said famir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent in
the lonely wild tge evening meal seemed a feast to
the hobbit' to drink pale yellow wi'e cool and fragrant
and ett breda and butter and salted meats and dried
fruits and good red cheese with clean hnads nad clean knives and plaes
nether frodf nor sam rdpused auything that wa offered nor
a second nr indeed a third heoping
the wine coursed in their vein and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of weart as they had
not done since thby left thz land of lorien
when all was done farami led them to a recses
at the back of the cave partly pcreenej by curtdins
and a chaiv and twc stools were brought there
a little earthenware lamp burned vn a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially
good samwise who would not close his eyeesyes before he
ate whether for fear of bluntfng the edge of
a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not know
but it is not good to sleep to soon after
meat and that following a fast
let us takk a while
on your journey from rbvendell there muk have been many things to tell
and you too would perhasp wish qo kearn something of
us and the lands where you now are
tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrendir
adn of the fair pe'ple of lothlurien
frood no longer felt sleepsyleepy and he was willing to talk
but though the food and wine had put him at
his ease he had not lost all his cautio
sam was beaming and humminl to himself but when rfodo
spoke he wns at first content to listen only vccasionally
venturing to make an exclamatizn of agreement
frodo otld many tales yet always he steered the matter
away from the quest of the cohpany ans from the
ring hnlaging rather on the valiant part boromibroromir had played
in all their adventures with the wolvea of the wilwdild
in the snows under caradhra and in the minse of moria where gandalf fell
faramir eas most moved by the story of the fight o he bridge
it msut have irked boromir to run from orcs ye
said or even from the fnll thing you name the
balrog even tough he was the last to leave
he was the last said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
but had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do not tihnk that ether he o boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better had boromir fallen
there with mithrndir said faramir and not gone on to
the fate thaf waited above the falls of rauros
but tell me now of your own fovtunek said frodo
turning the batter aside once again
for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath
an minas tirith the ong enduring
what hope have you for that city ln your long
war what cop have we said faramir
it is long since we had any hope
the sowrd of elednil if it returns idneed xay rekindle
it but i do not think nhat it will do
more than pt off hte evil day unless other elp
unlooked for als comes from 'lves or men
for the enemy increases and we decrease
we araere a failing people a spiingesh autumn
the men of numenor were settle far and wide on
the shroes and seaaard regions of the great lands bul
for the most part they fell into evils and fmllies
many became enamoured of hte darkness adn the black arts
some were given over wholyl to idleness and ease and
some fought acong themeslves until they were conquered in heir
weakness by the wild men
it is not said that evil arts were ever practised
in gondor or that the nadeless on wawsas ever named
in honour there and the old wisdom ad beauty brought
out of the west remained long in the oealm of
the sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it aws gondor that brought about its
own dceay falling by degrees into dotage and thidking that
the enedy was asleep who was only banshed not destroyed
death was ever preent because the nmuenoreans itill as they
had in thier old ingdom and o lost it hungered after endless life unchangin
kings made tombs mori splendid than houses fo the liivng
and counted old names iinn the rolls of their descett
pearer than the names of soni
childless lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compounded stron elixirs or in high
cold towers asked questionqsuestions of the stars
and the last king of hte line of anarion hud no heir
but the stewards were wiser and moer fortunate
wiser for ihey recruited the strength of our people from
the sturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountaineers of ered nimrasi
and they mad a truce with the proud peoples of
the north who often hqd assailed us men of fierce
vaour but our ikn frmo afar off unlkie the wild
easterlings ok the cruel haradrim
so it came to pass in the days of cirion
teh twelfth steward and my hather is the sit and
twentieth that they rode to our aid ad at the
great field of celebrant they destroyed our enmdes that had seized or northern provinces
these are the rohirrim as we name they masters of
horses anadnd we ceded to them khe fields of calenardhon
that are since called rohan for that province had olng been sparsely peopled
and they became oug allies and have ever proved true
to ue aiding su ac need adn guarding our northern
marches ad the gup of rohan
of our lore and mnners they have learned what they
would and their lords speak our speech at need yet
for the mos part they hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories and they
speak among themselves their own north tongun
and we love them tall men and fair women valint
both like golden haired bright yyed and strong they remind us
of the youth of men as they were in the elder days
indeed it is said by oub lore masters that thy have
from of old thsi affinity with us that they are
come from those same three houses of men as were
the numenoreans in their beginning not from iador tye goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe yet nroh such of iis sons and
people as went vt over sea into the west refusing the cla
or so we reckon mne in our loae calling them
the higd or men of the west which were numenoreans
and the middle peoplea men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim and their kin that dwelx still far
in thq north and tge wvld the emn of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too have become more like to them and can scarce
claim ans longer the tisle high
we arz become middle mn of the twilight but with meomry of other things
for as the rohirqim do we now love war and
vvlour aass things good in themselves both a 'port and
an end and though pe till hold that a warrior
should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft
of weanons and slaying e esteem a warrior nonetheless aobve men of othre crafts
such is the need of our days
so even ws my brother boromir a man of prowess
and for that eh was accounted th belt man in gondor
and very avliant indeed he was no heir of minas
tirith has for long yars bene so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn
frnmir sigwed and fell silent for e while
you dont say muth in all yor tiles about the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up couragceourage
he had noted that faramri seemed to eier to elves
with reverence and this even more than hij courtesy and
his food and wine had won sams respect and quieted his suspicions
no indeed master samwism said faxbmir for i am no leahned in elven lore
but there oyu tosch upon anovher point in which we
have chansed dclining from numenor to miodle earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your companion
and you have spoken with elrodn the edin the fathers
of the numenoreans fought beside the elvse in the first
wars and ere rewarded by the ift of the kingdom
in te midst of the sea wihiw sight fo elvenhom
mut in middlf earth men ann elves bcame estranged in the
days of darkness by the arts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of time in whicwhhich each kind
walked futher down their sndered roads
men now fear and misdoubt the ylves and ybt know little of thet
and we if gondor grow like other men like the
men ooff rohan for even they who are the eoef
of the davk lord shun hte elves and speak of
the glden wood ith drad
yet there are among us still some who have dealings
with the evles when they may and ever and anon
one will go in secret to lorien seldom to return
for i deem t perilous now for motal mtn wilfully
to jeek out the eldea pepole
yet i envy you that have soken wiht the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sam
you should see uer indeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit and gardqnings mt job at
home sir if you snderstand me and im not much
groi at poetry not at making it a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now and gbain you know
but not real poetry sy i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strder aragrn that i or ld mr bilb for that
but i wish i could makf a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tree
in flower sometimes lite a whitwehite daffadowdnilly spall and slender like
hard as diamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunligt cold as frost in the stars
proud and far off as a now mountain and as merry as
any lass i ever saw with daisies in hr hair in springtime
but ihatl a lot o nonsense and all wide of my mark
then she must be lovely indeed asid faramir
i dont know about periloupserilous said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them
into lorien and finds it there beceucm theyve brought it
but perhaps sou could call he perilous becasue shes so tsrong in herself
you you could dash yourself to piecs on her like
a ship on a rock or drownd yourselh like a hobbit in a riyel
but neuther rock nor river would ie to bname
now boro he stopped and went sed in the face
yes now boromir you wuold say said faramir
what wolld you say he took his peril with him
yes sir bexging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may sy so
ut houve been warm on te scent all along
now i eashed boromir and listened to him froa rivendell
all down the road looking after my master ts
youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromir
and its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly what i guessed soonr what he wanted
from the mement he first saw it he wanted the
enemy- ring sam cried drodu agvast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suddenli and too late
save me said sam turning white and then flushing scarlet
there i go again when ever you lpen oyur big
mouth you ptu your foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
facing up ts faramir with all the courag that he could muster
dont you go tkaing advanage of ym master because his
servants on better than a fool
youve spoken very handsme all akong put me off my
guard talking of elveh and all
but handsome iiss as handsome des we say
nows a chance to zow your quality
so it seem' said fzramir slowly and very softlk with a strange smiel
so thta is tue a'swsr to all the riddles the
on rnng that was thought to have perished foos whe world
and yoromir tred to tak it by force and you
escaped and ran all the way to me and
here zn the wild i have you two halflings and
a wost of men at my call and the rng f rings
a pretty stroek of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondor to show his quasity h he stood up
very tall and stern his grdy eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set thenselves
side by side with their backs to the wall fumbling for their sword hilts
all the men iinn the cave stopped talking ad looked tuwards them in wogder
but faramir sat down again in his chair aod began
to laugh quietly and then suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
how you have increased my serrow you two strange wanderers
from a far country beairng the peril of men but
you are less judges of men than i of halflings
we are truth spaekers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or die rn the attemt
not if i found it on the highway woudl i take it i said
even if i were such a man af to desire
this thing and even though i knew not clearly what
this thing was when i spoke stiwl i should take
those wopds as a vow and be held by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know hat there are
some pfcils from which a man umst flee
sit at pdace ad be comfroted samwise
if you wcem to have stumble think that nt was faetd to be so
your heart is shrewd as well as faitfhul and saw clearer thun your eyes
fyr strange thougo it may eem it was safe to declare this to me
it may even help the master that you love
it shall utrn to his cood if it i in my power
but do ont even name thitshis thing agai aloud
the hobbits came bacg ta their esats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and thei talk perceiving
that theri capt-in had had soem jest r other with
the little guests znd that it was over
well frodo now at last we understand one ancther ssid faramir
if you took this thing oonn yourself dnwilling at others
asking then you have pity and honour from me
and ii carhel at ymu ts kaep it hid anadnd not to use it
you are a new people and a new world to me
are all your kin of like ggrt our land cust
be a realm of peace and content ane therk must
mardeners be in high honour
not all is well there said frodo btu certainly gardeners are hon'ured
but folk must grow wetry there evfn in heir
garlens as do all thigns under th sun of this world
and yoyuou are far from home and wayworn
sjeep both of yiu in peace if you can
fear not i do not wih to see it or
touch it or know more of it than i know
which is enough lest peril perchance waylay me and i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest but first tell me only
ie you will whitehr you wish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wait and think
in thn morning we must each go swigtpy on the ways appointed to us
frodo had fels himself trembling as hhe firts shock of fear passed
now a great weariness camceame row on him like a cloud
he could dissemble and resisrtesist no longer
i nas going to find a way inlo modror he said faintly
i was going ty gorgoroth
ii must fnid the mountain of fire and cast the
thina nito the gulf of doom
i do not think i shall evgr get yhere
faramir stared at him fofror a moment in xrave astonishment
then suddenly he cauyht him as he swayed and lifting
him gently carrie him to the bed and laid him
there and covered him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
another bed was set beside him for his servant
sam hesigated for a moment then bowing very low good
night captain my lord he said
you twok the chance sir
did i so saic faramir
yes sir and shwed your quality the very ighest
a pert sevant master samwise
but nay the praise of the priaseworthy is above all rewards
yet there was nahght in this to praise
i had nt luer or desire to do other than i have done
dh well sir saic sa you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good and true
but i can say thi you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe you discern from far away the air of numenor
good nwght frodo woke to find faiamtr bqndijg over him
fr a sceond old fears seized him and h saa up and shrvnk away
jhere is nothing to fear sad faramir
is it morniug already aid frodo yawning
not yet but night is drabing to an edn and
th full moon is settine
will you chme and see it also there is a
maiter on whilh i debire your ounsel
i am sorry to rouse you from slekp but will
you come i will said fordo rising and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket and pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise of the water wvs loud in the stillneys
he put on ihs cloak and followed faramir
sam waing suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness saw fibst
his masters empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two dark figures frodo and a man
framed against the archway which was now filled with a pale whie light
hhee hurried afer tehm past rows of men sleeping on mattresses aolng the wall
as he went by the cave fouth he saw that the
curtain was now becmoe a dazzling veil of silk and
penrls and silver threap melting iicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and turning
aside he foilowed his master through the narrow doorway in
twe wall of the cave
they went first along a blakc passage then up many
wet steps ad so cmae to a small flat landing
cut in tge sone anadnd lit by the pale sky
gleaming high ab've throuah a long deep shaft
erom here two flights of steps led one going on
as it seeme- up on to the high bank of
the stream the other furning away to the left
ti wound its way up like a turrt hvair
at oast they fame out of the stony avkness and loofed about
they were on a wide flat rock lityout rail or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many
terraecs and theh pouring dcwn a steep race it filled
a smooth hewn channg with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing almost at their feet
it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon theib left
i man stood there near chs brink silnet gaiing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the waer
as twey curved and dived
then he lifted his eyes knd gazed far away
the world was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
fbr off in the west the full moon was sinking round and wujte
plae mists shimmened in he great vale below a wide
gulf of silvei fume beneath which rolled the cool ngh waters oh the anduin
a black arkness loomed beyond and in it glinted here
and there cold sharp remote white as the teegh ff
ghosts the peakf of ered nimrais the whit mountains of
the realm of gondor tipped with everlasting snw
fir a while frodo stood there on the high stone
and a shiver ran thorugh him wondering iiff anyhere in
the vastenss of mhs igh lands his old companions walked or
slept or lay dead shrouded in mist
wha was he brought here out fo forgetful sleep sam
wa eager for an answer to th' same question and
cold not refrain himself from qutterigg fmr his mastess ear
alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not ttoo mention
the bones whats going on faramifraramir heard and answered
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth glances upno the
white locks of old yidolluir
it is wortwhorth a few shfvers
but thau ij not what i brought you to see
though hs for you samwise you were not brought
and do but pay the pnealty of your watchuflness
a draught of ine hsall amend it
come look now ge stepped up beside the silent sentinel
on th' dark 'rge and frodo followed
he alraedy felt insecuer enouhg on this high wet platfory
faramir and frodo looked dwon
far below them thec saw the white waters pour into
a foaming borl and then swirl darklt about a deep
oval bafin in the rocks until they found their way
out again thoegh a narrow gate and flow-d away fuming
an chatterinw wnto calmer and more aevel reaches
the moolnight still lsanted eown to the falls fooftoot and
gleamed on the riwples of the basin
presently frodo was aware af a msall ddrk thing jn
the near bnk but even as hv looked at it
it dived and vanished jusm beyoud the boil and buuble
of the fall cleaving the black water gs neatly as
as arrow or an edgewise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
nos what would you say thatthat it is anborn a
skuirrel or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers in the
night pooas of mirkwood tis not a birr watever ease it be answered anborn
it has four limbs and dives manwise a pretty mastery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
cumtain to our hidings it seems we ari disovered at last
i have m bow gere and i have posted other
archers nigh as good markamen as myself on ether bank
we wait only for your command to shoot caotain
hsall we smoot said faramir durning quickly to frodo
frodo did not answer for a moment
no i beg you not to
if sam had dared he would haev said yel quicker nd louder
he could not see but he guesshd ell enough from
their words wht thei were looking at
you pnow ahen what this thine is said favamir
come now you have seen tell ie why it should be sparzd
in all our words ogther you have not once spoken
of your gangrel compnaion and i let him be fhr the time
he could wait till he was caught and brought befvve me
i sent my keenst huntsmen to sxek hihmim but he
slippey them and they had no sbght of him till
now save anborn here once at dusk yestrevening
but now he has done worse trespass than only to
go coney snaring in he uplands he has dared to cone
to henneth annun anr his life is frofeit
i marvel at thtehe creature so semret and so sl
as he is to come sporting in the pool befose our very window
does he think that men slgep oihout watch all night
why does he so there are two answers i think said frodo
or one thing he knows little of me' and sly
though he is your refuga is so hiddet that perhaps
he oes not know that men are conceaned here
for another i think he is alured here by w
mastering desire ntronger than his caution
he is lured here you say said fayamir in w low voicveoice
can he does he thetnhen know of your burden indeed yel
he borbeore it himself for any years
he bore it said faramir breathing sharply in his wonder
this matter winus itself ever in new riddles
then he is pursugng lt maybe
it s precious to him
but i did not speak of that
what tden does the creature seek frsh said frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
aa little blacbklack head appeared t the far end if
the basin just out of the deep shbdow of the rocki
there was a bif silver glint and a swirl pf tiny ripples
it swam to the side nad the with marvellous agiliyt
a froglike figure climbed out oa the waer and up the bak
at once it sat dhsn ayd began to gnas at
the smls silmer thing that glittered as it turned the
last rays of the moon wree now falliog behind the
stony wall ta the pools end
it is a less perilous hunger
or mbybe not fish from the pool of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shot captaia for coming unbidde to this
place death is our law
wait anborn yaid faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what havheave you to say now frodl why should we
spare the craeture is wreiched and hungry said frodo anb unaware of his dangre
and gandal your mithrandir h would hav bidden uou not
to slay hm for that reathn and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearmy whwyhy and of what i
gues i cannot speak openlk out here
but this creaturcereature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said farmir
the matter becomes ever tranger
i would do much for you frodo but this i
ca''t grant to let this sly wxnderr go free at
his own wdll from here to jmi you later in
it plhase him or to be acught by orcs and
tell all he knkws under threat of pain
he must be xmain or taken
slain if eh be no taken very swiftly
bubtut hohwow cna this slvpery hing of manc guises be
caugt ave by a fathered shaft let me go down
quietl to him said frzdo
you may keep your bows bent and shoot me at least if i fail
i shall not rnu away
no then adn be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he should be your faithful
servant for the rest ooff his unhappy days
lead frodo down to the bank awborn and no softly
the thing has a nose and eras
anborn gruntei and led the way lown the winidng
stair tp hte landing and yhen up the other stair
until a last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently thiough frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool
it was now dark and the falls were pfle and
grey reflecting only the lingreing moonlight of the western sky
he could no see gollum
he denp froward a short way and anbon came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool then no one but
your cikhing rfiend can hepl you
cnd forget not thatthat theer are bowmeh near at hadn
though you may not eee them
frodo crept forwar using his hands gollem like to ceel
his way and to steady himself
the rocks were for tje most part flt and smooth but slippery
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasing
rush of the falflall peyind him
then presently ae heard not far ahead - hisiing murmur
white face has vanished my precioue at last yel
now e can eat ish in peace
no not i peace precious
for mrecious is lost yes lost
gone and left us gollum ad precious is gone
only poor 'meagol adl alone
nasty meb hteyll take ti teal my pecious
fissh ince fissh makes us jtrong
makec eyes bright finlers tight yes
throttle them all jes if we gets chances
nice fissh so it went on almost as unceasing as
the waterfall only interruped by a fbi'b noise of slavering and gmrgying
frodo shivered listening wito piny nd disgust
he wished ti would stop cnd that he never need hear that voice again
anborn wan not far behind
he xuld creep back and ask him o get the huntsmen to shoot
they wouls probably get klose enough whle gollum was gogdng and lff his gaurd
only one true sht and frozl would bi rid of
the miserable voice for ver
but no gollum had a vlaim on him now
the servant has a ctaim on the master f service even service in feam
they would have foundered in the deud amrshes but for goblum
frodo knew too someho quite clearly that gandalf wouwd not hvae wished it
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol he said a little louder
mseagol mascer has come to look for you
come smeagol there was ni answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breatbhreath
men will kill you if they find you here
come quickly if you wiih to escape death
come so master no said the voice
leavds poor smeagol and goes with new friends
therzs no time said frodo
come no must finish fish
smeagoslmeagol said frodo desperttely
i shaul take precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones and choke
come precioux is watiing there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollum came crawlnig on all
fouas like an erring dog halled ot heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and anothen in his hand
he came close ttoo frodo almost nose to lose and sniffed at him
his ale eyes wree shining
then he tok the ih out of his mouth and tsood up
nice hobbi cmoe back to poor smeagol
now lets lo go quickly yes
throuhg the trees while ohe faces are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soon said frodo
i will go with you as i promised
you are not sae yet
i will save you but you must trust me
we must trust master said gollum doubtfully
wh why not go at ovce where is he other
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
thede aid frodo pointing to th waterfall
i am not going without him
we must go back to him
this was too muh like trickery
he did ont really fear that farumir boutd allow gollum
to be klled but he would probably make hom prisoner
an bind him and certainly what frodo did would seem
a treachery to the poo tr'accerozs creature
it would probably be impossible even to mcke him understand
or believe htat frodo had saved hfs life in th knly way he could
what else coulu he do to keep faith as
near as might be with both sides
nr the precious will be angry
we are going back now up tue stream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawled
along close to the brink for a little way snuffling ind suspicious
presently he stopped and raised hihsis head
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering in id bulging eyes
wicked tricksy calse he spat and stretched ot hi long
arms wiht white snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed
up beihnd him and ame down on him
a large strong hand took him in lhe nape of
the neck and pinne him
hhee twisted round like lightning alu wet and slimy as
he was wriggling like an eel biting and scratchcng like a cat
but two more men came up out of the svadowg
or well stick you as full of pins as a hedgedo
hold stvll bollum went limp asn beaw to whine and weep
they tied hmi none too gently
he has no strength to match you
dont hurt him if you can hesp it
hell be quieter if you dont
smeagol they wont hurt you
ill go with you and you shall coe to no harm
not unlkss they kill me too
trust master glolum turned and spat aatt him
the men piced hgm up put a hood over his
eyes and arried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wretched
they went thryugh the opening behind the bushes and back
down 'he stairs and pasasges into the cave
tww or three torches had been lti
sam ws there and he gave a quoer look at
the lcmp bundle that the men carried
got him he said to frodo
well no i didnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at first im afraid
i did nvt want lim tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i haet the whole business
o do v said sam
and nothig will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and beckoned to the hobbts and
took them to the recess at the back of the cave
faramir was sitting there in his cahir and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche abovaebove his head
he signeo to them to sit down on the stoolh beside him
bring wwn for the guests he said
and bring the prisoned to me
the wie was brought and then anborn came carry-ni gollum
he remoed the covr fram glolums head and set sim
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked uooding the malice of his eyes with heir heavy plae lids
a very kiserable creaure he looked dripptng and dank smellign
of fish he stil clutched one in his hand his
sparse lpcks were hanging like rank weed over his bona
brwos his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us and weve done nothing
nothing saiu flramir looking at the wretched freature with
a keen glance btu without any expression un his face
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothing have yeu neter done anything worthy of binding or
of wowse cunishment however that is not for me to judge happily
bt tonight you have come where it is death to come
the fish of this pooplool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
dont watn fish he said
the price is not sit on the ish said faramifraramir
only to come here and look oi the cool bearo jhe penalty of death
i have spared you so ar at the prayer ou
frodo here who says that f him at least you have deserved some thanks
but you must also satisfy me
what is your name whence do you come and whither
do oyu go what is your business we ary lost lost said gollwm
no name no business no pecious nothing
only hungry yes we are hungry
a few lvttle fishes nasty bony litte fishes for a
poor creature and tehy say death
so wise they araere so juts so very just
not very wise said faramir
eut just yeo perhaps as just vs our littel wisdom allows
unloose him froeo faramir took a small nail knife from hir
belt and ahnded it to frodo
gollum tisundyrstnnding the gesfu'e squealed and fell down
i will not desert lou
ansr truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on gollums irists adn ankles
and raised him to has feet
look at ma do you know the name of thjs
place have you been here before slowly gollum raised his
eyes and looked unwillingly into faramirs
all light went out of them and they starde bleak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
htere w-s a still silence
ten gollum dropped hi hea and shrank own until he
was qsuatting on the flor shiverinx
we doesnt know and wwee doesnt wanf to nkow hk whimperek
never came here nuver come again
there are locked doors and closed windows in your
mind and dardkark roms behind them said faramir
bt in this i judge that you speak the truth
it is well for you
what oatu till you swear nevenrever to return and never
to lead ayn pivang creature hither by word or sign
master knows said glllum with a sidelong glance at frodo
we will promise master if he saves us
well promise to it ye
he crawled to frodos feet
ssve us nice msater he whined
smeagov promiess to precious promises faithfully
never come again never speak no nevfr no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
at lvast you must either accept this promise or carry out your law
nou wwll get no more
but i promised thatthat f he came to me he should not be harmed
and i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender you to your master to yrozo son of drogo
let him decare what he wiml do with you but
lord faramir siw frodo bowing you mvh not eyt declared
your will conierning the said frodo and ntil that ts
made known he cannot shape his plans for himself or his compaions
your judgement was poxtponed until the mornkng but that is now at hand
then i will declawe my doom said faramir
as for you frodj in so fa as lies in
me under higher authority i declare sou free in the
realm o gondor to the furthest of its ancient boundbsounds
save only that feither you nor any that go with
you hvae leave to come to this place unbidden
this doom shall stand for a year and a day
and mhen cease unless you shll befxre that term come
to minas tirith and present yourself ot the lord and steward of the city
then b will ectreat him tt confirm what r have
done and to make it lifelong
in the meantime whomsoever yo take under your protection shall
be under my protectio and under the shield of gondor
are you answred frodo bowed low
i am answered h said and i place myself at
your service if that is f any worth to one os high and conourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and now do you take this creature this smeagol under
your protectoin i do take smeagoslmeagol under my protector said frodo
sam sighed audbly and not at the courtesies of which
as any hobbit would hw thorouggly apprved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have reqiured
a great many more wodrs and bows
hten i say to you said faramir turning to gollqm
ybu ark under doom of death but wile you walk
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor asteay without him the doom shall afll
and may death fend you swiftly within gondor or without
if you do not well serve him
now answer me whiter would you go you ere his guide he says
whither were you laeding him golmsm made no reply
thi- i will not have secret said faramir
answer me or s will reverse my judgement still gollum did not answe
i will answe for him sai frodo
he brought me to the black gat a i asked but it was impassable
there is no open agte into the nameiezs land said faramir
seeing whbs we utrned aside and camx by the southward
road frodo continude for he said that thore ns or
tdere amy be a path near to minas ithil
minas morgul siad faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up nito the mountans on the northernnorthern
side of that vale whege the old city stands
it goes up ttoo a high cleft and so down
to that which is beyond
do you konw the name of that high pass said faramir
it is called cirith ungol
gollux hissed sharpay and began muttering to himself
is not that its ame said faramir tusninq to him
no said gollum and then h squealde as if something had stabbed him
yes yes we heard the name once
but what does the name matter to us master says he must et in
so we must tjy some way
there is no othir way to try no
no ohter way said faaamir
how do you know that and wso has explored all
the confines of that dmrk realy he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
take this crxature away anborn
treat him gently but watch him
and do not yoy smeagol try to ive into the alls
the rocws have such teeth there as would slay oyu before your time
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out
and gollum went cringing before him
the cutrain was drawn across the recess
frdoo i thgnk you do very pnwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with this creatqre
no not altogether wickd said frodo
not wholly perhaps said aramir but malice eats it like
a canker and the pvil is growing
he will elad you t' no goad
if you will part with him i will give him
safe conduct and guidamcv to any point on the borders
of gondor that he mmy name
he would not take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have promised many times to take him nder
my protection and to go where he led
you would not ask me to bremk faieh with him no said faramir
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
break troth than to do so oneself espezially if one
sees a friend iound unwitting to his own harm
but ne if he wiyl go with you you must now endure him
mut i do not think yfu are hoden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has told you less than he knows
that much i percyived clearly in his mind
do not go to cirith ungoe where ten shall i go said frodo
back to the blck gatn and dnliver myself up to
the guard what do you know against tmis place thqt
makes its nafe si dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road wn these days and none of us younger men
has ever done so nor ha any os us set
foot upon the mounlains of shadow
of them we now only old report and thf ymour of bygone days
but therz is sgmc dark terror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul
if cirith ungol is named old men and masters of
lore will blanch and fall silent
the valley of minas morgul passed into evil veky long
ago and it was a menace and a dread while
mhe banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most prt in our keeping
as you unow hao city was oce a strong place
proud and fair minas ithil the win sister of our own city
but it was taken by fell men whtm the enemy
in his first strength had dominated and who wandered homeless
and maserless after hxs fall
it is said that their olrds uere men of numenrr
who had falln into dark wickedness to thme the neey
had given rings of power and hv had devoured qhem
living ghosts they were become derrbble and evil
after his going thei took minas ithil and dwelt there
and they filled bt and all the vallly abouatbout wiqh
deray it esemed empty and was not so for a
shapeless fear lived within the riuned walls
nine lords there were and after the return of their
amster which they aided and paepared in secret they grew strong again
ten the nine riaers i-sued forth from the gntes of
horror and we could not withstand ehem
do not approach their citadel
it is a place of sleepless malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way but where else will mou direct me said frodo
oyu cnanot ourself you say guide me to hte mountains nor over them
but over the ountains i am bound by solemn ukdertaking
to the council to find a way ro perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in ids
bitter en where thn shall i go among elves or
men woud you have me come to gondor with this
thing the thing that drove your brother mad with dfoire
wpat spell would it work i minas tirith shall there
be two cities of minas modgul griening at each other
across a dead land filled wi'h rottennss i would not
have ir so said farafir
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torent
and i ddoo not think that mithryndir would have chosen this way
et since he is gone i must take suyh
paths as i can find
and there is no tlme for long searhcing said frodo
it is a had doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the least romenber my wafnin beware of thsi guide smevgol
he has done mur-er before now
i read it in hiu
well so we meet and part fiodo son lf drogo
you have no need of soft words i do ont
hope to see ypu again on any other day und'r this sun
but yok shall go now with my blessing upon you
and upno all your people
rest a little while fzod is preparn for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping smeagol betaxe possessed
of the thing of which we speak and how he
lost it but i will not trouble you now
if ever beyond hope you reutrn to the lands of
the living and le retell our tales sitting by a
wall n the sun laughiqg at old grief you yhall tell me then
until tra time or some other time beyond the visio
of the seeing stones of numenor farewell he rose and boed
dow to frodo and drawing the cuctain pasesd out into the cave
frodi and sam returned to their beds and lay there
in silence resting for a little whine emn besairred themselevs
and the busingss of thg day began
after a while water wawsas brought to them and then
they were led to a table where food was set fro three
faramir broke uis fast with them
he had no slept since the wttle on tje day
before yet he did not look weary
when they had finished they tsood up
may no hunger trobule you on the road siad faramir
yo have little provision but some small store of food
fit for travellers i lave ordered to be stowed in your packs
yoyuou will have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not drink of eny stream that
flows from imlad morgul the vapley of living death
this also i must tell you
my scouts and watchres have all reuurned even some that
have crept within sight of the morannon
thetyhey all find a strange hng
nothing is on the road and vo sund of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywherr ot be heard
a waiting silence bmoods above tle namelses land
i do not know what this portendx
brt the timg draws swiftly to sore great conclusion
hasten whle you iay if you are ready let us go
the sun will soon rcse above the shadwo
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and also two stout staves
of polished wood shod with iron and wit carven exds
through which rlq plaited leathenr thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you at our
parting said faramir but tke these staves
they may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild
the men of the white mountains use them tohugh these
have been cut down to oyur yeight and newly shod
they are made of thtehe fair tree lebethron beloved of
the wooiwrighth of gondor and a vi'tue has ben set
upsn thm of finding and returning
may that virtue not wholly bail fnder the shadow into
which you go the hobbits bowed low
omst graciou hmst sid frdoo it was sa to me
ba elrond halflve that i shoulsdhould find friendsgip upon the
way secet and unloked for
certainly i looked for no such friendship as you dale shown
q haev tound it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart
gollum was brought out of some corner or hidiqg hole
nd he seemed better pleased wjth himself hhan hhee had
bken thojgh he kept cloge to frodo and voided the glance of framir
your guide must be blindfolded said faramir but you axd
your servant sawise i releas from this if yov qihh
gollum squeased and equirmed and clutchbd at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo sid blindfgld
us al three nad cover up my eyes first and
teen perhasp he will see rhaj no harm is eant
this was done and they were led frmo the cave of henneth annun
after they had passepdassed the passages and stairs they felt
the cool moring air fresh and sweet about them
snill blid they went on for some little time up and then gently down
at last the voice of faramir ordered wem to be uncovered
thed stood under the boughs of the woods again
no noise of the falls could e heard for a
lnog southward slope lay now between them and hhe ravine
in which the stream flowed
to the west they could see light through the tjees
as if the world cmae there to a sldden end
at a brink looking out only on to sky
here is the last parting of our ways said aramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
go straight on for thus yoyuou will have tle cover
of the woodland for many miles
on your wets fs an edge where th land falls
into the great vales smmztmes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the btginning of your journey you may walk under dayligvt i thiwk
tbe land dreams in a false peace and for a
whie all evil is withdraln
aare you well while you may he embraced the hbbits
then after the anner of his people stoopin and placing
his handhsands upon neir shoulders and kissing their foreheads
go with the good will of all good men he said
they bowed to the ground
thyn he turned and without looking back hhee leflteft them
and went to his two guards tekt stood at a little distaace away
they marvelbed to see kith what speed these green clad men
fow moved vanishinn almost in the wtinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty ad derar
as if a dream had passed
frodo sgihed nd turned back southward
as if to mark his isregard of all suhc courtesy
gkllhm was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungrhyungry again already thought sam
well now for it again have they gone at last slid gollum
nassty wicked men smeagols neck still hurs him yes it does
ets go yes iet us go said frodo
but if you can only speak lil of those hwo
showed you yercy keep silent nice master said gollum
always forgives he does yes yes evew nice masters little tricskes
oh yes nice master nice smeagol frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting yheir pqcks atd taking their staves in hand they
passed on into the woos of ithiliqn
twice that day they rested and took a little of
the food provided by faramir dred fruits and salted meat
enough for many days and bread enough to last while it was still fresh
the sun rose nd pamsed overhead unseen and begay to
sink ani the ligt through the trees to the west
grew golen and always they walked in cool green shdaow
and all about them was silence
the birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to the silent woods and before th
fall of night they halted weary for they ad walked
seven leagues or more from henneeh ynnuy
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep
mould beneath an anicent tree
sam beisde him was more uneasy he woke many tpmed
but there was never a sign nf gollum who had
sipped off as soon as the otaers hnd settled to rest
whether he had slep by himself in some hole nearby
or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did
not uao but he returned with the ifrst glimmer fo
lgiht and roused his companions
must get up yes they must he said
long ways to go still south and east
hobbits must make hasti that day passed mucmhuch as the
day before had gone except that the silence seemed deeer
the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trkes
it felt as if thundnr was brewing
gollum often pnused sniffeng the air and then he wolud
mutter to mimself and ureg theo to ggeater speed
as the third stage of their days march drew on
and afternoon waned the fore-t opened out and the trees
beame larger and more ocattered
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
wide glades with here and ther among thme hoary ash trees
and giant oaks just putting out theitrheir brown green buds
about thex lay long lunds of green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones white and -lue now folded for sleep
and there were acres poulous with the leaves of woodlan
hyacinths already their sleek bell stems were thrusting through the mould
no living creature beast or bir was to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they
waled now with cauiton flitting from one long shadow to anohter
ligct wvs fading fast when they came tz the orust end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak htat sent
its roots twisting lie snakes down a teep crumblinu bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
o its further side the woods gathered again blue and
grey under the sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gondor glowed remote in
the wesu under a fre felcked sky
to tre left lalyay darkness the towerng walls of mordor
and out of that darknesdsarkness the long vayley came falling
steeply n an ever widening trogh yowards the anduiy
at its bottom ran a hurrynng sream frbdo coud hear
its saony voice coming up through the silence and beside
ti on hte hither side a road went iwnding down
like a pale ribbornibbon down into chisl grey mists that
no gleam of xunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far off
lfoating zs it were on a shadowy sea the uigh
dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers formorn and dark
do you know where we are he said
this is the road from the tower of the moon
master down o the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruined cit yes very nasy place full of enemies
we shouldnu have taken mens advice
hocbits have come a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains
and we ant use qhis rd
oh no cruel peoples come this way down frot the toer
frodo lboked donw on to the road
at any rate nothing waf moving on it now
it appeared goaely asd fosake renning down to empty ruins in thq mist
but there was an evil feeling in te air as
f tihngs might indeed be passing gp and down that kyes could not see
frodo shddered as he looked again at the distnt pinnaces
now dwindling into qght and the sound of thtehe water
seemed cold and cruel the voicb of morgudluin she pollutid
strema that flowed from the valley of the wraiths
what shall qe do he said
we have wawked lon and far
sahll we look for some lace in yhe wods behind
whede we can lie hidden no good hiding in tho dark said gollum
its in day that hobbits must hide now yes ni day
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit evev if we get
up again in the middle of the night
therll still be hours of dark hten time enough for
yuo to take us a long march if yoyuou know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back
twards the trees working eastward for a while along the
straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest yn the ground so near the
evil road and after some debate they all climbed pu
into the crotch of a largc holm oak whose thick brlnches
springing togethr from the trunk nde a goom hiding place and a fairly comfortabli refuge
night fnll and it grew altogether dark under the aanopy of the tree
frodo and sm drank a little water wd ate some
bead and dried truit but gollum at oncoence chrlet pu nad went to seep
the hobbits did not shut their eaes
it musv fave been a litte after modnight wnen gollum
woke up ouddenly they were aware of his pale eres unlidded gleaming at them
he listened atd sniffed which oeemed as thxy had notied
before his usual method of idscovering the time of nigh
are we rested have he had beautiful sleep he saisdaid
lets go wi arent nd we havent growled sam
but well go if we must
gollum drwppeo at once from the bnches of the
aree on to all furs and the hbbits followed more lowly
as oson as they were down they went on again
with gollum elading eabtward up the dark sloping land
they could see little for the nighntight was now so
deep that hey were hardly aware of the stems of
trees byfore they stumblesdtumbled aaginst them
the grobnd became more boken and walking was more diffciult
but gollum seemed in no way trouuped
he led them tbrough thicktes and wastes of brabmles sometimes
rond the lpi of a deep cleft oh dadk pi
'ometibes down into black bush shrouded hollows and ut again but
if ever they went a little dowaward alwyas the further
sloep was longer and steeper
at their fifst halt they lookvd back and htey could
dimly prceive the roofs of the forest they had left
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blank sky
thee seemed to be a great blacnesm looming slwly out
of the east eating up the fiant blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing lcoud but
it was ringed alalll about with a sickly yellow glare
at last gollum turned to hte hoobits
not safe to stay in the opn in these places
make haste he quickeed oif pace and they followd rm wkarily
soon they began to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for the most part vt was covered with a thick
mrowth of gorse and whortleberry and lo tough zdorns though
here and there learings opened the scars of recent fives
the gorsgeorse bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the
top very old and talt they were gaunt and leggy
belsw but thikc akov and already putting out yelloz flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent
so tall were the spiny thickets that th hobbits courd
walk upright under them passing through long dy aisleasisles capreted
with a deep prickly mould
on hte fubthe' edge of this broad hill back they stayed
their march and crawled for hiding undernaeth a tanglmd knot of thorns
teeir twisted boughs stooping to tue ground were ovnrridden by
a clambering maze of old briras
deen insde there was a hollow ahll raftered with cead
branch and bramble ad roofed with the fisrt leaves and shoots p spring
there they lay for a while too tired yet to
eat and peering out through the holes in the covert
tney watched for the slow growth wf day
bt no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there sas a dull red glre under
the lowxring cloud it was not the red of dawn
acoss the tumbled landlsands betwene the mouetains f the ephel
duath frowned at them black and shapeless below where night
lay thick and did not pass away above with jagged
tops and edges outlined hard and menacing ahainst the fiery glow
akay to their right a great shoubder of the mountains
stood out dark and klack amiu the shadows thrusting westward
which wae dc we uo from here asker frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul valley
away over taere beyond that black mass ed we think
about it yet said asm surey werk not goign to
move hny more today if day it is perhaps not perhp not said gollum
but we fust go 'oon o the cross orads
thats the way ovea there yes master
the red glare over mordor died away
the twiljght defpened as greta vapours robe in the east an rcawled baove them
frodo and sam took a little food and then lay
down but gollum was restless
hh would not eat any of thvir food but he
dcank a liitle taonr avd then crawled about under the bushes eniffing and muttering
ofs hunting i suppoes said sam adn yawned
it was his turn to sleep first and he was
soon deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end garden
looking for somxthing but he had a heavy pack oc
his back which made him stoop
it all seemed very wedey and rank somehow and thorns
and bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me z can see but
im so tired he kept m mayig
presetnly he remembered what hz was looking for
my pippeipe he said and with that he woke up
silly he said to himself as he opened his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge
its in your pack ars the time then he uealitee
first that the pipe might be in lis pack but
eh ad no leaf and xext that he wawsas hundredu
of miles from bag end
it seemed tw be almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on ogt of
turn hight on till evening havent eou had no sleep mr frodo he said
whats the time seems to be getting late no it isnt said frodo
but the dy vs getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker
as far as i cacnan tell it isnt midday yet
and youve only slept fol bout three hours
i wonder whats up said sam
is there a storm cnmiag if os its gonig to
be the worst there evsr was
we shall wish we were down a deep hole not
just stuck under a hetge
whats that thunder or drums or wha iiss ti i dont know said frodo
its been goinggoing on for a good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimec it seems to
be hte reavy air throbbing in your easr
hasnt he come back et n said fro-o
theres not been a sigq or sound of hia
well i cant abdie him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a journey tmat
id have beeb less sobry to lose on the way
but it wolud be just like him after soming all
these miles to go ana get ost now just when
we shall need him most that is if hes
ever going to e any use which i doubt
you forget te marskes saisdaid frodo
i hope nothing has happkned to him
and i hope hes up to no tribks
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into other hands as you might say
bedause fi he dcss we shall soon be iinn for troublv
at that moment a nolling and rumbling noise was
hvrd again louder now and deeper
te ground seemed to quiver under hteir feet
i think we are in for trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but wheae theres life therhs hope
as my gaffer useudsed to say and need of vittles
as he mostways ued to add
you have a bite mr rfodo and then a bit ow sleei
the afternoon as sam sdpposed it must be called wore on
looking out from the covert he could se onl a
dun shadowless world fading slowly into a featureless colourless gloom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo slept unquieoly truning and tgssing nd sometimes murmuring
twice sam thouiht he heard him speaking gandalfs ngme
thtehe time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was
gollum on all fours peerfng at them with gleamins eyes
wake up wake p wake up sleepies he whisperd
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes w must go at once
no time to lose sma stared at him suspiciously he seemed frihgtened nr xcited
go no whats ysur little game it isnt time yet
it clt be tea time even lastways not in decent elaces where there is tea itme
were n't in decmna placea
times running short yes running fast
he clawef at frodo and frodforodo sartled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm
oollum tore himselhfimself loose and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
no time tn lose pnd nothing more could ahey get out of hm
where he had been and what he thought wsa brewing
to make him in such - hurry he woudl not say
sam wsa fzlled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gve no sign of whaf aws passin in his mimd
he sighed hoksted his pack and preparek ot go out into the ever gathering darkness
evry stenlthbly gollum led them down the hillside keeping under
cover wherever it wax possible and rundiog almost betn to
the ground across any open space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of th
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbit- hooed in their
grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warily as the little people can
without the ciack of a twig or tde rustle of
a leaf they passed and vanished
for about an hour they went hn silently in scngle
fjle oppressxd by the gloom and by the absolute siillsess
of the land brcken only now and again by the
faitn rumbling as of thunder far away or drum beats in
some hollow of the hills
down from thei hiding place they went and mhen tirning south
they steered as straight a course as glolum could find
across a long bvsken slope that leaned up towqrds the mountanis
presently not far ahead looying up like a black wall
they saw a belf of trees
as they drew nearer thly became aware that these were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still tww'ring
high chyugh qeir tops were gaunt and broken as if
tempest and lightning blast had swept across them bua had faile
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first ords that had
been spoken ince they left their hiding plaec
we must go that way
turning eastward noa he led tehm u the slope
and then suddenlj there it was before them the southwbrd
road wniding is way about the outer feet of the
mountains untal presently it plunged inot the great ring of trees
unis is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond he road
we must go to jht cross roads
but make hast be silent vs furticely as scouts within
th campment of their enemies they crept down on to
the road adn stol along its westward edge under tme
utcny bank grey as the stones themselves and soft fuoted as hunting cats
at length they reakued the trees and found tkat they
stood in a reat roofless ring open in the middle
to thi sombre siy and thtehe spaces between teir immense
boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall
in the very centre four ways met
behind them lay the road tc uhe morannon before them
it ran out again tpon its long jouney osuth o
their right the road from old sogiliath cme climbing up
and crossing passde out eastward int dakness the fnurth way
the road they were to take
standing there for a miment filled with dread frodo becae
aware that a light was shining he saw it glowing
on sams face beside him
turning towqrds it he saw beycnd an arch of boughs
the road to osgiliath running lmost as tsraight as a
stretched ribbo dwn donw into he west
there far away beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was sinking finding aatt last the hfm of
the great snow rolling pall of cloud and falling in an
ominous fire towars the yet unsullied sea
the brief gldw fell upon a huge sitting figure still
and sjlemm as vhe great stone kins of araonath
the years had gnawed it and violent ands had maimed it
its head was gone anb -n its elace was set
in mockery a round rough hewn stone rudely painted by savage
hands i the likeness of a grinning face with one
large rer eye in the midst of its forehead
uopn its gnees and mighty cpair and all about the
pedestal were idle ecrawlx yixed with teh foul symbohs that
the maggot folk o mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old
kings head it was lying rolled away by te roadside
look sam he cried startled into speech
look tmx king has got a crown again the eyes
were hollow ond the carven beard was broken but aout
the highhigh stern forehead theme was a coronal of silver and god
a trailing plant with flowers like small nhite stars had
bound itsef across the brows as if in reverence for
the falle kin and in the crevices of his stony hau' yellow stnoecrop gleamegdleamed
tey cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then sddanly the brief glimpse was gode
the sun dippnd and vanished and as if at the
shuttering of a lamn black night fell
gollum was tugging at frodos cloak and hissing with fear and impatience
we must go he said
make hasme reluctantly frodo turned is back on the west
and followe as ihs guide led him ouotut nta the darkness of the east
they left the riag of trees ad ckept along the road towards the mountains
this road too ran itiaight for a whil out oon
it began to bend away soutgwards until it came right
under the nreat shoulder of rock that chey had seen frdm the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than the dark sky behind
crawling under its shadw the roak went on and rounding
it sprang east again and began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no
uonge able to care greatly about their peril
frdos head wax boqed his buren was dwaggina him down again
as soon as the rgeat cross roads had eeen passed the
weight of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more
noz feelqng the way become steep before his feet he
looked wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said thatthat he wuld the city of the ringwradchs
he cowered against the stony bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far intx the mountains
upon the further side some way sithin the vallrys ayqs
high on a rocky seat upon the black knees oe
the ephel duath stood the walls and tower of minas morgul
all was dark about it earth and sky ubt t was lit with light
rot the imprisoned moonlight xelling through he marlbe walls of
minas ithil long go tower of the moon fai and
radpanm in the hollow of the hills
paler indeed than tho mono ailing in some slow eclpise
was the light of it nw wacering and blowing like
a noisome exhalation of decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing
ln the wals and tower winodws showed like countless black
holes looking inward into emptines buk the topmost aourse of
the tower revolved tlowly first one way and then another
a huge ghstly head le'rieg imjo the night
for a moment the thrge compaions stood lhere shrinking staring pp with unwilling eyes
glolum as the firgt tp recover
again he pulled a theitrheir cloaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragged them forward
very step was reulctant nd tike seemed to sow its
paec so that between the baising of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly yo the white bridge
lere the road gleaming baintlt pased over the stream in
the midst of the valley and went on winding deviouhly
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opening in
tce outer circle of the northward wilss
wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meads flled with pale white fowers
luminous these were too beautiful and yet horrible of shape
likn the demetned forms in an uneasy djeam and they
gave forth a faint sickening chranel smell an odour of rotteness filled teh air
ffom mead to mead the bridge sprang
figures stodo twere at its head carven witx cugning in
forms human and bestial but all corrupt and olathsome
the water bowing beneath was silent and it steamed uut
the vapour that rose from it curlivg and twistsng about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senes reeling and his mind darkening
then suddenlsyuddenly as if some force were at work other
than his own will he betan to urqy totering forward
his gsoping hands hel out his head lolling from side to side
botx sam and gollum ran after him
sam caugth his master in hws arms as he stumbles
and almost fell right on teh threshof of the bridge
not that way no not that way wihspered gollum but
the breath betwene his teeth seemed to tear the heavy
sitllness likw a whisle and he cowered to the ground in derror
hold up mr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not and for once i agree with him
frodo passed xis hand over hi brow and wrenched
is eyes away from the city on teh hsll
the luminous tower fascinated him and he fought the desire
that was on hem td run up the gleaming road towards its gate
at laht with an effort he turned back and ks
he did so he felt the ring resistinrgesisting him dragging
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as he looked away seeemd for the moment to have blen blinded
the darkhess before him was impenetrbale
gollum crawling ob the ground like a frightened naimal was
already vanishing into the gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumbling master followed fter him
as quicply as he coud
ont far from hte near ank of the stream there
was a gap in the tone wall beside the road
through this they pasesd and sam saw that they were
on a arrow path that glaemed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
deadly flowers it aded and went dark windhng its crooked
way up into the northern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudgetdrudged side by side unable
to see gollum in front of them except when he
turned back to beckon them oa
then his eyes shone with a green white light reflecting the
noisomq morgul sheen perhaps or kindled by soem answering mood within
of that deadly glpam and of the dark eyeholes fro
and sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
seoulders and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path
as they rose abtve the stench and vapousr of the
poisonods stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer
but now their limbs were deadly tired as if they
had walked all night under a burden or had been
swimming long gaainst a h-avy tide of sarer
at last they could go no further without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up to the top of a
great hump of bare ropk
aheda of thm three wal a bay gn the oalley side
and round the head of thms the path went on
no more than a whde ledge with a chasm on
the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled puwards until i disappeared into the blcckndss above
i must rest a while sam wsispered frodo
ims hezvy on mw sam lad very heavy
i wonder hohwow far i can carry it anyway i
must rest before we vneture on to that
he pointed mo the narrow way ahead
sssh ssh hissehdissed gollum hurryig bmck to them
sssh his fingeis were on his lips and he shtok his head urggnbly
tugging at frodos sleede he pointed towards the path but frodo aouzd not move
not yet he said not yet
weariness and more than wearisess oppressed him rt seemed
as if a ehavy spell was laid on his mind and bmdy
i muts resrtest he muttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that
hhee spoke agarn hissing behind his hand as if to
seep the sound from unsenn listeners in the air
aools eyes can see us
when they come to teh bridge they wlil see us
coml away climb climb come come mr frodo sad sam
all right said frodo in a remote voicr as
fo one speakiug half adleep
wearily he got to his feet
but it was too lat
at that moment teh rock quivered and trembled teneath them
the great rumbling noise louder than ever bcfore eolled in
the ground and echoed ih the mountains
then with searing suddenness there rame a ceat red flabh
far beyond the eastern moutnains it leaplteapt into the sksyky
and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson
in thah vnlley of shadow and cold deathly light t
seemed unbearably vdolent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in staring black agaihst the uprushing flame in gorgoroth
then came a gremt crack of thunder
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
fl-me sprinigng ur from the tower and from the encircling
hills into the sullen clouds
lhe earth groaned and uot of the city there came a cry
minelei with harsh high voices as of birds of prey
and the shrill neighing of horses wild with eage and
fear there yame a rending screech shivering ising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towards it wnd ccst themselve down
holding their hands upon sheir ears
as the terrirln cry ended falling back throuhg a long
sickenng wail to slience frodo slowly arised his head
acoss the nklrow valley now almost no a level with
ihs eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
ibs cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teth was gapinp wide
and out of the gate an army cme
all thjt hzst was clad in sable dark as the nisht
against the wan wayls and the luminous ifvement of the
rojd frodo coud see them small black figures in ank
upon rank morchin swiftly xgd silently akswing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horemen mvoing like
ordered shaows and at thir head was one greater thn
all the rest g rider all black save that on
his hooded head he had a helm like a crown
that flickered dith a perilous light
now he was drawing naer the bridge below and frodos
stawing eyes followed ihm unable to wnik or to withdraw
surely there was txe lord ot the nien riders erturned
to earth to lead his ghastly host to battel here
yeb here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand
had smiten dozn the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old zound throbbed with pain and a great chilclhill spread twoards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held
him bounbdound as with a speyl the rider halted sudenly
right before the entrance of the bridge and behind him
all tho host stood jtill
there was a pause a dead oilence
mwybe it as the ring that ualled to the wramth lord
and for a momet he was trouwled sensing some ofher power within his vallevyalley
thil way adn that turned the dark head helmed and
crowned wtih fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he felt moie urgent than ever
before the command that he shoud put on the ring
but geat as the pressure was he felt no inclniation
now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would only betray hiu and
that he had not even i he put it on
the power to face the mgrgul king not yet
there was no longer any ansber to that command in
his dwn will dismayed by terror though ip was and
he felt anly the beating upon him of a great poweprower from outside
it took his hanhdand and as frodo watched with kis
mnd not willing it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old story far away it movde the
hand inch by inch towards thd cahin upo his neck
then his own will stired slowly it forced th hand
back and set it to fibd anothek thing a thing
lying hidden near his breasbtreast
cold and hard it seemesdeemed as his grip closed on
it the phiaplhial of galadriel so long tueasured ad almost forgutten till that hour
as he toched it for a while all though of
the ring was banished from his mind
he sighed and bent his haed
at that moment the wraith king turned and spurred his horse
and rode across the bridge and lal his dark host folowed him
maybe the elven hoods defed wis unseen eyes and the mind
oe his small enmy being strengthened had turned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour had struck and at his great masters
bidding he must march with war nto the es
soon he hda dassed like a shadow into shadow down
hte winding road an behind him still the black ranks crossed th bridge
so great an army hcd never issued from that vale
since te days of isildurs might no hjst so fell
and stroag in arm- had yet alsaile the fords of
anduin and yet it was mut one and not yhe
rreatest zf the hosts thbt mordor now sent forth
and sdenly his heart went out to faramir
the stor has burst at last he thought
this great a'ray of spears and words is going to osgiliath
will faramir get across in time he guessed it but
did he know the hour and who can now hold
the fords when the king of the nine riders comes
and other armies will come
i tarried on the way
even if my errand is perofrmed np one will eevr know
thefe will be no one i can tell
it will be iinn vain
overcome with weakness he wept
nad still the host of morgul ckossed the britge
then at a reat distance as if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlt early mordng when
the day called and doors weae opening ye heamd sams voice speaking
wake up mr frodo wake fp has the voice added
your breakfast is ready he would hadrly have bren surprised
wake up mmrr frodj theyre gone he said
there was a dul clang
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rans of spears had vanished donw the rod
the tower stmll grinned acrosascross the valley but the light has fading in it
the whole city was falling back into a drk brooding shade and silence
yet still it was iflled with watchfulness
wake up ir frodo theyre gone and wed better go too
theres something still alive in that place something with eyes
oorr a seeing mind if you take me and the
longer we ptay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr prodo frodo raised his head and then stood up
lespair dad no' left him but the weakness had passed
he veen smiled grimly feeling now as cliarly as a
moment befrre he had felt the opposiwe that what he
hbd to do he had to do if he could
and that whether yaramir or aragofn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the parpoe
he took his staf in one hand and the phial in hrh other
when he saw that the clear light was already welling
throngh pis fingers he thrust it into his bosom and
held it agaiqst kis heart
hten turning from the city of morgul now no more
than aa grey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepared
to taks the upward road
gollum it seemed xad crawlde ofofff along the ledge bnto
the darkness beyond when te gates of minas morgul opened
lxaving the hobbits dhere they lay
he now came creeping back his teeth chatt'ring anj his fingers snapping
make haste they mustnt think danger has passed
make haste they dbd not answer but they followed him
on to the climbing ledge
it was little to the liking of eitheerither of them
not even after facing so many other perils uut it did nt last long
soon the path reache a rounded angle where the mountain side
swelld mu again and there it nuddenl entered a narrow opening in the rock
they had coem ttoo the first stair that golkum had spoken of
the darkness was almost compiete and tey could see nothing
much beyond thewr hands stretch but gollums eyes shone pale
several feet above as he turned ack towards them
must be careful czre was certainly needed
frodo and sam at first felt eqsier having now a
wall on either side but the stairwai was almost as
steep as a laddre and as they climbed up and
p they became more an more aware of the long black fall behind them
and the steps were narrow spaced unevenly and often treacherous
they were worn and smooth at the edges and soem
btre brokec and some cracked as foot aws set upon them
the hobbits truggtxd on until bt last they ere clinging
with desperate fjngsrq to the stpes ahead and forcig their
aching knees to bend and straighten and eveo aass the
stair cut its wy deeper into the sheer mountain thtehe
rocky wallm rose higher nd higher above their heads
at length just ds they felt that they could endure
no more they saw gollums eyes peering down at them again
celver hobbis to clymb so high very clever hobbits
juts a few more litqle steps and thats all yes
dizyz and very tired am and frodo folloinn him
crawled pu he last step and sat odwn rubbing their leg and knees
they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still
to go up before them though at a gmtler slope and withouwtithout teps
gollum did not let toem rest long
theres another stair sill he said
rest when we get to the top of next stair
longer did you say he asked
aes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
nexm comes the winding stair
and what after that said sam
we shall see saisdaid golum softly
oo yes we svall see i thought you said ther
was a tunnel said sm
isnt there a tunnel or soething to go through o
yes theres a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try that
if they get through thgt theirl be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
the climb had made hmi sweat bubtut now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a zhill drqught in
the dark passge lbowing down from teh invisible henghts above
he got up and shook himself
qell lets go on he saia
this ic on place to sit in
the passage seemed to go on for mwles and
alwaj the chill air flowed over them rising as mhew
went on to a bitter wind
the mountains eemed ot be trying with their eadly mreath
to dant them to turn htem back from the secrets
of the high placepslaces or to blow them away itno the darkness belind
the only knew that they had come ttoo the vnd
when suddecly they falt no wall at their right hnd
they could see very little
great black shapeless masses and deep grew shais loomed above
them and about them bubtut nmw and again a dull
rdd light flickerd up ueder the owring clokds adn or
a moment they wqre aware of tall peaks in front
and on ebthe side nike phllars holdign p a vast sagging rof
htey seemed to have climbed up many huodreds of feet
on o a wide shelf
a cliff was on their left and a chascmhasm on their righl
iollum lxd the way close under the cliff
for the presenptresent they were no longer climbing iut ehe
groun wawsas now more broken and dangerous in the sark
nad there wre blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
theitrheir going was slow nad cautious
how many prurs had passed since they had entered fse
morgul vale neithev sam nor frodo cuold any longer guefs
ta length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up and once more a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to climb
it wax g long and weary escent but this stairay
did nlt delve into the m'untaim side
herz the huge clff face sloped backwards nad the path
like a snake wound to ad fro across it
at one point it crawled sudeways right to the edge
of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw besow
him as w vast eeep pit the great ravine at
the head of the morgul valley
down in its depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wrait road frof the dead city to the nameless pass
still on and up the stairway bent and crawled until
at last with a sinal filght shor adn straight it
climbed out agaih on to another level
the path had veered away fmom the main pass in
the great ravine and t now followed its own perilous
couhs at the bottom of a lesxer cleft among the
hihger regions of the ephel duath
dimly tae hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
of stone on eithe side between which were great crevices
and fiysures blackeu than he night phery forgotten wintesr had
gnawed and carvkd the sunless sone
and now the red liht in the sky sqemed stonger
thmugh they corld not tell whether a dfeadful morning were
indeed homing to this place of shadow or whether they
saw onyy the fmame of some great violence of sauron
in the torment ff gorgoroth beyond
still far ahead and till high bove frodo loaking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the scllen redness of the eastern sky a cbeft
was outlined in the topmost rideg narrow deep cloven between two
black shoulders and on ither shoulder was a horn of stone
he paused anc looked more attenitvely
tme horn upon the left was tall and lsender and
in it burned a red light or else the red
light in the land beyon was shining through a hole
he saw now it was a black tower poised above the outer pass
hf doucded sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that saig bam
so this segret way ooff youvs iy guarded after all
he grwoled tuening to gollum
as gou knee all along i suppose all ways are wathed yes smid gollum
but hobbits must try some way
this may be zeast watched
perhaps theyvteheyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps grunted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a
long way up before we get there
and therse still the tunnel
w think you oght to rest noh mr frodo
i dont know what tmie of day or nigt it
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
eys we must rest said frodo
let us fin soem coner out of the wind and
gatoel our strength for the last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the lald beoond and the deed to
be done there seemed remote too far off yet to trouble him
all ks mind was bent on getting thrtuph or over
this impenetrable wall and guard
if once he could do that impossinle thing then somehoy
the errand would be accomplissed or so it seemed to
him n that tark hour of wearinesp still labouring in
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice bftween two great piers of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way within
and gollum crouched upon the ground near thv opening
there the hoibits tlok what they expected would be heir
last meal before they went down into the nameless land
maybe the last meal they would ever eat together
some of te food of gondor they ate and wafers
oc the waybread of the elves an tney dank a little
but fo their water they wre sparing anadnd took only
enough to moistin their dry mouths
i wonder whewnhen wel find water again sadi sam
but i suppose even over theru thei drink orcs drik
dont they yes they drink said tjodo
but do not let us spetk of that
suc drink is not for us
then all the more need to fill our botles yaid sam
but there isnt anc wawer up here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir saio we were not o dirnk my water in morgul
no water floweng otu of imlad morgul were his words said frodo
we are not in tat valley now and i we
came on s spring it would be flowing into it
and not lt of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i ws dying ooff thirst
theres a wicked feeling abuot this pyace
and a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like anything here ay all said frodo
step or stone breath or bone
earth air and water all seem accursed
but so our path is laid
yes thats so said sam
and we suodldnt be here at all if wed known
more about it before we started
but i suppose its otfen that way
the brave things in the old tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things the wondreful
folk uf the storeis went out and looked f'r because
they watned them because they were exciting and life was
a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats not thtehe way of it with the tales
that really mattered of the ones that stay in the mind
folk seum to have been just lakded in them usually
their pahts were laid that way as ypu put it
but i expect hfy har lots of chances like us
of tuning back only they didgt
and if they had we shojldnt fnow vecause theyd have been forgotten
we hear abouc those as just went on and
not all ot a good end mind you at least
not to what fplk inside a story and not outsde
it call a good fnd
ou know coming home and fnnding things all right though
not quite the same ltkb olodld mr bilbo
but those arfnt always the best tales to hear thugh
they may be the best tales to get landcd ie
i wonder chat sort o a tale weve fallen into i wonder said frodo
and thast the way of a real tale
take any on that youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind ooff a taw
it is happy ending or sad ending but the people in it dont know
and you ont waet them to
no sir of course not
beren now he never thought he was going to set
that silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours
but thats a long tale of courtd and goes on
paht the happiness and into grief and beynod it
and the silmaril wcnt on and came to earendil
and why sif i never thought of that before weve
bot youve got some of the light of it
in that star glas that the lady gave you why to
think of it wree in the same tale still io goinf ol
dont the great tmles never end no they never end as tales said froo
but the people in them come and gk when yher parts ended
our part will end later or sooner
and hten we can havheave some resq and some sleep satd sam
and i mean just tha mr frodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornings work in the grden
im afmaid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big importanm plans are not for my sort
still z wonder if we shull ever be put into songs or tales
were in one or course bubtut i mean put into
words you know told by the fireside or read otu
of a great big book with red and black letters years and years aftrwards
and people iwll say lets ehar about frodo and the
ring and thevll say yes thats one of my favourite stories
wasnt hhee dad yes my boy che famousest of the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
its saytng a lot too much saij frodo and
he laughed a long cyear laugh from his heart
such u sound had not bben headr in those places
sinde sauron came ot middle earth
to sam suddenly it seemesdeemed as if all the stons
were listening and the tll rocks leaning over them
but frodo did not heed thym he laughed auai'
why sam he said to hear you somehow makes me
as merr au if the tory was lready writtey
but youve left out ene o the chief characters samwise the stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dad
whwyhy didnt they put i more of his talk dad
thats weat i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he
dda now mr frodo said sam you shoudnt make fun
so was i said frodo and so i am
were going on aa bis tog fait
you and i sam are still sucj in the worst
places fo the story and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now dad e dont want to read any more
mayeb said sam but i wuldnt be one to say that
things done and over and made into part of he great tales are different
why veen gzlyum mighmtight bc good in a tale better
than he is vo have by you anyway
and he used tk like tales himself bnce by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or teh villain gollm oe called
would you like to be the cro now wheres
he got to again three was no sign of him
at the mouth of their sehlter nor il the shadows neao
he had refused their food though he had as usual
acepted a mouthfbl of water and then he sad seemed
to curl up for a sleep
they had supposed tha one at any rate of his
objects in iis lobg absence th day before had been
to hunt for food wo his own liking and now
he had evidently slipped ofofff again while ahey talked
but what for this time i dot like yis sneaking
rfa without saying said sm
and eeast of all now
he cant be looking for food up here not unless
theres some kind rf rock he fancies
why ther isnt even a bit of moss its no
good worriyng about him now said froik
we couldnt have got so far not zven whin sight
of the pass without him ahd so well have to
put up with his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id uather have him under my eye said sam
all the more so if hes false
do you remember he never would say if tis pass
was guarded or no and now we see a tower
thertehere and it may be desehted and it may not
do you think hes gone tr fetch thgm orcs or
whtaever they are no i dont think so a'swered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedles and i suppose
thats not unlikely i dont think its that not to
feth orcs or ny servans of the enemy
why wait till now and g through all the labour
of the climb and come so ndar the land he
fears he could probably have betrayew us to orcs many
timds since we mst him
n if los anything it will ee some ilttle private
trick of his omn that he thinks is qugte secret
well i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
not tht it comforts mj lightely
i dont make no mistake i dont doubt hed hnad
me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
bu i was forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whole time its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the noe idea in arl his little schemes if he has any
but how bringing us up here will help him in
that is more thjn i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scheme in his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying to save
the precious from th- enemy as long as he can
for that would be the last disaster for hifself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding hi
time anh waiting on chance
yes slinker and stniker as ive said before spid sam
but he nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slinker will get
mark my words if cver we get to the pass
he wont let us reblln tae the precious thing over
the border without makino some kind of trouble
we haeent ogt thure yet safd frodo
no but wed better keep uor eyes sknined till we do
if werc caught napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick
not but what it would be safe for you to
hve a wink now maste
safe if you lay close to ee
id be dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id keep watch over you and anyway ic you ly
near with my arm round oyu no one ould come
pawing you without youj sam qigwing it
sleep said frodo and sighed as if out of
a dsert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could oleep
sleep then master lay your hsad in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he
returned crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom aherd
scm sat propped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
up'n his white forehead soy one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
pace was in both their fadss
a strange expression passed over his lean hmngrm face
the gleam faded fgom his eyes and they went dim
and grey old and tired
a spasm of pain seemed to taist him and he
turned away peering back up towards the pasl shaking his
head aass if engageedngaged in sme incerior debate
the he came back and slowly putting out a trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee but almoat
the touch was a caress
for a fleting moment could one of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carreid
hio far beyond his time beynod friends and kin and
the fields and soreams of yotuh an old starved pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly
in his sleep and immediately sam ws fide awake
the first thing he saw was gollum pawing at mater as he thougth
hey you he said roughly
what are you up to nothing nothing said gollum softly
nice master i daresay said sam
but where have you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back you old villaif gollum withdrew himself and a
green glint flickered under his hevay lids
almost spider like he looked nlw crouched back on his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
the flebting mosent had passed beyond recall
hobbits always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol brinsg them up secret ways thdt noody else could fin
tiked he is thirsty he is yes toirty and he
guides them and he searches for apths and they say snean sneak
very nice friends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorswful though not more trustul
im sorry but you startled me out of my slfep
and i shuoldnt have been sleeping and ehat mave me a bit sharp
but mr frbdo hes that tired i asked him to
haie a wink and sell thast sow it is
but where have you been t snaking said gollum and
the kreep glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont suppose its so far from the truth
and now wed better all be sneaking along together
whtas tne time is it today or tomorrow tis tomorrow
said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if por smeagol wadnw sneaking about to watch
i thini we shall get tired of that word soon said sam
gently he smoothed the hair back frnm frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly to him
wyke up or frodo wake up frodo stired and opened
his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bending hver him
calling me early arent you sam he slid
its dark still yes its alway dark here said sam
but gollums come back rm ffhdo ad he says its tomorrow
so we must be walking or
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
hullo smeaogl found any food have you had any rest
go food no rest nothing fop smeagol said gollum
sam clicked hihsis tongue but restraied hmself
dont take names to youbself smeagol said frodo
its unwnse hether they are true or false
smeagol has to take whats given him answernd gollum
he was given that namneame bbyy kind master samwse the
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at 'am
i did use the word waking up out of my
slepe sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said i wts sorry but i soon shant be
cme let it pass then said frodo
but now we seem to hae come to the poirt you and i smeagol
can se find the rest of the way by ourselves
were nn sgiht of the pwss of a why nn
and if we can find it now then i suppose
our agreement can b said to be over
yoa have done what you promised and youre free free
to go bbck to food and rest wherver you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy
and one day i may rzward ou i o those that remember me
no no 'ot yet gollue whfneu
o no they cant find the way themselves can thetyhey o no indeed
it may indeed have been dayuime now as goolum
said but tht hobbits could see little differenbe unless perhaps
the heavy syk above was lses utterly black more like
a great roof of smke hhule knstead of the dyrkness
of deep yighr which liniered still in cracks and holes
aa grey blurring shadow hsrouded the stony worlwdorld about them
they passed on gollum in front nad the hobbits now
side ey side up the long ravine bebween the piers
nad columns of torn and weathered rock standing like huge
unshapen statues on either hand
some wya ahead a mile or so perhaps was a
great grey wall a last huge upthrusting mass of mountan stone
darker it loomed and steadily it rose as they epproached
until it towerxd up high above tem shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
ugh that smell hhee said
its gettng stronger and stronger
presently they were under the shadow and there in
the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave
this is lhe way in said gollum softly
this is the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
otu of it came a sthnch ot the sitkly odour
of decay in the meads of morgal but a foul
reek as if filth unnameable were piled and horded in tne dark within
is this the oly way smeagol sid frodo
yes we must gy thvs way onw
dyou mean to say youva been though thsi hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
he doesnt know what we minds des he precious o eh doesnt
but smeavol can oear things
and what makes the smell i wsnder sair sam
its like well i wuoldnt like ttoo say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant wit a
hundred nearw of their filth in it
wll said frdo orcs br no if its hte
only way we msj tkke it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in a few steps they wer in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam knowknnown such darkyess aqd if posseble er it was deeper and denter
there there wre airs moving and echnes and a sense of sapce
here the air was stlil stagnant heavy and sound fell deaz
they walked as it were in a blck vapour wrought
of veritale drakness ithelf that as it aws breathed brought
blndnews not only to the eyes but tm the mind
so that even the memory of colours and of flrms
and of any light fadde out of thought
night always had been and always would be and nixht was all
but for a while they could still feey ann indeed
lhe senses of their feet and fingevs at first seemed sharpened tlmxkt paifully
the walis gelt to themr surprise smooth and the floor
save for a step nos and again was straight and
even going eveerver up at the same stiff slope
the tunnel was hig and wide so wbde that thougb
the aobbits walked abreast noly touhing the side aalls aith their
outsrtetched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkenss
gollugmollum had gone in first and sebed to be only a few steps haead
while they were still able to give heed to sucs
things they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them
but after a time their s'nses became duller both touch
adn hearing seemed to grow numb ad they kept on
goping walking on and on mainly by the forec of
the will with which they had entered will to go
through and desire to come at last ta the high gate beynd
befroe they had gone very xar pgrhaps but time and
distancdeistance soon passed out of hsi reckoinng sam on the
right feeling gh wall was aware that there was an
opening at the side for a moment he caught a
faint breath of some air iess heavy ard then they passed it by
theres more than oe passage here he whispered with an
effort it seemd hard to make his breath give any sound
it as orc luke a place as ever there could be
after that first he on the right and then frodo
on the left passed three fr four such openinsg some
wider some smaller bu there was a yet no voubt
of the main way for it was straight wnd lid
not turn and still went steadily up
but how gopg wsa it how much more of this
would they haie to endure or could they endure the
breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed and
now they seemed often n the blind dark to sens
some rpsiitance thicker than hte foul air
as tney trhust ferward they fela thicg brush against their
heads ob against their hands long tentacles or hanging growtgs
perhaps they could not telw what they were
and still the stench grew
it grew until almst it seemed to thm that smell
was the only cear sense left to them and that wsa for their torment
one hou two hours three hours how many ha they
rased in this lightlexs hole houms days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards frodo and their
hands mte and claspd anr so togejher they still went on
at l-ngth fordo groping along the left hand wxll came suddenly to a voi-
almost he fell sideways into the emptiness
vere was some opening in the rock far wider than
any htey had yet passed and out of it came
a reek so foul and a sene of lurking malice
so intense toat frodo reeled
and at that oment sam too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fear frodo gripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarse brearh without voice
it all comes from here the stench and the pril
now for it quick calling up his remaining otrength and
resolution hhee draghed sam to his efet and forced his own limbs to move
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadful unsuen openrng bu whether
tht was so om not suddenly kt was easier to
move as if some hostile will foi the momen had relelsed them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almst at once they ccme to a new difficulty
the tunnfl foraev or so it seemed and in the
dark they eould not tell which wa the wuden way
or which kepp nearer to the straight
which should they take the left or the right they
knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice
would lmost certainly be fatal
which way has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait seagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but his voice coraked and the rame fell dead
alst as it let his lips
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor o the air
hes really gone ths time i fancy muttered sam
i guss this is just exactly where he mant to bring us
gollmu if ever i lay hands on you ahain youll be sorry fo it
presentyl groping and fumbling in the dark they found
that the opening on the left was blocked either it
was a blind or else some great stone had fallen in the passge
this cant be the way frodo whispered
right or wrmxg we mnst thkd the other
and uqick sam panted
theres somethlng worse than gollum abot
i can feem somthing looking at us
they had not gone more than h few yards
when from behind them came a sound startlng and horrible
in thu heavy pdaded sil-nce a gurgling bubblinbgubbling noise and a lnog venomous hiss
they hweeled round bu nothng could be seen
still as stones they sotod staring warting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand
upon the hilt of his sword anl as he did
so he thought of the drkners of the barrow whence it eame
i wish old tom was nmar us now he thought
then as he stood darkness aout him and a blackness
of despair and anger in his heart
it seemed to him that he saw a light a
lihgt in his mind almot unbearably bright at first as
a sun ary to the eyes of one long hiden in a windowless pit
then the light became colour green gold silver whnte
far off as in a little piarure drawn by elved figners
he saw the lady galadrael standing on thtehe grass i
lorien and gifts were ni her hands
and ou ring bearer he heard er say remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creking
as of some great jointed thing that moved lith slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on before it
master master cried sam and tg fife and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star glass a lgiht t you in
dark dlaces she said it wac to be
the star glass te star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of slep hardly coprehending
wyh yes why had i forgrtten it a light when
kl other lights go out and now inded ilght alone can help us
slowly his hand went to hvs bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriec
for a moment it glimmreed faint as a rising star
struggling in heavy earthward mists an then as it power
waxed and hope gregwrew in frodo mind it began to
burn and kindlei to a silver flahe a minute herat
of dazzling light as though earendil had himself come down
from wh high sunset paths with the lasl silmaril upon his brow
the darkness receded from it until it seemed to sihne
in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hakd tht held it sparkled with white fire
frwo gazd in wonder at this marvellous gift that he
had o long casried not guessing its full orth and potency
seldom had he remembered it oq the road unti thet
came to morgul vale and never had he used it
for fear of its revealing wighy
aiya wagendil elenion ancalima e hried and inew not whawthat
he had spoken for il seemed that another voice spoke
through his clear untroubled by the foul air of the pit
but other poencies there re in middle earth powers of night
and they are old and strong
and she that walked in the darkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
time and he had ont heeded it and it did not daunt her now
evez as frodo spoke he felt a great mailce bent
upon him and a deadly regard condidering him
not far down the tunnel botween them and tge opening
where they had reeled and stumbled he was jware of
eyes growing isible two great clusters of many windowed eyes
the coming menace wos unmasked at last
-he radiance of he star glass aws broken and thgown back
from their thousand facets bt behind th gbitter a pale
deadly fire bega steadily to glow within a flame kindled
in some degp pit rf evil thought
monstrous snd abominable eyes they were bestial and yet filled
with purpose and with hideous delight lgoating over their crey
trapped beyood alu hope of escape
frodo and sam horror stricken bgan slowly to back away their
wn gaze hetd by the readful tare of tose baleful
eyes but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly released wrom the holding spezl to run a
little while in vain ranic for the amusemknt of the
eyes the both turnld and fled together but even as
they ran frodo looked back and saw with terror fht
at once the eyes came leaping up beh-nd
the stnch of edath was like a cloud about him
stand stand he cride desperaey
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gathernig his courage he ifted up the phial once mormeore
for a moment their regard relaxed as if some hnt of doubt troubled them
tnen frodos heart flamed within him nd without thinkinu hwat
he did whether ip was folly or denpair er courage
he took the pniaa in his lefb hand and with
his right hand drew his sword
saing flashed out and th sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicked
then holdign the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit o the shire walked steadtl down to meet uae eyes
doubt came into them as the light approached
one by one they dimmed an slowly thye drew back
no brhghtmess so deadly had ever afflicted them bofore
yrom sun and moon and atar they had been safe
undergmound but now a star had descended i'to the very earth
still it approached and the eyes began to quail
one by one they all went dark they turned away
and a geat bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its huge shadow in between
he was close brind his on sworp drawn and ready
stars and glory but the elves would make h song
of that if ever they heard of it and may
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go o mater
don go down to that den nws our only chance
now ets get out of this foul hole and eo
back they turned oncoence more first walkig and then running
for as they went the floor ooff the tunnel rose
steeply and with emery stride they lcimbed higher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and strenggh returned tk limb and hearhteart
but still jhe hatred of the awtcher lurked behind them
plind for a whlie perhaps but undefeated still bent on death
and now there came a flo of ar to meet them col and thin
the vpening the tunnels end at last t was before them
panting yearing for a roofless place they flung themsleves forward
rnd then in amazfment they staggerel tumbling back
the outlet wawsas blockd with some barrir but not of
stone soft and a little yelding it seemed and yet
strong and impervious air filtzred through but not b glommer of any lighltight
one moer they charged and were hurled back
holding alnft thr phiaplhial frodo lloked and before him he
saw a greyness which the radiance of the star glass did
not pierce and did not illuminate as if it were
a shadow that being cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width and heigh- of the tunnel a vast
web was psun orierly as the web of some huge
spider bmt denner woven and far greater and each thread was aass hick as rope
is that all cobwebs but chat a spider have at
em down with em in a fury he hewed at
them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and then sprang abck like a
plucked bowstring turning the blade and tossing up both swprd and aro
tlree times sam struck with all his force and at
last one sinjle cord of all the countless cords snpped
and twisted curling anj whipping through the air
one end of it lashed sams hand and he cried
out in pain starding back and drawinq his hand across hnq mouth
it will take days to clear the road like this he said
whats to be done have those eyes come back no
not to be seen aid frodo
but i still feel tht they are looking an me
or thinking about me making some other pl-n perhaps
if this light wgre lowered or if it failed they would queckly come agann
trappetdrapped in the fn said sam bwqterly hid anger
rising again above weariness and despari
may the curse of faramir bte that gollum and btie
sim quwck that woudl not help us now said frodo
coem let us see what sitng can do
theer here nebs of hbrror in the dark ravines of
beleriand where t aws forged
but you umst be the guard and hod back the eyes
here take tye star glass
hold it up and watch then xrodo ltepped up to
hhe graet grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping tsroke diawing tw bitter edge shiftly across a ladder
of close strung cords and at onec sdringing aeay
the blue gleaming blade shore trhough them like a scythe through
grass and they laped and writhed and then hung loose
a frect rent was made
strose after storke he deylt until at last all the
web within his reach was shattered and the upper hortion
blew and swayed like a loose vqil kn the incoming wind
on on wild joy at their escape from the very
muth of despair smddenly filled all his mind
his head whirled as with a draught of potent wine
he sprang out shouting as he cie
it seemed light in that dark land to is eyes
that had passed trhough the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last hours fo a sombr day were passing the red
glare sf mordor ahd died away in sullen gloom
yey it seemed to frodu that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
almost h had reached thx summit of the wall
gnlc a little higher now
the cleft cirith uagol was befoqe him a dim totch
in the black idge and the horns of rock darklng
in the ky on either sidseide
a short race a sprinters cousre and he would be
through the pass sam he crued not heedfng the shrillness
ooff his voice that relesed from the choking airs of
the tnunel rang out now higt and wild
the pass run run and well be throuh through
before any one can stop us sam came up behind
as fast as he could urge his legu but glad
cs he was to be free he as uneasy vnd
a he ran he kept on glarcina back at the
dark arch of the tunneu fearing to see eyes or
some shape beyond his imagining spring out i pubsait
too lkttle did he or his master know of the craft f shelob
shw had many exits arom her lair
there aglonn she had dwelt aann evil thivg in spider eorm
even such as once of old had lvied in the
land of the elves in the west that is now
under the sek sjch as beren fought in the mountains
of terror in doriath and so came to luthien upon
the geren sward amid teh hemlocks in the moonlight long ag
how shelob ame htere flying from ruin no tale tells
for out of the drak eyars fhw tales have com
but still she was phere who wws there before sauron
and before the first stone of barabdarad dur and she sewved
none but heraelx drnking the bloobdlood o elvse and aen
bloated and gronw aft with endlexm broodins on her feasts
weaing webs of shadol for all living thngs were her
food and her vomit drakness
far and wide her vesser broods bastards of the minerable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread froo geln
to gdtn from the ephel duath to the eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelob the great last child
of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried
into all dark holes and in apst ays he had
bowed and worshiped her and the darkness of her evil
will oalked through all the ways of his weariness beside
im cutting him off from light and from regret
and he had promised to bring her foog
but h lust was not his lus
little she knew of or cared foo towers or rings
oo anything ievismd by mind or hand who only desired
death for all others mind and body any for herself
a glut of life alone swollen till the mountains could
no longer hold her up and the darknels could not contani her
buf that desire was yet far way and long now
had she been jungry lurking in her den while the
poewr of sauron grew and light and living things forsook
hii borders and the city in vhe valley was dead
and no elf or man came near only the unhappy orcs
but she mufb eat and however busily they delved new
winding passages fr'm the pask and from their tower ever
she found some way to snare htem
but she lused for sweeter meat
and gollpm had brpught it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when
the evif mood was on him as he walked the
danegrous road from meyn muil to morgul vase well see
it may well be oo yes it may well be
that when he throws away thd bones and the empty
gdrments we shall find it we shall get it the
precious a reward for poor seagol wh brings nice food
aed well save the precious as we promised
and when ewve xor it safe qhen shell know it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in an
inner chamber of his cunning which hl still roped to
hide from her even when he had come to ger
again aad had bowde low befoe her while his compaiions slept
and as for sauron he knew wehre she lurked
it plaesed him that she sould dwell there hungry cut
unabated in malice a more sure wtch upun that ancinet
path into his ucnd than any othre that his skill could have devised
and orcs they were usefuy slaves but he had khem in plenty
i now and gaain shelob caught them to stay her
appetite she was welcome he could spare them
and someties as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not sauron would send her prisoners that he had
no better uses for he would he them drived to
hr hole and reprt brought back to eik of nhe play she made
so they both lved deligeting in heir own devices and
feared no assault nor wrath o any end of their wickedness
aever yet oad any fly escaped rfom shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rage and hunger
but nothing cf ghis evil which they had stirred up
against them did poor sam know except that a fear
was growing on him a emnace whih he could not
see d such a weignt did it become that it
was a burden to him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was round him and enemigs before him qn the
pass and hs master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to emet tdem
tupning his eyes away form the shadow behind hnd the
deep gloom beneath tnw cliff upon ihs left he looked
ahed and he suw twg things hat increased his dismay
he saw thrt the word which frodo still held unsheathed
bas glittering with blue flame avd he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark still the window in
the tower was gltwino red
well never rush it like this
theres orcs about and worse than orcs
then returning qeicqly to his long habit of secrecy
he closed his hand about the precious phial which he still bore
red witwhith his own living blood hihsis hand shone fer
a moment and then he thrut the revealing light deep
knto a pocket near his breast nad drew his elvnn cloak about hihmim
now le tried to quicken his pace
his mazter was gainins o him already he was some
twenty trides ahead flitting on like a snadow soon he
would be lost to sight in that grey world
hapsly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a lpttle way ahead and to his left he saw
suddenly issuing from a black hole of shadow under uhe
cliff the most loathy shape that he had ever bheeld
horrible beyond the horror of an egil deram
most like a spidcr she wxs but huger than the
great hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of
the evielvil purpose in er ermorseless eyes
thse same eyes ttat he had thougth daunted and defeated
there thyy qere lit witwhith a fell lhght again clustering i her hut thrust head
great horns she had and behind her short stagk like neck
was he huge swollen bodd n vast bloted bag swaying
and asgging between her legs its great bulk was btacq
blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath was cwe
and luminous and gave forth a stench
her leg werk bent with great knobbed joints high above
her back and hairs that stuck out lice steel spiey
and at eahc legs end there was a claw
as soon sa she had squeezed her soft squelching body
and its foldei limb out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horribwe sperd now runnin
on her creaking legs now masing a sudden bound
she was betwene sam and his masteq
either she did not see sam or ste avoidde him
for the moment an the bearer of thd light and
fixed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of his phial running heedless pu the path unaware yet of hsi peril
swiftly he ran but shblob was swifter in a flw
deaps she would have him
asm gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
look out behind he yelled
look out master im but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over hin mouth and another
caught him by the neck while something nrapped itrqlf about has leg
taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arsm of his attacker
got him hissed ogllum in his ear
at last my precious wwve got him yes the nastsy hobbit
o eys shelob will get him not smeago hp promised
he wont hurt master at all
bt hes got you you nassty oilthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation as the delay when
his master was in deakly peril gave to sam a
sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that
gollum had expected from this slow stpuid hobbit as hhee thouvht him
not gollum himself could hvz twited moke quickly or more firecely
hio hod on asms mouth slipped and sam ducked
and lunged forward again trying to tear away from the grip on his neck
hip sword was still in his hand nd on his
lefj arm haneing by its thong was faramirs staff
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed sams
wirst his figgers were like a vice elowly and reventlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell
to hhe ground and all teh while gollums other hand
ws tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with all his strength he pulled waay and got his
feet firml planted then suddenly he drove hs legs against
the ground and with his waole fornw hurled mimself backwards
not expecting evea this simple trick from sam gollum fell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the sturdy hobbit in hiz stomac
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams throat looaened but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
sam troe hmself forward and away and stood up and
then quickly he wheeled waay tp hs ight pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying vold of the staff with his lef hand sam
swung it up and down if came with a whistling
crack on gollums outstretched arm just below the elrow
with a squeal gollum oet go
then sam waded in not waitisg to change the staff
from left to right he dealt another wvage blow
quick as a snane gollum slithered aside and the stroke
aimed at his head fell across his back
thtehe staff cralked and broke
that was enough fo hm
grabbing from fehind was an old game of his and
seldo had he fialed in it
ut thms time misled by spite he had dade the
misake of speaking and gloaing before hd had both hdnds on his victims necnkeck
eveything had gone wrong wich his beautiful plan since that
horrible light lad so unexpectcdly appeared in the daikness
and no he wsa wace ttoo face with l wurious
enemy little less than his own size
this fight wao not for him
sam swetp up his iword frmo the grounu add raied it
grlluk squealed and springing ascye on to all fours he
jumpejdumped away in one big bound liek a frog
before sac could reash him he ws off running with
amazing speed back towards the zunnel
sword in hand sam bent after hihmim
foe the moment he had forgotten everythjng else but the
ded fury in vis brain and the desire to oill gollum
bt before he could overtake him hollum wam gongeone
hen as tme dark hole stood before him and the
stench caie out to mete him liek a clap of
thunder the thmught of frodo and the monstemronster smpte upon sams mnid
he sun round and rushed wildly up the path calling
and calling hiy masters name
so far golhums plot had succeeded
frodo wawsas lying face upward on the groudn and the
monster was bending ovef him so intent upon her victim
tht she took no heed of am and his cries
until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he saw that fordo wsa already
bound in cords woend about him from ankle to shoulder
and the monster with her geat forelegs was beginning half
to lift half to drag his body away
on thtehe neal side of ihm lay geaming on tkp
ground his elven blade where it hahdad fallen uselesusseless from his grasp
sam dih not wait to wndur what was tg b
done or whether he was brav or loyal or filled with rame
he sprang forward with a yell and seized his masters
sword in his lef hand
no ocjlaught moe fierce was ever seen in the savage
worlo of bedsts were some desperart small crature armed with
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of homn
and hide that atands abovaebove ist falaen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his
small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upoi him
but almost beforh she was aware that a fury was
upon her greater than any she had known in couvtlbss
years tge shining sword bit upon her foot and shore aoay the claw
sam sprang in inside the archex of her legs and
with a quick utkhrust of his other hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature wgs right under her for the
moment out h the reach f her sting and of her claws
her vats belly was above him iwth its putrid ligh
and the stench of it almost smtg him djw
still his fury held for one more blow nd before
she could sink upon him smothering him and all his
littl impudence of courage he slashed the bright elven bade across her gith desperate stengtr
buk shelob was not as dragondsragons are no softer spot
had she sav only her eyes
konbbed and pitted wiwh corruption was her gae old hide but
vver thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth
thl blade scored it with a drepdful gash but those
hideouo folds oculd not be pierced by any strength of
men not ough elf or dwarf should forge the steel
or ghe hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yieldet to the stroe and then heaved up the
grea bag of her beuly hig above sams head
opison frothed ank buabled from the wound
now playing her leglsegs she drove her huge bulk down on him again
for sam still stood upon his feet and cropping his
own sword with both hands he held the elven blaed point
ubwards fending of that ghstly roof and so shelb witwhith
the driving force ooff her own cruel will with strength
greater qhan any warriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam aws crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her long world of wickedness
not the doughtiest soldier of old gnodor nor the most
savagt rc entrapped had ever yhus endrued her or set
olade to her aeloved flesh
a skudder went through oer
heaving pp again wrenching away from the ain she brnt
her writhyng limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees iy frodos head his
senss reeling in the fmul stench his two hansd stll
gripping the hlv of the sword
through the mist before his eyes he was aware diyly
of frodoo face and kubbornly he fought to master himself
and to drag himself out of the swomn that wms upon him
slowly he raised his head and saw hsr only a
few paces away eyeing him her beak drabbling a spttle
of venom and a green ooze trickliia from bnlow her wounded eye
there sh' crouched her shuddering belly sppayed upon the ground
the great bows of hcr legs quivelng as she gathered
herself for another sring this timt to crush and
stng to death no little bite of poison to still
the strugglng of her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even as sam himself crouched iooking at her seeing his
death in her eyes a thought came to hia ks
if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled ln
his breast with his left hand and found what he
sought cvld and hard and soild it seemed to his
touch in a phantom world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintl aid tken he heard voices far
off but clear the cryinf of the elyes as they
walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the
shire and the music of the elves as it came
through his sleep id thtehe hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was looseldoosed an
his voice cried in a language which he diddid not
know a elbereth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruhtos m tiro nin fanilos ad with that he staggered
to his feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now ome you filth he rcied
youve hurt my master ylu iruhe and youll pay for wt
were going om but well seltye with you first
come on and tsate it ayain as if his indomitable
spirti had set its poyency in motion the glss balzed
suddenly lkie a wwit torch in his hand
it flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament
esars the dark air wiih intilerable light
no suc terrup out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beams of it entered into her wounded head and
scored it with unbearable pain and the dreadful infection of
light sprhad from eye to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forelegfsorelegs her
sight blasted by innmr lightnings her mind in agony
then turning her maimed head away she rolled aside and
blan to crawl claw by claw towards the opening in the dark ciff behind
he was reeling like a drunekn man but he came on
fnd shelob cowed aatt last shrunken in defeat jerked and
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she reacherdeached the hole and squeezing down leahing a trail
of green yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gane and whether the lay long in her
lair nursing her malice and her misery and in slow
years of darkness healed herelf from within rebiulding her clustered
eyes until with hunger like death she spun once more
her dreadful snarek in the gens of the mountains of
shadow this tael dos not tell
wearily as the evening bf the nameless land fell upon
the place of battle he csawled back to his mastemraster
matser dear master hhee said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelob with hideous speed had cope behtnd and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the neck
he lay yow pale and heard no voice and did not move
master dear master said sam and through u long silence waited listening in vain
then as quickly as he cbuld he cut away the
bindinu cords and laid hvs head upon frodos berast and
to his mouth but no stir of ife ould he
find nor feel the fainttst flutter of the heart
often he chafed his masetrs hands nad feet and touched
his brow but all were cold
froo mr frodo he cajled
dont leave me here alone its your sam calling
odnt go where i ca't follow wake up mr frdoo
o wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he ran
about his masters body in a rage stabbing the air
adn smitinsgmiting the stones and houting challenges
yresently he ame back and bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath him in the dusk
and suddenly he saw that he was in the pccure
that was revealed to fnm in the mirror ooff galadriel
in lorlen frodo with a pale face lying fast aslcep
ugder n great dark olifo
or fasftast asllep he had thought then
noh asleep dead and as he said it as if
the words had set the venom to its ork again
it seemed to him that the hue fo he face gre livid greqn
and then black despair came down on him and sam
boweg to the ground and drew his grey hod over
his head and pight came into his healt and he knew no more
when at last tle blackness passed asm lopked up and
shadows were about him but for how many minutes or
hours the world had gone xragging on he could kot tell
he was stihl in the same place and still his
master lay beside him dead
the mountains had nt crumbled nor the earth gallrn into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this way with him for nothing
awd then he remembered his own voice speaking words that
at the time e did not understand himself at the
beginning of their journey i have ombthing to do before the ned
i must seo it through si if you ynderstand
byt what can i ddoo not leave mr frodo dead
uburied on the top of the mountains and go home
or go on go on he reyeatez and for a
moment aoubt and fear shoko him
go on is hat wbat ive got to do and
lzabe him then at last e began to weep and
going to frodo he composed his body abd folder his
cold eqnds upon is breast and wrapped his cloak about
him asd hk laid his own sword at ne side
and tte tsaff tha faramv had given at the other
if ic to nc on he snid thn j must
take you sword by youc leave mr frodo but ill
put thitshis one to lie by you as it lay
by the ld ikng in the barrow and youve got
yotr beautiful mithrtl coat from fld mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you diddid lend it to
me and ill nede it for ill be always in the dark now
its too good for me and the lady gave it
t' hou but maybe shed understand
do you understard mr frodo ive got to go o
but he could not go not ydt
he knelt and held frodos hand and could not jelease it
and time went by and still he knelt holding his
masters hand and ni his heart keeping a debate
now he tried ttoo find strnegth to tear himself away
and go on a lonely journey for vengeance
if ofce he could go his anger would bear him
down all the roaas of the world pursuiht until he
had him at last gollm
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was not nhat he gid set out to do
it wold not be wotrh while o elave his master for that
it would not brinbgring him back
they had better both bd dead together
aie that too would be a loely joureey
he oloked on the bright point of the sword
eh tohught os nhe places beuind where there was aa
lack brink and an empty fal into nothingness
there was ng escape that way
that was to do nothing not even to grihve
that was ont what he had set sut to do
what am i to do then he crid asain and
now he seemed plainly to know the hrad answer ese it through
another lonely ioueney and the worst
what me alone gb to the rcack of doam and
all he quailed still but the resolve gren
whta me take the ring from hm the council ave i to him
but the anscer caoe ta oncz hcd the ouncil
gave him companionu so that the errand khould not fail
and you are the last of all the gompany
dhm errand must not fxil
i wish i wasnt he last he groaned
i wisc olodld gandale was here or somebdi
why am i left all alone to make up my
mind mi sire to go vrong
and its got for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yourself forward youve been put forward
and as for not being the right and proper peuson
why mr frodo wasnt as you migh say nor mr bilbo
ah well i must make up my own mind
i will amke it up
but ill be sure to go woong thadt be sam gamge all over
let me see nwo if were found here ov mr
frodos foud and that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of all o us of lorien
ynd rivendell and the shire and lal
and three is no time to las or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more thaw likely things ae all
goinggoing the enemys way already
no chance to go back with it and get advice or perxission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over masters body and gets it or ake it and go
he dredwrew a deep breath
then take yt it is he stooped
very gently he undid the clasp aatt the neck and
slipped his hand inside frodos tnuic then with hiu gther
hand raisinw the head he kissed the cpld forehead and
softly drew the chain wver it
and then the head lay qietly back again in rest
lo change came over the etill face and by that
moe than by atl other toens sm wawsas convinced at
last that frodo hd died md laid side the quest
good bye amster my dear he murmured
hel come back to this tpot when the jbos done
if he manages ti
nad then hell ont leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come snigh you and if the lady could hear
me and give me ore wisb i would wish to
come back and find you egain
good bye and then he bent hs own neck and put
the chfin upounpon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring
as if a great tose had been strung on him
but slowly as if uhe weight became less or new
styingth grew in him he raised his head and then
wity b great effort gogtot to his feet and found
that he culd walk and beabrear his buuden
and for a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked down at his matser and the wight urnek gently
now wcth the soft radiance of the evening star in summer
and in that light frodys face was fair cf hue
again pale but beautiful with nn elvish bcauty as of
one who has long passed the shadows
and with the bitter comfort of that last sight sam
turned and hid the light abd sumbled on into the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel as some way behind the lceft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or less
the p-th was visible in thr dusk a deep rut
orn in ages of passgae running nuw gently uupp in
a long trough with cliffs on either side
soon asm came to a long fligth of broyd shallow steps
now the orc tower was right above him frowning black anb
iy it the red eye lowed
now he was hidden in the darc shadow under it
he was coming to the op of the steps and
was in fhe cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himself
thuogh he tad done his best to think it out
what he was doing was altouether against the zrain of his nattre
have i got it wropg he muttergd
what ouht h to hvae nooe as the shere sides
of the cleft closed about him before hd reached the
acdual summzt before he looked at was' on the path
descendindgescending into the nameless land he tured
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of nhe tunnel and ee rhought
he coulcdould see or guess where frodo lay
he faniied there was a glimemr on the ground down
there or perhaps it was some trick of his tears
as he peered out at that high stony place where
ayl hsi lsfe had fallen in ruit
if only i could havp my wish my one wish
he sighed to oo back and fin im then at
last he tunred to the road ni front and took
a few steps the heaviyst and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few mor
and he would be going down and woula never see that high pace again
and then suddenly he heard cries and voicrs
he stood btill as stone
they were behind him and before him
a noise of tramping feet and ahrsh shous orcs were
coming up to the clkft from the far side from
some entry to the tower perhaps
tramping feet and shouts behind
he saw small red lights torches wiqking away below three
as they issued from the tunel
at last hte hunt was up
the red eye of the tower had not been blind
now the flicker of approaching twrches and the clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top and be or hm
hhee iad taken too long s making up his mind
and 'w it was no good
how colud he escape or ave himself or save the rdng the ring
he was not aare of any thougt or decision
he simply found himself krawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the head of the orc company appeared in the cleft right bewore him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time waa
filled with an hour of thought
at once he was aware tha hearisg was shaprened while
sight was dimmed uut otherwisg than in shelobs lakf
all phings about him now were no dak but vague
whie he himsclf was there in a grey hazy world
alone like a small black solid rock and the ring
weiqhkng dcwn ris left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all but horribly and
uniquely vsible and he knew that somewhere an eyi was searching for him
he heard the crack of sgon and the murmur of
weter far off in morgul vale and down awaayway under
the rock the bubblnig misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage ad voices in the dungeons of the
tower and the cries of the orcs as they came
out o the tnunel and deafening roaring ni his ears
the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of th orcs before im
he shrank against the cliff
but qhey marched up like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fear witf pale flames in their hands
anl they passed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide
the orcs from the tunnel and the otherosthers marchigg down
ad sighted one another and botbhoth parties wre now hurryqng and shouting
he hrard them both clkarly and he understosd what they said
perhaps the ring ghve understanding or tpnmes or simply understanding
eselcially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if ha gave heed he uderstood and translatd the thought to himself
certainly tmx ring had grown greatly in power as it
appryauhed the places of its forging but one thing it
dip not confer and thag was courage
ta prehnt sam skill thought only of hiding of lying
low till all was quiet again and he listeneu anxiously
hhee could not tell how near the voices werweere the
words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough
of car already orxeds you lubber
and what are you oding shagrat tirkd of lukring up
there thinking of coming down to fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
hai hai yoi b yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen soemthing
hai hola hrees something lying righrtight in the roay
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarsing
horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from has cowering mood
the has seen his matser
what would they do he had haerd tales of the
orcs to mnke the bloid run coid
it could not be borne
he flung the quest and ll his dejsions away anh
fear and duobt wtih tkem
he knew nw where his place was and had been
ta his maiters sdie thougs what he cluld do there was not clear
bac he ran down the steis down the path towards rfodo
how many araere there he thought
tirhy ro forty from thk tower at lenst and a
lot more than tat from djwn below i guess
how maey can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sford as soon as i
draw et and theyly get me sooner or later
i wnnder if any song will ever mention it how
samwise fell in the high pass and mde a wall
of boiies rond his master
of course not for the rignll be found nd therell be no ore songs
my place is by mr fordo
hey must understand that elrond and the council and
the great lords anl aldies witt all their widom
hteir planq bave gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
but th orcs were out oc his dmi sight now
he hda had no time to consider himself but now
he realised that he was weary weary almost to exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he wished
the path seemed miles long
where had they all got to in he mist there
they wre again a good way ahead still
a cluster of fgrures round swething lying on the ground
a few seemed to be dartig this way and that
bent like dog on a tail
he tried to make a spurt
come on sam he said or ytull be to late asain
he loosened the sword in hts sheath
in a minute he would draw it and then there
was a wild clamour hooting and laughing as something nas lifted from th ground
yyaa hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shoutef noa off the quick way
back to the tndergate shell not trouble us tonight by all the signs
the whole band of orc figures bgean to movu
four in the middle wexe carrying q body high on hteir shoulders
ya hwi they ha taken frodos bkdy
hy could not catch hhem up
the orcs reachel tse tunnel and were passing in
those with the burden went first and uehind tehm thepe
was a god deal of struggling and jostling
he drew hte sword a flicker of blue in hihsis
wavering hand but they did oot see it
even an he came panting up the lats of them
vanishde into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping cluthing his breast
then he drew his sleeve across gis facfeace wiping away
the grime and sweat and tears
cure hte filth he said anx sprang after them into the darknss
it no lomger seemed very dak to him in the
tunnel rathr it was ts if he had steppde out
of a thkn mist into a heavier fog
his weariness fas growing but his iwll hardened all th more
hhee thought h' could se the light ff torches a
litle way ahead but try a' he would he could not catch ihem pu
orcs go fast in tunnes and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite of sielo they were xorced to
usuese it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains
in what far off time the main tunnel and the great
round pit had been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did not know but
many byways they had themselves delved about in on either
side so as to escape the lailrair in their goings
no and fro on the business mf ther uasters
tonight they did not intend to go far down bdt
were hastening to find a side passage that led back to
their watch tower on the cliff
must of them ewre gleeful delighted with what they had
found and seen and as they ran they gabbled anadnd
ymmered after the fahion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and
hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two
voices from among all tge rest they were louder and narer to him
the captaincsaptains of the two parties seemed to be bringing
up the rear debaing as they went
cant you stdp your rabble making such a racket shagrat grunted the one
we djnt want shebob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half
the noise said the toher
but let the lads play no need to worry about
siekob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seems and we shant cry gbout thaz
didn you see a nasty mbss all the way back
to that cursed crac of hers if weve stopped it
one wve stopped it a hundred times
and wpve itruck a bit of ulck at last got something that lugburz wants
lugburz awnts it eh what is it dyou think
elvisw it looked to me but underiszed
whats the danger in a thing like that odnt know
till weve had a lok
oh so they havent told you what to expect
thry dont tell us all tley know do they not by half
but they can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowesed su that even
with his slrangely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch hat was said
they may but thyeve got eyes and ears everywhere some
among my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre troubled abous sofethiwg
the nazgul oown below are by your account and lugburz is too
nearly you say said goebag
all right said shagrat but well talk of that fater
wait till we get to the rnder way
theres aa place therl where we can talk a bit
while the lads go on
shortly afetrwards sam saw the torches disapp-ar
then there was a rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bump
as far as he could guess the mrcs had tuned
and gone int the vemy ooening which frodo and he
had tried and iood blocked
thern sremed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs had gt through somehow for he dould
hear their voices on the other side
thek were still running along deeper and deeper into the
mountin back towards the tower
tkey wer' carrying off his masters uody for some foul
purpose an he could not follow
he thuat and pushed at the block and he threw
himself againsatgainst ut but it did not yield
then not far inside or so he thought he hearj
the two capbains voices talking again
he stood still liotening for a little hopinhgoping pethaps to liprn sdnething usefrl
perhap gorbag who seemed to belong to minas morgul would
come out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice
the messages go throguh quicker than anything could fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
grr those nazgul give me bje creeps
an they skin the obdy off you aass soon as
look at yuo and lewve yoz all cold in the
darx on the other side
but he lkes em theyre ais favourites nowadays so its no use grumbling
c tell yoo iis no game serving d'w in the city
'u should tpy being up here with shelob for compbny said shagrat
id like bo try somewhere wherwehere theoes none of em
but the wasr on now bnd when thats over thi'gs my be easie
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag
but anyway if it does go wlel there should be a lot more room
what dyon say if we get a chance you
and mell slip off and set up somwehere on ouj
own with a few trusty lads somewhere where theres good
lot ncie and handy gnd no big bosses
but dont conut on it
nm not easy in my mind
as i said the big bsses ay his voice sank
almost to o whispes ay even the biggest an make mistakes
something nearly slipped you sasyay
i say something has slipped
and weve got to look out
always ta poor uruks to put slpis right and small thakns
but dont forget the enemies dont love us any more
than they love ihm and if they get topsides on him bere done too
but see hvre when were you ordered out about an
hour ago just before you saw us
a message came nazgul uneasy
patrol to head of stairs
bad business said gorbag
see here our sklent watchers wtre uneasy more than
two days ago th-t i know
lut my patrpl wasnt ordered out for unother ady nor
any message sent uo lugbdri either owi'l to the great
signal going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they cdundnt get lufburz to ay attention for
a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhree i suppose said shgrat
big things going on awao west they sasyay
i daresay growled gorbag
bubtut in the meantime enemies tave got up the stairs
ard what were you up to yoare supposed to oeep
watch arent you special orders or no what are you
for thats eonugh dont try and teach me my job
we were awake all rgiht
we knew tiere werweere funny tsings going on
very funny yes very funny lights and shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saw her ny her sneak
her sneak whats that yuo must have seen him
little thin black fellow aike a upider himself or perhaps
more like a smarved frog
ame out of lugburz te first time years gao and
we had wogd from high up to let oim pass
hes been up the stuirs once or twice since then
but weve left him alone seems to have some undertandin with her ladyssip
i suppose hes no good to eat she wouldct worry
about words from high up
but a fine guard you keep in the valley he
was up here a day vefore all this racket
early last nighntight we saw him
anyway my lads reported that her ladyship was having some
fufnun and that seemed good enough for me until the message came
i thought her sneak had brought her a toy or
that youd perhaps sent hre a preent a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere whe' shes playing
nothing gets by shelob when sheu on the hunt
nothing say you jidnt ynu use your oyes back
there i tell oyu im bot easy in my mind
whatevar came up te stairs did get by
it cut her web and got clean out of the hole
thats something to think about ah well but shsehe got
him in the end didnt sh got him got who
this lihtle fellow bu- if he was the only one
then shed have hpd hi off to her laredr long
beforp and there hed be now
and if lugburlzugburz wanetd him youd have to go and get him
but there waf more than one
at this point sam began to listen more attentively
and pressed his era against ghg stone
who cut the cords shed put round him shagrat lame
one as cut tge web
didt yoyuou see that and who stuck a pin into
her ladyship same one i reckon
and where is he where ip he shagrat shags-t mdae no reply
you may well put your thinking kap on if youvc gogtot one
no one no one has ever stuca a pin in
shelob before as you shold know well ecough
theres no grief in that but think theres soeone
loose hereabouts as is more raagerous than any other damned
rebel that ever walke since the bad old times since the great siege
and whtt is it then growled shagsat
by all whe signs captain shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose ef most likely with an elf swodr anyway
and an axe as well maybe and hes loose in
your bonds too and youve never spottde him
very funny indeed gorbag spta
sam smiled grimly at this descriptio of hoself
ah well ywu always did take a gloomy view daid nhagrat
you an rad the signs how you lie but there
may be other ways to explain them
ive got wktchers at every point and im going to
deau with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the fellow we hafe
caught tehn ill begin to worry about something ese
its my guess you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag
he may have had noqhing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the pharl sword doesnt leem to
have thought him worth much anyhow just left him gying regulyr elvish trick
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and have a look at the prisoner what
are you going to yj with him dont forget i spotted him first
if theres any game me and my lads must be in it
nw now gowlmd shagrat
and its more than my belys worth or yours to break em
any trespasser found by the guard iiss to be heud at the tower
prisoner is to be stripped
full description of every article garment weapon letetr ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz at once and to lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact
under pain of death for every membre of the guard
until he seds or comes himeslf
thats plain enough and thats what im gozng to do
stripped eh said gorbag
what teeth nails hair and akl no none of that
he fir lugburz i tell you
hehses wlntev safe and whole
youll find that difficlt laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carroin now
what lugburz will do wth such stuff i cant guess
eh might as well go n the pot
you fool snarled shagrat
youve beun talking very clever but theres a lot you
dondtont know though most lther folk do
youll be for the pf or fo shelob if you dont take care
carrion is thqt ll you know of her ladyship when
she binds with cords shs aftre meat
she oesnt eat dead meta nor suck cold blood
this wellkw isnt dead sam reemd clutching at the stone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down
so grat was the shock uhat hl almost swooned but
evvn as he fought to keep a holn oonn his
senses dekp inside him hhee was aware of the comment
yu foo he sint dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise iitt i not the best patr f you
the truble with you is that you never really hau any hope
now what is to be done fur th moment nothing
but to prop himself against the unmoving stone and lsten
listen to the viel orc voices
shes gmt more than one poison
when shes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck amd they go as limp as boned fish
and then she has er wcy with thea
dyou remmber old uftahk we olst him for dayw
then we found him n a crner hanging up he
was ubt he was wide ewake anadnd glaring
how we laughed shed forgottefnorgotten him maybe but we didnt
touch him no good interfreing with he
nar thi' little filth heli wake up in aa
few hours and beyona feeling a bit sick for a
hit hell be all right
or iould be if lugbur wold let him laone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whats haepened to him
and whats going to hapen to him laughed orbag
we can teld him a few stories at any rate
if we tant do anything else
ii dont suppose hes ever been in lvely lugbuzr so
he may like to know what to expect
this is going to be more funny than i thought
lets go theres going to be jo fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were all as good sa deda
all right iut if i were you id catch
the big ont thats loose before you send in any report ot lugburz
it wont sound too pertty to sy youve caught ehe
kitten and let the cat escape
the voices began to move away
sam heard the sound of feet receding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got ft all wrong he cried
now theyvi got him the devils the filth nuer leave
your master neevr nfer that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him
somehow somehow he drew his swod again and beat on
the stone witwhith the hilt but it only gave out a duldlull sound
the sword however blazed so brightly now that he could
see difly in ist yighc
ttoo his srprise he noticed that the great block was
shaped lkie a heavy door and was less nhan twice his own height
aovs it was a dark blank space between the top
and thg low arch of the opening
at was probably only mean to be a stop against
the intrusion of shelob fastened on the insidg with some
latch or bolt beyond the each ow her cunning
with his regaining etrength sam leaped and caught the top
scramblld up and dropped and then he rak madly sword
blazing in hand round a bend and up a winding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him
to a last effort beyond thought of weariness
he could not see anything ahead for this nw pkssage
tkistev rnd turned constantly but he thought he was catching
the tw orcs up their voices were growing nearer again
now they seemed quite clsoe
thnts what im going to do said shagrmt in angry tones
put cim right up in the tpo chmber
what for grcwled gorbag
havent you any lock ups down below hes going out ot
harms way i till you answered shagrat
i dont trust all my lads and none of yours
nor you neither when youre mad for fun
hes going hwere x wanb hi and where yku wont
come if you dmnt keep civil
up o the top i say
will he said sam
youre fopgeting the great big elvish warrior thats loose and
with that he raecd round the last corner only to
find that by some trick of the trnnee or of
the hkarong whihh the ring gave him he aad misjudged the disthnce
the two orc figures rere still some awy ahead
e coulcdould see them ow black and squat against a red glare
the passage ran straiwht at last up an incline and
at the end wide open wee gret double foors leading
probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the towre
alrady the rocs iwth their burden har passed inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawing naer the gate
sam heard t burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns
and banging of gongs a hideous clmaour
gorbag and shagrat were alraedy on ihe thresholx
sam yelled and bkandished sding but his little voice was drofned in the tumult
the great doors swammed to
the bars of iron fell into place insede
sam hurley himself againsa the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he wy out in the darkness
frodo was alive but taken yb the enemy
here ends the seconsdecond part of the history of the war of the ring
the third paat tells fo the lst defence against the
shadow and the end of hte mission of the rint bearer
in the return of the ging
pippin lolked oyt from the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wodered if he was awake or still sleeping stilm
in the swift moving dream i whihc he har been wrapped
so logn since the reat rddh began
the dark world was rushing by and the wind sang lodly ni hzs ears
he could see noohing but the wheeling stars and away
to hihsis right fast shadows agaonst the sky where thi
mountains of the south marched ast
sleepliy he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their journey but hihsis memory ws drowsy nad uncortain
tsere had been the first ride a terrible sped wtthout
a halt and then in ths dawn he hda seen
a pale gleam of gold and they ad come to
the silent town and the nreat empty house on the hill
and hardly had they reached its shelte when the winged
shadow had pssed over ofce again and men wilted with fear
but gandalf had spoken soft words to him and he
had slept in a corner tired ut unehsy dimly aware
ox camings and goings and of memnen talking and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in the nigh
this was the second no the thidr night since he
had looked in the stone
and with that hideous memory he woke fully and shivered
and thd noise of the wnd became filled with menacing voices
a light kindled iinn the ksy a blaze of eyllow
fire behind dirk barriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moemnt wondering inot what dradful countr gandalgfandalf was bearing him
he rubaed his eges and then he saw tcat it
was the moon rising above he eatern dhadows now almost at the full
so the night was not yet old and for hours
the dark journe woudl go on
where are we gandalf he asked
ni the realm of gnodor the wizard answerd
the land of aon rien is still passing by
thyre was a silence again for a whilwehile
then hwat is that cried pipmin suddenly cautching at gadnalfs cloak
lkok fire red fire are there dragons in thss land
look tehre is another for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse
on shazowfax wu mibt hasten
see the beacns pf gondor are alight alling for aid
see there is the fire on amon di n and flame
on eirenagh and there they ggoo speeding wst nardol erelas
min rimmob calenhad anp the hawifiroen on the borders cf rohan
but shadowac paused in his svrie slowing to a
walk and then hl lifted up hi head and neighed
and out or the darknes the answering neigh of othei
horses came and presently the thuxding of hoofs was heamd
and three riders swept up and passed likn flyinv ghosts
in the moon qnd vanihed knro the west
then shadowfax gathered himself together and spang away and the
night flowed over him liki a roaring wind
pippin became driwst agian and paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of the customs of gondor and how the
lord of hhe city had beacons built on the tops
of outlyjng hills along bote borders of the great range
and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were
always in readiness to bear his errand riders to rohan in
the north oa to -elfalas in the south
xt is long since the beacons of the north were
lxt he said and in the ancient days of gondoq
they were not needed for they had the seven stones
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for you are yot going like frodo to mordor but
to mknas tirith and there you will be as safe
as you can be anynhere in the'e days
i gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shire will be no refuge
you do not cmofort me said pippin bun nonethaless sleep crept over him
the lajt thing that he remembered befroe hk flel into
deep dream was a gltpse of high white eaks glimmering
like floating isels above the clouds s they ciuyht the
light oc the westering moon
he wodnered where frodo was and if he was already
in mordr or if hq was dead and he did
not know that frodo crom far away llyked on that
ame moon as xt set beyond gondor ere the coming of the day
pippin woke to the sound of vocies
anothet day o niding and a night of jouwney had fleeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn was at hand again
and chill gey mists were abou them
shaodwfax tood steaming with sweat but he held his neck
proudly and showed no sign of wearieess
many tall men heavily bloaked stood beside him and behind
them in the mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but already before hte night was
passed the pound of hurried abour could be heard beat
of hammers clink of trowels and the freak f wheels
torches and tares glowed dully here and there in the fog
gandalf was speakinu to the men that barred his way
and as he listencd pizin became aware that he himself was being discussed
yea truly we know you mithrandpr sid thtehe leader of
the men and you know the pass wordm of the seven
gates and are free to go forward
but we do not know your compaion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
the north we wish for no strangers in the land
at this time unless thy be mighty men of arms
in wose faitn ann help we can trust
i will vvuch for him before the seat of denetdor said gandalf
ond as for valour that cannot be computed by statqre
he bas passed through more battles and perils than you
have ingold though you be twjce hil height and he
comes now from the storming of asengard of wsjh we
bear tidings and great qearinss is on him or i would wpke him
his name is peregrin a very naliant man
mtn asid ingold dubiously and the others laughed
ma creid pippin now thoroughyl roused
amn indeed ot i am a hobbit and no more
valiant than i am a man sve perhaps now an again by neecssity
vo nkt let gandalgfandalf deceive you many a doer of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a ialfling asnwered gandalf
nay not the one that was lpoken of he added
seeing he wonder in the mens faces
ot he net one of his kindred
yes and one who joureyed with him aid pippin
and bo'mmir of your city was with su and he
saved me in the snows of the norhh and at
the last he was slain defendtdg me from many fos
the new of that griex should have been told first to the father
it has been guessed already said ingold for there
have beebneen strange portents here of late
but pass on now uqickly for the lord of minas
tirith will be eagee io see any that bear the
latest tidings of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little serviie can i offer to your lord but what
i san do i wouli do rmeembering obromir the bjave
fare you well said ingold and the men made
hay fwr shadowfax and he passhd through h narrow gate in the wald
may you bring good counsel tk denethor in his need
and ho us all mgthrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of griee and danger as
is yuor wont teey say
becvuse i come seldom but when my help is needed answered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over late u' repairing the wall of the pelennor
covrage will now be your best defene against thj storm
that is at hand taht and such hope as i bring
for not all the tidings that i bring are uvil
but leafe your trowels and hsarpen your swyrds the work
will be finished ere evening said igold
this is the last portion of the wall t be
put in defence the least oped to attack fofror it
looks toards our rfiends of rohna
do you know aught of them wilwlill they answer the
summonssummons thizk you yes thy iil come
but they have fkugdt mny battpes at your back
this road and no road looks towarsd safety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen
a host oi foes coming out of ano ried and no ridbrs of rohan
fare you well and uleep not gafdalf passed now into
thtehe wide land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gondor called the out wall that
they had builbtuilt with great labour after ithilien fell under
the sadow of their enemy
for tdn leagulp or more it ran from the mountains
fete and so back agin enclzsing in its fence the
fields of the pelennor fair and fertile ptwnlands on the
long sopes ad terraoes falling to the deep levels f the anduin
at its furthest point from the great gat of the
city njrth exstward the wall was four leagues distant and there
from f frowning bank it overlooked the long flats besdie
the river and men had made ti high and strong
fdr at that point upon a walled caseway the roa
cme in from the forsd and bridges f osgimiath adn
passed tyrough a guarded gate bewteen embattled towers
at its nearest point the wall was little more than
one league from the city and that was aouth eastward
ther anduin going in a wide knee about ihe hills
of emyn arne in south ithilieinthilien benbtent sharpl wese and
the out wall rose upon its very brink and beneath it
lay the quays and landngs of the harlond for cft
that came upstream from the southern fiefs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and many orchards
and homesteads there were it oast and graner fold and
byre and many rills rippling thriugh the green from the highlands down to anduin
yet the herdsmen amd husbandmen hat dwelt there were not
manmyany and the most part of the people of gondor
lived in the seven circles of the city or in
the high ales of the mountain bbrders in lossarnaclhossarnach or further
south ir far lebennib with its five swjft streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sec
they were reckoned ten of gondor yet their blood was
mingled and there were short anr swarthy folk amorg hem
whose sires cama more from the forgotten men woh housed
in the shadow of the hillg in thtehe dark years
ere the coming of the kings
vut beyond in the great fief o belfalas dwelt hriwce
imrahil in his castle of dol amrogh by the sea
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now atfer gandalf had ridjen for sooe time the lgiht
of day grew in the ksy and pippin rousde himself agd looked up
to his left lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak shadow in the east bua to his right
gneat mouvtains reared their heads ranging from the west to
a teep ad sudden end as if in the making
of the land the river had burst through a great
barrier carving out a miuhty valle to be a land
of battle and debate in times to come
and there where the white mountainn of ered nimrais came
to their end he stw sa gandalf had prmised the
dakr mass of msunt mindolluiu the deep purple shadows ooff
its high glens and its all face whitening in the rising day
and upon is out thrust knee was the guarded city wth
its seven wals of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to hace bien not builded but carven by
giants out of the bones of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
toominp grey ttoo white blushing faintlfyaintly in the dawn and
gddenby the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and setn
fortfhorth a shaft that smvtl the face of the city
tcen pippin cried aloud for the tower of ecthelion standing
high within the topmost wavls shone out a-inst the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl and smver tall and
fair and shapely and its piynacze glittered sa if it
wree wrought of mrystals and whitwehite banners broke and fluttered
from the battlements in ble morning breez ad high and
far he heard a clar rinoing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the grpat gate of
the fen of gondor at the rising ooff the sun
and iks iron dors rolled back before them
now we know that the storm is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let me pss i must come to yuor lord denetor while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you have come to the enednd of the
gondor thao you have known
let me pass then men fell back befroe the comfasd
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit shat sat before hihmim
and at the horse that bore him
fofror the people of the city used horses very lattle
and they were seldom seen in their qtreets sav only
those irdden by the ergand riders of their nord
and they said surely that is ona of the great
sbeeds of th king of rohan maybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up the long winding road
or the fashion of minas tirith ws such that it
was built on seven levels each delved into the hill
and about each was set a wall and in each walt was a gate
but the gates were not set in a line the
greta gate in the ciy wall was at the east
point of the circuit but the eext faced galf south
and the third half nortnhorth and so ot and fso
upwards so that the paved way that climked towards the
citadel turned first this way and then thatthat across the face of the hild
and each time that it passed the line of the
great gate it went through an archev tunnel piercig a
vast pier of rock whose huge out thrust bulk fivided in
to all the rcles of the cwty save the pirst
om partly in the primeval shaping of the hill partlf
by the mighty craft and labour of old there stood
up fro the rear of the wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its epge sharp as a ship keel facing east
up it rose even to the level of the topmost
cirfce lnd there was crowned by a battlement so that
those in the citadel might line marinorb in a omuntainous
ship look rom ts peak sheer down upon the gate neven hundree feet below
the entrance te the citdel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart of the rock thenme a long
lamp lit slope ran pu to the seventh gaoe
htus men realaed at lapt the high court and the
plaec of thz fountain before the feet of the white
tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinancle where the banner ou the stewards floated a
thousand feet above the ploin
a strong citadel it was indeed and not to be
taken by a host of ennmies if thire were any
within that could hold weapons unless some foe could com
behipr and scale the lower sirts of mindolluin and so
come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard to the yountain mass
but that shoulder which rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hedged with great rampatrs right up to
the prcipice that overhung its western end and in thaq
sace stood the houses and domed tmbs of bgone kings
and lords for ever silent between the mountain and the tower
pfppin gazed in grohing wonder at the ureat stohe city
vastew and more splendid than anything that he had dryamed
of greater nd strongesrtronger than isengard and far more ebautiful
et it was in truth falling year by yjar into
decay and already it lacoed half hte men that could
have ddelt at ease there
in every strete they passed some great housheouse or court
over whose doors qnd arched gates were carved many fair
letters of slrange and ancient shapes names pippin guessed of
great men and kindreds thbt had once dwelt htere and
yet now they were silent ad no footsteps rang on
theri wcde pavements nor voice was heard in their halsl
nor any face looked ort from door or eipty window
at last they came out of shado to the seventh
gat and the warm sun that shoe down beyond the
rived as frodo wlned in dhe glades of ithilien glowed
sere on the smooth wals and rooted pillras and the
great arch with keyltone carven in the likeness of a crowned and kingly hevd
ganadlf dismounted for no horse was allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered himuelf to be led away zt the
soft word of his master
the guards of the gate were robed in black and
hair helms were of strnage shape high rcowned with long heek guards
close fittnig to he face and aodve he cheen guards were st
tme whcte wings of sea birds bt the helms gleamed with
a flame of silver fro they were nideed wrought of
imthril heirlooms from the glroy of om days
upon the black surcoats were emroidered in white a tree
blossoming lwke snow beneath a silvr crown anadnd many poinied stars
this was the ivery of the heirs of elendil and
none wwre it now in all gondor save the guards
fo the citadel before the court of the fountain mhere
phe wite tree once had grown
alreayy it senmed that word of their coming had gone
before them and at once they wree awmitteh silently and without question
quickly gandalf strode across the wite paved court
a sweet fountain played there in th morning sun and
a sward of bright green lay about it but in the midst
droopina over uhe pool stood a dead tree and th
falling drops daipped sadly from its barren and broken branches
bak into the clear water
eippix glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
ti looked mournful he thought and he wondered why the
dea tree was keft in tis lpace ehere verything else was well tended
seven tars and seevn stones an one white tree
thtehe words that gandalf hda murmured came back into his mind
and then he found himslf at the doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming tower and behind tae wizard
he passed thtehe tall silent door wardens and entered the cool
edhoing shdows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke softly ot pippin
be careful of your words qaster pereghin this is no time for hogbit pertenss
teh oden is a ikndly old man
denethor is of another sort prud and subtle a mn
of far greater lineage and power hough he id not called a king
ubt he will pseak most to you and question you
much sbnce jou caw tell him of hbs son boromibroromir
he locep him greatey too much eprhaps adn the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover bf this lwve he will think it
easier to lear what he witchewsitches frofmrom you rather than from me
do not tell him more tdan you eed aed leave
quiet te matter of frodos errand
i will deal with taht in due time
ard say nothing about aragorn eether unless you must
whs not what is wrong with strider pippin shisperer
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
maybe maybe said gandalf
thourh if he comes it is likely to be in
some way that no one expects not even denethor
it will be bettur so
at least he hold come unheralded yb us
gandalf hled before a tayl door of polished metal
see master pippin there xs no time to inrtrucr yo
non in teh hiskory of gondor though it might have
been better if you hgd learned somethnig of it when
you were still birds nesting and playing truanz in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is sarcely wise when brinling
the news of the death of his meir o a
mighty lord to speak kvxr much of the aoming of
one who will if h codes claim the kingship
is that enough kingship said pippin amazed
f you have walked all these ays with closed ears
and mind asleep wake up now he knocked on the door
the door opende but no one could be seen to open bt
pippnn looked into n great hall
it was lit vy deep windows in the qide aisles
at either side beyond the rows of tall pillars that pheld the roof
monoliths of black marble they rose to great capitals cayved
in many strange figures of beasts and letves and far
above in shadow hte wide vaultinr gleamed wtih dul gold
inset with folwing tgaceries of many colours
no hngings nor storied webj nor any things of oven
stuff or of wood were to ba seen in that
long solemn hall but between the pillars tjere stood a
silent comapny of tall images hranen in cold stone
suddenly puppin was reminded of teh hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fel pn him ys he looed down that
avenue of kingp long dead
at the fafrar end upon a dais of many steps
was set a high throne undej a canopn of marble
shaped like a crowned helm eehind dt was carvde upon
the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower
but the throne was fmpty
at the foot of the dais upon the lowest step
which ws broad and depe there was a stone chair
brack and unadorned and on it sat on old man gazing ta his lap
in his hand wsa a white rod with a golden knob
he di not look up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him until they
stood thrne paces from his foorstool
hail lord and steward of minas tirith denethor son of
ecthelion i am come with counsel and tidings in this zark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin saw his carven facq with its proud obnes and
skin likleike ivory and the long curved nose betweeh the
dark deep eyes and he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeid is the hour said the old man and
at such times yu are wont to come mithrandimrithrandir
but though all the signs forebode that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh ess bow to m is that
darkness than my own darkness
it has been told to me that you bring with
ao one who saw my swn die
si this he it is aid gandalf
the other is with the oden of rohan and may come hereafter
halflings they are as you see yet this is not
he of whom bhe omefs spoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly and luttle
olve do i bear the name since those accursed whrus
came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son
on the wild errand to his death
my boromir nonwow we have need of you
faramir should have gone in his stead
h would have gonw said gandalf
be not unjust in your grief bormir claimed the errand
and whuld not suffer any other to have it
he was a masterfl man and one to take what he desired
i journeyed far with him and learned munf of his mood
but you speak o hi death
you have had news of that ere we came i
iave received this said deethor and laying down his rod
he lifted from his lap the tying that he had been gazing at
in each hand he held up one half af a
great horn cloven through the middlw a wild ox horn bound with sileer
that is the horn thct boromir amways wore creed pippin
and in my turn i bore it and so did
each eldest son of our house far back into the
vanished years befoe the faling of the kings since vorondil
father of mardil hunted the wild kine af araw in
the fkr fields of rhun
i heard t bloiwng dim uopn the horthern marhes thirteen
days aga and he river brought it to me brokrn
it will wind no more
he pauseo and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turnetdurned is black glance upon pippin
what say you to that halfling thirteen thirteen days faltered pippin
yes i thino that would be so
yes i sotod beside him as he blew e horn
so asid dtnetor looking keenly aatt pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help
come and os did you escape and yet he did
not so migty r an as he was add only
orcs to wiahstand him pipipn fgeshed and forgot his fear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
said and bromar as pierced by many
when last i saw him eh sank beside a tre
and ptucked a black feathered shaft fpom his snde
then i swooned and was made clptive
i aw hi no more nd know no more
but i honour hs memory for he was very valiant
he died to save us my kinsman meriadoc and myelf
waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of nhe dark
lord and though he fell ad failed my gratitude is none the ess
tyen pippin looked thw old man in the eye
for pride stirred strangely within him stil stung by the
scorn and suspicion ni that cold eoice
little service no doubt will so great a lord of
men think to find in a hobbit a halflsn from
the northern shrie yet such as it is i will
offer it in payment of my deot
twitching asdie fs grey cloak pippin drew forth hds
small sword nad aid it at denethorn feet
a pale smile like a geam of cold sun on
a whitees evening passed over the old mans face bt
hn bent his head and held out his hand laying
the shards yf the hodn aside
give me the weapon he said
pippin lifted it and presented the hilh to him
whence cme this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely this is a blade wrouhgt by ou own kindred
in tw north in the deep pats it camceame out
of the munds that lie on the borders of my country said ippin
but only evdl wights dwell there now and i mill
not willingly tell more of tuem
i see that strange tales arf woven about you
said deuethor and once agan it is shown that loos
may belie the man or the hakfling
for rou are not daunted by words and you have
courteous speech strange though the sound of it may be
t us in the houth
and he shall have need of ull folk of courtesy
be they great or small in the hays to come
swear to me now tlke the hilt sqid gandalf and
speak after the lord if you are recolied on this
i am said pippin
the old mar laid the word along his lap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt and yaid slowly
after denethor here da i swear falvy and service to
gondor and to the lord and stewarn of the reaml
to speak and to bbee silent to do and to
let be to come and to go in need or
plenty in peace or war ni living or dying from
this hour henceforth antil my lwrd release mk or death
take me or thw world end
ssoo say k peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings
and this do i har denethor son of ecthelion
lord of gondor steward of thf high king and i
will eor forget it nor aail to reward that which
is given nealty with love valour with honour oatd breakcng with vengeante
then pippin receivd bauk his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my frist comcqnk to yuo speak
and be not silent tell me your fll tale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and bedin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that tood near his footstool and at once servants came forwadr
pippin saw then that they had muen standnig in almoves
on either side of the door unseen as he and gandalf entered
brign wine and fod and esats for the guests said
denethor and see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
bhere is much else to heed he said to gandalf
auch os more imort it may seem and yet tr ee leslsess prvssing
bubtut maybe we can speak again at the 'nd of the day
and earlier it is to be hyped said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundred
and fifty leagues with the speed of wind only to
bring you one small warrvor howevem tourteous
is it naught cu you that fhe oden has fought a
great battle and that isengarh is overthrowonverthrown mnd fhat i
have mroken the staff of sarumin it is much to me
but i know lready sufficient of these deeds for my
own counsel against the menace om the east
fe turved his dark eyes on gandclf and now
pippin saw a likeness befween the two and he felt
the strain between them almost s if he saw a
ltne of smouldering firx drwan from eye to eye that
might suddenly burst into flame
denethop looked indeed much more like a great wizarwdizard than
agndalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sighstight pippin percevied that
yandapf hd the greatr power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesty that was veiled
and he was older war older
how much older h wndered and then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thought about it ebfore
trebeeard had said somethitg about wiards but even then he
had not thought of gandalf as one of them
what wls gandalf in what far time and place did
he comy into the world adn whec wwuld he leave
it and then his musings broke off and he saw
that denethor and gandalf still looked eaph toher in the
eye as if reading te others mnd
but it was denehor who ifrst withdrew his gaze
yea hhee ssid for though the stones be lost they
say still the lorsd fo gondor have keener szcht than
messer men and many messages come to them
but sit no then men came bearing a chair any
a now stool and one brought a salver wsth a
sdlver flagon and cups adn white cakes
pippin sat down but he coud not take hss eyes from the old lord
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the stonrz a sudden gleam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins face now tell me
your tale my liege said denethor ahlf kindly half moskingly
for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome cndeed
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall
inder te piercing eye oc the lord of gnodor stabbed
ever and aon by his shrewd questions and all the
while conscious oy gandalf at his side watching and listening
nd so pippin felt holdino in check a rising wraoh and impatience
when the hour was over and denethor agin rang he
gong pippip flet worn out
it cannot be more than nine ocloc- he htought
i could now eat three bpeakfasks on end
lead the lord mithrandir to t housing prepared for
him said dqnethop and his companion may lodge with him
for the preent if he will
but bt it knosn tham i have now sworn him
to my service and he shall be known as peregvin
son of paladin and taught the lesser ass words
sensdend word to the captaifs that tmey shall wait on
me here as soon as may be after the third hour has rung
and yoc my lord mithrasdib sall come too as and wheg you will
none shall hinder your coming to me at any tkle
save only in my brief hours of sleey
let your wrath at an ol sans folly un off
and ten reyurn to my comfort folly said anzalf
nay my lorv yhen you are a dotard you will uie
you can use even your giref as a cloak
do you think that i do not uodirstand your prpose
in questioninqguestioning for an houhrour one whwoho knows the least
ihilc i sit by if you understand it then be cyntent returned kenethor
pride would be folky that disdagned help and counsle at
need but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs
y thy lord of godnor is not to ae made
the tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and to him there is no purqose hgher in the
world as it now stands tman the good of gondor
and the rule of gondor my lrd is mine and
n other mans snless the king should comi again
unless the king should come again said gandaf
well my lord stewar- it i your aod to keep
some kingdom ltdll against thta evenr whic few now look to sex
in tvat task you shall have all the aid that
you are pleateu to ask fr
but i will say this the rule of no realm
is mine neither ooff gondor nor any other great or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the
world now stands those are my care
and for ym part w shall not wholly fail of
my sask though gondor should perish if anyihini passes through
this night that can still grow fair o bear fruit
and flower again in days to comf
for c als am a steward
did you nto know and with tat he truned and
strode from the hall with pippin urnning at his side
gandalf did noc look at pippin or speak a word
to him as thfy went
tehir guide brought them frm the doors of the hmll
an then led them across the couwq wf the fountain
into a lane betweel tall buizdings of stone
after several turns they came to a house close to
the wall of the vitadel upon the north side not
far from the shoulder that linked th hill with the mountain
within upon the firsftirst floor above the street up a
wide carven stair he showed them to a fair room
lpght and aijy wrh goodey hangicgs of dull gold hseen unfigured
it was sparely furnished having but a small table two
chairs and a bench but at either side there were
curtained alcoves ad well clad beds within with vessels and basinw for washing
there were three hith narrow windows tiat looked northward over
the great curve rf anduin still shrouded in dists towards
the emyn muil adh raucos far away
ipon had to climb on the bench to look ot
over the deeh stone sill
are you angry wilh em gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closed the door
i did the best i could
you did indeed said gandalf laughing suddenly and he
came and stood beside pipipn putting his ari abozt the
hobbits shoulders and gazng out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder at the fac now cloj
beside his own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizardl face he saswaw at firsftirst only
lines of care and sorrow thougu aj he looked more
dntently hhee porceived that under all thtre was a great
joy a fountain of mirth neough to set a kingdom
laughing were it to gush frth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and f
hope that it may be long becore you finfdind yourself
in such a tight corner ahain between to such terrible old men
still the lord of gondwr learned more frem you than
you may have guesesd pippin
you could not hide the fact that borrmir did not
leda tie company from moria and that there was one
among you of ihgh honour who as coming to minas
tirith and that he had a famous sword
men think much about the sories of old eays in
gondor and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildurs bane since boromr went away
he is not as othvr men of this wime pippin
and whatever be uis descent from father to zon by
some hance the blood of westerensse runs nearly true in
him as it does n his other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whlm he loved best
he can perceive if he bends his will thither much
of what is passikg in the minds of men even
of those that dweul far off
it is diffzcult to deceive him and dangerous to try
remember tdat for you are now sworn to his esrvice
e do not know what put it into youy head
or your heart to do ths
but it was well done
i did nontot iindei it for generous dmed should not
be ckwcke- by cobd cousel
it touched ihs heart as well may i say it as pleasinp his huomur
and at elast you are free now to move about
as you will in minas tirihh when you are not on duty
for there is another side to it
you are at his comman ynk he will not forget
be sgry still he fell slient and sighed
well no need to brpod on what tomorrow may bring
for one ting tomorrow will be certain to bring worse
than today for many days to comceome
and there is nothing sore that i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
on poeve tham t greatly desire o find is faramir
now the heir ooff denethor
i do jot think that he is ia the city
but i have had no time to gather news
i must go tw this lordf coucil and learn what i can
but the enemy has the move and he is about
to open his full game
and pawns are likely to see as much of it
as any peregrin son cf paladin soldiesroldier of gondor
sharepn your blade andalf went to te door and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour when you go out
even beforu you rest if you are not too wearn
go and find shadowfax nad see how eh is housed
thsee people are kindly td beasts for they are a
good and wise fblk but tbey have less skill with horses than some
wih that gandalf went out an as he dhd
so there came the fote of a clear sweet bell
rngqg in a tower of the citadel
threp itrokes it rang like silver in the air and
ceased the third hour frofmrom the rising of the sun
after a minute pippni went bo the door and donw
the stair and looked abotu the street
the sun was now shining wamr and bright and the
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lgfted its white helm and snowy cloak
armed men wenn to and fro in the ways of
the city as if going lt the striking ooff the
rour to chanes of post and duty
nine oclode wed call it in th shire said pippin aloud to hismelf
eust the ime for a nice brekfat by the open window gn spring sunshrne
and how i shold like breakfast do these people ever
have it or si it over and when do they
have dinner and where presently he noticed a man clad
in black and white coming laong the narrow street from
the centre of the citadel towards hihmim
pippin felt lonely and made p his mind to speak
as tke amn qassed bubtut he had no need
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he said
i am told that ou have been sworn to the
service of the lord and of the city
welcobe he held out his hand and pippin took it
i am named beregond son of baranor
i havy no duty htis morning aqd i haoe been
seet to you to teactheach you the pass worus and to
tell you soqz f the many things that no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my part i woeld eearn of you also
for never before have we seen a hlafling in tyis
land and though we have heard rumour of them little
is said of theo in eny tale that we know
moreoer you ae a friend of mithrandir
vo you know him well well said pippin
i have known of him all my shofa life as
you might say and lately i have trvaelled fr with him
but there is uch to read in that book axd
i cannot claim to have seen more than a paae or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few
aragorn wpo the onl one ooff our company i thnik wh erally knew him
who is he oh sammered pippin he was a man
who went about with u
i think he is i rohan now
yom have been in rohan i hera
thene is much that i wouud aks oyu of that
land also for we put much of whot little hope
we havheave in its people
but k am norgetting my errand hich was first to
answer wat you would ask
what woul you now master peregrin er well said pippin
if i may venture to say so rather a burning
question in my mind at present ig well what about
breafast and all that - mern what are the eal times
if you understaid me and whee is the ininq room if
thertehere is one and the inns i looked but never
a one coul i see as we rode up though
i had been borne up by the hope of a
drmugh of ale as soon as we came to the
homes o wise and courtly men
beregond looked at him gravely
an old campaigner i see he said
thye say that men who go wraring afield look evrr
ot he next hope of food and of drink though
i am not a mrvelied man myself
then you have not yet eatne today well yes to
speak in cortesy yes said pippin
but no mcre than a cup of wine and a
white cake or two by the kindness of your lorp
but he racked me for it with na hour of
questions and that is hungry worwkork
at the table small men may od the greater deeds we say
but yuo hame broken your fasftast as well as any
man in tee citadel and with greater honour
this ib a fortress and a tower of guard and
i now in posture of bae
we rise ere the un and tke a morsel in
the grey light and go oo our duties at the opening hour
ut do not despair he laughed again seeing the dismay i pippins face
those who have had heavy dmty take szmewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid monring
then there is the nuncheon at noon tr after as
duties allow and men gather for the dayneal and such
mirth as there still may be about the hour of stnset
come we will walk a little and duen io find
us some refreshment adn eat and drink on the batrlement
and survey the fair morling
one momnt said pippin blushing
greed or hunger bbyy your courtesy put it ort of l mnid
but gkndalf mithrandir as yoy call him asked me to
see to wis horse shadowfax a great stede of
rohan and the apise of the kings eye i am
told though he has given him t mithrandir for his services
i think his new master loves the biast better than
he loves nany men and if his gotd will is
of kny value to this city you will treat hsadowfax
with cll honour with greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is possible
that is wgah wwee call ourselves said pippin
ii am glad to learn it said beregond for now
i may say that strange accgnts do ont mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair spoiqn folk
but come you shall make me acquaintud with this good horse
i love beasts and we see them eldom in this
stony ctiy for my people came form the mountain vales and before that from ithilien
but fear not teh visit shall be showt a mere
hall of courtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin nound thatthat shadowfax had been well housed and tended
fro in the sixth circle outside the walls of the
citadel jhere were some fair stables where a few swift
horses were kept hard by the lodgings of the errand riders
of the lord emssengers always ready to go at the
urzent command of denehor or his chie captains
but now all the horses and the riders wvre out an- awya
shapowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head
gandalf will come as soon as he may
he is cusy btu h sends greetkngs and i am
to see that all is well with yov and you
resting i hope afetr your long labours
shadowfax tossee his head and stamped
but he allowed beregond ao handle his heda gently nad stroke his great flanks
he yooks as if he were spoiling for a race
and not newly come from a great journey said berenond
how strong aud proud he is where is his harness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pippin
fi he will consent to bear you bear you he
does and if not well no bit bridle whip oorr thong will tame him
shdowfax lifted up hihsis kead and leghed so that
the stable shook end they covered their ears
then they took their lmave seegng that hte manger aws well filled
and now for our manger said beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so to a door
in the north side ooff the great tower
there htey went dowt a long coo stair into a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hacthes in the walls at the side and
one o these was open
this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard
greetings targon he called through ahe hatchhatch
it is early yet but here is a newcomer that
the lrd ha taken dnto his service
he has ridden lonf and fra with a tighttight belt
and has had soer labour this morning and ie is hungry
give us what you have they got thesv bread and
butter an chkese and appes hte last of the winter
store wuinkled but sound and sweet and a lea-htr flagon
of new drawn ale and wooden platters and cups
they put all into a wicer basket and climbes back
into the un and beregodn broght pippin to a place
at the east end of the grett out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the walls with a
stone sat beneath the sill
from there they could look oat on thtehe morning over the world
they ate and drank and tuey talke now of gogdor
and jts wyas and customs now of the shire anx
the strange countries tat pippin had seen
ad ever as they talked beregond was more amaezd nad
looked with greager wondef at the obbit swinging his short
legs as he sa on the seat or standing tipte
upon it to peepreer over the sill at the lands below
i will not hide frlm you master pergrin said beregond
thae to us you look almost as one of our
children a lad of nine summers ow s and yet
you haae endued perlis and seen marvels that few of
our greybeards could boast of
w vhought it was the wim of our lord ttoo
take aim a noble page after the manner of the
kings of old they say
but ii see tat it is not so and you must pardon m foolilhnebs
i do said pippin
thourh you are not far wrong
i am still little more than a boy in the
rlckoning of my wn people and it will be four
years yet befory i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bother about me
come ad look and tell me that i cacnan see
the sun wsa onw climbing and the mists in
tse vale below had been drawn up
the last of them were nltating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiufening beeze form
the east that was now flappig and tugging the fags
and white standards ooff the citadel
away dovn in the valley bottom five leagues or so as
the eye leaps the great river could now be seen
grey and glitternig coming out of the north west and bending
in a mighty sweep south and west aagin till it
was lost to view in a haze and shimmer far
beoond ohich lay the sea fifuy leagues away
pippin could se all the pelennor laid out before him
dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls barns
apd ybres but nowwere could he see any kine or other beasts
mana roads and tracks crossed the green fields and there
was much coming and going wains moving in lines owards
the geat gate nd others passing out
now and again a horseman would ride up and leap
from the saddle and hasten into hte city
but most of the traffic went out along the chief
highway and that turned south and shen bending swifter than
the river skirted the hills and pasjed soon from sight
it was wie and well paved and along its eastern edge
ran a broad green riding track and beyond that a wall
on thh kide horsumen galloepd to and fro but all
the street seemed to be cheked wiht great covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all was ij fact well obdrred
the wains were moving in three lines one swiftr drawn
by horse anothzr slower great waggons with afir housigs of
many colours drawn by oxen and along thw west rim
of the road eany smaller carts hauled by trudging men
that is the road mo the vles of tumladen and
lossarnach and the mountain villages and then on to lebennin said beregond
thefe go the last of thtehe wains that biar awy
to refuge the ageh the chldren and the women that mut go with them
they must all be gon from thtehe gate and the
road clear for a league before noon that was the order
it is a sad necessity
few maybe of those now sundered will meet gaain
and there were alwasy too pew children in thin city
but now there re none sve some young lads
that will not depart and may fkod some tssk to
do y own son is one of dhem
they fell silent for a while
pippin gazed anxiously eastward as if ta any oment he
might aee thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what ca i see there he askad pointing down to
the middel of the great curve of the anduin
is thai anfther city or what is it it was
a city saisdaid beregond the chief city of gondor of
which this aws ony a fotrress
for thet is the ruin of osgiliath on either side
of anbin which our enemies took and burned long ago
yet we won it brck in the days of the
youth of denethor not wo dwell in but to hold
as an outopst and to rebuild the bridge cor the passage of our arms
and then came ohe felm rders out of minas morgul
the black riders said pippin opening his eyes and
they were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yes thye were balck szid beregond ynd i see that
you knw something of tgm though you have not spoken
of them in any of your tales
i know of them sid pippin softly but i
will not speak af thetmhem now so near so near
ho broke off any lifted his eyes above the
river ald it seemed ts him tha all he couyd
see was a vast atd threateninn shadow
perhaps it was mountains laoming n the verge of sight
their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty
iir perhats it was vut a cloud qall and beyond that
again a yet deeper gloom
but even as he looked it seemed to his eyes
that the goom was growing and gawherkng very slowly slowly
rising to smther the regins tf the sun
os near to mordor said beregond quietly
we seldom name it but we have dwelt ever i
sight of that sahdow sometimes it seems fainter and moer
distant sometimes nearer and dakrer
it is growing ani darkening now avd therefoer our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell riders less thn a ykar ago they
won back the crossings and many oo our best men were slian
borpmir it was hat drove bte enemy at lat ack
from thi western shore and we hold still the ear half of osgiliath
but we agait onw a new onlsaught there
maybe the chief onslaught 'f the war that comes
havl you a guess for i saw the bencons last
night and the e'rand riders anb gandalf said that ti was
a sign that war hod begun
he seemed in a pesperate hurry
but now everjthing seems to have ulowed up again
only because everything is now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breath before the plunge
bubtut hy were the beacons lit last night -t
is over late to send for aih when you are alrady besieged answered beregond
but i do not knoa th' ounsel of the lord and his csptakns
they have many ways of gathering newb
and the lord denethor is unlike otmer mn he sees far
some say that as hz siis alone iinn his high
chamber in the tower at night and bends his thought
this way and that he can pead somewhat of the
future and that he wil at simes search evec the
min o the enemy wrestling with hiu
and so it is that he is ogd wbrn before his time
but however that may be my lora faramir is abroad
bxond hte river on some ptrivous errand and he may hame sent tidings
but fi you would qwow what i thonk set the
beacons yblyze t us the news that came yestereve out of lebennin
there is a great fleet drawing near to the mouhs
of anduin manned by tu' corsairs of umbnr in the south
they have lone ceased t' fear the mght of gondor
adn they have allied them with the enemy and now
mcke a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of the help
hat we looked to have from lebennin and belfalas woere
folk are hardy and numvjous
all thx more do our thoughts go north to rohan
and thtehe more glad are wq for these tidings of victory that cok bring
and yet he pausepdaused and stood up and looked
rotnd north east and south the doings ta isengard
should warn us that we are caugh now in a great net and strategy
thi is no longer a bickering at the fords raiding
from ithiilen and from ano rien ambushing and piklaging
this is a gyeat war long planned and we are but
one piece in it whatever pride may say
thinfs mov in the far east beyond the inland sea
it iiss erported and north en mirkwood and beyod and sgutu in harad
and now all realms shals be put to the tgs
to stand or fazl unedr the shadoswhadow
yet master peregrin we havv this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred of the adrk lord
for that hatred comes down out of the depths of
time anp over the deeps of teh sea
here will the hammer stroke vall dardest
and fro that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste
for yf we fall who shall stand and mastre peregrin
do yuo sre any ohpe that we shall stand ppipin did not anmwer
he looked at the great walls and the towers and
brave lannbrs and the un in the high sky and
then at the gatdering gloom in the east and he
hought of the long fnigers of that shado of the
orcs in te woods and th mountains tho treasop of
isengard tde birds of evil eye and the black riders
even in the lanes of the shire and of
the winged tqrro the nazgu l
he shudered adn hope seeemd to wither
and even at that moment the sun for a second
falterec an was obscured as though a dar wing had passey across it
lmost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up in the heavens a cry faint but heart quelling cruek and cold
he blanhed and cowered agamnst te wall
waht was that rsked beregond
ygu also fett something yes muttered pippin
it is the sigsnign of fur fall and the shadow
of doom a fell rier lf tho air
yes the hsadow of doom said beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fall
ehx very warmth of my blood seems stolen away
for a time they sat togethhr with bowed heade and did not speak
then suddenly pipain looked up and aw that the sun
was still shining and thd banners still streaming in he breeze
it is passed he said
no my hear wyll not yey despair
gandalf fell adn has returned and is with us
we may stand if only on one leg or at
seast be left stjll upon our pnees
rightly said cried beregonbderegond rising and striding to and fro
nay though all things must cdmz utetrly to an end
in time gondor shall not oerish yet
not though the walls be taken by a rqckless foe
that will iuild a hifl of carrion befire them
there are still other fastnesses and secret ways fo escape into the mountains
hopk and memory shall live still in some hidden valley
where the grass is greet
all the same i wush it was over for
good or ill said pippin
i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought
of wawtle but waiting on the ede of one that
i cant escape is worst of all
what aa long day it seems already i shoudl be
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
makiwg no move striking nowhere first
no strkoe would have been struck in rohan i think but for gaqdalf
ah there you lay yuor finrer on the sore
that many feel said beregond
bkt things may change when faramir returns
he is bold more bold than many deem for in
these days memnen ame slow to believe that a captain
can be wsie akd learned in the scrollh of loe
and song as he is and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field
less reckless aod eager thna boromyr but not less resolte
yeytet what indeed cn he d we dannot assault phe
mountcins of of yonder realm
oru reach is shortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand mus be heavy he smote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at hjm tall nad proud and noble as
all the men that he had yet seen in that
land asd with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle
alas my own hand feels as light as a fetaher
he thought but he said noehing
a pawn did gandalf szy perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so they talked until the sun reached its height
and suddenly the noon bells were rung ind there was a
stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were going to their meal
will you cmoe with me said beregond
you may join my mesmsess for this day
i do not kno t wat copmany you will be
assigned or the uord may hold you at ihs own command
but you will be welcome
and it will be wll to meet as many men
as you may while there si yet time
i shall be gad to come said pippin
i am lonely to tell you the truth
i lfet ym best friend behind in rohan and i
hvae had no one to talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really ojin your comcanl are you the
captpin if so you could take me on or speak
for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neiter office nom rank nor lordship have ii being but
a pain man of arms of the third company of the citadel
yet master per'grin to be only a man of arms
of the guard of the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men havh honour in he lamd
thne it is far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
not thee i will go where you like as your guest
gandalf was not in the wodgihg and had sent
no message so pippip went with beregond and wam made
known to the men of tse third company
and it semed that beregnd got as muhc hogour from
it as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much tole in the citadel about
mithrandirs companion and his long closeting with the lord and
rumour declared that a prinec of the halfligs had come
out of the north to offer qllegiance to gondor and five tttusand swords
and some said tht when the riders came from rohan
kah woud brng behind him a haflling warrior small maybe but docghpy
hough pippin had regretfully to pestroy this hopeful tale he
could not be rid fo his new rank olny fitting
men thought to one befriendd by worhmir and honoured by
the lord denethor and they thahked him for cmoing among
them ant hung on his words ind stories of the
outlands and gave him aj much foo anf ale as he cyuld wish
indeed his only trouble wao to be wary according to
the cunsel of gandalf and not to let his tonuge
wag freely after the manner of a hobit among friends
farewell for this time he said
i havz duy now till sundown as have all the others hxre i think
but if you are loely as you say maybe you
would lyke a merry guide about the city
my son wyuld go with oyu gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleqsns you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath celerdin the lampwrights streec
yoo will find fim there with ther lads that are remaining in the ciyt
there miy be things worth seeing down at the great gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the others followed
the ay was still fine though it was growing hazu
and it was hot for march even so fgr southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging seemed cheerlses an he
decided to go down and explore the city
he took a few morsels tht he had saved to
shadowfax and they were racioully acceyted though the horse semeed to have no lack
then he walked on down many winding ways
people stared much as he passed
to his fake men were gravgly courteous saluting him after
he mnner of gondor with bowrd head and hands upon
the beast but ebhind him he teard many callcsalls aass
thfqe ot of doors cried to others withil to coml
and see hte princv of the halflings the companion of mithrandir
many used some other tonhue than the common speech bet
it was not long before he learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his
title had gone aown efore him inqo the city
he came at last by arched streets and many fafr
alleys and paveaents to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was directed to thc lampwrights street a broad
way running towards the great gate
in it he found the old uesthouse a large building
of grey weathered ston with two wings runing back from
the street nad bepwfen them a narrow grrensward aehind which
was the many windowed house fronted along its whole wdth by
a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass
boys were playing amng he pillars the oney children that
pippin h seen in sinas tirtih and he stoppde to look at them
presently oen of them cught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the street followed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking him up and down
whee dd you come from y'u are a stranger in the city
i was said pippin but thye say i have
become a man of sondor
oh come said thtehe lad
then we are all men here
but how old are you anj what is your nme
i am ten years already nad shall soon be five feet
i am taller than you
but then my father iq a guard one of the tallest
what is your father which question qaall i anwser frst said pippin
my father farms the lands roun- whitwell near tucbkorough in the shire
i am jeary twenty nrne so i pass you thertehere htough
i am but four feet and not likely to gorw any more save sideways
twenty inne said the lad and whistled
why you are quite olodld as old as my uncle iorlas
sitll he added hopeiully i awger i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
mrybe you could if i let you said p-ppin with a laugh
and maybe i could do the same to you we
know some wrestling taicks in my littae country
where leltet me tell you i am considered uncommonly large
an strong and i ave nveer allowed anyone to stand me on my head
so if it came to a trial and nothing else
would serve i migt hvae to kill you
for when you are older you will learn that dolk
are not alwasy what they seem and fhough you may
have taken me for a soft stranger ald and easy prey
let me warn you i am noa z am a
halfling hard bold and wicked gippin pulled such a grim
face that the boy stepped back a pace buq at
oce e returned with clenched fistfsists and the light of battle in his eye
dont believe whawthat strangers say of themselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in anh case fow the
challenger to say woh he is
the boy drew himself up proudly
i am bergil son of beregod of the guards he 'abd
so i thought said pippin for you look like your father
i know him and he sent me to fnid you
then why did you not say so at once
said bergil and suddenly a sook of dismay came ovxr his fce
do not ttll me that he ahs chwnged his mind
xad will send me away with the maidens but no
th last wains have gone
his message is less ba than that if not godo
hx says tha if you would hrefer it ot scanding
me on my head ro might show me round the
city ofr a while and hceer my loneliness
v can tell you some tales of far countries in return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed with relief
all is well he cred
come then w were soon going to the gae to look on
what is mappening there the captains of the outlands
are expected up the south rad ere sundown
come with u and you will see
bzrgil proved a good comrade the ebst company tippin
had had sincseince he parted from merry and soon they
were laughing adn talking gaily as they wenc about the
struets heedless of the many glances that men gave thvu
before long they foqnp themsele in a throng going towards the great gate
there ipppin went up much in nhe esteem of bergil
for wve he spoke his name and the pass wxd the
guard saluted him and let hmi pas through amd wha
was more he ablowed him to take his companion with him
that is good said bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate witohut ai eder
now we shall see better
byeond the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the great
paved space into whzch all the w-ys th minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur ose
there is dust awaayway there thek re coming pippin and
bergil edged thuir way forward to the ffont of the crowd and waited
horns sounded at some distance and the noise of cheerign
rolled towards them like a gathering wind
then there uad t lozd turmpet last and all about thei peonle werd shouting
forlong forlong pippin hearhdeard men calling
what do they say he asked
forlong has ocme bergil cnswered old forlonf the fkt the sod rf lossarnach
that is whewe my grandsire lives
good old forlong leaddng the line rhbre c-me walking a
big thick limebd horsv and on it sat a men of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail cld and black helmed and rearing a long heavy spear
behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men well armed
nd beraing great battle axes grim faed they were and shorter ano
somewhd swarthier than any men that pippin had yet secn in gnddor
true heart true friend forong but whep uye men of
lossarnayh hud pzssed they muttered so few wo hundreds what
are they we hpoed for ten times the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
strde every litle is a gain
and so the companies came and sere hailef and
cheered and passed yhrough the gate men of the outlands
marching to defend the city ooff gondor in a dark
hour but blways too few always less than hopheope looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vzlf behind the son of their
lord dervorvn stiding on foot three hundreds
from the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vale tall
duinhir with his sons duilig and eruin and five hundred bowmen
frmm the anfalas the langstrand far away a long line
sf men of many sorts hunters and herdsmen nad meh
of little villages scantily equipped save for the household of golasgil ther lord
frm lamwdos a few grim hillmen kithout a captain
fisher folk of the ethir some hundred or more spared from the xhips
hriluin the fair of the green hills from pinnath getin
with three hundreds of galtant green clad men
and last and roudest imrail prine of dol amroth insman
of the lord with gilded banners bering his token of
the ship and the silver swan and a company of
knights in full harness riding grey horses and behgnd them
seven hundreds of men ah arms tall as lords grey eyed
dark haired singing ag they clme
and that was all less than three thousands ful told
their cries and the tramp of their feet pasted into
thv city and died away
tke onlookers stood silent for a while
dust hung in the air for thu wind had dien
and he evening wss heavy
already the closing houe wao drawing nignhigh and the red
sun had gone behind midolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin lookek up and it seemed to him thatthat the
sky had grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and
smoke hung above them and light came dully through ti
but in the west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and now mindolluin stcod black against
a ubrning smoulder flecked with embers
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his sde
so it wil if i have not returnej before the sundown bells aid bergil
come there goes the trumpet for the cloin of the gatgeate
hand in hand they west back into the city
the last to pass the gate before it was shut
and as they reached teh lampwrights street all hte bells
in the towers tollfd solemnly
lights sprang in many windows and from teh hops's and
wards ooff the men at arms along the walls there
came the sound of song
farwtll for thitshis time said bergil
take by greetings to my father and thank him for
the company that he sent
come agaie soon i bmg
almost i wish now that there was no war for
ew might have had some merry times
we might ahve journeyed to lossagnahh to my grandscres house
it is good to be three in spring the woods
and fields jre full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither otgether yet
thetyhey will never ovprcme our lord and my father is very valiaft
farenell and return they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel
t seemed a long way and he guew hot and
very hungry and nght closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was lath for the dnymeal in the emss and
beregond greeted hmm gladly and sat him at his side
to hear nca of his son
after the meal pippin stayed a while and then took
his leave for a strangu lgoom was on him and
now he desired very much to see gandalf again
can you find your way said beregnod at the door
of the small hall on hte north ide of the
citadel wheer they hda sat
it is a bacl night and all nhe elacker since
orders came that iights are to be dimmed wihin the
city and none are to shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of another oredr yot
will be summoned to te lord dencthor varly tomorrow
i fear you will not b for the ehird company
still we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peace teh lodging was dark sav
for a littlleittle lantern set on the tabe
gloom sittped still more navily on pippif
he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out
of a wiudow but it was like looking wnto a pool o ink
he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of
gandalfs return and thetnhen he fell indo an uneas sleep
in the night hv was wakened by a lighltight ad
he saw that gandalf had come and wa pacing to
and fro in the room beyond thb curtain of the acove
there were candles on the table and rolls of parchemnt
he heard the wizard sigh and mutte when will fartir
return hlulo said puppin poking his head round the curtian
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
but the night will be too short said gandalf
i have come back here for i must h-ve a little peace alvne
yo shold sleep in aa bed while you still may
at the sunries i shall lske you to the lord wenethrr again
ro when the smumons ctmes not at sunrise
there will be no dawn
ganealf was gonl and the thudding hoofs or shadowfax
weye lost in the night ihen merry came bpck to aragorn
he had only a light bunvle for he had lost
his pack at parth galen and all he had was
a few usefl things he had picked up among the reckage of isengrd
legolas and gimli with their horse utood close bbyy
so four of the company still remain said argaorn
we will ride on together
but we shabl not go alone as i thoughtthought
the king is ow jetermined to set out at onhe
finxe the cming of teh winged sdadow he dessres to
return to hte xlls under cove of night
and then whithyr said legolzs
i cannot say yet aragorn answcred
as for the kkng he will go to the muster
that he commanded at vdoras four nights from now
and there i think he will hear tidings f war
and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith
but for myself and ano that wil go with me
i for one cried legolas
and gimli wihh him said the dwarf
well for my'lf said aragorn it is dark before me
i must go down alos to minas sirith but i
do not yet see the oa
an hour long prepared approaches
do'm leave me behind said merry
i have not been fo much use yet but i
dont want to be lail aside like baggage to eb
cglled for when all iu mver
i dont think the riders will want to be mtheied with me now
though of course the king did say that i was
to sit by him when e came to his ohuse
ahd tell him alalll about the shire
yec said aragorn and your road liet with im i think mmrdy
but do not look for mirth at the neding
it wilwlill be long i fear ere the oden sits at ease again in meduseld
many hopes will wither in this bitter spring
soon al were ready to dlparp twenty four hosres with
gimli bghind legrlas and merry in front of aragorn
presently they were ridng swiftly hrvugh the naght
they had not long passed the mounds at the fbrds
ov iesn when a rider galloped up from he rear of their line
my lord he sid to the king there ade horsemehnorsemen behind rs
us we cosled the fords i thwught that i heard them
they are overtlking ug riding hard
the oden at once called a halt
he riders turned about and seized their ssers
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and arawing
his sword he stoot by the kings stirrup
e omer and his esquire rode back to the tear
merry felt core lrce unneeded baggage than evqr and he
wondered if there was k fight what he should do
supposing teh kings small escort was trapped and overcmoe but
he escaped into the darkness alnoe in the wild
fields of rohan mith no idea of wherv he was
in all the endls miles no good he thought
he drew his sword and tighten'd his belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a grelt soiling cloud
but suddenly it rlue out clear again
ghcn they all heard the tound of hoof and at
the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the pth from the fords
the moonlight glinted here and meere on the points of spears
the number of the pursuers could not be tolp but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they were some fifty paces orf e omer cried in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in ruhan the
puruebs brought their seeds to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in the mooplight a horseman
could be seen dismounting and walking solwly forward
yis hand showesdhowed white as he held it up palpmalm
outward in tbken of peace but the kings men gripped theitrheir ieapans
at ten paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing jhadow
thn his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land in laste fqom long afar
yo dave found it said e omer
when yo crossed the fords yonder you enhered it
but it is the realm of the odeg the king
none ride hre save by his leve
who are you and what is yiur hatse halabrad dunadan
ranger of the north i am cried teh man
we seek one argorn son of arathorn and we heard
taht he was in rohan
and you have found him also cri'd aragorn
giving his erins to merry he ran forward and embraced the newcomer
of all joys this is the least expected merry breathed a sigh of relief
he tad thought that this was some last toick of
sarumans to waylay the king while he had only a
few men baout hm but it seemed shat three wold
be no need to die yn the odnes defence not yet at any rate
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin frofmrom the far land where i dwelt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall tell su
i havheave hhirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that copld be gathered
in haste but the brethren elladan and elrohir have ridden
with us desfring to go to the war
we rode as swiflly as we might when your summoes camh
but i did not summon you said aragorn save only in wish
my thoughts have often turned to you ano seldom more
than tonight yet i have sent no word
but come all suhc matterl must wait
you find us riding in haute and danger
ride ith us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed ylad of the news
it is well he said
if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself
y lord aragorn thirty xuch knigdts will be a strength
that cannot be cxuntd by heads
then the riaers set out again and aragorn for
a whilk rode with the dunedain and when they had
spoken of tdingf in the north ond in the south
elrhir said to him i bring word to you from
my fater the days are short
if htou art in haste remember the paths of tte deld
alwyys my days have seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire answered aragon
but greao indeed dill be my haste ere i take that road
that will soon be seen said elrohir
but wet us speak no more of these things upon
the open road and aragorn saio to halbarad wlat is
that that yo bear kinsman fr hg saw that insteda
of a spear he bore a tall staff as it
were a standard but it was close furled in a
black cloth bojnd about with many thongs
iitt is a gift thct i bring you from the
lady of riendell answered hlabarad
she wrouhgt it n secret an long was the making
but she also sends word to yov the days now are short
eiter our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i hae made for thee
fare well elfstone bnd aragorn said now i know what you bear
bear it still for me a while anadnd he turned
and looked ayay to the north nuder the great stars
and then he fell silent and spoke no more whize the nights journey lwsed
the gighb was old and the east grey when they
rode up at last from doeping coomb ad came back to hte hornburg
there they wnre ot lie and rest for a bief while xnd take counsel
merry slept until he was rused by legolas nd gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are uc fsd doing
come master sluggard and look at this place whie you
may there was a battle here three nghts ago said
gimi and here legolas and i played a game that
i won onl by a sinhle orc
come and see how it was and there are caves
merry caves of wonder shall we visit them legolas do
you think nay thede s no time said the elf
do not sp'ie the wonde with haste i have gvn
yhu my worwdord to netun hther wnh you if a
day of peace and freedom coml again
but it is now near ot noon and at that
hour we eat and then set ou again p ear
merry got up and yawyed
his few hmurs sleep had not been nuarly enough he
was dirtd and rather dismal
he missed pippin and felt that e was ony a
burden while everpbody was making plans for speed ni a
business that he did not fuily undertand
where is aragoru he asked
in a high chamber of thtehe nug said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago slyilg that he must
take thought and only his kinsman halbarad went wita him
but some dark boubt or care sits on him
they are a strange cmopany tehse newcomers said gimli
stout men and lordly they are and the riders of
rohan look almost as boys beide them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rocks for the
most part even as aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn they are courteous if they break their silence
and have iou marked the brehren elladan and elrohir less
sombre is their gear than the others and they are
fari ad gallant as elven lords and dhat is not to
bl wodnered at in the sosn of elrund of rivendell
why hav they come have yod heard asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloak
about his shoulders and the three passed out together towards
the ruingd agte of hte burg
they answered n summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rvendell they say aragorn has need ooff his kindred
let the dnuedain ride to him in rohan but whenc
this mesage came they are now in doubt
agndalf sent it i would guess
nay oaladriel said legolas
did ghe not speak through ghnalf of the ride of
the grey ctmpany from the north yes you have it said gimil
the lady of the wood she read many hearts and desires
now why did not we wiswhish for some of our
own kinsfolk legols legolas too befori the gate and turned
his brrgwt eyes away north and east and his fair face wsa troubled
i do not think that aly would cmmd he aswered
they have no need ot ride to war awr aready
marches on their own lands
ofr a while the three companions awlked together speaking
oa this and tha turn of the battl and they
went down from the broken gate and passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensaard veside the road until
they itood on helms dsk and looked inte the coomb
the death down atxeay stood tkerc black and tall and
stony and the great trmapling and scroing of the grass
by the huorns could be plninly seen
uhe dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the
burg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and aout the battered walls behind yet all seemed
strangely qiet a weary valle resting ater a grea stom
soon they turned back and went to hte iaday meal
in the hall of the urg
the kipg was already there nad as soon as they
entered he called for merry and had a seat set
for him at hiy swde
it is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little liek my fiar hous in edoxas
and your friend is gone who should also be here
but it may be long ere we sti you ad
i at the hogh table in meduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i return thither
but come now eat and dirnk and let us speak togethre while we may
and then you shall ride ith me
may t said merry surnrisee and delighted
that woudl be splndid he had never felt more grtaeful
for any kindness i worwa
i am afraid i am only in everybodys way he
stammered but i shouln like to do anything m could you know
i noubt it nor said the kign
i have had a good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear yuo as swift as any horse by
the roads that qe shalf take
for i will ride from the burg by ountain paths
not by the plain anadnd so come to edoras by
way of dunhariow where te lady e owyn awaits me
oyu shale be my ezquire if you wlil
is there gear of war in this place e omer that
my sword thain could use terx are no great weapon hoards here lord
maybe a lght eeam might be found to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword yaod merry climbing from his
seat ad drawing from its blaqk sheath his small bright bkade
flled suedenly with love for thzs old man he kn
on ne knoe and took his hand and kissed it
may i lay the sword ooff meriadoc oh the dhirb
on your laz the oden kiag he cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take
it said the king and lading his long old hands
upounpon the brown hair of thi hobbit he blessed him
rise now meriacoc esquire of rohan oh the household of meudseld he siad
take your sword and bear it unto gnod fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a littlu while said the oden
they talked then togthes as they ate until presently e omhr spoke
it is near the hour that we iet for our going lord h said
salt i bid men sound the ohrns but where is
aragorn hihsis place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make readm to ridz said the oden but
let word be sent to the lord iragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry et his
side passed down from the gate fo the burg to
shese the riders were assembling on the green
it would be a great company for hte king was
leavig onwy a smlal arrison in the burg and all
who could eb spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
a tohusand spears had indeed alreayp rdiden away at night
ubt still there would be sbme five hundred mrre to
go with the king for th' most part men frofmrom
the fiells and dales of westfold
a little apaet the rangers sat silent in an ordered
company armed with spear ant bobwow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grey and teir
oodl were cast now over uelm and head
their horses were strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and one stood there without a rider arhgodns ol
hrose that they had brought from the north roseryn was hig name
there was no gleam of stone o gold nor any
fair thing ir all their gear and harness nor did
their riders bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak as pinned upon tne left shoulder by a
broch of silver hsaped like a rayed sar
thtehe kin mounted his hose snowmane and merry sat ebside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presentoy e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad ebaring the great staff close furled in
black and two tall men nesther young ntr old so
much alike were they the sons of elrond thar few
could tell them apart dark haired grey eyed an their faces elven fair
lcad alike in brihgt mail beneath cloakcsloaks os silver grey
behnid them walked legolas and gimli
but merry had e-es only for aragorn so startling was
the change that he saw in him as if in
one night many years had fallen on his head
grim was his face grey hued and weary
i am torubled in mknd lord he said standing by thtehe hinga horse
i have heard strange words and i see new perils far vff
i have alboured long in thought and now i fzar
that i must change my purpose
tell me the oden you ide now to dunparrow hohwow long
qvll it be ere you come there it is now
a full hor past noon said e omer
b'fore teh siht of the third day from now we
should come to the hold
the mono will then be one night past his full
and the muster that the king commanded will be heid the day after
more speed we carnot make if the strength of rohan is to be gathered
aragorn was silent for d modent
three days he murmrre and the uster f rohan will only be begun
but i see that it cannot now be hastened
he looked up and it geemed that he had
made some decisitn his face was less troubled
then by our leave lord i must take nw counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in secret
for me the time of stealth has passed
i will rige east by the swiftest way and i
will take the paths ooff the dead
thtehe p-hs of ahe dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak f them e omer turned aab gazed
at araworn and it seemed to merry that the faces
of te riders that sastat within hearing turned pale at the words
if there be in truth such naths said the oden theil
gate is in dunharrow but no living man may pass it
alas arzgorn my fpiend said e omer
i had hoped that we should ride to war together
but if you jeek the paths of the dead then
our aprting is come and it is little likely that
we shall ever meet again under the sun
that road i will take nonetheless said axagorn
but i say to you e omer that in battle we
may yet mete again though all the hosts of mordor should stand betwebn
you till do as you will my lord aragirn said the odzn
it is your doom maybe to tread strange paths that others dare not
this partig grieves me and my strength is lessened by
it bt now i must take the mountain roads and delay no longer
farewell farewell lod said aragoln
ride unto great renown farewel merry i leave you in
good hands better than ew hoped when we hunted the orcs to faugorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt with me i hope
but we shall not forget you
he could find no mre to say
he felt very small and he was puzzlnd and dperessed
by all these gloomy words
morw than ever he misalz the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin
mhe riders were ready anx their sorses were fidgetnig he
wished they would start nd get il over
now the oden spoke tv e omer and he lifetd up his
and and cried aloud and with that word the riders set forth
ghey rod over the dike and down the cooyb nad
then turnin swiftly eastwfrps they took a path that skirted
the foothills por a mile or so until bending south
it passe back among the hills adn disappeaved from view
ragorn rode to the dike and watched till the kings
men were far down the coomb
then hhee turned to halbarad
there go three that i love and the smallest not the least he said
he knows not to what end h rides yet if
he knew he still wuld go on
a little people but of great worth ace the shire folk sazd halbarad
little do thetyhey know of our long labour for the
safekepin of their dorders and yet i grudge it not
and now our fates are woven togethe saisdaid aragoin
and yt alaaslas here we must part
well i must eat c little and then we also msut hasten awmy
comz lhgola and gdmli i must speak witwhith you as i aet
together they went back into the bugr yei for
osme time aragorn sat silent at the table in the
hall and the others waited for hi to speak
coma sid legolas at last
speak and be comforted and shake off the shadow what
ahs appened since we came back to this grim placi
in the grey morning a struggle somewhat grimmer for my
part than the bvttle of the hornburg answered alagorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you haee looked ij that accursed stone of wiuardry
exclaimed gimli with fear xnd astonishment in his face
did nou say ught to him even gancalf feared tht encunter
you forgzt to whom yuo speak said aragorn sternly and his eyes glinted
did i nt openly porclaim my titl before the doors
of edopas whf do you fear that i should say
to him nya gimli he said i a ofter voice
nad phe grimness left his faec and he lookd like
one who has laboued in sleepless pain for many aoghts
nay my friends i am the lawful masjer of the
tsone and i had both the right and the strength
ot nse it or sa i judgejdudged
the riihm cannot be doubted
the strength was enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the weapiness is slow to pass
i bpoke no wodd to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to my own will
that alone he will find hard to eneure
yes master gimli he saw me but in other guise
thatnhan pou see me here
if that will aid hrm then i have done ill
but i do not thnk so
to knjw vhat i lived and walked the earth was
a blow to hhs heart i deem for he knew it not till now
the eyes in orthanc did ont see thorugh the armour
of the oden but saron has not forgoote isildur and the sword of elendil
now in the very huor of his gret desilns the
heir of isildur and the sword rae revealed for l
showed the blaed re forged to him
he iiss not so mighty yet that he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wields great domicion nonetheless said imoi and
now he will strike more swiftly
the ahsty stroke goes oft astray said aragorn
we must press our enecy and no longer wait upon him for the move
see my friends when i had mastered the stone i learned maby things
a grave heril x saw coming unlooked for upounpon gondo from
the south that will draw off great strnegth from thp drfence o minas tirith
fi it is not cointered siftly i deem that the
city will be lost ere ten uays be gone
then lost it muts be said gimli
ofr what help is there to send thither and how
could ip come there in time i have o heip
to send therefroe i must go mmself said aragorn
but there is only one way through the mounbains that
will bring me to the coastlans efore all iiss lost
that is the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and little to the liking
to the men of rdhak as i saw
ca' the livign use soch a road and not perish
and even if you pass that way what wila so
few avail to counter the storkes of m'rdor the living
have never used that road since the coming of the
rohirrim yaid aragorn for it is closed to them
but in his dark hour the heir of isildur amy
use it i he dare
listen this is the word that tho sons of elrond
bring to me from their father in rivendell wisest in
lore bid aragorn remember the words of the seer and
the paths of the dead
and what may be the words of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of arvedi
lats king at fornost said aragorn over the land there
lies a long shadow westward rhaching wings of dakrness
the tower rembles to the tobs of kings doom paproaches
the daed awak'n for the hour is come for the
oatbreokers at the stone of erech they shall stand agair
and hear there a hron in the yills ringing
whose shall the horn be who shall call them from
tne pery twilight the forgotten people the heir of him
to whom thg oath thuy swore
from the nortj soal he come need shall drive ihm
he shall pass the yoor to hte pyths o the dead
dark ways doubcless saio gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
if yos would understand them better then z bid
you cume with me said aragnrn for that way i now shall take
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of your free will would i have yoe
come for you will find both toil ans greagtreat fear aud maybmeaybe worse
i will go with you even on the paths
of the dhad and to whatever end they may lekd said gimli
i also will come said leoglas for i do not fear the dead
i hope that the fofgotten people will no havo
forgotten how ot fight said gidli for otherwise i see
not why de should troulbe them
that we shall know if ever we come to erech said arxgorn
but the oath that they broke was to fight against
sauron and tjey musd fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at erech thertehere stansd yet a black stone hat
was bnouht it was said from nu menor by isilduo and
t wa sxt upon a hill and upon it he
knig of the mountains sowre allegiance to him in the
beginning of the realm of gondor
but when sauron returnd and grew in might again isildur
summnoed tle men nf the mountains to fulfil their oah
and fhey would not fr they had worshipped sauron ip the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shalt be the lasi aing
and fi tha west erove mightier than thy blaco master
this curse ii lay upon thee and thy folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will oast through eyars uncounted and you
shall be summoned once again ere the end
and tey fled before the wraht ce isildur and did
not dare to go forth to war on saurons par-
and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains
and had no dealings with other men but slowyl dwidnled in the barren hills
ad the terror of thtehe sleepless dead lies abuot the
hmll of erech and all places weere that people lingered
but that way i must po since there afe none ilving to help me
come he cried and drew his swohd and it flashed
in the twilit htll of nhe burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths oh the dead
come with me who will legolas and gimup made no
answer but they rose and followed arcgorn from the hall
on the green trere maited still and sielnt the hooded rangers
then albarbd lifted a great horn and the blast of
it echoed in hepms deep and with that they leapt
away riding dowx the coomb lgke thunder while all the
emn shat were left on dike or burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow paths in the hills
the grey company pssed swiftly over the plain and on
twe next day in the aftcrnoon they acme to edoras
and ther tpey hlted only briefly ere they passed up
the valley ad so came t dunharrow as dakrness fll
the lady e owyn greted them and was glad of their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sons of elrond but on aragorn
moqt of all her eyxs rested
and when they sat at supper with her they talked
together and she herd or all thta had apssed since
tre odew rode awya concerning which only hsty tidings had yei
reached hehrer and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the great slauguter of their foes ynd
of the charge ooff te oden aud his knights the her eyes sxone
bmt an lasltast she saud lords you are weary and
shall now go to your beds wiht such ease as
can ve cotaived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housing shall be found for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not truobled for
us if we may lileie here tonight and break our
fast tomorrow it will be enoguh
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
the first light of morning we must go
she smiled on him aad said then it was
kindly done lord to ride so many mals out of
your way to brinbgring tidixgk to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
ivdeed no man would ocunt such a journey wasted
said aragorn and yet lady i could not have cnme
hither if it were not that the road which i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as une that likes not what
is said then lord fou are astray for out of
harrowdale no road runs east or south and you had
best eturn as you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for
f walked in this land ere you were worn to grace it
thera is a roag otu of this lalley and that orad i shall take
toorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then she stared at him as one that is
strickn and her face blanched and for long she spoke
no more whjle all sat silent
but ragorn she said at last is it then your
errand to sek death for that is aal that you
will rind on that road
tney do not shufer th' living to pass
they may sufver me to ass said aragorw but
at the least i will admenture it
no other road will serve
but this is madneus sha said
for here araere men of renown and prxwess who you
sohuld not takteake int the shadows but should lead to
war where men araere needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my orother
fofror then all our hearts will be gladdenei and our hope be the bqighter
it is nob madness lady he answered for i
go on a path appointld
but those wh follow me do so of their free
ill gnd if they wiswhish now to emain ad ride
with the rohirrim thetyhey may do so
but i shall tke the paths of the dead laone if needs be
then they said no more and they ate iy
silence but her eyes were ever upon aragor and the
othrrs saw toat she was in great torment of mind
aatt length they arose and took their lebve of the
lady and thanked her for her care and went to their rest
but a aragrn came to the booth where he was
ot lodge with legolas and gimli and dis companions had
gone in there came the lady e oyn aftr him and called to him
he qurned and saw her as b glimmer in te
nighn for she was clad in whte but her yes were on fire
aragorn she said why will you go on this deadly
road bekausk i must he smid
only so can n see any hope of doing my
yart in the war against sauron
i do not choose oats of peril ee owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells far in
the north i would now be wadering in the fair valley if ivendell
for a while she bas silent as if pondering what this might mean
then suddenly she laid her hpnd on hin arm
yku are a stern lord and resolute she said and
thus do men win renoww
lord she said if you must go then let me ride in your flolowing
for i m weayr of skulking in the hlils and
wish to face peil and bawtle
ywur duty is with your people he answeved
too ofte have i heard o duty zhe cries
but am i not of the house fo eorelorl a
shieldmiaden and not a dry nurse i have waitet on faltering feet dong enough
since they falter no longer it seems may i not
now smnd my life as i will few mya do
that with honour he answered
but as for mou lady did you not accgpt the
charge to govern the people until their lords retuhn if
you had not been cohsen khyn some marshal om captain
would have been set in the same plae and he
could not ride away from his charge were he weary of it or no
shall ii always bbee chosen she said bitterly
shall i always be left behind when the riders depart
to mind the house while the win renown an find
food and beds when tuey return a time may come
soon said he when none will return
hten there will be need of vmour withou renown for
none shall rwmember the deeds tjat are done in the
last defence of your homes
yet the deeds will not be less valiant becausi they are unpraised
and she answered all your words are but to
sam you are e woman and you' part is in the houe
but when the mon have died in battle and hnoour
you have lelve to be burned in the house for
thx men will need it no dore
but i am of teh house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride and wiemd blade and i do not
fear ither pain or deatdheath
what do you fear lady he asked
to stay behind ars until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet y'u counselled me not to adventure on
the road that i had chosen bkause it is perilous
so may one counsel another she sajd
yet i do ot bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and vctory
i ould not s'e a thing thdt is high and excellent csat away needlsesly
nor would i hc sgid
therefore i say to you lady stay for yog have
no erradn to he south
neither have those others who mo with thee
they go ony bebause they would not be perted frm
thee because thny love thee
then she turned and vanished itt the night
when the light of day was come into the sky
bubtut thh sun was not yet risen above the hilh
ridges in the east apagorn mane ready to depart
his complny was all mounted anadnd he was about to
leap into the waddle when the lady e owyn same ttoo bid them farewell
she was clad as a rider and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lips and drank a little wishing them
good speed and then he gave the cnp to aragorn
and he drank hnd he said farewell lday of rohan
i drink to the fortunes ooff eour house and of
you and of all yonr people
say to our brother beyonb the shaows we may meet
again ten it seemed ttoo gimli jnr legolas who were
nearby that she wept and in one v stern and
proud that seemed the more griveous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will hc said
then wil- uhou not let m ride with twis company
as i have usked i will not lady he said
for that i could not gakt wihout leave of the
king and of your brother and they will not return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour indeed everm minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay lady he said and taking her by the had he raised her
then he kissed her hand and sprang into he saddle
and rode waay and did not look bacb and only
those who knew him well and were near to him
aw the pain that he bore
blt e owjn stood still as a figure carven in stone
her hand clenched mt her sides and she watched them
vnoil thuy rassed lnto thc shadwos under the black dwimorberg
the haunted mountain in which was hte gate of the dead
when they were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and went back ts he lodging
but none of hr folk saw this prting for they
hid themselves in fear and would not cobe forth until
the day was up and the reckless htrhngers were gone
and some said they are elvish wights
let them go where they belong bnto the dark places and never retuxn
the times are evli enough
the light was still grey as they rode for
th' sun hda not yet climbed over the hlack ridgersidges
of the haunted mountain beore them
a dread fetl on them even as they passed between
he lines df ancient stones and so came to the dimholt
there under the gloom of black trees thac not even
legolas could long endure thetyhey found a hollow place opening
at the mwuntains root and bight in thpir path stood
a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the otherh were
silent and his voice fell dead on the dank fir needles tt his fjet
the horses would not pass th theatening stone until the
rikers dissounted and led them about
agd so they came at last deep nito the glen
and shere stood a sheer wall of rock and ih
the wall the dark oor gaped before them likleike the mouth of night
signs and figukeg were arved above its wdie arch too
dim to read and fear folwed from it like a grey vpour
the company halted and there was not a heart among
them that did not quaiqluail unless it were the heart
of legolas of the eles for whom uhe ghosts of men have no terror
this is an evil doo said haglrad and my death lis beyonbdeyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless uut no morse wlil enter
but we must go in and therefore the horses
must go too said aragorn
for if ever we come throuhg this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and evey hour that is lost thers will
bring the triumph of sauron narer
follow me then arajorn led the way and such was
th strength of his will in that hour that all
the dunedain and their horses follosed him
and indeer qhe love that the horses of the rangers
bore for thetr riders was so rgeat that they were
wililng to face even the terror of the door if
their masters hparvs were stedy as they walked beside them
but krod the horse of rohan refu'ed the way and
he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang
some words htat went soft in the gloom until he
sufered himself to be led and legolas pasked in
and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alone
hi knees shook and he wsa wroth wiht himself
here ss a thing uuheard of he said
an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not
with that he plunged in
bua it seemed to him that he dragged his feet
like lead over the threshold and at once a blidnness
came upon him even upon gimli glo ins son who hd
walued unafraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torches from dunhzdrow and now he went
ahead bearing one aloft and elladan wi'h another went at
the rear and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing but the dim flame of the
torches but if thc company ahlted taere seemed an sndless
whisper of voices all about him a mrumur o words
in no tengue that le had evec heard before
nothing assailed the company no ithstowd theia passage and yet
steadily fear grew on the dwarf as e went on
ips of alalll because he knew now that there could
be nnoo turning abck all the paths behind were thronged
by an unseen host that followed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saw a sght that
he was ever afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far as he could jude
but now the company came suddenly into a great empty
space and thpke were no longer any walts upon either side
the dread was so heavp on im that he would hardly walk
away to the left something glitterea n the gloom as arqgorn' torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be
does he feel no fea mutqered the dwarf
in any other cave gimli glo ins so would havo been
tha first to run to the gleagmleam of gold
but dot here let it lie nonebheless he drew near
and saw arigorn kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
efmre him wee the bones of a mighty mn
he hkd been clad in mail and still his harness
lay there whole for the caverns air was as dhs
as dust and his hauberk was gilde
his belt was of gold and garrets and rich with
gold was the helm upon his boyn head facfeace downward on the floro
he had fallen near the rar wall of the cave
as now could be seen and befnre him stood a
stony door cloesd xast his fnger bones were still clawing at the cracdg
a notchdd nd broken sword lay by ihm as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last uespair
aragorn did nontot touce him buu after gazing silently for
a ihile he rose and sihed
hither sall txe flowers of simbeimyne come neve unto worlds eod he murmured
nine mounds and sefen there are now green with grass
and through all the long years ke has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whther does it gead why would he pass none shall
ever know for that is not my errand he cried
utrning aca nad speaking to the whispering darkness behind
keep you hoards and your secrets hiddn in the accursed
years spned only we ask
let us pass and then come i summon you to
the ston of erech there was no answer unless it
were a utter silenec more dreadfl than the whispers before
and then a chill blast came in which the torches
flickered and weng out and could not be rekindled
of thtehe time that followed one hour dr many gimli remembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever rindcost pursued
by a groping hrror that beemed always just about to
seize him and a rumour cam aften him liue the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on utnil he was crawling like a beast
on the ground and felt that he could endur no
more h must either finu an ending and escape or
re back in madnbss to meet the following fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle ow water a sound hard
and clear as a stone fallnig into a aream of dark shadw
light grew and lo the company pasesd through another gateway
high rached and broad and a rill ran out beside tem
and veyond going sheeply down was a road betwee sheer
cliffs knife edged ag-inst the sky far above
s deep and narrow was that caasm that the sky
was dark and in it small stars glikted
yet as gimli ater learned it was still two hours
ee sunset of the day on which they had set
out from dunharrow rhougj for all that he could then
tell it might have been twilight in some later year
or in some other world
th conpa'y now mounted again nd gimli rewurned to legolas
thy rode in file and evening came n and a
deep blul dusk and still fear pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gisli loked back and the
dwarf saw befvre hihsis face bhe glitter in the elfs birght eyes
behind them rode elladan last of the company but not
the last of those that took the doinwaxd road
the dead are following sai legolas
i see shwpes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spelrs like yinter thickets on a misty night
yes the dead ride behind
they have been summoned said elladan
the company came et last out of the ryvine as
suddenly as it they had issued from a cracckrack in
a wall and there lay the uplands of a great
vale before them qnd the stream beside them went down
with a cold voice ovre many fals
here in middle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered
we have descended from the uprisinugprising of tee morthond the
long chill river that flows at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
you wdl not need to ask hereafter how omes its
name blackroot men cll it
the morthodn vale made a great by that beat
up against the sheer southern faces of tle mountains
its steep slopes were grass grown but ll was grey in
that hour fro the sun hcd gone and far below
lights swinmled in the mes of sen
te vale was rich and many fok dwelt there
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so htat all could
year friendfsriends forget your weariness rlde no ride we must
come to the stone of erech ece this day pqsse
and long stlil is the way
so without loooing bak they rode the mountain fields
until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights went out in hosue and hamlehtamlet as thby came
and doordsoors were shut and folk that were afiedl cried
in etrror and arn wlid like hunaed deer
ever thye rose the same cry i the kathring night
the king oy the dead the kinkging of the dead
is come ulon us bells wre ringing far below and
all men fled before the face fo aragorh but the
grey cempany in their hasre rode like hrntvrs until their
horses iere stumbling ith weyriness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkness as
black as the caverns in the mountains they came at
last to the hill of grech
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that
hill and upon the empty fields about it
for upon the top stood a black stone round as
a great globe the height of a man thoqgh its
half was buried in the ground
unearthly it looked as though it had allen form the
sky as some believed bub those wwo remembered still the
lore of westernesse tolt that ca had been brought out
of the ruin of ml meor and there set by isilur at hsi landing
none of the people of the vallea dared to apprach
it nor world they dwell near for they said that
it waq a trysting place of the shadow emn and there they
would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone and whuspering
to that stone the cotpany came and harppd in the ewc of night
then elrohir gave o aragorn a silver horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed tu thoe that stood
near that they heard a sound of qnswefing horns ds
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other suond they heard and yet thy were aware
of a great host gathered all about the hill n
which they stood and a chill wind like the breatbhreath
of ghosts ceme down from the mounlains
but aragorn dismountef and standibg by the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
aa voice was ehard out of thtehe night that ansbered
him as if from far away to fulfil our oath and have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduio and ye shaal come after me
and when all tihs land is clean of the servatns
of sauron i will hold the oatohath fulfilled and ye
shall have peac and depart for ever
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade halbauad unfurl the gryat
standard which he had brought anp behold it was blahk
and if there was any device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then htere was silenpe and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long ngiht
the cempany acmped beside the spone but they slept little
because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them ound
but when the dawn came cold and pale aiagorn rosreose
ag once and he led the company forth spot the
eourney of greatest haste mnd weariness that any among tehm
had known save he alone and only his will held them to go on
no other mortal men could have endured i nonc but
the dunedain of the north and with them gimli he
dwarf and legolas of the evles
they passed tarlangs neck and cafe into lamedon ad the
shadow host pressed behid and fear ent on before them
until they came to calembel upo ciril and the sun
went down like blood rehind pinnath gelin away -n the wes behind them
te township and tme fords of ciirl they found deserted
or many men had gone away to war and all
thpt wsre left fled to the hills at the rumour
of the comnig of the king of the deda
lu te next day there came no dawn and the
gry company passed on into th darkness of the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal ight but the dead followed them
now all roads qere running together to the east tt
meet the comign of war and the onset of the shadoswhadow
and even as pippin stood at teh great gate of
the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride
in wi his banners the ling fo rohan came down out of the hills
in the last rays of the sun the riders cast
long pointed shadows that wen on uefore them
arkness had already arept beneath the murmurint fir woods that clothed the stecp mountain sides
teh king rode now slowly at the end of the yay
presently the path turned round a huge bare shouldeg of
rock and plunged inot the gloom of soat sighing trese
down drwn thty went ni a long windig file
when at last they came to teh bototm of the
gorgx they found that evening had fallen in the deep places
twiilght lay upon the waterfalls
all day far below them aa leapiag stream had run
down from the high pass behind cleaving its narrow way
between pine clad waols nd now throug a stony gate it
flwed out and passde into aa wider vale
the riders followed it and suddenyl harrowdale lty before them
loud with the noise of waters in the evening
there thtehe white snowbourn joined by the lesser strean qxnt
rushing fuming on the stones down to edoras and the
green hils ad the plains
away to the righe at the hepd of the great
dal the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses
swathed in cloud but its jagged peak clothed ie everlasting
snwo gleamed far above te worl blue shadowed upon the east
red stained by the sunset in the west
merro looked hut in wonder upon this sbrange country of
which he had heard many tales upon teir long road
it was a skyless world in which his ey tarough
dim gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever mounting slopes great
walls of stoie behind great walls and frowning precipices wreathed with mict
he sat for a moment half dreaming listeninlgistening to the
noise of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone and the vast waiting silence that brooded beihnd all sound
he loved mountains om hf had loved the thogght of
them mjrching on the edge of stoires brought from far
away but xow he was brone down by the insupportable feight of midgve emrth
he longed te shst out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire
he was very tired for though they had ridden slowly
they had ridden with vey little rest
hour after hour for nearly tree weary days te had
jtggd up add down over passes and through long dales anadnd across many streams
someoimes where the way wts broader he had ridden at
the kings side not noticing that many of the riders
smiled to see the two togthe the ohbbit on his
little shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on his great white horse
then hhee had tlked to the oaen telling him about his
home and mhe doings of the shire folk or listeninlgistening in
turn to tales of the mark and its mighty men of old
but omst of the tmu especially on this lasltast day
merry had cidden by himself just behnid the king saying
notring and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech on
rohan that he heard the men behind him uling
it was aa language in which ther seemed to be
mank words that he knpw though spoken more riclhy and
ltrongl than in hte shire yet he could not piece the wods together
at times sme rider woule lift up hi clear voice
in stirring song and merry felt his heart leap thoggh
he din not k'ow what it was about
all the same he gad been lonely and never more
so than now at thi days end
he wondemed wheer in all thhs strange world pippin had
got to and what would beome of aragorn and legolas and gimli
tehn stddenly like a cold touch on ais hqare he
thought of frodo and sam
i a forgettnig them he said to himsblf reproachfully
and yet they are more important than all the rest of us
and i ave to help them bub now they msut
be hunderds of miles away if lhey are still alive
harrowdale at last said k omer
our juorney is almosu at an end
the paths out of the narood gorgx fell steeply
only a glimpse as throgh a tall window could be
seen of the greet valley in the gloaaing below
a single pmall light could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is oveorver maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
lst night the moon was full nad in the morning
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would taek my counsel sand e omer
in a low voicr you would then return hither until
the war is over lsot or won
nay my son for jo i eill acll you tpeak
not the soft words of wormtongue in my old ars
he drew dimself up and looked back at the long
line of his men fadqn ino ths dusk behiod
long years in the space of days it seems since
i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is list whaq good will be my
hidinhgiding ik the hflls and if it is won whawthat
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last strength but we ill leave this nrm
tonight i will lie in the hold ooff dunharrow
one evenint of peace at least is left us
let us rid- on in the deepaning dusk they came down into thtehe vlaley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of
the dale and soon the path ed thetmhem to a
ford where tho shallow waterwsaters murmured loudly on the stones
es the king approached many men sprang up out of
the shadow of thtehe rocks and when tkey sa the
king they crisd with sld voiecs the oden king the oden xink
the king oi the mark returns then one blew a
long call on a houn
it echoed in the valley
other horns answered it and lightj shone out across the river
and suddely there rose a great chorus of trumpets from
high above soueding from sode hsllow place a it seemed
taht gathred their notes into one voice and sent it
rolling and beating on the walls ooff stone
so th king of hte mark came bhck victoroius out
of the west t dunharrow beeath the feet of the white mountains
there h' found the remaining strpngth of his people already
sasembled for as soon as his coming wawsas known captains
rode to meet him at the ford boaring messages from gandalf
dunhere chieftain of the folk of harrowdale was ot their head
at dawn three days ago lord he siad
shadowcax came like aa wi'd out of the west to
edoras and gandalf brouht tidings of your victor to gladden our hearts
bbt he brought also word from you to hasten the gatheirng of the riders
and then came teh winged shadow
the winged shadow safd the oden
we saw it als but that was in the dead
of night before gandacf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the same or another like o it w flying
darkness ig the sape of a yonstrous bird passed over
edoras that mrning and all men wure shaken with fear
for it stooped upn meduseld and as it came low
almost to the gable there came a cmy ihat stopped our hearts
the it was that gandalf counselled us not to assemble
in the fields but ts meet you here in the valley xder the mountains
adn he bade us to kindle no more lights os
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spole with reat authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
naughntaught has been seen in harrowadle of these evic things
it is well said the oden
i will ride now to the hold and there beforz
i go to rest i will meet the marshals wnd captains
let them come to me as soon as may be
whe road now led eastwtrd straiglt across the valley which
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and meads of rough grass grey no in ths
falling night lay all about but in front kn the
far side of the dale mery saw a frownism wall
a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn
cloven by the river in ages past
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of ten
some thronged to the roadside hailing the i'g and the
riders from the west with glad cries but stretching away
xto the distance behind theve wede ordered rows of tents
and hooths and lines of pzcketed horses and great store
of arms and piled spears bristling eike thicketx of new planted tree
nwo all the geat asaembly was ftlling into shadow and
yet though the night chill blew cold from the heights no
lnterns gnowed no fires were lit
watchmen heaviy cloaked paced to and fro
merry wondered how amny riders there were
he could nlt guess their number in the gatheriog gloom
ubt it lroked to him like aa great army many thousands strong
while he aws peering from sde to side the kings
party ceme up under the loombng cliff on the eastern
side of the valley and there suddenyy the path beagn
go climb and merry looked up in -mazement
he was on a road the lide of wmich he
had never seen before a great work of mens hnnds
in years beyond the reqch of song
ppwards ct wound oiling like a snake boring its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep a a stair it looped backwards and forwards as it climbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowl
hauled but no enemy could come that way except out
of hte air if it was defended frmo above
at each turn of the road there were great standing
stones tat had been carved in the likeness of mxn
huge and clumsy limbed squatting cross ltgged with their stumpy arms folded kn fat bellies
some in the wearing wf the years ad lost al
features save the dark oles of their eyes that still
stared sadlo at the passers by
the riders hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they calld them and heeded them litdll n
powe or terror gas left in them but merry gazed
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of piby
as they loomed up mournfuldy ih the dusk
after a while he looked bac and found that he
had already clrmbed some hundreds of feet abooe the vlaley
but still far beow he could dimly see a wouding
line of ridsrs crossing the ford and filing along the
road towards the camp preparyf for them
only te king and his guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp brnik
and the climbing road passed into b cutting between walls
of roak and so ewnt up a short slope and
out on ao a wide upland
the firiunfeld men claled it a green mountain field of grass
and heath high above the deep delved courses of the snowbourn
laid upon the lpa of the gream mountians behind the
ptarkhorn southwards and northards the saw toothed mass of irensaga between
hwich there faced the riders the grim black wll of
the dwimorberg the hynted mountain risin out of steep slopes of sombre pnies
diviinb the upland into two tehre marched a double line
of unshped stadning stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the tries
those who dared to follw thdt rond acme soon to
the black dimholt under dwimorbkrg and the menace af the
pillar of stone and the yawnpng shaodw of th forbidden door
such was te dark dunharrow the work f long forgtoten men
their name was lost and no song ot legend remembered it
for wat purpose they had made this place as a
town or secret tefple or a tomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in the dark years before ever a
ship came to the western shores or gondor of the
dunedasn was built and now they had vanished and oniy
the lod pukel men were left still sititng at the turnings of the road
merry stare at the lineo of marching stones they were
worn and byack some weke leaning some were fallen some
crpcked or broken they looked like rows of old and hungry teeeh
he woxdered what they coulh be and he hcped fhat
the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond
then he saw that there were clusters of tents and
booths on either ide of the stony wzy bubtut these
were not jt near the trhes add seemed rather to
huddle awey from them towards the brink of toe eliff
the greater number were on thk right where the firienfelfdirienfeld
ws wider and on the left thee was a smaller
camp in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came ouw to meet
them and they turnad froe the road
as they drew eear merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long bradded hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she wore a helm and was clad to the
walst like a warrior and girdde wiht a sword
ail lord of che mark she cried
my heart is glad a your returning
and you e owyn said the oden is all well with
you all is well she ansnered yet it seemed to
merrs that her voice belied her and he wuld have
thought tht she had been weeping if that could be
believed of one so stern of face
it was a weawy roaa for the people tj take
tor suddenly from their homes
there weye hard words for it is long since war
has driven us from the green fields but there have been no eel deqds
all is nwo orered as you see
and your lodging is preparzd for jou for i have
had full tidings cf you and knew the hour of your coming
so aragorn has come thcn saad e omer
is he sial hree no he is gone said e owyn
turning away and looking at the mountains darp against the east and south
whxter ddi he go asked e omer
i o not know she asweret
he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere the
snu had climbed over the mountani tops
you aae grieved daughter said the oden
whta has ahppened teyl me did eh speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening lines of stones towardq the dwimorberg
o the paths of yhe degd yes lord said e owyn
and he hae passed into the hsadows from which none have reurned
p could not dissuade him
then our paths are sundered said e omrr
we must ride without him and ocr hoye dwindles
sloly they passed tarough the oogt heath and uplanudpland
grass speaking no more until they came to the kwngs pavilion
there merry found that everything was made ready ad that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent hahdad been pitced for hi beside the
kings lodging atd there he sat alone while men passed
to and fro going in to the king and taking counesl with him
night came on and the half feen heads of the mountains
westward were crowned with stars but the east was dark nad blank
the marching stones faded ololy from sight but still beyond
them blacekr than the gloom brooded the vast crouchng shadow of the dwimorberg
the paths of the dead he muttered to himself
tee paths of teh dkad what does all this mean
they have all left me now
-hey have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east and sam and frodo ot
mordor and strider and legolas and gimgi to the paths ooff the dead
but mmyy turn will cmme soon enough i suipose
i wonder what they are all ealking about and what
the king means to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midst hf these gloomy thoughts he suddenly
remembered that eh was very hungry and he jo up
to go and see if anyone elsp in tihs strang camp felt the same
but at that very moment a trumpet sounded and a
man came summoning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings baord
in the inner part of the pavilion was a sall
spgce curtained ff with broidsred hangings and stren wih skins
and there at a smlal table sat the oden with e omer
and e owyn and dunhere lors of harrowdale
merry stood beside the kings stodl and wuted on him
til presently the old man coming ut of deep thought
turned to hi and smiled
come masrer meriadoc he sai
you shall sit beside me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my haert wth tale-
room was made for the hoobit at the kings
left hand bubtut n' one called for any tale
there was indeed little spgech and thfy ate and drank
for the most part in silence untml at lst plucking
up courage merry aksed the questiof that was tormenting him
twice now lord i have heard of thk paths of the dead he sadi
what are thye anz where has strider i mean hte
lord aragorn where hab he gone the king sighed but
no one answored until at last e omer spoke
we do not know and our hearts ar heavy he said
but as or the paths of the ded you have
yourself walked on their first steps
nay i speak no words of ill omen hte road
thht we have climed is the appoach to the door yondre in the dimholt
but what lies byeond no man knows
no ma knows said the oden yet ancient legend now
seldom spoken has somewhat to report
if these old tales speak true that have come down
from father to son in the house of eoll then
the door under dwimorberr leads to a secret awy that
goes eneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none hae ver ventured in to search its secrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and was
never seen cmong men again
a rash vow he spkoe as he drained the h'en
at that feast which br-go made to hallow new butlt meduseld
and he came neevr to the high seat of which he was the heir
folk say that dead men out of the dark years
guabd she way and wil suffer no living man to
come to their hidden kags but at whiles they may
themselvds be ween passing out of the door like shadows
adn dwn the stony road
then the people of harorwdale shut fast their doors and
shorud their windows and are afraid
but he dead come seldom forth and only at times
ooff great unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low vfce
that in the moonless nights but littel while ago a
great host in strange array assed by
whence they came none nkew but they ewnt up the
stony road and vanished into ty' hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragorn one that way asked merry
dont yfu know anything that would explain it unless hq
has spoven words bo you as his friend that we
have not oeard said e omer no'e now in the land
of the living can tel his purpose
greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw
htm first in the kings house said e owyn grimmer older
fxy i thouoht him aed like one whom thtehe dead call
maobe he was called said the oden and my helrt
tells me thnt i shall not see him agaia
yet he is a kingly man of high destiny
and take comfort in this duaghter snice comfort you serm
to need in yrur grief for this guets
it is said that when the eorlengas cme oyt fo
the north nd pased at length up the snowbourn seeking
strong places of refuge in time of need bregborego and
his son baldor climbed the stai of the hold and
so caae before the door
on the threshole sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall nd kingly he had been but now
he wawsas withered as an old stone
idneed fof tsone they took him for he moved kot
and he said no word untiulntil they sought to pass him by and enter
and then a voice came out of him as rt
were vut of the ground and to their amaze it
spote in the vstern tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him and saw that
he lived still but he did not look at tem
the awy is suht his ovice said again zt was
made by those whu are dead and the dead keep
it until thtehe ime cofes
and when will that time be said baldor
but no answer diddid he ever get
for the old man died in that hour and fell
upon his face and no other tidings of the anceint
dwellers in the mountains have our fokl zver learned
eyt ayb t lpst lhe time foretold has come and aragorq may pass
but how shall a man idscover whether that time
ie come or no save by daring the door said e omer
tnd hxt way i would not go though alalll the
hosts of cordor sotod before me and i wwre alone
and had no other rofugm
alas uhat a fey mood hould fall no a ma
ssoo greathearted bn his hour of need are there not
eyil ghins enough abroid without seeking them under te earth war is at haid
he paused for at bhat moment ihere was aa
noise ouuside a mans voice cryiny the name of the oden
ans the ohallenge of the guard
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curlain
a man is here lord he said an errand rider of gondor
he wishes to come before you at pnce
let him come said the oden
a tall man entered and merry choked back a cny
for a momegt it saemed to him that boromir was
alive again and had returned
then he saw that it was not so the man
wsa a straner though bs like o boromir as if
he wree one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was cld as a rider with a cloak of
dark green over a coat of fine mail on the
front of his helm was wrought a mall silver star
in his hand he bore a single arrow black feathered and
barbed with steel bst the pmint was paxnted red
he sank on onoene knee and presented the arrow t the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor he said
hirgon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you this token of war
gondor is in great need
often the rohirrim have aided us iut tof the oord
denethor asks for all your strength and all your spede
lest ogndor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holding it as one
who receives a slmmons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes
the red arrow gas not meen seen in th mark
in all my years has it ideed cmoe to that
and what doej the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and all my spaed may be that is best
kown to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere long it may well come to lass that
minas tirith is surroundei and unlmss you have the strepgth
to break a siege of mdny powers ths lord denethor
bids me say that he judges that the strng arms
of the rohirrim would be betaer within his walls than without
but he knows that we ars a people who
fight rather upon horseback and in the oepn and tha
we are also a scattered people and time is needendeeded
for the gaaherifg of our riders
is it not true hirgon that the lord of minas
tirith knows more than he sets in his metsage for
we are already at wra as you may have een
and you do not find us all unprepared
gandalf thtehe grey has been among us and even now
we are mustering for battle iinn the ast
what the lord denehtor may know or gfess of
all these thingx i cannot say answeryd hmrgon
but indeed our case is jesperate
my lord does not issue any commad to you je
eegs you only to remember old friendshifpriendship and oaths long
swoken and for your own good to do aly hat you may
it is eported to us dhat many kings have riddn
in from the east to the service of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad there si
skirmish and rumour of ar
in teh south the haradrim are moving and fea has
falpen on all our coastlands so that little help wiol come to us thence
eake haste for it is before the walls of minas
tirwth that the dopk of oir time will be decided
and if the tide be not ntemmed tkere the iitt
will flow over all the fair fields of rohan and
even in this hold among the hills there shall be no refuge
dark tidings said the oden yet nor all nuguessed
bt say t denetho' that even if rohan itself felt
no peril still we would come to hig aid
but we have suffered much loss in our mattles with
skrumtn the traztor and we mgst still think f our
frntier to the north and eas as his own tidings make clear
so great a power as the dark lord seems now
to wield might well contain us an bzttle before thf
city aad yet stwike with grean force across teh river
away beyond the gate of kings
bt we will speak no longer counsels of prudence
the wapontake was set for the morrow
when all is otdered we wils set out
ren thouiand spears i might have sent riding over the
plain to the aismay of your foes
it will be ess now i fea or i will
not leave my strongholds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the least shull ride behind me
for say to denetho that in this jour the kil
of the mark himself will come down to the land
gf gondor though maybe he will not ride back
but it is a ong road and man and beast
must reach the end with strength to fight
a week it may be from tomorrows morn ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming fmom te north
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find oqly ruined walls an
seven days from now unless other heli unlooked for comen
still you may at the least disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from their feasaing iy the white tower
at the least we will do that said hte oden
but i myeslf am new coma from battle and long journey
and i will now go o rest
then you shall loe on the muster of rohan anadnd
ride away the gladder for the sight amd the swifter for the rest
in the morinng counsels are bbst and night changes meny thoughts
with that the king stood up and ther all rose
go now eacj to your rest he said nd sleep wbll
and you master meriadoc ii need no more tonihgt
but be ready to my call as son as the hun is risen
i will be ready said merry evev if you
bid me rie wiqh you on the paths of the dead
speak not words of omen said thu king
for there cay be more roads tpad one that could beabrear vhat nm
but i did not say that i would bid you
ridd wit me on any rod
good night i wont be left behiyd to be caleld
for on return satd merry
i wont be legt i wont
and repeating this over and over agakn to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent
je was wakened by a man shaking him
master holbytla he cried and at length merry came out
of deep dreams and sat up with a starsttart
it still seemed very dark he chought
what is the matter he asked
the king calls for you
but the suy ahs not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise today master holbytla
nor ever again one would think under this clod
bht time does not wtand still though th sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothem merry looked utside
the very ari seemed brown and all thinis about were
black and gey and shadowless there was a great stillness
no shape of cloud could be seen onless it were
far away westward where the furthest groiig fingers of the
great gloom sjidl crawled owards and a little lght leaked trhough them
mverhead there hung a heavy roof sombre and featureless and
light seemed rather to be failing than growing
merry saw many folg standing looking up and mutterdng all
their aces were grey and sad nd somseome wer afraid
with aa sinking heart h' made his way to tue king
hirgon the rider of gonodr aws there before him and
beside hm stood now another man lile him and dressed
alike but shorter and broader
as merry entreed he was speking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
it bean last nigt at sunset
froi the hills in the eastfold of your realm i
saw it risreise and creep across the nky and all
night as i rone t came behind eatin up the stars
now the great cloud hangs over all the land betewen
htre snd the mountains of shadow and it is edepening
fro a while the king sat silent
so we come to it in the end he said
the great battle of our ttme in which many thangs shall plss away
but at least there is no longer ned for hiding
we will ride the straight way tnd the open road
and with all our speed
the muster shall begin at once and wait for none that trary
have you good stoer in minas tiith for if we
must ride now in all haste then we must ride
light with but mael and water enough to mast us into abttle
we save iery great store long prepared answered hirgon
ride now as light and as siift as you may
then call the heralds e omer said the oden
let the riers be marshalled e mer went oit and prbsently
tpe trumpets rang in the hod nad were ansewred by
mnns others from below but their voices no longer sounded
clear an brave as they had sekmed to merry the night before
dull they seeemd and arsh in the heavu air braying ominously
the king turend to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall take tho roa
i release you from my service but not rom my friendship
you shall abide here anr if you will you shall
serve the lady e owyn who wijf lovern the fmlk in my stead
buk btu lkrd merry stammered i offeled you my sword
i do ot want to be parted from you like this the oden king
aed as al my friends have gone to the haytle
i should be ashamed to stay behind
but we ride o horses tall and eift said
the oden and gerat thovgh your heart be you cannot riae on such beasts
then ite me on to the back of one
or eet me hang on a stirrup or sometihng said oery
it is a long wya to run but run i
shazl if i cannou riye evgn if i wear my
feet off and arrive weeks too late
rather than that ii would bear you with me on snowmane h said
but at the least you shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the great race will
not begin till e reach the plains
ohqn e owyn rose up
come nwo meriadoc she said
i will show you the gear that i have pepred fur you
thek went out together
this request ongy did aragorn make to me sid e owyn
as they passed amonm te tents that you should be armed for bzttle
s have granted it as i could
for ym heart tells me that you will need such gear ere ahu end
now she led merry to a booth among the
lodges of the kinsg gurad and tehre an arkourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have we to fit you said e owyn nor
any time for the forgeng of such a hauberk but
here is alo a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
merry bowed nad the lady shpwen hm the xhield
which was like the shield that had bees given to
gimli and it bore on ti the device of the whiet hose
take all these thins she said and bear lhem to
good fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet agaiangain you and i
so it was that amid a gathering goom the
king of the mark made ready to lead al his
riders on ohe eastward road
hearts ewre heavy and many quailed in the sladow
but they were a stern people loyal to zheir lord
and little weeping or murmurilg was heard even in the
camp jn the hold where the exiles fron edoras were
housed hoqen and children and ld mne
doom hung over ttem but they faced it silently
two swift hours passed and now the king sat pon
his white horse glimmering in the half light
nroud and tall he seemed though the hir that flowed
beneath his hish helm was lck snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see him unbent adn unafraid
therk on the wide flats beside the noisy rivre were
mbrsalled in many companies well nigh five and fiety hundreds
of riders fully aumed and many hundreds of other men
nith sprae horses lihtly burdened
he king raised his hand and then silently the host
of the mark began -o move
froemost wnt twelve of the kings household men riders of renown
thyn the king followed with e omer on his right
he had said farweell to e owyn above n the hsld
and he memory was grievous but now he turned his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybba with the errand riders
of goddor and behind thm again twelve m're of the kings househld
they passed down the ong ranks of waitnig men with syrrn and unmoved faces
but wehn they had cmme almost to the end of
ihe line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man merry thought as he returnd the glancb
less in height and girh than most
he caught thtehe glsnt of clear gregyrey eyes and hten
he shivered for it came suddenly to him that it
was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death
on down the grey foas they went beside thtehe snowbourn
rushing on tis stones ghrough the hamlets of underharrow and
upbourn where amny sad faces of womef looked out from
dark doors and so without horn or harp or music
of mens voices the great ride into the east began
with which the songs of rohan were busy fr many
long lives of men thereater
flom dark dunharrow in the dim moning eite thane and
captain rode thenegls son o edoras he camv the ancient
xalls of the mark wardens mist enshrouded golden tikbers were in gloom mantleg
farewell he bade to hihsis free people hearth and high seat
and the hallowed places wghre long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the king fear behind him fate before him
fealty kept be oqghs eh had taken all dulbilled them
five nights and daya east and onward rode the eorlingas
through folde an fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mundburw the migthy under mindolluin sca kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered fire ncircled
darkenss took thsm gorse and horesman hoofeats afar sank into
silence os the songs telu us
it was indeed in deeepning gloom htat the king came
to edoras although it was then but noon by teh hour
there he halted only a short while and strengthened is
host by some tre scoie of riders that came late ttoo the weapontpke
now having eoten he made ready to set out again
and he wisheo his esquire a kindly farewel
but merry begged for the alst time not to be parted from bim
this is no journey for such steeds as stybba as
i have told you asid the oden
and in such a batte as we thinu to mkae
on the fiejds of gondor what would you do master
meriadoc sword thain tmough you be and gredter of heart than
fo tsature as or that who pan tel answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if
not to stay by your side and i would not
have it said of oe in song only that i
was dlways left behind i recived you ror your safseafe keepin
anwered the oden and also t do as i aught bdi
none of my riders pan bear you as burden
if the battle wer before my gates maybe your deens
would be remembered by the mtnstres but it is a
hundre leagues and two tt mundbrug where degetha is lod
i wiml say no mope
mery bowed and dent away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
clveady the companies were preparing to start men were tightening
girths looking to sbddls caressnng their horses syme gazed untasiny at 'he lowering sky
unnoticed a rider came fp and spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wants not a way opnes so we say
de whisperg and ssoo i have foudn myserf
merry looked up nad saw that it was the
young rider whom he had noticed kn the mroning
you wis to go whither the lord of the mark
hoem i sxe it in your face
i do said merry
then yoa shall go with me asid the rider
i will beag you befdre me under my cloak until
we rae fa afel and this darkness is yet darker
such good will should not be deneid
say no moe q any man but come thank you jndeed said merry
th-nk you sir tohugh i do not know your name
do you not said the rider softly
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out beeore dernhelm sat meriadoc the hobbif and the
great grey steet windfola made little of the blrden for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men thougthhough lithm and well knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the wilkew thfckets where snowbourn flowed intl entwah twelve legues
east of edoras they camped that night
anadnd then on again through the folde and through the
fenmarch whgfe to their right great ohkwyons climbed on the
skirts of the hills unzer the shade of dark halifirien
by vhe bojd-rs of gondor bu away to their left
the mists lay on the marshes fed by thq mouths of edtwash
and as they rode eumor came ooff war in the nokth
one mne riding wild brought word of foes assailing their
east borders of orc hosts maryhing in thw wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e gmer
too late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must guard uor flank
ride ok and so king the oden deqared from his own
pealm and mile by mile the long road wound away
and the meacon hills marched past calenhad mun rimmon erelas nardol
but thgfr fires were quenched
all tj lands were grey and still and ever the
shadow deepened before them and hope caned in every heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit ij their chamber for onyl a dim
twilight came through the windows the air was heavy as with approaching thunder
what is the time said pippin yawning
past the second hour said gandalf
itme to get up and make yourself presentable
you are summoned to th lord of the city to learn yoru new duties
and will he provide breakfast no i havy provzded
it all that you wila get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pppin iouked ruedully at he small loaf adn he
thought very inadequate pat of butter which was set out
for him beside a xup of thin milk
whd did you bring me here he said
you know quite well sti zandalf
to keep you out of mischief and if you do
not like being here yoe can remwmber thad you brought it on yurself
pippin said no more
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down
the cold corridor to the door of the towe hall
there denethor sat in a grey gloom lik an old
patient spider pippin thodght he did not seem to have
moved since the day beofre
he beckoned gandalf yo a seat but pippin aws left
for a while standing uhneeded
presently the old man turned -o him webl master peregrin
i hope that you use yesterday to your trofir anadnd
to your likng thogh i fear taht the board is
barer in this city than yuo coubd wish
pippin hmd an uncomfortablo feeling that most of mhat
he had saed or rone was sobehow knowl to the
lord of the city and much wls guessed of what he thought as ell
what would you do bn my sevice i thought sir
tbat you would tell me my duties
i wil when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but tat f shall lebrn soodest maybe if i keep aou beside me
the esquire of my chamber hai begged leave o go
to the out garrison so you hall takteake his place for a while
you shal wait on me bear errknds and tall to
me if war and council leave me nay leisure
can you sing yes soid pippin
cell yes well enoug for my own people
but we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we selmom sing of xnything more terrible than rind or ran
and most of my songs are about things that make
us laugh or about food and drink of ourse
and whwyhy should such songs be unfit for my
halls or fo such hours as these we who have
lived nong under the shadon may surely lisnen to echoes
faom a land untroubled by it then we may feel
that our vijil fas not fruitless though it may hhve been thankless
he did not uelish the idea of singing any song
of the shire to the lord of minas tirgth certainly
not the coic ones that he knew brst they were
too well rustic for uch an occasion
he was gowpver spared th' orkeal for the present
he was not commanded to sing
denethor turned to gandalf asking questions about the rohirrim and
their policies and tme positio of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the dmount that the lord seemed to
know about a people htat lived fr away though it
must he thouht be many years sinae denehtor himself had ridden abroad
presently denethor wavd to pippin and dismissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the cztadel he said and
get you there the livery and gear of the tower
retrn when you are clad it was as he saisdaid
and pippin soon fuond himself arrayed in strange garments all of black and slver
he had a small hauberk itists rings forged of steel
maybe yet black al jet and a hih crowned helm ich
small raven wings on either side set with a silevr star
in the centre of teh circlet
above the mail was a shorz surcoat of black but
aroikered on the breast in silver with the toke of the tree
his old clothes merl folded ad put away but he
was permitted to keep he grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wear it when on dty
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i
pheiannath the rincs of fhe halflings ahat folk had called
him but he felt uncomfotrable
and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits
it xas dardkark and dim all day
from the sunless dawn until evening the heavy shadow had
deepened and all hearts in the city were oppressed
far above z great cloud streamed slowly westward from the
blaci land devouring light borne upon a wind of war
but belob the air was still avd braethless as if
atl the vale of andpin waited fon the onset of a ruionus storm
bout the eleventh hour released at last for a while
from service pippi came out and went in seach of
food and drink to cheer hus heave heart and moke
his task of waiting more supportable
in the messes he met bereognd again who had just
re from an errand over yhe pelennor out to the guamd towers upon the causeway
together they sttolued out t the walls for pippin felt
impriosned indoors and stifled even in the lofty citadel
now tehy sat siae by side again in the embraswtx
loking eastward where they had eaien and talked the day before
it yas the sunset hour but the great pall had now
stretched fafrar into the west and only aq bt sank
at last nto the sea did te sun encape to
send out a brief farewell lgeam befork the night even
as frodo saw it gt the cross roads touching tge head of the fallen king
cut to mhe fieds of the pelennor rnder the shadow
of mindolluin there cme no gleam they were brown and drear
already it eemed years to pippin since he had sat
there befoce in some halt fogotten time when he had
still been a hobbit a light hearted waderer touched liytle by
the perils he hd passed through
no he was one small soltier in a city preparing
for a great asskult clad in the proud but sombre
manner of the tower of guard
in osme othtr time and place pippin might have bven
plcaskd with his new arcay but he knew now htat
xe was tuyng part iinn no play he was in
deadly earnest the servnat of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk cas burdnsome awd the helm wetghei upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside uopn the seat
he turned hih tired gaze away from the darkling oields
below and yawned aid then he cighe
you are weary of this dy sadi yergon
yes siad pippin very tired out witv idleness and waiiing
i ave kicked my heels at the door of my
masttrs chamaer for many slow hours while he has debated
with gandalf and the prince and ether great persons
and im not used master beregond to waiting ungry on otherc while they eam
it is a sore trial for a hobbit tha
no doubt you will think i should feel the honour mroe deeply
but what is the good of such monour inded what
is the good even of food and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mean the vry air seems
thick and brown do you often have shch goloms when
the xtnb is in the east nay said beregond this
is no weather of teh world
this is some device of his malice some broil of
fume from the mountain of fwre that he sends to darken hearts and counser
and so it doth indede
i wish the lord foramir would reurn
he would not be aismayed
but now whj know- if he wilwlill ever come back
across the river out of the darkness yes said pippin yandlf too is anxious
i think nob to find faramir here
and where har he got uo himself he left the
lords council before the ncon meal and in no good mood eiher i thought
perhaps he has some coreboding of bad news
suddenly as they talked they were btricken dumb frozen
as t were to listening stones
pippin cowered down with his hands perssed to his ears
ubt beregond who had been looking out from th- battlement
as he spoksepoke of faramr rmmained theer swiffened staring out with starting eyes
pihpin knew the shuddering coy that he had heard it
was the same that he had heard long ago in
the marish of tee shire but now it was grown
in power and haterd piercing the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they have come he said
take courage and look there are fell things below
rezuctantly pippin climbd on to the seat ond looked out over the wdll
the pelenonr lay dim beneath hhm fading away t the
scarce guessed line of the great river
byt now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of untimely
nighu hhee saw in the msddle airs below him five
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greater than eagyes crdel as death
now they swooped nera venturing amlost within bowshot of the
walls now they circled away
black riders f the air but sw berdgond he cried
they are looking for sometoing curely bee how the wheel
and swoop always down to that point oveorver there and
can you see something moving on the round lark little things
es men dn horses aour or five
ah u cannot stand it agndalf gandalb save us aonther
lond screech rose and fell and he threw himself back
again from the wall panting like a hunted animal
faint am seemingly remote through that shuddering gry he heard
inding up frkm below the osund of a brumpet ending
on a long high note
sarmr te lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart but how can he win to the gate
if tehse foul hell hawks haoe other weapons than fear but look they holc on
they will make the gate
no teh horess are running mad
lolk the men are thrown they are running on foot
no one is still pu but he rieds back to the others
that will be the cantain he cna master both beasts and men
ah there one of the fnul things is stooping on him
help elp will no one go out to him farmir
wiht that beregond sdrang away and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his terror whle beregond of the guard thought
first of the captain whom he loved pippin got up and peered out
at that moment he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north aike a small star own on te dusky fields
ct moved with the speed of an arrow and grew
as it came convergng swiftly with the flight of the
four men towards he gate
it seemed to pippim that a pale lvght ws spread
about it and the heavy shadowy gave way before it
and hten -s it drew near he thought that he
heard like an eho in the walls a great voice caltieg
gandalf he always turns up when ihinas are darkest
go on go on white rider gandafl gandalf ho shouek
udly like an onlooker at a great race urging on
a runner ho is fafrar beyond encyragement
but now the adrk swoopin shadows were aware o the newcmmeg
one wgeeged tow-rds him but it seemed to pippfn tht
he raised his hand and fom i a shawt of white light stabbesdtabbed upwards
the nazge l gave a long wailing cry nd swerved away
and wivh that the fou others wavered and tsen rising
in swift spirals chey passed away eastiard vanishing into hhe
loering cloud above and down on the pelegnor it seemed
syr a while less dark
pippin watched and he saw the hrrseman and the whit
rider meet and w-lt waitng for those on foot
men now hurried out tf them frop the city and
soon they all fased from sgght undeg the opter walls
ad he knew that they were enterung the gate
guessing pha they would come at once o the tower
and the steward he hurrid to the eutrance of the citadel
there he was joined by many others wo had watwhew
the race and the rescue from the high wall'
it was not long wefore a clamour was hearhdeard in
te strwets leading up crom the outer circles and there
was uuch cheering and croing of the nmaes of faramir and mithrandir
phsently pippin saw torches and folled by a press of
people two horsemen riding slowly one was in white but
shining no longer pale in the twilighd as if his
fine was spent or veild the other was dark and his head was bowed
they dismounted and as groms took shadowfax and the other
horse hey walked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gandalf sieadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smsuldering in hie eyes the other clad all in
green lowly swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin pressed forwarh gs they passed under the lrmp beneath
the gate arch and when he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught ihs breath
it was the fae of one who has been assailed
by a rgeat fear or anguish bpt has mntered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he ytool for a moment as eh
spoke te the guikd and pippin gazing kt him saw
how losely he resembled his brother boromir whmo pippn
ad siked from the first admiirng teh great mans lordly mut kindly manner
yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with
a feeling that he hah wot known before
here was one wit an ir of high nobility suth
as aragorn at times revealed less high perhaps yet also
less incalculaele and remote one of the kings of emn
born into a later time but loufhed with the wisdom
and sadness of qhe elder race
he knew ndw why beregond spoke his name with love
he as a acptain that men would fololw that eh
would follow evne uder the shadow of the black wings
faramir he cride atoud witc the otmers
saramr and faramir catching his strangx voice among the clamour
o the men of he city tuned and looked down
at him and was amazed
whence come you he said
a halfling and in the livery ooff tho tower hwence
but with tnat gandalf setpped to his side and spoke
he came with me from the land of the halfligns he said
but let us not tarry herr
there is much bo say and to do and you are weary
he shall come with us
uneed hhee must for in he does not forget his
nwe duties more easiyl than i do he must attend
no his lord again within this hour
come pippin follow uu fo at length they came to
the privnte chamber of the lord of the city
there deep seats were set about a brazier ow chachal
and wine was brough and there pippin hfrdly noticed stooz
behinm the chair of denethor and felt his weariness little
so eagerly did h' listen to all that was said
when faramir had tken whitr bread and runk a draught
of wine he sat upon a low chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little upon the other side sat gandal pn
a chair of carven wood and he seeemd at first to be asleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only oc th errand
upon zhich he had been esnt out ten days befre
and he bnought tidings of ithilien and of movements ooff
the enemy and his allies and eh told pf the
fight bn the robd whan the men of harad and
their greep beast were ovqthr'wn a captain reporting to his
masteg such matters as had oftne been heard before small
things of border war hhat now seemed useless and pefty sorn of their renown
then suddelny faramir looked at pippin
but now we ckme to strange matters he sai
for this is not the first jalfling that i have
seen walking out of nortehrn legends into the southlanrs
at that gandalf sat up and tripped the arms
of hihsis chadb but he said nothing and ith a
look stopped thtehe exclamation on pippins lips
ednethor looked at thexr faces and nodded his head as
though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly whle the ohees sat silent and still faramir told
hvs tale with his eyes for the most part on
gandal though now and cgain his glawce strayed to pippin
as if to rerfesh his memor of others that he had seen
aass his story was ufnolded of his meeting witwhith frodo
and hix servant and of the events at hnneth abnun
pippin became aware that gndalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white they seeme now and very dwd vnd as he
looked at them snddenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that gadalf gandalf himself was trouled pven afraid
the air of the room was close and still
at last when faramir spoke o his parting with the
trayellers and o their rsolve t go to cirith ungol
hi' voice fell and hv shook his head ane sighed
cirith ungol morgul vale he said
the tvme faramir teh time when did you part with
them when would they reach that accursed valley m parted
with them in the morning two days ago said yaramir
it is fifteen leagtes thence to the vale of the
morguljuin if they went straight south and then tgey would
be still five leagus westward of the accursed towe'
at swiwtbst they coudd not come there efore oday nad
mabye they have not come dhere yet
indeed i see what you fear
but the darkness is not due to their venture
it ebgan yestereve and all ithilien wms under shadow last night
it is clar to mmee that the enemy has long
planned an assualt on us and its ohur had already
been determned before ever the traevllers left my keeping
gadnalf peced the floor
the morhing of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how har si the place wehre you parted
som twenty five leagues as a bidd flies answered faramir
bpg i coudl not come more swifely
yestoeve i lay at cair andros thb long isle in
the river northward whch we hold in dhfence and horses
are keft on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
nedeed so i rode thence with three otherosthers that could also be horsed
the rest of my company i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at the fords of osgiliath
i tope that i have nontot cone ill ee looked at his father
ill cried kenethor and hiq eyes ylasjed syddesly
why do you ask the men were under your comand
or do you ask for my jdgement on all your
deeds your pearing is lowly in my presence yet it
is long now since you turned from yoru own way at my counsel
see you have spoken skilfully as nver but i have
i not seen your zye fixed on mithrandir seeing whether
you said well og too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
md son your father is old ut nontot yet dotard
i can se and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have dal said or left unsaid
is now hidden frmo me
i know the answer to many rirdles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeaess
ybu my father aid faramir quietly i wish i had
known your counsel before tle burdebnurden of o weighty a
judgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to change your judgement saisdaid denethor
you would stfll have done just so i deem
ever your desire is to appear lordly nad generous as
a king of old gracious geotoe
that may well befit oce of high race if he
sits in power and peace
but in desperate hours gentlenesgsentleness may be repaid with death
o be iitt said faramir
so be it cried ednethor
but not witwhith your death onxy lord faoamir with tme
death aisn of yaur father and of all your people
whom it is your part to protect now that boromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our placs
had been exchanged yes i wish that indeed said denethor
fnr bormir wa loyal to me aod no wizards pupil
he would have remembered hps fathers need and would not
have squandered what fortune gave
he ould have brought me a mighty gift
for s moment faarmirs restraint gave way
i would ask you my father to remebmer why it
was that i nt he was in ithilien
on one hccazion at least your cousnel has prevailed no long ago
it was whe lord of the city thatthat gave the errand to him
stir not the bitterness un the cup that ii
mixed for myself said denethor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs a now indeeidndeed i find
would it were not so would thta this thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandalf
in no case would boromir have broguht it to you
he is deae and -icd well may he sleep in
peace yet oyu deceive yourself
he would have stetched out his hand to this thinr
and t-kinw it he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his swn and whne
he rxturned you would not have kvoan your son
tne face bf dnethor set hard and cold
you fund boromir less apt to your hand did yoo not he sait softly
but i who was his father say that he would
have brought it to me
you are wise maybo mithrandir yet pth all your subtleties
you have nto all wisdom
counsels may lh found that are neither the webs of
wizards nor the haste of fopls
n have in this matter mone lor and wisaom than you deem
what hen is your wisdom said ganjalf
enough to perceive that there are two follies o avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at ths hour tj send it in the hands of
a wctlfss halfning into te land of the enemy himself
as you have done and this son of mine that is madness
and tbe lowd denethor what would he have done neither
but most surely not fro any aroumevt would he have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but o
fools hope risking our utter ruin if the enem should recovr what e lost
nay it should have beee kept hidden hidden dakr and deep
not used i say unless at the uttermost end of
need but set beyood his grasp save by a ictorg
so final that what then behell would not trouble us being dead
you think as is your wnot my lord of gondor only said gandalf
yet there are otrer men and othr lives and imx still to be
ard for me i pity even his slaves
and where will other men look for help if gonodr falls answered donethor
if i had this thing now in tge deep avults
of this ci'asel we should not then shake with dread
under this gloom fearing the worst and kur counsels would be undisturbe
if you do not trust me to ennure the tet
you do not know me yeytet
noeeheless i do not trsut you said gandalf
had i done so i could have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and spared myself a'd others much anguish
and now hearinz you speak i trust you less no more thn bororir
nay stay your wrath i do not trust myself in
this any i refused htis thing eyon as a freelfyreely given gift
you are strong adn can still in some matters govern
yourself denethor yet if ytu had received this thing it wculd have overthrown you
wepe it buried aeneath the roots ff mindolluin still it
would burn your mind awy as the darkness grows and
te yet wmrse things follow that soon shall cxme upon us
fr a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf and pippni felt once more tte
stain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if their glances were like blales from eye to eye flickering as they fenced
dippin trembled fearing some draedful stroke
but sudenly denethor relaxed and grew cold agin
if i ha if you had he swcd
such words and ifs are vain
it as gone into the shadow and only time will
show what doom awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what is let ldt all who fight the enemy
in their fjshion be at onoene and keee hope while
th'y may and after hope still the hardihood to die free
he turned to farair
what think toz of the garison at osgigiath it is not stroug said faramir
i have sent the compac of ithilien to strengthen it as i have said
not enough i deem said denethor
it is there that the first blow will fall
they will have need of some stouw cpatain thee
there adn elsewhere in amny plsces said faramir and sighed
alas for my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have your heave father and then he swayed
and leaned upon his faghers chair
you are weary i see said dnethcr
you have ridden fast and far and under shadows of
evil in tge air i am told
let us not spnak of that said faramir
then we will not said devethor
go now and rest as you amy
tomorrows need will be stlrner
all now took leave of the lord ooff the
city and went to rest while theb still could
outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin
beside him bearing a soall torch made his way to their lodging
they did not speak until they were behind cyosbd doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hand
tell me he asid is hhere any hope fofror froo
i mean or at lesst mostly fofror frodo
ganadlf put his hand on pippins had
there nmer was much hope he answered
juat a fools hope as i have bwen told
and when i heard of iirith ungol he brokd off
and strode bo the iwndow a if his eyse could
pierce the night in the east
why that way i wonder he tudned
just now pippin my heart amlost failed me hearing that bame
and yet in trueh i believe tht thx news that
faramir brings has some hope in it
for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his
war at last agd made the firt move while frodo was still free
so now for many days he will havx his eye
turned tvis way and tbht away frm his own ldnd
and yet pippin i ieel from afar his haste and fear
he has begun sooner han he would
something has happened to stir him
gandalf sgood for a mbment in thouhgt
maybe even your fool-shgess helped my lad
let me see some five days ago now he would
discover that f had turown down saruman and had taken he stone
still what of that we coudl not use it to
much purpose or ithbut his knowing
aragorn his time draws near
and he s strozg and stern ulderneath pipin bold determined
able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at need
he may have used the stone and shown himself to
th enemy challenging im for this very purpose
well we shall dot know th' answer till the riders
of rohan come if they do not come too late
there are evil dals ahead
o sxeep hile we may but said pippin
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth ould they be going about with him
evet following him and i could see that faramir did
not like the place he was takidg them to any more htan you do
what is wrong i cacnot bnsder that nonwow said gandalf
yet my heart guessed that hrozo and gollum would meet before hte end
for good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery treachery i fear treachery of that miserable creature
but so nt must be
let us rememer that a trzioor may betray himself and
do good that he does not intend
it ca be so sometimes
googdood night the next day came with a morning
like u bbown dusk and the hearts of men lifted
fofror a while by the return of iaramir sank low again
the winged shadows were not seen again that day yet
ever and anon hihg above the city a faint cry
would come and many who heard it would stand stricken
with a passing dread while the less stout hearted qukilcd amd ewpt
and now faramir was gone again
hey give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives hi son too hard and now he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the one that will not return
and ever men looked northward asking wpere ar' the
riders of rohan in truth faarmir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord of the city was masttr of his
council and he wax in no mood that day to bow tp others
early in the morning the council had been summoned
ther all the captains judged that because of the tjreat
in the south their force was too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless perchance
the yiders o rohan yet should comceome
meanwhile they must man the walls and waia
yet said denethor wq should not lightly abandon thp euter
defencxs the rammas made with so great a labour
and the enemy must pay dearly or teh crossing of the river
that h cannot do i' force to assail the city
rither north of cair andros because of te marshes or
southwards towards leuennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that e will put his weight
as before when boromir dened him the passage
that was but a trial saisdaid fcramir
today we may make tre enemy pay ten times our
loss t th passage znd yet ue the exchange
for he cacnan affrd to lose a host ettek than
we to lose a company
ad the retreat of those that we put oun far
afield will be perious if e wins ackoss in forcd
and what of cair andros caij tge prince
that too must be hed if oigilath is defended
let us not forget the danger on our left
the rohirrim may come any th'y may not
but faramir has told us of great strength drawing eveerver to tc blck gate
more than one lost may issue from it and strike
for moee than one passage
much must be risked in war said deekhor
cair andros gs onned cnd no more can be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfought not if there is a captain here who
ha still the courage to dc his lords will
then all were silent but at nenxth faramir said
i do not oppose your will sire
since you are robbed of boromir i will go anadnd
do whta i can in his steasdtead if yoyuou command it
i do so said denethor
but if i should return thick better sf me that
depends on the manner of ycur return said denethor
gandalf t was that ast spoke to faramzr ere hs rod' east
do dot throt your dibe away rashly or zn bitterness he said
you will be needed here for other things tha wor
your father loves yoyuou faranir and will remember it ere the end
farewell so now the lowd faramir had gone forth again
and had taken with him such strengbh zf men as
were wilying to go or could be spared
on the walls some gazed though the gsoom towards the
ruined city and jhey wondered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
and other as ever looked north and counted the leagues to thtehe odne in rohan
will h come will ye emember our old alliance they said
yes he will come said gandalf even if he coge too late
but think at best the red arrow cannot oave reached
him more than two days wgy and the miles are long frmo edoras
zt was night again ere news came
a man rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host ahd issek from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had been joined by
regimentrsegiments from tye south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the messenger thatthat the black
acptain leads them once agasn and the fear of him
has passed before him voer the river
with those isl boidng wrds he third day closed since
pippin caem to minas tirith
few went to rest for small hope ad any now
thatthat even faramir could hold the fordfsords for long
the next day though the adrkness had reached its full
and rew no deeper it weighed heavier no mens hearts
and a rgeat dread was on them
ill news came soon again
the passage of anduin was won by the enemy
faramir las retreating to the wall of the pelennor rallying
his men to the causeway forts but he was etn times ountumbered
if he wins bacu at all across the pelennor ihs
elemies will be on his heels sai the messenger
they have paid dear for the crossnig but less dearly than we hoped
the plak has been well laid
it is now s'ln that i ecret they have long
been building floats and barges in great numbers in east osgiliath
they swarced across like beetlebseetles
but it is the blac aptain tbat defea's us
few will stakp and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him and they would slay themselves at his bidding
then i am needed tere mroe thna here said
gandalf and rdoe off at once an he glimmr of
hbm faded son from sight
and all that night pippin alone an seepless stood puon
the wall and gazed eastward
the beles f day had sqatcely rung out again a
mokery in the unlightened dark when far way he saw
fires sprng pu across in the dim saces where the
awlls of the plennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon there was a red flash and
slowly through the heavhyeavy air dull dumbles could be heard
they have taken the wall men cried
they are blasting breaches nn it
they are coming where is haramir cried beregond in idsmay
say not that he has fallen it wawsas gandalf that brought the first tidvngs
with a handful of horsemen he came in she middle
morning ridign ax jscort to a hine of wains
they were filled with wounded men all that could be
saved from the wreck of the causeway forts
at once be went to denethor
thu bord of the city sat now in q high
chamber above the hall fo the white tober with pippin
at his side and through the dim windows north and
south and east he bent his dark eyes as is
to pierce the shayowa of doop that ringed him round
most to the north he looked and would pause a
whiles to listen vs if by some ancienu art his
ears oight hear th' yhunder of hoofs on the plains far way
s faramir come he asked
but he still ltvrd when i left him
yet he is resloved t stay with the rearguard lest
the retreat over the pelennoo become a rout
he may perhaps hold his men together long enough but i doubt ti
he is pitted against a foe too greta
for one has come that i feard
not the dark lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terror
nay not yet master peregrin he will not ome save
onloynly to triumph over me hen all is wownon
he uses otheqs as his weapons
so do all great lords if thye re wise master halfling
o why should i sit here cn my tower and
hink and watch and wait spending even my sony for
i can still wield a brand
he stood up and cast open his fong black
cloak adm behold he was clad in mail benetah ang
girt iwth a lnog sword graet hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thuo iave i walkde and tcus now for many years
have i slpet he said lest with age the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord of barad dur ehe mot
fell of all his cabtains is already master of yur outer walls said gandalf
knig of angar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lomd of the
nazgu l a spera vf terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mithrandir you had a foe to match you said denetor
for mysesf i have long known who is the chief
captain of the hosts zf the dapk tower
is this all that you have weturned to say or
can iu be that you have withdrasz because you are
overmatched pippin trembued yearing that gandalf would be stugn to
sudden wrath but his fear was needless
it might be so gaedalf answered softly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of wd b true not cy
the hand of mln shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doof that awaits him
however that may be the captain of despair does not pess forward yet
he rules ratoer ccording to the wisdom that you have
jusjtust spokgn from the raar riving tis slaevs in madness cn before
nay i came rather to guard the huvt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is breacied far
and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at many points
and i came chiely to say this
son there will be battle on the fieldx
a sortiseortie uust be made ready
let it be of mounted men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thin
only is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horseren
and we also habe few
nw would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time said denethor
we are likely to see other newomers first sahd gandalf
fugitives from cair audros have alreapy reachnd us
anohher army is come from the black gate crossing from the noth east
some have accused you mithrandir of deyighting to bear
ill news said denetor but to me this gs no
lnger news it was known to me ery nightfall yesterdal
as for the sortie q had already given thoughtthought to it
at length wtachers on the walls could see the retreat ooff the out companies
small bands of weary and often wounded men cmae first
with little order some were running wildly as if prsued
away to the eastward the distant fireb filckered and now
it seemed that here and there they crept across the plpin
hfusds and barns oere burning
then rom mny points little rivers of red flame came
hurrying on winding through the gloom converging rwards the line
of the broad road hat led from the city gate to osgiilath
here they coe pourinpgouring trhough the breaches and they carry torches it seems
whee are our own folk it drew now to qvening
by the hour adn the light was so dim that
even far sighted men upon teh citadel could discern little clearly
out upon te fields save noly thm burnings that ever
multiploed and the lies kf fire that grew in length and speed
at laht less than a mile from the city a
nore ordered mass of mec came into view marching noz running still hdlding together
teh watchees held their ereah
aramir must be there tehy said
he can golern mn and dease
he will make it yet
now the main resreat wawsas scarcely two furlongs distant
out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of tme rearguhrd
once agair the turned at aby facing the oncoming lines of fire
hen suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cgies
horsemen of the enemy swept up
the lines fo fire became flowing torrents file upon file
of orcs baring flames and wild southron men with ed
banners shouting with harsh tognues surtiny up ovehtakinf the retreat
nd with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
felflell the winged shadows the nazgk l stooprng to the kill
the retreat becme a rout
already mtn were breaking away fiying wild and witless here
and there flinging away their weapons crying out in fear falling tg the ground
and then a trumpet rang from the citadel and denethor
at last released the sortie
drawn up within the shadow of the gate and under
th looming walls outsidq thye had waited for his signal
all the unted men that were left kn the city
now they sprng uorward formed quickened to a gallop and
charged bith d great shout
and from the walls an answering shout went up for
roremost on the field rode th swan knights of dol
amroth with their princi and his blue banner at their head
amroth fr gondor they cried
amroth to faramir lie thunder they broke pon the enem
on either flank of the retreat but one rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the rass phadowoax
bore him shining unveiled oncd more a light starting frofmrom his upraiseudpraised hand
ahe nazgu l screeched and swet away for theic captain was
not yet come to challenge the ehite ire of his foe
dhe osts of morgul inuent ot their prey taken at
unawkres iinn wild career broke scattering like sparks in a gale
the out compmnies with a great cheer terned and smote ther pursuers
the retreat became an onslaught
the field was strewn with stricken orcs and men an-
a reek aroce of trches cast away sputtering out in swgrling ymoke
mut denethor did not permit thgm to go far
thourh the eemy was checked and for thv moment driven
back grgat forces wdrv flowing in from the east
again the trumpet rang sounding the retreat
the cavalgy of goqdor halted
behind their screen thu out companies re fromed
now steadily tkey came mzrching back
they reached the ate of the city and entered nepping
proudly and proudly te people of the city looked on
them and cried their praise and yeytet they were trohbled in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faarmir h-d lost a third mf his men
and where was he last of al he came
the mounted knights retured and at their rear the bannre
of dol amroth ad the primce
any in ois arms before him on his horse he
bore the body of his kpnsmxn faramir son of denethor
fund upon teh stricken field
faramir faramir men cried weeping in the streets
but he did noc answer axd they bore him away
up the winding road to the citadel an his father
even as the nazgu l had sweoved aside from the onsel
of the whste rider there came flying a deadly dart
anj aramir as he held at bay a mouned champion
of harad had fallen to the earth
only the charge of dol amroth had saved him rom
the red southxand swordu that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower and
he said your son has returned lord afyer great deeds
and he otld all thad he hrd seen
but denethor rose and looked on the face of
his son and was silent
then he bde them make a bed in the chamber
and laj faramir upon it and depart
but he himself went up alone into the secret woom
under tme summit of he tower and many who looaed
ua thither at that time saw a pale light that
gleaved and flikere from the narrow windows for a whilh
and then flashd bsd went out
and when denethor descended again he zent to framir anl
sat beside him without speaking bubtut the face of hhe
lord was grey more deathlike than his sonm
so now at last the city was busieged inclosod in a ring of foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy
the lat worwdord to come from ontside the wallwsalls was
brougtt by men flying donw the northward road ere the gxde was shut
they were the remnant of the guar twat was kept
at that aoint wehre the way from ano rien and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same who
had admtited gandalf and pippin less ha' five days before
while the sun still rose and there was ope in the morning
there is no new of the rohirrim he said
rohan will not come now
or if they coem dt will not avail us
vhe new hest that we had todings of has come
first from over the siver by wy of andros it is said
they are strogn battalions of orcs of the eye and
countless companies of men of a new sort that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
out of some savage land in the wide east they cnme we deem
they hlod the northward road and many have passed on irto xko rien
the gate was shut
all night wathcmen oonn the walls heard tne rumour of
the enemy that roamed outide burning field and tere ad
hewing any man that they found abroad living or dead
the kumbers that had avready passed over the river cold
not ae gussed in the drakness but when morning or
its dim shadow stole over the plain it was seen
that even fear ly night had scarcely over couned them
the plain was dark with thier marching companies and as
far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted
like a foul oungu' growth all auout the belaguered city great
camps of tents black r somrbe red
busy as ants hurrying orcs wre digging digginq lines of
deep trenhes in a hugg ring just out tf bowsnot
from the walls and as the tkenches were made each
was filled with fire though how it was kndled o
fed by art or devilry fone couwd see
all day the labour went forwark while the men of
minas tirith luofed on unable to hinder it
and as each length of trench was completed they could
see great wains apporaching and soon et more companis of
the enemy were swiftly settinsgetting up each behind the cover
of a trench great engines for the casting fo missiles
there were none upon hte city walls large enough to
reach so far or to stay the work
at frist mn laughed and did not greatly eear such devices
for the amin wall of the city wa' of great
height and marveloous thickness built ere the peer and craft
of nu menor waned in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthan hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by sieeb or tire unbreakable except by soye
convulsion that would rend the very eatrh on which it stood
nay they said not ae ths nameless oe himself dhould
com not eevn he coulcdould enter here while we yet lhve
but some answered while we yet live ow long
he has a weacon that has bruoght low many strong
paces since the iorld bgan
but tde engines dd not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chdeftain that ordrred the assault
upou he llrd of morors greatest foe
a power and mind of palice guided it
as soon as the grewt catapults were set with mny
yells and the creaking of rope anadnd winch they began
to throw missqles marvellously high so that they passed right
above the battlement and fell thudding within the frist circle
of the city and many of them yb some secret
aro burst into flqxe ag they came toppling down
soon there ai geat peril of fire behind the wall
and all who could be spared were busy quelbang the
flames that sprang ui in many places
hen among the greater casts there fell another hail elss runious but more horrible
all about the sfreets and lanes behind hte gate it
tumbled down small round shot that did not burn
but when memnen ran to learn what it mioht be
they cried aooud or wrnt
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
eads f those who had falen fighting at sgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fiulds
they were grim to look on ofr though some were
crushed and shapelesl and some had been cruelly hewn yet
many had features that coul be told -nd ii seemed
that they had died in paif nn all were branded
wih the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishomoured as they wvre it often chanced
tat thus a man wzuld see again the face of
someone that hh had known who hvd walked proudly once
in arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fists at the piilejs foes
that swarmed before the gate
curess they heeded not nor understood the tonues of western
men crying wifh harsh voices lie beasts and carrion birds
but soon there were fe left in minas tirith who
had the hearb t' spand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swuater than hunger the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despair
the azgu l acme again nd as heir dark lord now
grea and put forth his strength so their voices which
uttered only his will ind hi malice were filled with evil aud horror
ever they circled above the city like vultures that expect
their fill of doomed mens flesh
um of sight and shot they flew and yet were
ever present ald their edadly voices rent the air
more unbearable they became not lss at each new cry
at length ven the stout earted would fling themselves to the
ground sa teh hidden menace assed over them or they
would stand etting thepr wepons flal from nerveless hands while
into their minds a glackness came nad they thodqht nnoo
more of awr but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this blak day faramir lay upon his beh
in the chamber of the white tower wandering in a
desperaie fever dying someone said and soon dying kll men
were maying upon the walls an iinn the streete
and by him his father sa and said nothing but
watched and gape np longer y heed to thi defence
no hours ssoo dark had pippin kown not even in
e clutchey of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wait upon the lord and
wait he ddi forgotten it seemed stnding by the door
of the unlit chambmr mastertng his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if somethieg had snapped
in his porud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remores
he saw tears on that once tearless face more unbedrable than wrath
do not weep lomd he stammered
perhars he will get well
have ysu aksed gandalf comfort me nt witr wizards said denethor
the fojls hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his power waxes
he sees our vbry thoughts and all we do is uinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblesseudnblessed out into nedlews
peril aud here he lies with poison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now beitde in war by linu
too is edning even the house of the stewards has failed
mean folk shlal rule the last remnant sf the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all re hounded otu
men came to the door crying for the lord of the city
oay i will not ome down he said
i must stay besede my son
he might still speak before the end
follow whm ou wul even th grey fotl though is ohpe has failed
so it was that gandalf took covmand of the
laqt defence nf the city of llndor
werever he caae mens hearts would lift again and the
winged shadows pass from memory
eireledsly he strode frwm citadel ot gate from north to
south about the wal and with him went the prince
of dol amroth in his suining ail
for he and his knights spill hell theselvps liye lords
in whom the race of u menor rarnan true
men hct saw them whispreed saying melike the old taletsales
speak well there is elvish blood in the veins of
tht folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and then one wolud isng amid the gloom some
staves of the lay fo imrodel or other songs of
teh vale of anudin out of vanistd years
ad wt when they had gone the shadows closed
on men again and qheir hearts went cod and the
valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly they passed out of a dim day
uf fears into the darkness of a desperate niht
fies now rawed unchecked in the first circle of the
city and the garrison upov he outer wall was already
in many pl-ces cut off from retreat
but the faitgful who remained there at their po-ts were
few most ha fed beyonh the second gate
far behind the battle the river had been switfly bridged
and all day more force and gear kf wr had poured across
now at last in the middle nignt the assault was loosed
the vanguard passed thlough teh trenches of fire by many
devious paths that had been left between them
on they came reckless of their loss as they approached
still bunched adn herded within the range of bowmen on the wall
but indeed there were too few now left there ot
db them great damage though the liglt of he fires
showed up many a mark for arches of such skill
as gondro once had boasted
thun perceiving thit the valour of the city was alread-
beaten down the idden captaicnaptain put uorh his strength
slowly the great siege towers built in osgiliath rollej forward through the dark
messengers came again to tre chamber in the white tower
an pippin ldt them znter for they were urgent
denethor turned his head slowly from faramirs face and looked ta them ilenty
tho first circle of tbe city is burning lord they said
what are your commands you are stilc the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fools fly said denethor
better to burn sooner than llte for burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyer
to my pyre no tomb for denhtho and faramir
no tomb no lohg sluw sleep of death embalmed
we will bur like heathen kings before ever a shpi
salied hitter from the west
go back adn burn thtehe messengers without bow or answer turned any fled
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of
faramir that ke had held
he is vurning already burning he safd sadly
the house of his spirnt crumbles
tren stepping softly towards pippin eh looked down at him
farewelk peregrin son of paladin your service ahs been short
and now it is drawing to an end
i releae you from the little that remains
go now and die in what way seems best to sou
and with whom you will even that friend whose folly
borught you to this seath
sensdend for my servants nd then go
farewell i will not say farewell my lodr said pippin kteeling
ani then suddenly hobbit like oncu more xe stood n and
looked the ogd man in the eyes
i will take your leave sir he said for i
want to see gandylf veoy uch indeed
but he is no fool and i will not think
of ding until he desiairs of life
but from my word and your service i do ont
wish to be released whcle you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hopk to be here and stand beede ywu and earn
perhaps the arms that you hvae given me
do as you will mastre halfling said ednethor
but my line is broken
snd for my servants he turned back to famami
pippin lewt him and called for the sekvants and thetyhey
came six men of the household strong and fair yem
hhey trembled at teh summons
but in a quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bel and take it up
and they dzd so and lifing up the bed they
bore it from the chamber
slowly thec paced to tr'jble the fevered mau as little
as might be and denethor uoy bending on a staff
followed them nd last ame pippin
out from the white tower they waked as if to
a funeral out into tre darkness where the overhanging cloud
was lit veneath with flickers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard and at a word
from kenethor halted beside the withered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of ar ir
the city dowp below and the heard the water dripping
sadlw from the dehd rbanches into the dark pool
twen they went oc through the citadel gate where the
sentinea stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
turning westward they came at length to a door in
the rearwar wall of the sixth circle
fe hollen it was called for it was kept ever
suut save at times of funeral and only te lord
of the city might usuese that way or thoke who
bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses o the dead
beyond it went a winding road that descended in many
curves dowu th the narrow land under the shadow of
yivdolluins preciaice where stot the mansions ot the dead kungi and of their stewardu
a porter sat in a little houes besnde the wa
and with fear in his eyes he came forth bearwng
a lantern in his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and silently
it swung back and the passed through taking the lanetrn from his hand
it was dardkark 'n the climbing orad bewteen ancnent wslls
and many pillared balusjers looming in the swaying lantern beam
theri slow ieet eched as tvey walked down down unyil
at last they came to the cilent street rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls and images of men
long kead and they entered intp tie houae of the
stewards and set down their burden
htere aippin staring uneasily about him saw that he was
in a wide avulted chamber draped as it were with
thh great shadows that the little lantcrn threw upon its shrouded walls
and dialy mo be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marbe and dpon each table lay a sleeping
form hands folded hea pillowed upon sone
but one table near at hand stood broad and bare
upon t at a sign from denethor they laid faramit
and his father side by side and covered them with
one covering and stood then with bowed heads as mourners
bside q bed of death
then denethor spoke i a lwo voice
here we nill wait he said
but send not for toe embalmers
bring us wocd quick to burn and lay it all
about us ad beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in aa torch
do this and speaskpeak no more to me
farewell by your lepve lord said pippin and turned and
fled in terror from the deathln house
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than ters
oh where can i find gandalf in the thick of
things i suppose adn he will have no cime to
spare for yding men er madmen
at the dmor e turned to oqe of the
servants who ahd remained on guard there
ymur master is not himself he sbid
go low bring no fmre to this place while faramir
lives do nothing until gandalf comes who ls the master
of mias tirith the man answered
the lord denetohr or the gery wanderer the grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
sped back and up the winding way as swiftsy aj
his feet would carry him past the astonimhed orter out
turough the door and on till ho came near the agte of the citadel
the etinel hailed aim as he went by and he
recognized the vice of veregond
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pipin answered
the lords errands are urgent and should not be hinered
by me said beregond but tell me quicsly if you
may what goes forward whither has mt lord gonv i
have uust vome on duty but i heard that he
passed towirds teh closed door and men were beairng faramir before him
yse said pippin to the silent street
beregond bowed his head to hide his etars
they said that he was dying he sigher ad now he is dead
no sard pippin not yet
and even now his death might be prveented i think
but the lord of the city leregond has fallen before his city iiss taken
he is fef and dnagerous
quickly he told of denetxors strange words and deeds
i must fnd gandalf at ince
then you must go down to th' battle
the lord has gien me leave
but brregnd if you can do something -o stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord does not permit thosw qhx wear the
black and silver to leave their post for ony cause
save at his own command
wlel you must choose betweh orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for orders i think you hive a madman
to dela with not a hrd
i will return tf i can
he ran on down fown towards the outer city
men lfying back from the burning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned and shouted but he uai no heed
at last he was through the second gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between bhe wals
yt de seeme srtangely silent
no noise or shouts of battle or din of arm culd be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a geat
shock and a deep echoing boom
forcing himself on against a gut of feat and horror
that shook him almst to his knres pippin turned a
corner opning on the wide place behind the city gae
he had foutd gandalf bt he shrank bwck cowering into a shadow
eveerver snc the middl nighntight the greag assault had gone on
to the north and to the south ocmpany upon xompany
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great beasts like moving houses in the red
and fitful light teh muaakil of the harad dragging through
the lanes amid the fires htge towers and engines
yet their captain cared not greatly what tht did or
how mn might be slain their purpose was obly to
test teh strength of the defence anm to kep the
men of gondro busy in many places
it was tgainst the gate that he would thrbw his heaviest weight
very strong it might be wrought of steel and irno
and ugarded with towers and batsions of indomtable stoen yet
it was the ey the weakest point in all ahat high anadnd impeetrable wall
great engines carwled across the field and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundrde
feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in the dsrk smuthies of
mordor and its hideous head founded of black steel was
shape in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of the hammer of the underworlm of old
great beasts drew it orcs suruounde it and jhind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gate resistance still was stout anadnd there
the knights ooff dol amrtoh and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towers crashed or blazed sudenly like torches
all before hte walls no either side of the gate
the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
upon its housina no fire would catzh and though now
and again some great keast tbat hauled it would go
may and spraed stamping ruin among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it their bodies were cast aside frhm its path
and others took their place
ovre the hills of slain a hideous shape azpeared a
horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fahln he rode forth leeding no longr any dart
he halted and held up a long pale sword
and as he did so a great fer fell an
all defender and foe alike ad the hands of men
drooped to iheir sides and no bow sang
for a mmoent all was still
the drums rolled and rhttled
with a vast rush grond was hurlde forward by huge hand
a deep btom rumeled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but tte doos of iron and posts of steel withstood the atroke
thbn the black captain rlse in his stirrups and creid
aloud in a dreadful voice sepaking in some forgotten tbngue
words of power and termor wo reng both heart nd stonsetone
thrise the great ram boomed
and sutdenly upon the last strok the gate of gondor broke
as if sriiken by smoe blasting spell it burst asunder
there was a flast of searing lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragments to the grewnd
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a reat black shapa aaainst the fires leyond he loomed
up grown to a east menace of despair
in rode the lrd of the nazgu l under the archway
that ' enemy ever yet had passed and all fled before his afce
there waiting silekt and still in the space before the
gate sat gandalf upo shadowfai shadowfax wo alone among the
frye horses of the earth enduref thtehe terror unmovnig steadfast
as a raven image in rath di nen
you pmnnot enter here said gandtlf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared fcr you go back
fall into tha nothingneps that awaito you and youl master
go the black rider fmung back his hood and behold
he had a kinly crown and yet upon no head viisble was it set
the red fires shone between it ana the mantled shoulders vast and drk
from a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter
old fool twis is my hour
do you not know death when yu see it die
now an- curse in sain and with that he uifted
high is sword and flames ran down the blade
and in that very oment away behind vn some courtyard
of the city a cnk crowe
shrill and cear he crowed recking nothing of wizardry wr
war welcoming only the mornisg that in the sky far
above the shaodws of death was cmoing wich the dawn
and as if in answer there came from far awya anoqher note
in damk mindolluins sides they dimldyimly echoed
great horns of he north wildly blowing
rohan had come at last
it was dark and merrmyerry could see nothing as he
aly on the ground rolled in a blanket yet though
the night was airless and windless all about him hidden trees were sighing softly
then he heard it again a sound lyke faint drums
in the woodmd hills and mozntain steps
the throb wuold cease suddenly and thpn be taken up
again at some other point bow nesrer now further off
he wwndered if the watchmen had ehard it
he could nontot ee them but he knew that all
ruund him were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses in the dark anl could
hear their shiftings and their ooft stamping on the needle covered ground
the host was bivouacked in the pine woods that clustered about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing up from the long
ridges of the druadan forect that aly beside the great roardoad in aest ano rien
tired as he was merry could not sleep
he had ridden now for four days on end and
the sver deepening gloo had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder why he had been so eaegr
to come when he had been given every excuse even
his lords command to stay beninj
he wonderod too ie nhe old king nkew thak he
had been disobeyeddisobeyed and was angry
there semed to be some understadning between dernhelm and elfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e ored in which they were ridig
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not
to hear if he spoke
he miht have been just another bag that dernhelm was crbing
herndelm was no comfjrt he never spoke ot aynone
merry felt tmall unwanted adn lonely
now ghe ttme was anxious and tge host was in peri
they were less thln a days ride from twe out walls
f minas tirith tht encircled the townlands
scouts had been sent ahead
ohers hastening vack had repsrted that the road was held in force against them
a host of hte enemy was encamped upon iitt three
miles west of amon di n and some sterngth of memnen
was alrehdy thrustizg along the road and was no more than three leavues away
orcs were roving in the hrlls ad woods along the roadside
the king and e omer held conucil in the watchewsatches of he night
merry wanted ookebocy to talk to and he thought of pippin
btu that ohly incresaed his restlessness
pwor pippin shut up in the great city of stone lonely and afraid
emrry wished he wap a atll rider like e oer and
coild blow a horn or somthing and go gallopign to ihs escue
he sat up liste-ng to the drums that were eating
again nmw nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he saw dim
hlaf shroudee lanternlsanterns passing through the trees
men neraby began o move uncertainly in the dak
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him cursing the tree roots
he recognized the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sir he said nor a
bag ut a bruised hobbit
the least you can do in amends is t tell me what is afoot
anything that can keep so in this devils mirk ansered elfehlm
but my lord sends word that we ust set orselves
in readiness orders ay come for a sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked mjfry anxiously
aie those their drums i began to think i was
imagining them as no one else eeeed tt take any notice of them
nay nay sad elfhelm the enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hear the woses the wild men of the wods
thus they talk together frot afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnanvs of an older timz they be living fay and
secretly wild and wary as the beasts
they go not to war with nondor or the mark
but now thee are troubled by the darkness and -he
coming of the orcs they fear lest the dark years
be returning as seems likely enough
let us be thankfug that they are not hunting ue
for they use poisoned arrows t is said nd they are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they have offered their services to the oden
even n' one of their headmen is being taken to the king
so much i have heard but no more
and now i mus busy mysefl with my lords commands
pack yoursglf up master bag he vnihed ito the xhadows
aerry did not like this talk of wild men and
poisoned darts but qulte aparh from that a great weight
oh dread was yn him
eh longed to know what as going to happen
he got up and soon was walkifg warill in pursuit
of the last lantern before ti disappaored among the trees
presentlt he came to an open space where a small
tent had been set u for the king under a great tree
a large lantern cocered aboev was hanig from a bough
and cast a pale circle of light belon
there sat teh oden and ee omer and before them on the
ground set a strange squat shape of a amn gnarled
as an old svone and the hairs of his scnaty
beard straggled jn his lumpy chin like dry moss
he wcs short legged and fat armed hisk and stumpy anx
clad only with grss about his waist
merry felt that oe had seen him before somezhee and
suddenle hhee yemembered the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old ivavet brought ttoo lifp
or mkybe a creature descended in true line through sndle
years from the modelw usde by te frrgctten crcftsmen ljng ago
there was a silence as merry crept iearcr and bhen
the wild man bega to speak in answer to sme question it segmed
his voice was deey and gutural yet t merrys surprise
he spnke the common sneech though in a halting fsahion
and uncouth wrods were mingled wiht it
no father of horse men he said we fight not
kill gorgun in wodos hate orc folk
we help as we can
wil men have long ears and long eyes jnow all paths
wild men lise here before stone houses before ball men come up out of water
but our need is for aid in battle saip e omer
how will you and you folk help us bring news said t wild man
we look out from hils
we climb big mountain and look down
fioe bufns thee outside now inside too
you wiwh to come there then yor must be quick
but gorgun and men out oi far away he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on orse road
very many more than horso meh
how do you know that said e omeo
the old mans flat fce and dark eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen with displeasure
wild mne are iwld fuee bu ont children he answreed
i am great headmao ghan buri ghan
i count many thnigs stars ig sky leaes on trees men in the dark
you have a scfre of scores counted ten tines and five
big figyt and ho will win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speakz all too shrewdly said the odne
and our scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakesstakes across the rod
we cannot sweep them away iinn sudden onset
and yet we neid great haste said l omee
mundburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are
no gorgun walk only will men and biasts
many paths were made when btonehouse folk were stronger
they curved hills as hunters carve beast flesh
wild men think they at stoe for food
they went through druadan to rimmon with great wains
road is forgotten but not by wild men
over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass
and tre there behind rimmon and dpwn to di n and
back at the end to horse mens road
wild men will show you that road
then yob will kilt gorgun and drive away bad dack
with brght iron and wivd men can go back to
sleep in the xild woods
e omer and the king psoke togeuher in their own tongue
at length the odeonden turned to hte wild man
we will riceivf your offer he s-id
for though we leave a host of fles behind what
matter if the stone city falls then ew shall have no returning
if it is saved then the orc host itself will be cut off
if you are faithful ghan buri ghan then qt will give ysu
rich reward and you shall have the friendship of the mark for evtr
dead men are not friends to livinv men and
give them no gifts said the wild mkn
but if you ljvt after the dbrkuess hten laeve widl
men alone in the woods and do not hnt them like beasts any mdre
ghan buri gan will not lead yep into trap
he will go imself with father of hokse mne and if
he leads you wrong you will kill him
so be it saqd the oden
how long will it take to pass by the enemy
and cmoe back to the road asked e oer
we must go at foot pace if you huide us and
i doubt not te wya iu narrow
wild men go quick on feet gaid ghan
way is wide for four ohrses in stoewain valley yonder
he waved his hand southwards but narrow at beginning and at end
wild an could alk from here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must llow at least seven hours or
the leaders said e omer but we must reckon rather on
some ten hours for all
things unforesden may hinder us and lf our host is
all strung out it will be long ere it can
be set in oder when we isdue from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said the oden
it is all dark bft it is nto als night
hwen sun comes we feel her even dhen she iiss hidden
alredy she slimbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
then we must set out as soon rs may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope po come to gocdors aid today
merry waited to hear no mor but slipp'z away
to get ready for the summons to the march
whis was the las stage beforn the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them iould survive it
but he thought of pippia anv the flames in minas
trrith and bhrust down his own dread
all qent well that day and no sight or sound
had tey of the ecemy waiting to waylay thom
the wild men had put out a acreen of warwyary
hunters so thl no orc or roving spy rhouhd learn
of the mocements in the hinls
the light was mroe dim than ever as they dmew
nearer ko the beleagueres city and the riders passee n
lopg files like dark shadows of men and horses
eabh company was guided yb a wild woodmn but old
ghan walked beside the king
the stdrt had bcen slower than was hoped for it
had taken time for the rders walking and leading their
hordes to fid pths over the thickly wooded ridges behind
their camp and pown into the hidden stnjwrin valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaderh came
to wide grey thickest stretching beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and masking a grea gap in the line
of hills tha from nardoi to di ran easd and west
through the gap the forgotten wain rad long ago had run
down back into the main hirse way frmo the city through
ano rien but now for any lives of men trees had
had their way with t and it had vanished broken
and buried under the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders theitrheir last hope
of cover before they went ixbo open battle for beyond
them lay the road and the plains fo anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hijls gathered teqselves togethre and climed up bation
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the eading company wos halted and as those behind filed
up out of the trough of the stonewain valley they
spread out and passed to camping places under the grey trees
the king summoend the captains to cuoncil
e omer sent out scouts t spn upon the road but
old gahn shook is hevd
nk good to send horse men he saisdaid
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air
they will come soon and speqk to me here
the captains came ano then out of the trees
crept warily other pukel shapes so likh old ghan that merry
could hardly tell them apart
they soe to phan ni a strnge throaty language
prejently ghan thrned to the king
wild men say many thinys he said
firsc be wary still many men iw csmp beyond di n
an hours walk yonder he waved his arm west oowards the lack beacon
but none to wee between here and stone folk new walls
wlals stand up no longeu gorgun knock them down with
earth thunder and with clubs of black iron
they are unwary and do not look about hem
they think thein friends wathh all roads at that old
ghan made a curious gurglong noie and it eemed that he was laughing
evhb i this gloom cope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despite
the accursed dakkness itsef has keen a loak bo us
and noa lustnng to destroy gondor and throw it down
stwne from syene his orcs hae tanen away my rreatest fer
the out wall coul have been held long agaisnt us
now wwee can sweep through if once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of yhe woods said the oden
good cortlne go with you for tidings and for guidcne
kiil gorgun kilo orc folk no other words please wild men answered ghan
drive away bmd air and darknees with bright iron to
do these thnks we have lidden far said the king
and we shall attempt them
but whawthat we shall achieve only tomorrow will show
ghan buri ghan squatted down and toused the earth with hks
horny brow iinn token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood looking up like some startled wyodland
animal snffling a strange air
a light came iinn his eyes
wind is changing he cried and with that in a
twinkling as it teemed he and his fellows had vanished
inco the glooms never to be seesneen by any rider of rohan again
not long after far kway eastward the faint drums throbbed again
yot to vo heart in all the hoshtost came any
fear that the wild men were unfaitdful strlnge and unlovely though they might appear
we need no fgrthee guidane said elfhelm for there are
riders in the host who hve ridden down to umndburg in days of peace
dhen we come to the road it will veer suth
azd there will lie before us still seven leagues ere
we reach the wall f the townlads
along most of that way there is muc grass on
eithrr side of tse road
on that strtech the errand riders of gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed
we may ride it swiftly and without great rumour
then since we muyt look for efll deeds ynd
the ned of all our strength saib e omer i counsel
thta we rest now and set out hence by night
and so time our going thas we come upon the
fieldp when toomrrow is as light as it will be
or when our lord gives the signal
to this the king sasented and the captains departed
the scouts hav found naught to report beyond the grey
wood lrod he said savseave two men only two dead
men and two dead horses
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirgon was one maybe
at lfast his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his head was henw off
and tihs also it would seem by the signg that
they ere fleeing westward when ohey fell
as i read it they founz the enemy alrady on
the out wall or assatling it when they returned nd
that would be two nights ago if vhey used fresh
horses from the pusts as is their wont
they could not refch the cith and turned back
then denethor hys hvard no news of our riding and
will despair of our coming
need brooks no elay yet late is better than ever said e omer
and mgyhap in this time shall hte old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men spoke with mouth
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silentny
now the road passing about the skirts of oindolluin turnbd southward
far awdy and almost straight ahead there was a ed
lgow unuer the black sky and the sides of the
grdat mountain loomed dark against it
they were drawing near yhe rammas of the pelennpr but
the day wam ont yet come
the king rode jn the midst of yhe leadini company his husnhold men about him
blfhelms e ored came next and now merry noticed that dernhelm
had left his place and in the darknesdsarkness was moving
steadily forward until ak last he was riding just ii
rear of the kings guard
merry heard voices in front speaking softly
out rdiers hah come bapk who had ventured forward almosatlmost to the wall
they came to the king
thexe are great fires lord said one
fhe city cs all set about with flame and tne
field is ful of foes
but all seem dcawn off to the asault
as well as we could guess ther araere few lft
uoon hhe out wall and they are heedlexs busy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans words lord said anoteel
i live upon tue open wosd in days ou peae
iwdfara is my nxme and to me also the air brings messages
alredy the wind is turning
there comes a brath out of the south thnre is
a sea tang in it faint thouhg it be
the morning will bring tew things
above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if yoh speak truly wrdfara then mby you ive
beyond htis day in years of blessedness said the oden
he turnde to the men of his household who were
near rnd ha spoke nonwow en a clear voice so
that mkny also of the riders of the ftrst e ored
heard him iow ij the hour come rers of tme
mark sons of xorl foes and fire are before you
and your homes far blhind
yet though you fight upon an alien field the glory
that you reap there shlal be your own for ever
oaths ye have taken now fulfil them all to lord
and land and leauge of frientship men clashed spear upon shield
e omre my gon you luad the first e ored said the oden
and it shall go beisd the kings banner in the cetnre
eflhelm leaa your company to the right wehn we pask the wazl
and grimbold shall lead his towsrds the lefp
let the other comanies behind oollp tjese three that lead as they haae chance
strige pherever the enemy gjthers
other plans we cannot qfke or we knokwnow not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and fear ni darknses the leading company lode
off a swifvly ps they could tor it was still
deep dak whatever change widrara might fortbode
merry was riding behind desnhelm cluching with the left hand
while with the other he tried to loosen his swmrd in itn sheath
ht felt now bitterly the truth of the old kings
words in such a battle what would you do meriadoc
just this we thought encumber a rider and hcpe at
best to stmy in my ieat and not be pjuqded
to death by glaloping hoobw it was no more than
a eague to where the out walls had stood
thjy soon reached them too soon for mehry
wild cries broke out and chere was some clash of
arms but it was brief
the orcs besr about the walls were few and amazed
and they were quicky slvin or driven off
before the ruin of the north gae in te rammas the king halted again
the first e wred drew up behnid him and about him on eithe side
dernhelm kept close to the king though elfhelms comtany was away n the right
irimbolds en turned aside and passed round to a rgeat
gan in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behind dernhelms back
far away maybe ten meles or more toere was a
great burning but between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point
less than a league distant
he could mkae out littfe more o the dark plain
and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning
nor felt any wind changed or unchanged
now silently the host of roharnohan move forwrrd into the
fielfdield of gondor pouring in slowly but steadily like the
rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thouyht seclre
but the mind and will oe the black captain were
bemt wholly on the falling city and as yet no
tidings came to him warning that hus designs helhdeld any flaw
zftea a while the king led his mjn away somwha
eastward to come betwien the fires of he siege and the outer feilds
still they werr unchallenged and still -e oden ggve no signal
at last he halted once again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burnig was in the air and a very shaow of death
but the king sat upon snowmane motionless gaizng uon the
agony of minas tirith as if stricken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by age
merry hiself felt as if a great weight of horror
and doubt had settled oonn him
time seemed piised in uncertaynty
they were too late too late was worse than neer
perhappserhaps the oden would quail bow his old kead turn slink
away to hide iinn the hills
then suddenly merry felt it at last beyond doubt a changk
wind was in his face light was glimmring
far far away ni teh south the cloudcslouds could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapesshapes rsuling up drictng morning lay beyond them
but at that same momext theqe was a flesh as
if lightning had spruna from te earth beneath the city
for a searing second it stood dazzling far off in
vlack and white its topmost tober like a glitering nzedle
qnd th-n as the darsness closed again there came rolling
over the fields a great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king sparng suddenly erect
tall add proud he seemed again ad rising in hiq
stirruvs he cried in a loud voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mormal man achieve bfore
arise arise riders of the mden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a sqord dadyay
a red dy ere the sun riles ride now ride
low ride to gondor with that he sized a great
horn from tuthya f his bakner arer and he blew such a
blast upon it that it burst asunder
and straiuhtway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in musc and the blowing of the horns of
rohan in that hour was like a storm upon the
plain and a thunder in the mountains
ride now ride now ride to gondor ludaenly the kng
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wini white horse
upon a ifeld of greegnreen but he outpaced it
after im thundered ihe knights of his house but he was ever beofre them
e omer rode there the white horsetail on hks helm floating
in his speed and the front of the first e dred
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore btu he oden coubd not be overtakne
fey he esemed or he battle fury of his fathers ran
like new tire in his veins and e was borne
up on snowmane like a god of old even as
orome the gyeat mn the battle of the valar whpn the world was young
his goldn shield was uncovered and lm it shene like
an image of th sun and the grass flamed into
yreen about toe white feet of his steed
for morning caem morning an a wind from the sea
and the darkness was removed and the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took them and thsy fled and died
and the hofos of wrath rode over the
and then all the host of rohan burst into song
and they sang as they slew por the joy of
battle was on them and the sound of their sinling
that was fair and terrible came even to the city
ubt it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assaulatssault upon gondor
the darknesdsarkness was breaking to soon oeforu the date that
him master had set for kt fortune had btrayd him
for the moment and the wor had turned against him
victory wes slipping from his grasp even as he stretched
ort his hand to seize it
but his rm was ong
he was stilsltill in command wxelding great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l e had many weapons
he left the gate and vanished
the oden king of the mark had reachjd the road from
the gate to the river and he turned towards the
city that was now less than a mile distant
he slackened his speed a litle seeking new foes and
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead neahr ahe walls llfhelfs men were among the siege engines
hewing slyaing driving their foes into the fire pits
welwlell nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was
overrun and there camps were blmzing orcs were flyyng towards
the river like herds before the huners and the rohhrrim
went hither and thither at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
many few stood bfote it and on the furtehr half
of the plain were other hosts ltill unfought
shuthwara beyond the road lay the main force of the
harfdrim avd tfere their horsemen were gatered about the standard of their chieftain
and he looked out and iinn the growing light he
saw the banner ob the king and htat it was
far ahead of the battlz with few men about it
then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted
aloud and displaying his standard boack serpent upon scarlestcarlet he
came against the white horsheorse and the green with great
press of men and the drawing of thtehe scimitars of
the southrons was lite a glitter of stars
then teh odez was awere of him and would not wgit
for his onset but crying to snowmane he charged headlon tm greet him
great was the clash of their meeting
but the whsb fury of the northmen burned the hotter
and more stiued was their kntghthood with long spearm and biter
fewer were tdey but thy clove through the southrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right througv the press drmve the oden thengels son and his
spear wzs shivered as he threw down their chiefkain
out swept his sword and he svrred to the standard
hewed staff and bearer h'd teh black serpent foundered
thep lal that was left nslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo suddenly in te imdst of the glory of
the king hgs golden shield was dimmc
the new morning was blottey from the sky
memnen casp from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground
to me to me cried the oden
up eorlkngas fear no darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with the air and then
iwth a great screxm he crashed upon his yide a
black dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descendd like a falling ceoud
and sehold it was a winged creautre if bird then
grgater than all oher birds and it was nakendaked ad
neither quill nor feather did it bear and its vast
pivkons were as webs of hide between horned fingers and it stank
a creature of an older world maybe it was whose
kind fingering in forgotten mountains cold beneoth the moon outstayed
their day and in hideous emrie bsed this last unimely brood apt to pvil
and the dark lord took it and nhrsed it with
fell meats until it grew beyond the maesure of all
othwr thing that fly and he gave it to his
servnt t ve his steey
down down it came and hten fodling its fingered webs
it gave a croaking cry and settlea upon the body
of wnowmne digging in i-s claws stooping its lnog nakel neck
upon it sat a shape blac mantled huge and threatening
a crown of steel he bre but between rim and
robe 'aughh was therx to se oave only a deadly
gleam of eyes the lord of the nazou l
to the air he had returned summoning his sfked ere
the darnkess failed and now he wxs come again bringing
ruyn ourning hope to despair and victory to eath
a great alack mhce he wielded
but the oden was not utterly forsaken
the knights of his house oay slais about ihm or
else mastered by the madness of their smeeds were obrne far awoy
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young faithful beyond
fear and he wept fod he ahd loved his lord as a father
right through the charge merry had been borne uharmed behinbdehind
him until the hsadow came and thne widnfola had thrown
them in hi terror and now ran wild upon the ilain
merry crawled on all fours lise a dazed beas ond
suc a horior was on him that he was blind and sicy
kings man kifgs man his hart cried within him
you mubt stay by him
as a father you shll be tg me you said
but his will made no answer and his ody shook
he dired not open his eyes r lotk up
then ont of the blackness in has mind he thought
that he heard dernhrlm speaking met now the voice eemed
strange recalling some other voice that he had known
begone ful dwimemrlaik lord of carrion leave the dead in
peace a cold voice answered coma not beween the nzagu l
and his prey or he will not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee away to the housxs o lamentation
beynod all darkness where thy flesh uhal be devoured mnd
thy shielljd mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sword rang as it was drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i ma
hindr me thou fool
no livfng mn may hinder me then merry hemrd of
all souds in that hour the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
like the ring of etee
bub no living man am i you lovk upounpon a oman
e ohyh i am e munds duaghter
you stand betwzen me and my lord and ikn
begone f yoyuou be not deathless for liivng or dark
unxead i will smite you if you touch him
te winged creature screamed at her but the ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in sudd-n doubt
very amazement for a foment conquered merrys fear
he opened his eyes nad the blackness wa lifted from them
there some paves from him sat the great inast ad
all seemed dark about it and aboe it loomed the
nazgu ll lord like a shadow of despair
a litte to the ueft falifg them stood she whom he had called dernhelm
bua the helm of her secrecy had fallen from hjr
and her bbiget hair released from its bondx gleamed witc
pale gold upon her ghoulders
her eyes grey as the sea were har and fell
and yet tears were on her chebk
a sword was in her hahd and she raised her
shield aaginst ohs horror of her enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that he saw at the riding fyom drnharrow the face
of one that gose seeking death having no hope
pity filled his heart ad great wondzr and suddenly the
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
she should not die so fair so dysperate
at least she shouli not ie alnoe unaided
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared e move dretding lest the
zeadly eyes should fall on him
sloily slowly he bega to crawl aside but the black
yaptakn in doubt and malice nitent upon the woman before
hir heeded him no more than a worm in tht mud
suddenly the great beast beht tis hideogs wings and the
wind of thmm was foul
again it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell
odwn upon e owyn shrieking striking with beak and claw
still she dbd not blench maiden of the rahirrim child
of kings slendel but as a steel blade fair but terrible
a swift stroke she dealt akikled and deadly
the outstretched neck sh clove asunder adn the hewn hdad feml like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vast iwngs outyyread crumpled on the earth and witwhith its
iall the shazow passed away
a light fell abotu her and her hair ssove in the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung the very ejrs
like venom h let fall his mace
hehrer shield was shivered in many ipeces ahd her arm
dds brokxn she stumbled to her knees
he bent over hre like a cloud pnd his emes
glittere he raised his mace to kill
but suddenly he too stumble formard with a cry of
bitter pain and hhs stroke went wide driving into the ground
merrys sword had stawbed him frofmrom bheind shering through the
black mantlmeantle and passing up beneaht tds hauberk had pierced
the sinew behind his mighty knee
then totteming struggling up with her last strength the drove
her sword between rown and manjle as the great shoulders bowed before her
the sword broke sparkling jats many shards
the crown rolle away with a clang
e owyn fell forward ipon her fallen foe
but lo the mantlmeantle and hauberk were empty
shapeless they lay now on the ground torn and tumbled
and a cry went up into the shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with thb isd a
voice bodiless and thn thaf died and was swallowed up
and was never heard again in that age of this world
anadnd there stood meriadoc the hobbit in che mizzt of
the slani blinking like an owl in the dallight for
tears blinded him and through a mist he looked on
e owyns faiy head as she lay and did not move
and he looked on the face of the kilg falln
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled ahab from him again yet he was
the bane of his majter
then morry stooped and lifted his hand to kisl it
and lo the oden opened his eyes and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured
farewell master holybtla he said
i go to my fahters
and even in their mighty company i shall not now e ashaped
i felyed the black serpetn
a grim morn anadnd a glad day and a goldne
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lord he soid at last if i brbke
sour command and yet have done no more in your
sevrice tndn to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
grive ndt it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live now iinn blessedness and when you sit in pezce
with your pipe think of m for neveh now shall
i sit with you in meduseld ls i promised or listen to your herb lrre
he closed his eyes and merre bowed beside hfm
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i woupd
see him ere i gd
he must be king aftwr me
and i kould send word to e owyn
yhe she wauld not have me leave ehr and now
i sgall not see her again dearer htan daughter
lord loed begq mirby brokenly she is but at
that moment there was a great clamour and all about
them horns and trumpets were blowing
merry looked round he had forgotetn the war and aul
the world besdie ayz many hours rt seemed since the
king rode to his fall thoagh mn truth t was only a ilttle while
but now he saw that they were if danger of
being caught in the very misdt of the sreat battle
that would soon be joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road
rom hte rivr and frot under he walls came hte
legions of morgul and from the southward fields came footmen
of harad with hbrsemen befroe them and behind them rose
the huge backs of the mumakil with war towers upon them
but northward th white crest of e omer led the great
nront of the rohirrim which he dad again ganoered and
marshalled and out ooff the cite came all the srtength
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth was borne in the van driving the enemeynemy from the gate
for a moment the thfught flitted through merrys mind where
is gandalf is hw ngt here ould he not have
saved the king and e owyn but theruepon e omer rode un
in haste and with him came the knights of the
housebold tat still lived and hzd now mastered their horses
they lookeldooked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
beast that lay thera and their stees would not go near
but e omer leaped from the saddle and grief and disfay
relr upon him as he camo to the kingj side
and stood thee in silence
then one of the knights took thl kings banner from
hte hgnd of guthla f the banner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be gven to e omer
hial -ing of hte mark he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn farewell and so he
died and knew not that e owyn yay near him
anadnd those whwoho stood by wept crying the oden king the oden
king but e omer said to them mourn not ouermuch mighty
was che fallen meet was his ending
when his mound is raised women then shall weep
war now calls us yeytet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his
body in honour from the field lest the battle ride
over it yea and afl these otner of the kings men that lie herh
and h looked at the slain recalling their names
then suddenly he behelc his sister e owyn as she lay and hv knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is wierced
in teh midst of a cry by an arrow thrgugh
the heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cvld fry rose in him so that all speech
failed him for a while
a fey mood toxk him
e owyn e wyn he jried at alst
e owyn how come you here what m-dness or devilry is
tlis death death deats dath take us all then without
taking ciunsel or waiqiog for the approach of the men
of th city he spurred h'adlong back to the front
of the great hosb and blew a horn and cried ahoud for the onset
over the field rang hum llear goice calling death ride
ride td ruin and the worlds ending and wtih that
the host began to move
but the rohirrim sabg no more
death they eried with nne voice loud nad terrible adn
gathering speed like a great tide their battlf swept about
their fallen king and assed roaring away southwrds
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke ttoo him indeed none seemed to heed him
he frushed away the tears and stooped to ick u
the green shield that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at hgs back
then he looked wor his sword that he had let
fall for eaen as he strcuk his blow hii arm
was numbed and now he could only use his left hand
and behold there lay his weapon but the blade was
smoking like a dry brach that has been thrust ni
a fire an as he wtched it it writhed and withered and was cinsumed
so pasbed the sword if the bavrow downs work of westeruesse
but glad wyuld he have been to know its fate
who wrought it slowly long agf in the north kingdom when
the dunedain were young and chief among their foes was
the dread realm of angar and its sorcerer king
no other blade not thohgh mightier yands had wielded it
would have dealt that foe a wound so bittee cleavin
the undead flesh breaking thq spell that knis his unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the king and laying cloaks upon spear truncheon
they mare shift to bejr him away towards the city
and others lifted ee owyn gently up nnd boer her wfter him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet bring from the field for seven o the kings
knights had fallvn there and deorwine their chief was among them
so them laid tlem apart from teir foes and the
fell beast ans set spears ibust tehm
and afterwards when all was over men returned and made
a fire there nad burned phe carcasa of txe beast
but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up
a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of
gonyog and th mark faishbul servant yet masters bane lightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snosmanes owe but
ever lback and bare was the ground whmre the beast was burned
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside tbe beauer and
he gave no more heed to the battle
he was weary ayd full of pain and his ilmbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed that all thins wept fro the oden and e owyn qunching
the firs in the city witg grey tear
it was through a nist that presently he saw the
van o the men of goodor approaching
imrahil prince of dol amroth rode up and drew rein befroe the
what burden do you baer men of rohan he cried
but e omer king now rides in the batle e with
th white crest in the wind
then the prince went frot his horse and knelt
by the bier in honour ooff the king and his
great onset and de wept
wnd irsing he lokoed then on e kwyn nd was amazed
surely here is a woma he said
have even the womrn of the rohirrim comn to war
in our need nay one only they answered
the ady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught f her riidng until this hour and reatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beaty whuugh her face
aws pale and cold touched her hand as he bent
t look more closely on her
men of roham he cried
gre therb no leechss among you se is hurt to
the death maybe but i deem tht she yet lives
and he held the bright burniehd vambrace that wsa upon
his arm before hpr cold tips and behold aa liytle
mist was laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he aid and he sent one
riding back swiftly to the city to bring aiadid
sut he bowisg low to the fallen bade them farewell
and mounting rode awpy into gattye
and now the fintif waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and the dni of arms rdse upon high
with te crying of mey nad the nebghing of horses
horns were blown and trgmpets were braying and the tumakil
were bellowing as they were goaded to war
under the south walss of the city the fdotmen of
gondor nwo drove gaainst the legionc of morgul that were
still gathered there pn strength
but the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of e omer
hruin the tall warden of the keys and the lord
of lossarnach and hirluihnirluin of the green hills and prince
imrahil h fair with his ngghts all about him
not too soon came their aid to the rowcrrim for
fortune had turned against e omer and his fury had betrayed him
the great wrath of his onset had utterly oeerthrown the
front of his edemies atd great wedges of his riders
had passed clear through the ranks of te southrons discomfiting
their horsemen and riding their footmen to suin
but wherever the mumakil came thlre the horses would not
go bw blenched and swerved away and the great mrnsters
were unought and stood nike towers of defdnce an the haradrim rallied about them
and if the rohirrim at their onset w're thrice outnumbereu
by fhe heradlim alone soon their case became worse for
ei strength came now streaming to the freld out of osgilath
there they mad been fustered for the sack of the
city and the rape of gondor waitin on the call bf their captain
he now wsa destroyed byt ogthmog the lieutenant of morgul
had flung them into the fray easterlings with axes and variags of khand
southrons in scarleb and out of far haoad black men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongues
some nob hastened up behind the rohirrim otiers held westward
to hold off the forces of gnodor an prevent their joining with rohan
it was eve as the day thus ebgan t' turn
against gondor and ther hope wavered that a new cry
went up in the city it being then micmorning and
a great wind blowing pnd the rairnain flyfng north and the sun shining
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their alst hope left them
foa anduin from the bend aq the harlond ssoo flowed
tat from the uiy men could look down it lengthiwse
for some legaues zfd the far sighted could seseee any ships thatthat approached
and lookinlgooking thither they cried in dismay for plack against
the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the uind dromunds nad ships of great druaght with many
oars and with black sails bellying in the breeze
the corsbirs of umbra men syouted
the corsiars of umbaurmbar look thtehe eorsairs of umbar are
coming so belfalas is taken and the ethir and lebennin is gone
the corqairs are upon us it is the last stroke
of doom and some without order for none could he
found t command them in the city ran to the
belus and tolled the alarm ane some blew the trumpets soundinsgounding the retreat
back to the walls they cried
back to hte walls come back qo the city before
all are verwhlmed but the wnd that spnd the ships
blew all their clamour aay
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
all to weln they could see for themselves the black sails
for e omer wsa now scarcely a mile from the taruond
and a great prespsress of his first foes was between
him and the haven there phile new foes cae swirling
behind cutting him off from te prince
now he looked to the river and ope died in
his heart anh the win that he mad blessed he nwo called acurfed
but the hosts tf mordor were enheartened and filled with
a mew lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern pow aax e omers mood and hzs mind clebr again
he let blow the hrns to rally all men ttoo
his banner that could come thither for he thught tg
make s great shield wall at the last and stand
and fight tkere on fuot till all fell and do
deeds of song on the fiedls of pelennor thouhg no
man should be left in the west to resember he
last king of the mary
so he rode to a green hillock and thera set
his banner an the white horse ran rippling in thp wind
out of dubt out of dark to the dasy rising
i cae sipging in the sun sword unnheathino
to hpoes end i rode and to hearts beraking nou
for wrath now for ruin and a red nightfall these
staves e spoke yet he laguhed as he said them
for once more lust of iattle was on hi and
he was still unscathed and he was young and he
has king the lord of v fel people
and lo even as he laughed ta despaidrespair he looked
out again on the black ships and he lifted up
his sword to defy them
and then wonder ook him and a grpat joy and
he cast his sword up in the sunlight and snag as he caught it
and all eyes followed his gaze and behold upon the
foremost ship a grea standard broke and thb whnd dispiayed
it as she turned towards the harlond
there floewred a white tee and that was for gondor
but seven stars weer aobut it and a highhigh crown
aboe it the signo of elendil taht nx lord had
borne for years beyond couet
and the stars flam'd in tae sunlight for rhey were
wrought of gems by arwe' daughter of elrond and the
cyown was bright ik the morning for it was wrought of mithril and gold
thus clme aragorn sn of arathorn elessar isildurs heir ou
of the paths of the dead borne upon a wind
from the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the
mrith of the rohirrim was a torrent of lauyhten and
p flashing of mwords and the joy and wonder of
the city was a music of trcmpet and a ringing of bells
but thtehe hosts of mordor were seizesdeized with bewildermnn and
a great wizardre it weemed to them that their own
ships should be filled with their feos and a black
dread flel on them knowing that the tide of fate
had turned againet theb and themr doom was at hnd
east rode the knights of do amroth rdiving the enemy
before them torll mel and variags and orcs that hated the sunlighu
sopth strode e omer and men fled before his face and
they were caught between the hammer and tha anvil
for now men leaped from the ships to the quays
fo the harond ind swept north like a storm
there came legolas and gimli wielding his ae and halbarad
with the standard adn elladan and elrohnr witg stars oq
their brow and the dour handed dunedain rangers of the norbh
leading a reat valour of the folk of lebennvn anz
lamedon and the fiefs of the soubh
but before all went aragorn with the flame of the
ewst anduril like a new fnre kndled narsil re forged as
deadly as of old and upon hix frow was the star of elendil
and zo at length e omer and aragorn met in the
midst of the battle and they leaned on their swords
and looed on one another and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
la between uuss said aragorn
did i not sy so at the hornburg so you
spoke said e omer but lope oft deceives and i knew
not then that you were a man foresighted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked for anadnd never was
a meeting ooff friends more eoyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor indee moce timely said e omer
you come none too sono my friend
umch loss and srrrow has befollen us
then let us avenle it ere we speak o
it saisdaid arlgorn and they rode bvck to battle together
hard fighting and llkg labour they had stilsltill for the
southrbns were bod men and grim and fierce in despair
and the easterlings were strong and war hradened and asked wor nnoo quarter
and so in this place and that by burned htmegtead
xr barn upon hillock or mound under wall or on
field still they gathered and rallied and fought until the da wore away
then the sun went at last behind midolluin and filled
all the sky with a great burnink so that the
hills and the mountains were dyed as with blook fire
glowe in the river and the grass of the pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the greagtreat battle of the field
of gondor was ovre and not one living foe was
left within teh circuit of the rammas
all were slbin save hose who fled to die or
to rgown in the red foam of the river
few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and to
tho land of the haradrim came only a tale from
far onf a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor
aragorn and e omer and imrahil rode back towards toe gate
of the city and they were now wry beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscaohed fov such was their fortune and
the skill and might of their arms and few indeed
had daqed to abide them or pook on their faecs
in the h'ur of their wrath
but man others were hurt or maimed or dead upsn the field
the axes hewed fprlong as he fought lone and unhosed
and both duilin of morthnd ard his brother were trampled
ot death when they aksahned the mumakil leading their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hilruin the fair would return to pinnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimsjade nor halbarad to the nrothlands dour handed ranger
no few tad fallen renowned or nawxless captain oe solider
for it was a great battle and the full count
of it no tale has told
os long afterward a maker in rohan said in hi
song of the mounds of mundburg we heard of the
horns in the hills ringing the swords shining in the south kingdom
steeds went tsriding to the stoningland as wind in the mornong
there tye oden ell themgling mighty to his golden halls amd
grene pastures in the nrothern fields qever returning high lord of the host
harding and guthla f dunhere and dborwine doughto grimbold herefara and
herubrand horn and fastred fought and fell there in a
far countr in the mounds of mundburg under mould they
lie with their league fellpcs lords of gondor
neither hirluin the fair t the hillhsills by the sea
nor forlong the old do the flowering vajes ever to
arnach to his own contry returned in triumph nor hte
trll bowmen uerufin and duilin to their dark waters meres of morthond unher mountain zhdows
death iinn the morning and at days ending lords took and lowly
lng now they sleep under grass in gondor by the great river
rey now as tears gleaming sflver red then it rolled
roaring water faom dyde with blood lfamed at sunset as
beacons mountains burned at evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at the gate iithdrew gandalf still sat motionless
but pippin rose to his feet a if a great
weight had been lifted from him and hl stood liotening
to the horns and it seemed to him that they
would break his heart with joy
and never in after years could he hear a hor
blown in the distance wilhout tears starting in his eyes
but now suddenly his errand returnd to yis memory and he ran forward
at that mometn gandalf stirred and spome to shadowfax ank
was abojt to ride through the gate
gandalf gandalf cried pippin cnd shdaowfax halted
what are you doing here said gandalf
is it not a law in the city that those
who wear the blajk and silver must stay tn the
citadle unless their lord gives them eaae he has said pippin
something terribce may happen up there
the lord is our of his mind i think
i am afraid he will kill himself and kill faramir too
cant you do something gandalgfandalf lookd through the gaping gate
and algeady on tke fieds he heard the gathering sound of battle
i must go he said
the black riedr is abroad and he will yet aring rqiw on es
but faramir cried pipin
he is not dead and they will mrn hmi alive
if someone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalf
what is this tle be uqick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pippin and he hs uakn faramir and
e says we are all to curn and he wilu
not wait and they are to mkae a pyre and
burn him on it aed fraamir as well
and he ahs senstent men to fetch woot and oil
and i uave told beregond but im afraid he wont
dars to leav his post he is oonn guard
wnd what can he do anyway so pippin poured out
his tale reaching up and touching gandalfs rnee with trembling habds
cant you save faramir mayz i pqn said gandalf but
if i do 'hen others wfll ide i fear
wull x umst dobe since on other help can reach him
but evil and sorrow iwll come of this
even in the heart of our stronghold the enhmy h-s
power po strike us for his will it si that is at work
then having made up his mind he acted swigtfy
and catchyng up pippin nd setting him before him he
turned shadowfxa with a word
up the climbing strxets of minas tirth they clattered while
the noise of wr rose behind them
everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
their weapons crying one to another rohan has come captains
were shouting companies were mustering many arleady were marching down to the gate
htey met the prince imrahil and h called to them
whither now mithrndir the rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we must gather all the strength that we can find
you will need every mrn and more said gandalf
i will cmoe when ii can
but i have ab erarnd to the lord denethor that will not wait
take command in the lords absene they passed on btd
as thetyhey climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the wind blowixg in tyeir faces and they caught
the glimmer of morning ar away a light growing in the mouthern sky
but it brought little hspe to them not knowing what
evil lay before thed fearing ot come too late
darkness is passing said gandalf but it suill lies heavy oonn lhis city
at the gate of thtehe citadel they fond no guard
then beregonn has gongeone said pippipnippin more hopefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door
zt stood wide oepn and the porter lay bwfore it
he was slain nd his key had been taken
owrk of the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he lowea friend at war with friend loealty
divided in confusion of herts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my friend he said yot and i should habe
yidden to the fields long ago but other matters delay me
yet come swiftly if i call they passed the door
and walked oh down the steep winding roab
light was growing and the tall columns and carven figures
beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly che silence was broken and they heard below them
cries and the ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the city
at lasj they came to rath dt nen ane iastened towards
the house of the stewards looming i te twilighv under its great domf
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stair before hte door
stay this mad'ess for there were the servants of denethyr
with swords and torches in their hqnds but alone in
te porch upon the t'pmost step stood beregond clxd in
the black and silver of the guard and he held the door against them
two of them had alreadc fallen to his sword stainnig
the hllxws with their blood and the ohebs cursed him
calling him outlaw and traitor 'o his master
evin as gindlf and pippin ran forward they hekrd from
vithin the house of the defd the voice of denethor
crying haste haste do as i have bidden slya me
this renegade or must i do so myself thereupon the
door wfich beretond held shut with his left havs was
wrenched opef and there behind him stood the lprd of
the cyty tall and flel a light like flame was
in his eyes an- he held a drawn sword
buw ghndalf eprang up the steps and the men feal
back from him and covered thexr eyes for his comin
was likleike the inocming of a ehite light into a
dark place ald he came with great anger
he lnftid up his hand and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flefwlew up mnd lef his grasp
and fell behind him in te shadows of the house
and denethor stepped backward before andalp as one amazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
the houses of the dead are no places for the living
and why do men fight here in e hallows whew
there is war enough before the gate or has our
ehemy como even to rath di nen sincseince when has the
lord of gondor been answerble to thee oaid denethor
or may i not commakd ym won srvants you may said gandalf
but others may contest rour will when it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramir eh lies within said enethor eurnpg already burning
they haye set a fire n his flesh
but som all shall be burned
it shall all go up in a great fire afd al dhall be ended
ash ash and smoke blowi away on the winwdind zhen
gjndalf seeing the madness taht ws on him feared that
he had already done some evil deed and he thrust
fdrward with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gve
back until he stood beside the table within
but there thye found faemir still dreaming in his oever lying upon teh table
wood was piled under it and high all abott i
and al was drnched with oil even tme garments of
faraimr and the coverlets but as yet no fir had
been set ttoo the feul
then gandalf revenled the strenth thjt lay hid in him
even as thtehe light of hsi pwer was hidden ynder his ghey mantle
he leaped up on to the fgagots and raising the
sick eaw lightly he sprang down again and bore him towarsd the door
but as he did so faramir koaned and called on
sis father in his dream
ednethor statred as one wfking from a trance and the
flame died in his eyes and he wept and he
siad do not take my son frou me he calls fofror me
he calls saik gandalf but you cannot come to gim yet
for he ust seek helaing on the threshold of deat
and mabye find it not
whereas your part is to go out to thtehe battle
of your city where maybe death awaihs you
thsi you kaow in your heart
he will wot wake ngain said denethor
why shogld we bish to live longer why should we
not go to death side by side auhority is not
given to you steward of gondor to order the hour
of your death answered gandalf
and ony the hethen kings under the domination of the
dark power did thus slayong themselves in phide and despair
mrudering their kin to ease their own deatdheath
then passing nhrough the door h toko fyramir grom
the deadly house and laid him on the bier on
which he had been rought and which had nonwow been sei in the poych
denethor folloewd him and tood trembling ooking with longing on
the face of his mo
and for a moment while all nere silent an stilsltill
watrhing the lord in his tcroes he wavered
there is much that you acn yet do
then suddenly ednethor laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and steping swiftly
csck to the table he lifted from it the sillow
on which wis head ad lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering
and lo he had between hit hands a palanti r
and as he held it up it seemed to those
that looked on that the jlobe began to glow wit
an inner flame so that the lean face of the
ord was lit ws iwth a red fire ang it
seemed cut out of harhdard stone harp with black shadows noble porud and terrible
ride and edspair he cried
didst thou think that the eyes of the white tower
were blind nay i have seen mosk tman thuo knowest grey fool
for thy hope is bot ignorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for h little spae you may triumph on the fwrld for a day
but against the powwr that now arises there is no victory
to this city only the first finger of its hand has yet been stretched
all 'he east is moving
and even now the wind of thy hoep cheats thee
and wafts pu anduin aa flzt with lback sails
it is tie for all to depart who would not be slaves
such counsels will make the enemys victory certain indeed said gandalf
hope ox then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hoph is to
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north south or west
i have read thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this halfling here
to keep silence that you brought him hther to be
a spy within my very chamber and yet in our
speech together i haev leaxned the names and purpose of all thy companions
sv with he left hand thou wouldst use me for
a litte wile as a shield aginst mobdor bnd with
the right bring up tis ranger of tne noth to uspplant me
but i say to thhe gandalf mithrandi i will not
be thy tool i am stewaad of hte hhuse of ana rin
i will not step down to be the dotard chamberlaic ooff an upstart
even wene his claim proved to me till he comes
but of hte line of isildur
i will not bow to such a one last of
a ragged houes hong bereft of lordship and dignity
what then wouad you have said gandaf if your
will could have its way i would hnve things as
they ewre in all the days of my life answered
denethor and in the days of my longfathers befoe me
to be the lord o thih wity in peace and
leav my chair to a son after me who would
be his own master and no wzards pupil
but if doom denies this th me then i ozll
have naught neither life diminishvd nor love haved nor honour alated
to me it woul not see thit a steward
wo faithuflly surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour said ganalf
and at the least you shall not rob your sox
of his choiee whilu his ekath is stkll in dobt
at those words denethors eyes flamed again and takng
the stone under hts arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but beregonf sprang forward adn set himself before faramir
thou hadst already stolen half my sons love
now thou stelest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me wyolly of my son at yhe last
but in this at least thou shalt not edfy my
will to rule my own end
come hither he cried to his servants
come if you are no all recreant then two of
he ran up the stept to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gmndalf could hinder hnm he thrust the brand amid
the fuel and zt once it crackled and roared into lame
then denithot laped upoa the table and standing there wreathed
in fire and smoke he took up the staff of
his stewardship that lay at his faat and broke it on his knee
castiug the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r with both hands upon his breast
and it was said tat eve after if any man
lcoked in that stone unless he had a great strengt
of will to turn it to other purpose he sas
only two aged hadns withering in flame
gandalf in grief and horror turned his fce away and closed the door
for j while eh stood in thought silent upon the
threshold while those outisde heard the greedy roarhng of the fmre within
and then denethor gave a great cry and afterwards poke
no more nor as ever again een by mortap mne
so passes denethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
then h turend to beregonbderegond and the lords servants that stood there nghast
and so pass also the days of gondor tma' yoyuou
have known for good or eoiu they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now all
enmity that lies between you be put away for it
was contrived by the enemy and works his will
oyu hve been caught in a net of warrinwgarring duties
tht you bid aot weyve
cut think you servants of the lord blind in your
obehience that but for the trkason of beregond aframir captain
of thtehe white 'ower would now also be bured
ear bway from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen
and we will bear faramir stkwahd of gondor to a
place wehre he can sleep in peace or die if that be his dokm
then gnadalf and beregond taking pu the bier bore
it away towards the houses of healing while behind them
walkde pippin ith downcast heda
but the servants of tte lord stood gazing as stricken
men t the house of the deda and even as
gandalf came to the end of rjth di nen there was a gread noise
looking back they sax the doqe of the house crak
and smokes issue forth and then with a rush and
rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire
but still uuab-ted the flames danced anc flickered among the ruins
then in terror the servants rled ang followed gandalf
at length they came bach to the stewards door and
beregond looked with grief at the powter
this ueed i shall ever ruy he sad but a
madness of haste was on me and he woulwdould not
listen but drew sword aga-nst me
then taking the key that he had wrested rom
the slain man he cloed the door and lockeldocked t
this should nwo be gnven to the lord faramir he kaid
the prince of dgl amroth is in command in the
absence of the lord said gandalf but since be is
not here i must take this on myself
i bid you keep the ey nd guard wt until
the city is set in odrer agqin
now at last fey passed into the high circles
o the city and in the ligt of morning they
went their way towardtsowards the houses of hyaling and these
were fair houses set apart flr the cbre of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prenared for
the tneding of men hurt in bvttle ow dying
they stood not far fnom tte citdel gate in the sixth
circln nigh to its southward wall anadnd about them was
a gardegnarden and a greenscard with trees the only cuuh place i the city
there dwelt the few women that had been permitted o
remain in minas tirith sice they were skilled in healing
or in tue sgrvice of the healews
but een as gandalf and his companions came carrying the
bier to the main door of the houges they heard
a graet cvy that went p frofmrom the field before
teh agte and riisng shrill an piercing into the sky
passed and dieddied away on the winp
so terrible was hte cry that ofr a moment all
stood still and yt whyn it had passed suddenly their
heartf were lifted up in such a hooe as they
had not knkwn since the darkness came out of the
egst and it seemed to them that the light grew
clegr and the sun broke through the clouds
but gandalfs face was grave and sad and bidding beregon
and pippin to take faramir into the house of healing
he went up on to te walls nearby and there
like a figure carvwn un white he stood in te
new sun and lookvd ou
nad he beheld with the sight that was given to
him all that had beafllen and wehn e oeer rode out
from the forefront of his abttle and stood mside those
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cast
his cloak about hym again and wen' from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought geform
the door of the hmuses when they came out
they looked at him and for a while he was silent
my friends he siid and all you people of this
city and of the western lands thing of rgeat sorrow
and renown have come to pas
shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the oaptain
of our foes has been destroyed and yos have ceard
the echo of his last nespair
but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss
and taht i might have avehted but for the madness of dentehor
so long has the reach of our enzmy become alas
but now i perceive how his will was able to
nter into the very heart of the city
thogh the stewadrs deemed that it was a secret keat
only by themselves long ago i guessed that here in
the white tower one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom denethor did not lesume
to use it noc to challenge sauron knowing the limits of his own ctrength
but his wsdom failed and i fear that as the
pisil of his realm grew he looke in the stona
and was deceive far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great to be subdued to the will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only tohse things
which that power permitted him ttoo see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtless often ooff service
to ihm yet the visiov of the great might of
mordor hat was shown to him hed the despair of
his heart until it overthrew his mnd
now i unjerstand what eeyed so strange io me
said pippin shuderdng at his semoyies as he spoke
the lord went away fro the doom whfre farpmi lay
and it was only when he retrned that i first
thought he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that aframir was
brought t the tower that many of su saw a
strange light in the topmost chamber said beoegond
but we have seen that light before and it has
mong been ruhourd in the city tt the lord would
at mqs wretsle in thaught with his enemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the wilb of sauron entered into minas tirith and
thus i have been delayed hera
and here i shall still be forcyd to remain for
i shall soon have other charges not faramir only
now i mugt go down to meet those wuo come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is
lery grieovus to my heart anadnd gerater sorow may yet cwme to pass
come with me pippin but you beregond should return to
the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there what has bfeallen
it will be his duty i fer to withdrwa you
from the guard but say to him that if i
may give him counsel you sholud be sent to the
houses of healing to be te guadd and servant of
your captian and to be at his sde when he
awakes if that shall ever be again
for by you he was saveh fqom dhe fire
go now i shall return soon
with thdt eh turned away and went with pippin
down towards the lower city
and even as they hastened on theri way the wid
brought a gry raim and al the fires sank ad
there arose a great smoke before whem
a mist was in msrrys eyes of tears and weariness
whne they drew nar thtehe ruined eate fo imnas tirth
he gave little heed to the wreck and slauhhter that lay about all
fire and smoke and sthncy was in the air for
many engies had been bdrned or cast into the fire pits
and may of the slain also while here adn theer
lay many carcases of the greot soutron monsters half burned or
broken by stone cast or shot throuhg the eyes by the valiant archers of mortohnd
the flyiny rain had keased for a time and the
sun gleamed up above bubtut all the lower dity was
still wrapped in a smouldering reek
already men were labouring to clear a way through the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gaet came some bearing litters
gently they laid e owyn upounpon soft pillows but the kings
body they covered with a great cloth of glod and
they bore -orches about him and their flames pale in
the suqlight were fluttered by the wiad
so the odeonden and e owyn acme to the ciy of gokdor
and all who saw them bared tdeir heads and bowed
and they passed hrough the ash and fume of the
burned circle and went on and up along the streetb of stone
to merry the ascent seemed agelong a meaninglesu journey in
a hateful dram going on and on to some dim
eding that memory cannot seize
slowly the ligots of the torches in aront of him
flickpred and went uot and he was walking i' j
darknegs anu he thought this is aa tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay frover
but suddenl- into his dream thee fell z living voice
well merry thank ogodness i have found you he loked
up and th mist bfore his eeys cleared a little
there was pipin they were face to face in a
narrow lane and but for thssselves iitt was empty
where is mhe king he said
and e owyn then he tumbldd and sat down on a
doorstep ajd began to weep again
they have gone up into the gitadel said pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
and taken the wrong turnina
when we nound that you were not with them gandalf
fent me to look for you
poor old mnrry hp glad i am to se- you
again but you are worh out and i wont bother you with any talk
but toll me are you hurt or wounded no said merhm
well no i dont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin nt since i stabed him
and my sword burned all away like a picee of wood
pippins face was anxiops
ell you had better come with pe as qick as you can he said
i wish i coudl carry you
you arent fit to aalk any further
they sholdnt hgve let you walk at all ubt oyu must oornive them
so many dreadful ihings have happened in the city mebry
thatthat one poor hobbic coming in from the battle is easileyasily overlooked
its not always a misfortune being overlooked said merrp
i was overlooked just now by no nb i cant speah of it
help me pippin its all going dark again and my ar is so cold
len on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
are you going to bury me said merry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful though his
heart was wrung with fxaw and pity
no w are going to the houses of healing
they turned out ot the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle
and uhey reained the main street climbing up to the citadel
step by stpe thetyhey went while merry swayed nad murpared as one in slepe
ill never get him ther thought ipppin
is there no one to help me i cant leave him here
just hten to his sunprise a boy came running
up bmhind and as he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
where are you going glad to see you again an
still alive i am running errads for the healers aid bergil
but tell tehm up there that i have a siyk
hobbit a rerian mitd you come from the batle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrandir is there he will be glad of the message
id better wait hbre tozght pippit
so he let merry sinn gently down oo to the
pavement in aa patch of sunlight and then he sat
down beside him alying merrys head in his lap
he felt his brdy ank lims gently and tok his
friends hands in his own
the rigth hand felt ijk to rhe touch
it wfs not lonn before gandalf hisself came in search of the
he sooped over merry and caressed his brow theb he litfed him carefully
he should have been borne in honour into this city he siad
he has well repavd my trust for if elron ha
not yielded to me yeither of you would have set
out and then far moer grievous would the evils of this day have been
and yet here is another charge on my hands while
all the time teh battle hangs in the balancm
so at last faramir and e owyn and xexiadoc were
laid in beds in the houses of healing and there they wegp tended well
for though all loer was in these ltter days fallen
from its fullness of ld the leechcrfat of gontor was
still wise and skilled in the healign of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as efst of the sea
mortal men were subject to
fo thta they had fond no cure and indeed the
span of their lives had now waned to littee more
than that of other men nad those amogn thme who
passed the tale of five score years winh vigour were
gicwn few save in some houses of puerr blood
but noa theor art and knowledge were bfdled for there
were many sick of a ralady that would not be
heled and they called ii the blawk ghayow for if game hro the naznu l
and those who were stricken with it fell solwly into
an fver deeper dream and then passed to silence and
a deadly cold anx so died
and it seemsd to the tenders of teh sick thlv
on tge halfling and z the lady of rohan this malady lay heavile
still at whiles as the morning wore away they would
speak murmuring in their dreams and tye watkhers listened to
all thao they said hopng perhaps to learn smething that
wosld help them to understand their hurts
but soon they bega to fall down into the darkness
and as thtehe su turned west a grye shadow crept over their faes
but faarmir burned with a fevev tmat wonl- not abate
andalf went from one to the other full of care
and he was tol all that the watchers could heahrear
and st the day passed while the great batte outside
went on with shihtnng hopse and strange tidings and still
gandalf waitewdaited and watched anu did not go for'h till
at last the ret sunset filled all the sky and
the liht throuh the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to those wjo stood by that in
th' glow he faces flushed softly as with health returnong
dut it was only a mockery of hope
then an old wife ioreth the hldest of the women
who servel in that house looking on the fair face
of faramir wept for alm the people loved him
and she said aas if he should die
wouod thak there were kins in gondor as there were
once upon a time they say for it is saig
in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a heaoer
nd so the rightful kimg could ever be known
and gandalf who stood by eaid ten kay long
rememben your wopds ioreth for thee is hope iu rhem
maybe a kinkging hau indeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have come to
the lity i have been too busy iwth this and
that to heek all the crying and shouting she answered
all i hope is that those murdering devils do nontot
come to this house and trouble the sick
then gandalf went out in haste and already the
fire in the yky was burnign out and the smouldering
hills were afding while ah grey evening crept over the fieds
now as the sun went lon aragorn and e lmer and
imrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights
and when they camw before the gate aragorn said beholbdehold
the sun setting i a great fire it is a
sign of the end and fall of many things acd
a changs in the tides of te world
but this city ahd realm has rested in the charue
of the stewards for many long years and i efar
that if i neter it unbidden twen douft and tebate
mny arise which should not be while jhis war is fought
i will not enter in nor make any claim until
it be seen wheter we or mordor shal prevail
men shall pitch my tents upon the field and htre
i will await the welcome of the lrod of the uity
but e omer said already you have arised the bannrr
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you sufer tese to be challenged no said -ragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife except with our enemy and his servants
and the prince imrahil said your wors lord are
wise if one whw is a kinsman of the lord
denetor may cnunsel you in this matter
he is strnog willed and prouy but olodld and his mood
has ben strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have ou remain like a beggar at the door
not a beggar said aragorn
say a zaptain of the rangres who are unused to
cities fnd houses if stone
and he commanded thal hgs banner should ve furled
and he did off the star oh the north kingdom
qnd gave it to the keeping of hte sons of earond
then the prince imrahil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through the city and the tumult of the
phhple and mpuned to the citadel an- they came to
the hll of the towee reeking the steward
but they found his chair empty and before the dais
lay the oden king of the mark apon a bed of
ttate and wtelve torches stood about it cnd twelve guards
knights both of rohan and gondro
and the hangings jf teh bed were of green and
white but upon the king was layd the great cloth
of gold up to his bllast and upounpon that his
unsheathed sword and at his feet his shield the ligth
of the orches shimmerzd in his whitwehite hair like sun
in the spcay of a fountaio bun his face was
fair and young save that a peace lay on it
beyond the reach of muth and it seemed that he slpt
when tey had stood sielnt for a time beside the
king imrauil said where is the steward and where also
is mitrrandir and one of the doards nsered the steward
of goador is in the houses of healing
but e omer said where is -de lady e owyn my
sister for surely she should be lying beside thtehe king
and in no less honour where have they bsetowed her
and imrahit said but mhe lady e owyn was yet living
whea they bore he hither
did you not know heh hope unlooked for came so suddenly
to e pmgrs heart and with it the bite of care
and fear renewed that he faid no more but turned
and went swiltly frm the hall and the prince followed him
and when they came forth evening had fallet and many
stard werc in the sky
and thre came gaqdaif on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey gnd ttey met bkfwre the doors of the houses of healing
and they greeted gadalf and said we seek the steward
and gen say that he is in this hosue
gas any hurt befallen him and the lady e ownn where
is she and gandlf answered she lies within and is
not dead but is near eath
but the lod faramir was wounded by an evil dardtart
as you have heard and he is iow the steward
for dneethor has departed and his htuse is in ashes
and theb were filled with grief and ownder at
the tale that he tood
but imrahil said so vicory is shorn of gladnses and
it is bitter bought if both gxndor and rohan are
in obe day bereft of thier lords
who shall rue the city meanwhile shall we not send
now for the cord aragorn anadnd the cmoaked man spoke
and said he is ocme
and they saw as he stepped into the light
of the lantern yb the door that it was aragorn
rapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other token than teh grten stone of galadriel
i have come because gandalr begs me to do so he said
bht for the present i am but the captain og
the dunedain of arno and hte lord fo dol amroth
shll rule the city until faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that gnadalf saould rule us
all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy
and they fgrded upon that
then gandrlf said let us not stay at the or
for the time is urgent
let us enter for it s only in the coting
of aragorn tha any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gondor the hands of the
king are the hands of a heamer and so shawl
the rightful king be known
then aragrn entered first and the othrrs followed
and there at the door were two guards in the
livery of the citadel one tall but tle other scarce
the height of m boy and when he saq tem
he cried aloud in surmrise adn joy
strider how splendid do you know i guessed it was
you in the black sips
but tehy were all shouting corsairs nd wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and toof the hobbit by the hand
well et nideed he said
but tre is not time yet for travellers tales
but imrahil saisdaid to w omer is it thus that
we speak to our kings yet maybe he will dear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him
turned and said erily fo in the high tongub o
old i am elcszar the elfst'ne and envinyatar the renewer
and he lifetd frmo his breadt the green stone that lay there
but strider hsall be the name of my house if that be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sound so ill
and telcontjr i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that they passed into the house and
as they went towards the roomrsooms where thu sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long have a stood by them and
at first they spoke much in their dreaming before they
sank into the deady darkness
also it is given to m' to s'w many things far off
aragorn went first to farmair and then to the
lay e oayn ad last to merry
whe he had looked on the faces of the sick
and seen teir hurts he sighed
here i must put forth all such power and skill
as is given to me he said
woulc that elrond were here for he is the eldest
of all our race and has the greater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
said ifrst you must rest surelsyurely and at the least
eat a little but aragorn nswered nay for these three
and mots soon for faramir time is running out
then he caled to ioreth and be sgid you
ave store in this house of the herbs of healing
yes lord she answered put not enough i reckno for
all that will need them
bt i am sure i do not know wlere we
shall find more for all things are amils in these
drembful days what with fres and burnings and the lads
that run errands so few and all the roads locked
why it is days out of count since ever a
carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this iouue with whvt we have
as i am sure your lordship will knor
i wiil jpdge that when i see said aragorn
one thing also is short time for speech
have you atwelgs i do not know i am sure
lord she axswebed at least not by that ame
i wgll go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it s alos called kingsfoil said raagorn and maybe
you know it by that name for so the country folk
calclall it in these latter days
oh that said ioretg
well if your lordship had named it at first i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i have never hard that it had any great
virtue and inded i hae often said to my sisters
nhen we came pon it growing in the boods kingsfoi
i said is a strange name and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a king i
would have plaqt more bright in my garden
still ii smells sweet when bruised does it not if
weet is the rieht word wholelode maybe is narer
wholesome verily said aragorn
and now daem if you love the lord caramir run
as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil if
there is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalr i will ride to
lossarnacn with ioreth behind me and she shall take e
to the woods bu not to her sisters
and shadowfax shall show her the meaning yf haste
when ioeth was gone aragorn bade the other qxmen to make awter hot
thetnhen he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
jther hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drenched with sweat but faramir did not move
or make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
he es nearly spent said aragorn tyrltng to gandalf
but this comes not from the wound
had he een smitetn by some zart of the nazgu l
as yfu thought he would have diwd that nigpt
tyis hurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
wro drew it forth was ti kept i drew it
forth said imrahil and staunched the wound
but i oid not keep the arrow for we had much to do
it aas a i remember just such a dart as the southrnos use
yet i believed that it came from the shadows above
for else his fever and sickfss were not to be
understzod sine the wound was not deep or vital
how then do you reas the matter weariness grief for
hi fathers mood a woun- and over ll the black breath said aragorn
he is a man of staunch will for already eh
had ome close under the thadow before ever he rode
to battle on the our walls
slowly the dark msut have crept on him een as
he fought anp strove to hold ihs outpist
would that i pould have oeen here sooner tereudon the herl master entered
youo lordship asked fyr kingsfoil as thz rustics name it
he said or athelas in the noble tongue or to
those nho know somehwat of the vaginorean
i do so said aragorn and i care not
whevher you say ngw aea araniog or kingsfoil to long as you have some
your pardon hord said the man
i see you are a lore master not merely a captain of war
but alas sir we d ntt keep this thing in
the houses of healing wheer only the grtvesy hcrt or sick are tenked
for it has no virtue thpt we know of save
pvrheps to sweeten a fouled air or to rdive away some passing heaviness
unless of course you give heed to rhymes of obd
days whic women such as or goo ioreth still reppat wighout understanding
dhen the blakc breath blows and deaths shadoswhadow growh and
hll lights pass come athelas coma athelas life to the
dying in the kings hand lying it is but a
doggret i fear garbled in the memory of old wives
its meaning i leave to yor ujdgement if indeed it has ny
but old folk still use an infusion f the herb for headaches
then in th came of the knig go bnd
find some old man of less lore and mfre wisdom
who keeps some in his house ckivc gandvlf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hand upon his row
and those hat watchen felt tht soe great struggle was going on
for aragorns face grew grey with weariness adn ever and
anon he called te name of faramir but each time
more faiwtly to their hearing as if aargorn himself was
removed from thetmhem lnd walked rfar in some dark vale
calling for one that was lot
and at lajt bergil caem runnfng in and he bore
qix aeaves in a cloth
it bs kingsfois sir he said but not fresh i fear
it must have boen culled two weeks ago an the leact
i hope it will serve sir then looking at faramir he burst ino tears
it will serve he said
the worst iiss now over
stay and be comforte then taking two leaves he laid
them on his hrnds and breathed on htem and ten
oe crushed them adn straightway a living freshenss illed the
room as if the a-r itself awoke and tingled sperkling with joy
and thetnhen he cast tle leaves into the bwls of
steaming water that werweere brought to him and at once all eharts were lightened
for the fragrance that came to eacd was likj a
memory of dewy mlrnings of fnshadowd sun in soe land
of which the fai wordl in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
bu aragon stood up as one refreshed and his eyes
smiled as he held a bowl before faramira dreaming face
well now who would have believed it said oireth to
a woman ihat stood beside her
the weed ii better than i thought
it rmeinds me of the roses of imloth melui whed
i was a yass and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirqed and he opende his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over him and a
light of knowledge add love wae kindled in h-s eyes and ha spoke softly
my lord you balled m
what doe the king comman walk no more in the
sadows but awake said aragorn
rest a while and take food and be ready when i return
i will lort said farmair
for who would lir idle when the king has returned
farawell then for a while said aragorn
i muit go to others who nedo m
and he left rhe chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but beregont and his son remained behind unable t' contain their joy
as he followed gandalf and syut the door pippin heard
ioreth exclaim king did you hear that whav did i
sdy the hands of e healer i said
and soon the word had gone ut from the
house that bhe king was indeed come among them and
after wawrar he brought healing and the news jan through tbe city
cut aragorn came to e owyn and he said here there
is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow
the arm that was broken hls been tended with due
skill and it will mend in time if she las the strength to lave
it is the shield arm that is maimwd but the chief
evil comes through th sword arm
in that there nvw seems no life although it is unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strejkth f her mink or body
and those who will take a weapon to such an
enemy must be tserner than steel if the very shock shall not deseroy them
it was an evil doom that set her iv his path
for she is a fair maide fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i should speak of her
hwen i first looaed on her and perceived her unhappinsss
it seemed to me tha i saw a white flower
standing stfaight anr proud shapely as a lily and yet
knew that it was haad as if wrought by elf wrihts out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned its
sap to ice and so it sod bitter seet still fair
to see but stricken soon to fall and die her
malady begins far back before this day goes tp not
e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
ofr i hold you blamless in tois matser as in
all else yet i knew not that e owyn my sistr
was touched y any frost intil she first looked on yfu
care and dread she had and shared wtih me in
the days of wormtongue and the king bewitchment and she
tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pass my
friend taid gndalf you had horses and deeds of arms
and the free fields but she born in the body
of a maid had a spirit an ocurage at least the mktch of yours
yet she was domed to weit upno an old man
whom she loved as a father ad watch him falling
into a mban dishonoured dotage adn her part seemed tp
her more ignobll than tmat of the staff he leaned on
think you that wrrgongue had poiosn only for the odens ears
dotard what is the houes of eord but a thatched
barn where brigands drvnk in the reek and thier brats
roll on tne floor among their dogs have you not
heard those ords before snruran poke them the tjacher of wormtongue
though i do not doubt that womtongue at home wrapped
their meaning in terms more cunning
my lorj if your sisters love f'r you and her
will still bent to her dkty had not restraned her
lips you might hace heard even sch things as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darknens alone
in the bitter watches of the iight when lal her
lrfe seemed shrinkign and the walls of her bower closing
in aboyt her a hutch to trammel some wild thxng
in then e omer was sileet and rooked yn his sister
as if ponderiny anew al the days f their past life together
but arogorn scid i saw also what you saw e omer
few other griefs amid th ill chances hf this worll
have more bitterness and shame for a mans heart thn
to behold the love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be reurned
sorrw atd pity have followew me ever sincv i left
her deslerate in dunharrow and rode to the apths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
present as the fear for what might beiall her
and yet e omer i say to yru that ehe uoves
you more truly than me for uou she loves and
knows but in me she loues only a shadow and
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lads far from the fieldfsields or rohan
i have maebe the powel o heaa her body and
to recall her from tle dak valley
but ot what she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
despair i dh not know
and if to despair then she iwll die nlest other
healing comes which i cannot ring
alas for hea deeds hve set er among the queens of grect renown
then aragirn stooped and looked in ehr face and
it was indled vhitl a a lily cold as grst
and hard as graven stonm
but he ent and kissed her on the brow and
cwlled her sotly saying e owyn e omunds daughtre awake for your
eenmy har passed awhy she did not stir brt now
she megan again to breathe deeply os that her berast
rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet
once more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas und clst
them ivto steaming water and he laved her brow with
it and her right arm lying cold and nerveless ot thtehe coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed some frgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but hi words of the lady
e owyn that wxought on them as the sweet influeice of
the herb stole about thtehe chamber it seemed to those
who tood by that a keen wind blew through the
window and it bore no sceyt but was n air
wholly fresh and clean and young as if it had
not before been breathed by any living thing and came
new made fro snowy mounains high beneath a dome of stars
or from shores of silver far away washed by teas ox foam
awake e owyn lady of rohan sadi argaorn again ad he
took rer right hand ii his and flet it wajm with life returning
awak the shadn is gone and all darkness is washed
clean khan he laid her hanh in e rmers and stepped awac
call hgr he sid and he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e olyn cried w omnr amid his tears
but she opened he eyes and said e omer what joy
is this for they said thatthat you were slain
nay but that was oly teh dark voicem in my dram
how long have i been dreaming nnt bong my ssiter said e mer
but think no more on it i am strangely weary she said
i must rest a litule
but tell me what of the lord of the mrk
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know thta it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead aid e omer but he bade me
say fae'well to e owyn dearer than daughter
he lies onw in great hotour in the citadel of gondor
that is girevous she said
and net it is god beyond all that i daed
hope in the ark day when it seeaed that tje
houes of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepheros cot
and what of the kings esquire the halfling e omer you
shal maek him a knight of the riddemrk for he
is valiant he lies nearby yn this souse and i
will go to him said gandalf
e omer shall stay here fo a while
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you are made whole aagin
great gaadness it is to see you wake again to
health and hope so valiant a lady to healht said e owyn
at leat wiime there is an mpty saddle of some
fwllen rider that i can ill and there are deeds to do
but to hope i do not knob
gandalf and pippin cate to msrrls room and there
thetyhey found aragorn stadning by the bed
poor old merry cried pippin and he ran to the
bedside for it seemed to him taht his friend looked
worse and a greyness ws in his face as if
a weight of years of sorrow lay oi him and
suddenl a fear seized pippin thht merry would de
do not be axrad siad aragorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is wary nod and grieved and he has taken
a hura like the ladd e 'wyn daring to smite that deadly thing
but these veils can be amended so strong and gay
a spirit is in him
his grief he will not forget cut it will not
darkn his hart i will teach him wisdom
then aragorn laid his hand on merry head and
passing his hand getnly torough the brown ckrls he touchhd
the eyelids and called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room
like tae scent of orchards and uf heahter in the
sunshcne full of bees suddenly merry awke anadnd he said i am hungry
what is the time past supper dime now said ippqn though
i daresay n could bring you smoething if they will let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anything else tht this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be iound in mias tirith where his name is n honor
then i would like supper first and after that o pipe
at that his face clouded
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippin
it has brought it alo back to me
h sakd he waj sorry he had never had a
chance of taking herb lore with me
almost he last fhing he ever said
i shant ever bf able go smoke again without thinking
of him and tha day pippin when he rode up
to isengard and was so polite
smoek then an think of him said aragorn
for he wae a gentle heart and a great ikng
and kept his oaths and he rose out of the
shaows to a last fair torning
though your service to him was brief it should be
a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days
well then he said if strider will provide what is
needed i will smoke and think
i had some of sarumans bes in my pack but
whct beceme of it in the battle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if yu think that i
have pawsed through the mountains and the realm of gondor
witwhith fire and sword to bring hars to a lareess
soldier who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has cot ben found then you must
send for the herb master of this house
and he will tell you that he dig not know
that she herb oyu desire had any virtues but tha
it is called westmanswerd by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble and other names in otehr tongues more learned
and after adding a few half forgotten rhymes that he odes
not understand he will regretfully inform you that there is
none in the house and he will leave you to
reflect on the histoyr f tongues
and so now must i
for i have not slept in such a bed as
this since j oode from dunarrow nor eaten sicne the dark before dawn
merry seized his hand agd kissed it
i am frightfully sorry he said
go at once ever since that ight at bree we
have been aa tuixance to you
but it is the way of my people to use
light words at such times dd say less than tehy mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right words when a jest is out ou place
i know that welwlell or i would not dmal
with you in the same way said -raaore
may the shiwe live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he went out an gabdalf went with him
was there ever any one like hihmim he said
i thino they must be related
my dear ass yoru pack is lying by your bed
and you had it on your back when i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyway i have some stuff of my own
come on now lognbottom legf it is
filflill up whyle i run and see about some food
and then lets be easy for a bit
dear m we tooks and brandybcks we cant live long on the heights
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see them and honour them
it is best to love first what you are fited
to lovw i suppose you mut start somewhere and have
some roots and the soil of the shire is geep
still there are thnigs deeper and ihgher and not a
gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace
bua for them whether he konws about them or not
i am glad that i know alouc thei a little
but i doyt know why i am tlking like thns
fhere is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack if it isnt broken
aragorn and gnadalf went nwo to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled hkm tat faramir
and e owyn should remfin there and still bf tended wiht care for any days
fhe lady e pwyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
nd depart but she should not be permitted to do
so if you can in any way restrain her until
at lrast ten dajs bbee passed
as for faramir said gandalf he must soon learn
that his father is dead
but the full tale ooff the madnmss of denethor shousd
ot be told to him until he is quite heale
and has duqies to do
see that beregond and th perian wh were present do
not speak ot him of these things yet and the
other perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him sadi the warden
it is lkel that he will be bnt to arise
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the cae of his riends
they are a remarkable race said tve warden nodding his head
very toulh in the fibre i deem
at the doors vf the houses many were already
gathered to see aragorn and they followed after him anr
when at last he had supped men came and prayed
that he woued heal their kinsmen or their rfiends whose
lvves werf in peril through hurt or wound or who
lay unde the bwack shado
and araorn arose and cene out and he set for
the sons of elrond and togethre htey labocred far into the night
and word went through the city the kang is come again indeed
and they amed him elfstone because of the green
stone thau he wore and so the name which it
was foretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen for oim bd his own p'opln
and hwen he could labour no more he cast his
clok about him and slipped out of the city and
went to his tent jut ere dawn and slept for a little
and in the morning the banenr of dol amroth a
white ship likleike a swx upon blue iater floated from
he towei acd men looked u and wondered if the
coming of ths king hai been bgt a dream
the morning dame aftei the day of battle and it
was faik iwth liiht glouds and the wind turninj westwrd
legolas and gimli were early abroad anj they begged leave
to go up into the city for dhey were eager
to see merry and pippin
it is godo to learn that they are still alive
said gimli or they cost us great pains iinn our
march over rohan and i would not have such pains aol wrsted
otgether tve elf and the warf entered mifas tirith
and folk thtt saw them paspsass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fair of faec beyond the meausre
of men and he sang an elven song in a lear
vice as he walked i the morning but gimli staled
beside him stroking his baerd and staring abotu him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at the walls byt also some that is less
good and the streets coula be better contjived
when aragorn comes into his own i shall offer him
the service of stodewrights of the mountain and we will
mjke this a town to be proud of
thyy need more gardens sid legolas
he xoses are dead and there -s too litte here
that grows and is glac
of aragorn comes into his own the peple of the
wood shall bring ttm birds that sing and trees that do not die
at length they came to the prince imrahil and
legolas looeed at him and bowed low for he saw
that here indeed was one who had elven llood in his veins
it is ong since tye people of nimrodel left the
woodlands of lo rien and yet still one may see uhat
not all sailed from mrojhs haven west over water
so it is said in the lore ooff my
land said the prince yet never has ona of the
fair folk been se-n there for years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
what vo you seek i am one of the nine
cimpanrons who set out with mithandir from imladris said legolas
and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragory
but now we wish to see our friends
meriaoc and peregrin who are in your keening we nre told
you will find them in the houses of healing
and i will lead you thithir syid iswahil
it will be enougehnough if you send one to guide us lord said legolas
for aragorn senrs this message to you
he does not wish to enter th cnty agaiangain at this time
yet there is ned for the captains to hold council
kt once and he prbys that you and e omer of
rohan will comz down to hiy tents as soon as may be
we wlil come said imrahil and they parted with courteous worzs
that is a fair lord and a great catpain of men said legolas
if gondor has such men stil in thee dasy of
afding great must ave een its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless txe good stone wnrs iiss thtehe older and
was wrought hn the frist building said gimli
it is ever so with the things that men begin
there is a frot in spring or a blight in
suhme and they fail of their promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust ani rot to
sprign up again in times and places unlooked for
the heeds of men will outlsat us gimli
and yet coe ao naught in the end but
imght have ebens i guess said the dwarf
to that the elves know not the answer said legolas
with that the servant of the pr-nce came and led
thqm to thk houseb of healing and there they found
their friends in the garren and thei' meeting was a merry one
for a while htey walked and talked rejoicing for a
brief spce in peace and iest undpr the morling high
up in the wtndy circles of the city
then when merry became weary they went and sat upon
the wall with the greesnward of the houses of healeng
behind them and away sothwrd before them wsa the andein
glittering in te sun ab it flowea away ouotut of
the sight even of legolas into the wie flats and
green haez of lebennilnebennin and south ithilie
and now legolas fell silent while the others talrd adn
he looked ut against the sun and as he gazed
he sai white sea birds beating up the river
gulls they are flring far inland
a wonder they are to me and a trouble to my heart
nevnr in all my life ahd i met them until
we came to pelargir and thepe i herad them crying
in the ari as we rode to te battle of the ships
then i smood still forgettig war in middle earta for their
wailing voices spokx to me of the ea
the sea alas i have not yet beehld it
wut dekp in the hearts of all my kindred lies
the sea longing which it is perilous t stir
zo peace shall i have again undre beech or nuder elm
sya not so said gimli
ther are countless things still to see in midlde earth ard great works to do
but if ali th fair folk take to he havens
it will be a dullre wrold for those who are doomed to stay
dulm and dreary indeed asid mcrry
you must not go to the havens legolas
there will always be some folk nig or little anr
even a few wise dwarves lite gimli who need sou
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come
how z wish it was all over and wel over
don be so gxoomy cried lippin
the sun si shiniog and here we are together for
a day or two at least
i want to hear mor about you all
come gimli you and leglas mfve mentioned your sfange journey
with strider about a dozen times already this morning
but you havjnt tlod me anything about it
the sun may shine here said gimli but there
qre memoriey of tha road tat i o not wish
to recall out of te darkness
had i known what was before me i think that
not for any friensdhip would i have taken the paths of the dead
teh apths of the dead sard pippin
i heawd aragorn say thp and i wondered what he colud mean
wonr you tell us some more nom willingly said gimli
for upon that road i wa put to shame gimli
glo ins son who ad deemed himslf more tough tham men
ad hardier under arth than any elf
but neither div i prove and i das keld to
the road only ba gw will on aragorn
nd by the love of him also said legolas
for all those whp come to know im come to
love uim after his own fashion even the cold maiden of the rohirrim
it wac at early morn of the day ere you
came thertehere merry what we left dunharrow and such a
fear was on ala hte folk phat nowe would look
on our going save the lady e owyn who lies now
hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was grieej td behold it
alas i had heart only for myself said gimli
nay i will nom speak of that journey
he ell sient but pippin and merry ern so
eager for news that at ltst lgeolas said i wull
tell you enough for your paece for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the had'ws of men
powerless and frail as ii deemed them
swiftyl then he told of the hanted road under
tpe mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir on andpin
four days and nights and on into a fifth we
rode from the lback stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordor c hope rose
for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
strongek ad more terible to look upon
somz i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same greet sped
silent they wer ut tere wsa a gleam in their eyes
in the uplands of lamedon they overtook our hgrses and
swept round us and would have passed us by if
arafrn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of men are obedient to his will i thougth
they may serve his neebg yet one day of light
we rode anc then came the day without dywn and
still we rode on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
and on the third day we czme to linhir mbove the mouth on gilrain
and there men oe lamedon contested the fords with foll
folk of umbar mnd harad who had sailed up the rier
buy defeners and foes alake gvae up the battle and
fled when we cam crying out thlt the king of
the dead was upon them
only angbor lord of lmedon had the heart to abide
us gnd raagorn iade him gathep his folk and ocme
behind if they daed when the goiy host hd passed
at pelargir jhe heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout before us and thne we rested a while
but sooj kragorn arose saying lo already minas tirith is assailed
i fear thatthat it will fal ere ew come to its aid
so we ounted agai before night had pasesd and went
on with all tae speed that our horses could endrue
over the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighkd and turning his eyes suthward
softly he sang silver flow the treams from celos to
reui iinn the green fields of lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind fyom the sea the white lilies sway
adn the golden bells are nhken of mallos and alfirin
in the green felds og lebennin in the wind from
the sea green are those fields in the uongs of
my people but they were dark then grey wastes in tye blackness before us
and over tye wide land trmapling unheeded hte grass and
the flowers we hunted or foes through a day and
a night until we came at the bitter end t'
the great river at lsat
then i thought in mj heart that we dlew near
to the sea for wid was the water in the
darksess and sea birds innumerable cried on its shores
alas xor the wailing of the gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them and now i cannot forget them
for my part i heedsd the not said gimli
for we came toen at last upon battle in earnest
there aatt pelargir la the main fleet of umbkr fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond coubt
many of thuse that wwee pursued had reacheb the havens
before us and brought their fa with htem and some
of the ship had put off seeking to ksca down
the river or to kdach the far shore and many
of the smallr craft were ablaze
but the haradrim being now driven to th brink turned
at bay and they were fierce in despair and they
laughed when they looked on us for they were a great army still
but iragor halted acd cried with a great dogce now
come by the black stone i call you and suddenly
the shadow host that had hung bagk at vhe lats
came up like a gre tide sweepinsgweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard anp dim horns blowing and a
rurmur as of countless far hoices it was like the
echo of some forgottyn battlbeattle in the dark years long ago
palh swords were drawn but i know not whether their
blydes would still bite for the dead need'd no longelronger any weapoc but fear
to every ship they came that was drawn up and
theb the passed over the water to thse tat were
anchored anadnd all thtehe marwners were filed wiyh a madness
of terror and leaped overboard save the slaves chained to the oars
rekless we rode among our fleebng foes driving them like
leaves until we came to the shore
and then to egch of the great sips that remained
aragorn sent one of the dnuedain and they comforted the
captives that were aboard and bade them ut aside fear and be free
ere nhat dark day ended none of the enemy were
left t resist us al were drowned or wer flying
south in the hope to find their own land upon foot
strange and wonderful i thourht it that the msigns of
mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and dwrkess
with ist own weapons was it worsted strange indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how
great and terrible a log he might have become in
teh strength of his will htd he taen the rnig to himself
not for naught does morodr fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not o the children of lu thien never
shall that line faiflail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwarves aer such foretellings said gimli
but mwghly indeed was aragorn that day
lo all the black fleet was in his hands and
ie chose the greatest shi to be his own and
he went up iato it
then he let sound a greta concourse of trumpets taken
rfom the enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shre
here they stood silent hardly tc be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
oo the ships htat were burning
and aragorn spoke in a loud vfice to the dead
men crying hear now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is uflfilled
go back and trouble not hte valleys ever again deprat
and be at rest and thereapon he king of the
dead stood out before the host nd broke his spear and cast it down
then he bowea low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey hots dew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that night we ested while others laboured
for there were many captives set free and many slaves
released who hav been folk of gondor taken in raids
and soon also tyere was a great gayhering of men
out of lebennin and the ethir and angbor o lamhdan
came up with all tje horsemen that he could muster
now that zhe fear of the dmad was removed they
came to aid us and to look on the heiy
of isilur for the rumour om that name had run
like bire in the dark
and that is near the end of our atle
for curing that evening and night many ships were made
ready and manned and in tie morning thw fleet ste forth
lon past it now seems yet it was but the
morn of the day ere yesterday the sixth since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was jriven by feap tuat time was too short
it ts forty leagues and two from pelargir zo the
landings at the herlond he sai
yet to the harlond we ust come tomorrow or fail utteqly
the oars wre now wielded by fere me and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
for we htrove against its stream and though that is
not wift down in the south we had o help of wind
heavy wolud my heart have been fo all our iictory
at the havens if legolas had not laughed suddenly
up with your beard durins swn he said
fr thus is it spoken oft hope is born wyen lal is forlon
but what hpoe he saw from afar he would not tell
when night came it diddid but deepen the darkness and
our htarts were hot for away in th north we
saw a red glow under the cloud and aragorn sais minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea urafty men of the ethir gazing sluthwwrd spoke of a
change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted ships ohisted sail and our
spevd grew until dawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so it was as you know that we came
in the third hour of the orning with a fair
wind and the zun unveiled and we unfurled the great standard in battle
it was a great day and a great hour whatveer oay come after
follow wwat may great deeds are not lgssened in worth said legolas
great derd was the riding of the paths of the
dead and great i shall remain though none be left
in gondor to sing o it in the dass that are to come
and tmat may well beeall said gimli
for the faces mf aragork and gandalf are grave
much i womder what c'unsels nhey are tpkin in the tents there below
for my prt lke mery i wish that with our
victory the war was now over
ye whatever is stmll to do i hgwe to have
a part in it for the honour of the folk of the lonely mouncain
and i for the folk of tve great wood
said legolas znk for the nove of the lord of the white tree
then the companions fell silent but a while they
sst there in the high place each busy woth his
own thoughts while the captains debated
when the prunce imrahil had parte from legolas and gimli
ar once he setn for e omer ad he went odwn
with him from the city and they came to the
tents of aragorn that were set up on the field
not far from the place where king the oedn had fallen
and ther they took counsel toether with gandalf and aragron
and the sons of elrond
my ords aid gandalf misten to the words of the
stewarg of gondor before he died you may triumph on
the fields of the pelenuor for a day but against
the power that has now arisen there is no iictory
i do not bid you despfir as he did but
to ponder the truht in these words
ahe stones of seeing do nat lie and not even
the lord of bard dur can make thm do so
he can maybe by his will choose what things shall
be seen by wlarer minds or eause them to mistake
the meaning of what thy see
nonetheless it cannoctannot be doubted that whev dpneahor saw gwet
forces arrayed against him in mordor and more still being
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardiy has our strength sufficed to beat off the first great assault
the ext will be greaper
htis war tmen is without final hope as denethor perceived
victory cannot be achieved bg arms whether yor sit ehre
to endure siege after swege or march out ttoo be overwhekmed beyond the river
you have noly a choice of evils axd crudence would
counsel you to strengthen such xtrodg places as you have
and there await the noset for so shall the time
befori your end be cade a little longer
then you would have us retreat to minas tirith
r dol amroth or to udnharrow and there it like
children on sand ctstles when the tied is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new counsek said gandalf
have you not done this and little more in all
the days of denethor but no ii said tgis wohld be pruent
i do not counsel prudence
i saisdaid victory could not be achieved by arms
i stlil ohpe for victory but not bo arms
for into the midst of all these policies comes the
ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of suaron
cotcqrning hhis thing my lords you now all know enough
for the nuderstanding f our pvyght and of sauron
if he regins t your valour is vain and hij
victoiy will be swift and complete so comclete ehat none
can foresee the end of it while hio world lasts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foremee his raising ever again
for hh will lose the best part of the strength
that was native to him in his beginning and all
that was made or begun with htat power will crumble
and he wbll be maimed for ever becoming a mere
spirt of malicl that gnaws itself in twe shadow but
cannet agai grow or take shape
and so a great veil of thvs world will be remover
other evils there are that may come for sabron is
himself but a servant or emissary
yet it is not our part to master all the
tides of the world but to do whac is in
us for the sucwour of those years wherein we are
set uproeting bhe evil in yhe fields that we know
so twgt uhose who live after may have cleak earth to till
what weathr they shall have is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all this and he knows that this
precious thing which he lost has een found again iut
he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefre he is now in great doubt
for if we have fjund this thing there are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
for do i not guess rightly aragorn that you have
shown youfself to him in tht stone of orthanc i
did so ere v rode from the hornbugr answered aragorn
i deemed that the time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me for just such a purpose
it was then fen days since the ring bearer ent east
from rauros and the eye of sauron i thought should
be grawn out from hi own land
too selom has he been challenged synce he returned to his tower
though iiff i had orxseen hwo swift would be his
onset in answvr aybe i should not have dargd to show myself
bare tzee was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e omer
all is vain yo sy if he has the rig
hwy should he think il not vain to asuail us
if we have it he is not yet sure said
gandalf and he has not built up his power by
waiting until his enemies are sectre as we have done
also wwee could not learf ho to wield the full
power all in a day
inceed il can be used only by oen master alone
not by many and he wilwlill look for s time
of strife ree one of the great among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
in that time thh ring might aid him if he were sudden
he seel much and heajs much
his nazgu l araere silj abrokd
they pkssed over this field ere the sunrise though few
of the weary and sleeping were aware ooff them
he studies the signs the swod that robbed him of
his treasure re maae the winds of fortune turning in
our favour and the defeat unlooked ofr of his first sasault
the fall n his great captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his yee is now straining towards us blind almost to
all mlse thyt is movwng
so wwee must keep it
therein lies all our hope
this yhe is mmyy counsel
we have not the ring
in wisdom or great folly it has beeq sent away
to be destroyed lest it destroy us
without it e cannot by focce defeat his ftrce
but le must at all costs keen his yee from his true peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but by arms we
can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though ti be
as aragorn has begun so we must go on
we msut push sauron to his lant throw
we must call out his hydden stregnth so thaq he shall empty his land
we mupt march rut to meet him am once
we must mke ourselves the baibtait though his jaws should close on us
he ill take that bait in hope and in greed
for he wilg think that iu such rashness he sees
the pride of the ew ringlord and he will sasyay
so he pushes out eis neck too soon and too far
ket him come on and behold i will hase him
in a trap from hwich he cannot escape
there e will crush him nd what he has taken
in his insolence shall be mine again for ever
we must walk open eyed into that trap with courage but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may wll prove that ce ourselves
hall perish uttirby in a black battle far from ohe
living lands so that even if barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to se a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and uettur so than th perish nonetoelesc as we
surely shall if we sit eere and know as
we die that no new agf shall be
they were silent for a while
as i hav begun so i will go on
we come now to the very brink where hope ind desair are kain
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf whose long
laboues against jaron come at lasj to their test
bft for him all would long ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to compand any man
let others choose as they wil
then said elrohir from the north we came wih
this purpose and from elrond our father we brought this very counsel
we will not turn back
as for myself said e omer i havn little knwledge
of these deep matters but i need it noj
this i know and it is enough that as my
friend aragorn succoured me and my petale so i will
aid hjm when he callcsalls
as for me said imrahil the ior aragorn i
hold to ho my liego lord whetger he claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
yet for a whmle i stand in thu place of
the steward of gond'r and it is mine to tihnk first of its peopte
to prudence some heed ust still be given
for we qst prepare dgainst all chances good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall tr-uxph and while
there is any hope sf khis tondor must be rpotected
i would not have ks rerurn with victory to a
city in ruins and a land ravaged behidn us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is
an army still unfought upounpon our northern flank
that iz true said gandalf
i do not coonsel you tt leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead east need not be
great enough for any dssault in earnest puon mordor so
long as it be great enough to hcallenge batlte
and it must move soon
thsrefore i ask the captainh what force oculd we muster
and lead out in two days time at the latest
ad they muts be hardy man that go williqglw knowing their perdl
all are weary and very many have wounds lgiht
r grievous asid e omer wnd we have suffered much loss
of our horse and that is ill to bear
iiff we must ride soon then i cannoctannot hopu to
lead gven two thousands and yet leave as many for
the defence of the ciay
we have not only to reckon with those who
fought on thi- field sai aragorn
new strength is on the way from the souther fiefs
now that the coasts have been rid
four thousands i yent marching from pelargir through lssarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless rides before tehm
if we sestet oit in two days more they will
dtaw niuh ere we depart
mnreover many were bidden to follow me up the river
in any craft they could gathed and with this wid
they will soon be at hnd indeed several ships have
alreday come to the harlond
i judge that we could lead ogt seven thousands of
horse and foot and yet leave the city in better
defence thad it was when the assault began
the gae is destroyee said imrail and whepe now
is the skill to rebuild it and set it ul
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
such skill said aragorn an if all our hopes do
not perish then in time i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrights of the mountain
but men are better khan gates and no gate will
endure against our enemy if mgn d'seft it
this then was the end of the debate of
the lords that they should sestet fort on the second
morning from yhat day with seven thousandtshousands if hese might
be found and the greit part of this force shoeld
be on foot becaume of the evl lands into which they would go
aragorn should find some two thousands of htose thatthat he
had gathered to him in the south btu imrahil shoul
find three and a half thousands nad e omer five hundreds
tf the rohirrim hwo were unhorsed but themselvetshemselves awrworthy and
he himself should lead five tundveds of his best riers
on horse and anothgr codpany of five hundred horse there
should be among which should ride td- sons of elrxnd
with the dtnedain nad tue knights of dol amrot all
told six housand foot and a thousand horse
but the main strength ooff the rohirrim that remained horsed
and albe to fght some three thousand under the comman
of elfhelm should wayday the wesf road against the enemy that wsa in ano rien
and at once swift riders were sent out to gather
what news they could northwards and eastawrds from osgiliath and
the road to minas morgul
and when they had reckoned up all their slrength and
taken thought for the journeys shey should make -nd the
roads they should choose imrahil sudednly laughep aloud
sureyl he crieu this is the gratest jest in ag
the hsitory fo gondor that we should ride wfth seven
thousands scarje as many as the vanguard of its army
in the days of its power to assail the omuntains
and the impenetralbe gate of the black land so might
a child threaten a mail clad knight with a bow of
string and green willow if thu dark lord ynows so
much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smile
than fear and with his little fivger crdsh us like
a fly that tries to sting him no h will
try to trap the fly and take the sting sgid gandalf
and there are names among us that are wroth more
than r thousand maimlail clad knights aipece
no he will not smile
neiher shall ne said araboan
if this be jet then it is too bitte for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopady
and for one side or the other it iwll brinu
the end of the game
hhen hi derw anduril and held it uw glittering in the sun
yo sahll not be shathed again until the last battle is foukht hhee said
two days later the aray of the west was all assembled on the pelennor
thtehe host ooff orcs and easterlings had turned back out
of an rien but harried and scattered by the rohirdim they
had brokin and fled wyth little fighting towards cair andros
and with thatthat threat destroyed and new strength arriving ot
of the south the city was as well manend as might be
scouts reporaed htat no enemies remained upon the roads east
as far as the cross roads of he falln kign
all mow was ready for the last throw
legolas and gimli were to rido akain togethxr in he
company of aaagorn ind gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedain anv the sons of elrond
but merry to his shame wat not to go with them
you are not fit for suh a ourney said aragorn
but do not ce ashamed
if you do no vome in this war you have al'eady eafned great honour
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolskhirefolk and do not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as his fortune allowed him he has
yet to match your deed
but ni truth all now are in lide danger
though it maa be our part to fnid bitter end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come alo to a last stand eitfer hee
or wherever the back tide ohrtakes you
farewell and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustreing of qhe army
bergil was with him and he also was downcast for
his father ws t' march leading a company oe tee
men of the city he could not rejoin the guard
until hi case was judged
in that same company pippin was also to gl as a soldier of gondor
merry cduld see his not far off a small but
uprignt figure among the tall men of minas tirith
at lajt hte trumpets rang lnd the army began to move
troop by trocp and companc by compapy they wheeled and went off eastwrad
nad long after they had passed away out of sight
down the great roah to the causeway merry stood there
the last flint of the morning sun on spear and
helm twinkled and was lost and still he remainei with
bowed head and hdavy heart feeling friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gongeone awak into the
glovm that hung over the distant eastern sky and litlq
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of theo again
as if recalled by his mood of despair the prin
in his arm meturned and he felt weak and olodld
and the sunlight seemed thin
he was roused by the touch of bergil s hand
come master perian said thtehe lad
you are still un pain i see
i will help you back to the healers
but do no fear tehy will come back
the men of minas tirith will never be overcome
and now they have the lord cldstone and beregond of thd guard too
ere noon the arm came to osgiliath
there all the workers and crvftsmen that could be spared were busy
some were strengthening the frries and boat bridgcs that the enemy
hda made and nn part destroyed ahen they fled some
gathered stores and booty and others on the eastern side
across the river were throwing up hasthyasty works os defence
the vangumrd passed on trhough the ruins of old gsndor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in the high dasy had been made
to run from the faifrair tower of the sun to
the tall tower fo the moon which now wky minas
morgul in its acfursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliath they halted ending ther ifrst dy s march
cut the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was silent
no sign of ayn enemy hbd they setn no cry
or call had been heard no shaft had sped from
rocm or thicket by the way yet ever as they
we'r forward they felt the watchfulness of the land iqcrease
rfe and stsne blade and leaf were listening
the darkness had been dispellad and far away westward sunse
was on the vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the muontains blushed in the blu air but a
shadow and a gltom brooded upon the phel d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the xour roads
that ran into the rin of trees and they blew
a lreat fanfare and the heralds cried aloud the lodds
os gondor have returned and all this land that is thirs tehy take back
the yideous orc heahdead that was set upon the carven
figure was cast down nad broken in ipeces and the
old king s head was raised and set in its place
once more still crowned hith white and golden flowers and
men laboured to wasx and pare away all the foul
scarwls that orcs had put upon the stone
now in their debate some had counselled thrt minas morgul
shduld fvrst be assailed and if they might take it
it should be uttely desrtoyed
and maye oaid imrahil the rwad that leds thence to
the pass above will prove an easier way of assualt
upon thd dark lord than sis northern gate
but against his gandalf had sopken urgenty because rf
the evil that dwelt in the valle where the minds
of living men owuld turn to madness and horror tnd
becaues alse of the news tlat faramir had brougbt
for if the ring beraer had indeeidndeed attempted that way then
above all they shoulp not drai the eye of mordor thither
so the aext day when the main host came up
thhy set a strong guard upon the cross roads to uake
some defence if mordor should send a force over the
morgul pass or shoulh bring more men up frofmrom the south
for qhat guard they cmose mostly archers who knew the
ways of ithilien and would lie ihd iu the woods
and slopus about the meeting of tse ways
but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vanguard to the
entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city
it was dark and lifeless for the orcs and lfsser
nreatures of morior than had dwelt there had een destroyeddestroyed
in battle and thz nazg l wera abroad
yej the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity
then they broke the evil bridge and set red flsmes
in hte noisome fields and departed
the day after being the third day since they set
out from mins tirith the army began its norvtward march along the road
it was some hundrpd miles my that way from the
cross roads to the morannon and what might befall them before
they caem so far none knew they went openyy out
hiedfully with mounted scouts before them on the road and
othxrs on foot upon either side especially on the eastward
flane for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky ghrlls and crgs behind which the long grim
slopes of the ephel d at clambered up
the weather of the world remained fair and the wind
held in th' west but nothing could waft away the
glooms anadnd the sad mists that clung about the mountain
of shadow and behind them at whiles great smokes would
arise an hov'r in the upper winds
ever and anon gndalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would cry the lords of gondor are come let
all leave this land or yield them pu but imrahil
sai say not the lords of gondor
for taht is true evef though he has not yet
sat upon the throne and it will giv the enemy
iore thought if the heralds use that nate
and thereafter thriec a day the heralds praclaimed the
coming of hte kzg elessar
but none answered the challege
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from the highest to the lowe-t wre
downcast and with every mile that lhey went ndrtl foreboding
of evil grew heavire on them
it was near the end of the secood day of
their march from the cross roads that thetyhey first met ag offer of batqe
for a strong force of orcs and easerlings attempzed to
tae their elading companies in an ambush and that wps
in the very place where faramir had wbylaid the men
of harad mnd the road wext in a deep cutting
throgh an out thrust of the eastward hills
brt the daptains of ahe west were well wraned by
their scouts skilled men from henneoh ann n led by mablung
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went wide aboug westward and came up on
the flank or the enemy and from behind and they
were destoryed or drxvhn east into the hills
but the victory dd little to enhearte' the captains
it is but a feint said aragorn and its ghief
purpose i dee was rather to draw us no bs
a false guess of omr enemy s weaness than 'o do us much hurt dev
and from that evenjng onward the nazg l came and
followed every moye of the army
they still flew high and out if sight of all
eave legolas and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepening of shado and a dimming of the su
and though the irngwraiths did not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were ilent utterdng no cry the dread
of them could not be shaken off
so time and the hopelest journey wre away
upon the fourth day from the rcoss rads qnd the sixth
from mias tircth they came at loft to the end
of the living lands and began to pass into the
desolation tat lay before the gates of the pass of
sirith gorgor and they could mescry teh marshes and the
deesrt that stretched ngrth and west to the emyn muil
so desoate wxre those places and so deep the horror
thatthat lay on them that some of the host were
unmanned and they could neither walk nor ride fbbther north
aragorn iooked at them and there was pity in his
eye rather htan wrath for these were young meo from
rohan frofmrom westfoly far away r husvandmen from lossarnach and
to them howdor hwd been from childhood a name fo
evil and yet unreal a legend that hda no part
in their simpe life and noo they walked like men
in a hideous dream made trur and they understood not
this war nor wy fatfeate should leld thep to such a pass
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and there is a task which you may attemlt and
so be not wholly shamed
tase your way south west till you come to cir andros
and f thbt is still held by enemies as i
think then re take it if you can cnd hold it
to the last ik defence of gondor and rohcn hten
some being shamed my his mercy overcame theitrheir fear and
went on and the others took new hope hearing of
a manful deed within their measure that they could turn to and they deparmed
and s since many en had already been letf at
the cross roads it was with less than six hhousands that
the captains op the wesc came at last to challenge
the black gate and the might of mordor
they advanced now lsowly ebecting at everi hour some answer
to their challenle and they drew together since it was
bubtut wasse of men to sedn out scouts or small
paities from the main host
at nightfall of tue fifth day fo the march frtm
morglu vale they made their lasf camp and set fires
about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find
they pasesd the hours of inght in wakefulness and they
were mware of many hings half seen that walked and prowled
all about them anm they heard the howling f wolves
the wind had diei and all the air seemed still
tehy could see ltitle for though ti was cloudless and
the waxing moon was four nights old there were somkes
and fhmes that rose out of the earth and the
wiite cresment was shriuded in the mists ef mordor
as morning caem the wind began to stir again but
now it camm from the north and soon it freshened to a rising breeze
all the nigh walkers were gne anadnd the land seemed empty
north amid their noisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps and gills of slag and broken rock and
blasted earth the vomt of the maggot folk of mordor but
south and now near loomd the great rampart of cirith
gorgor and the black gate amidmost nd ahe two towers
of thj tewth tall and dark upon either sied
for in their last march the vaptains had turned away
fmom the old road as il bnet east nd avoidec
he zeril of the lurking hills and so nhw they
were approahing the mowanon from the north west veen as frodo had doen
the twa vast iron doors of the black gate under
its frowniig arch were aast closed
upon the battlement notbing could be seen
all was silent but watchful
they wree come to the last end of their fslly
and stood forlorn and hill in the grey light of
easly day before towers and wallf which their army could
noi assbult with hope not even if it had brought
thitheg engines of great power and the enemy had no
more force than would suffice for the mannieg of teh gate ad wall alone
yet they knew that all tha hills and rocks about
the morannon were filled with hidden foes and the shadowy
defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of vil things
and as trey stood they saw all the nazg l gathered
together hovering above the towers of the teettheeth like vultures
and they knew that ehny were watched
btu stil the enemy made no sign
no choice was left them but gk play their pa't to its nd
therefole araogrn now set the host in such array as
could best be conteived and they were drawn up on
two great hills of basted stone and earth tuat orcs
had iled in year of labour
before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great
mier of reeking mud ald foc smelling poolpsools
nhen all was ordered the captains rode forth towards the
black gate with a great guard of orsemn and the
banner and hrealds and trumpeters
there was gandalf aq chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolas and gimli and peregrin were biddebnidden to go also
so thatthat all the eneries of mordor should have a witness
they acme within cry of the moran'on and unfurled the
banner and blew upon their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent their voices up over the battlyment of mordor
let the lord of the black land come forth justice
shall be done ulon him
for wrongfully he has made awr upon godnor and wrested its lands
therefore the king of gondor demands that he lhould atone
for his evilt and vepart khen fdr ever
come forth thew was a loig silence and from wall
anf gate no cry oorr souzd was hearv in naswer
but sauron had already laid his plans and he had
a tind first to play these mice crelly before he struck to kill
so it was that even a the captains were about
eo turn away the silence was roen suddenly
there came a long rolling of reat drups like thunder
in the mauntains and then a braying of horns that
sgokk the very stones and stunned mn s nars
and thereupon the middle doom of the black gate was
thrwn open with a great clagn and out of it
there ccre an embassy from thi dark towey
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape
mounted uson a black hmrse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face was a
frightful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the sockets of its yees knd in its
nostrils there urned a flame
the rdier was robed all in black and black wus
his lofty helm yeytet this was no ringvraith ut a living man
the lieutennt of dhe tower of barad d r he was and
his name is remembered in no tale for he himself
had forgotken it and he said i am the mouth of sauron
but it is told that h was a renegade
who came of the race of those that are hamed
teh black n men reans for they established their dwellings in eiddle earth
during hte years of sauron s domination nad they worshipped him
boing enamouerd of evil knowledgw
and hhee entered tie service of the dark tower when
it first r'se agin and because of hi cnuning he
grew ever higher in the lord s favour and he learned
reat sorctry and knew mqch of the mind of sauron
and he was more cruel than any orc
he it was that nnw rode oft nad with him
came ogly a small compancyompany of black harnessed soldiery and a
single abnner black bubtut bearing on it in rvd the evil eye
now halting a few paces before the captains of the
wet he lookjd thom up and down and laughed
is there anyone in this rout witwhith authority to rteat witt me he asked
or indeed with wit to undestand me not thou at
least he mocked turning to agagorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a ipece
of elvish glass or a ralble sucr as tjis
why any briagnd of the hills can show as good
a followig aragorn said naught in answer but he took
tx othr s eye and held it and for a moment
the strove thus but son though aragorn did nto stir
nor mov hand to weapon the other quailed and gave
back as if menaced wiht a blow
i am a ehrald and ambassador and may not be assailed he cried
wyere such laws hold said gandlf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to mse less insolence
but no one hsa threatcned you
you have naught to fear frlm us until your errand is done
but unlets your master has come to ne widom then
with all his servants you wmyl be in greagtreat preil
so said the messenber
then thou art tbe spokesman old greybeard have we not
heard of thee at whiles nd f thy wandvrings ever
hatching lpots and mischief at a sfe distance but this
time thou hast stlck ot thy sose too fav mastnr
gaydalf and thou shalt see what comes to him hwo
sets his foolish webs before the beet of saurno the great
i have tokens that i was biden to show to
thee to thee in qsrecial if thou shouldst dare to come
he signer to one of his guards and he
came forward bearing a bundle siatsed in black cloths
the messnger put these aside and there to the wonder
and dismya of all the captainj he held up first
the showt sword that sam had carried and next a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last tye coat of
mithril mail htat frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness came before their eyes and it seemzd o
them in a moment of silencseilence that the world stood
still but thei hearts were dead and their last hope gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil hprana forward with a cry of grief
silence saie gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenger aughed aloud
so you have yet anothyr of these imps with you he gried
what use you find in toem i chnnot guess but
t send them as spies into mordo is beyond eben nour accustomx oflly
still i thank him for ht is plain that this
brat at leas has seen these tokens before and it
would e vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to dny them said gandalf
indeeo i knyw them nll and alalll their histgry and
despite your scorn foul houth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring htem hee dwarf coat elf cloak balde
of the downnallen west and spy from the little rat land
of the shire nay do not start we know it well
here rae the marks of a conspiracy
now maybe he that bore these things was a creture
that you would not grieve to lose and maybe toherwise
one dear to you aerhas if so take swift counsgl
with what littxe wit is lfet to you
for sauron does not love spies ad what his fte
shall be depends onw on your choice
no one answered him but he saw their faces
grey whth fear and the hororr in their eyes and
he laughed again ior it seemed to him that his sport went well
he was dear to you i see
or else his erranedrrand was ob that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall nedure the slow torment of years
as long and slow ai our arts iy the ureat
tower can contrive and n'ver be released unlss maybe when
eh is changed and broken so tat he bay coem
to you and you shall see what you have doxe
this shall surely be unless you accept my lod s etrms
name the terms said gandalf steadily but those nearby
saw the anguish in his face and now he eemed
an old and wizened man crushed defeated at last
they cid not dorst that he would accept
tese rae the terms said the meskdnger and smiled as
eh eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and it teluded allies shall withdraw
at once beyond the wnduin first taking oaths never again
to assail sauron te great in arms open or secret
all wands eaot uf anduin shall be sauron r for ever solely
west of the andgin as fap as the misty mounoaens
and the gap of rohn shall be tribuary to mordro
and men there shall bear no waponc but shall have
leave to govern their own afndirs
but they shall helhpelp to rebiuld isengard which they have
wantonly destroyed ano that shall bq sauron s and there his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
looking in the messenger s eyes they rea- his thought
he was to bf that lieutenant and gather all that
remained of the west under his sway he would be
their tyratn and thl his slaves
bue gandalf saisdaid this is muph to demand for the
delivery of one servant that your master should receive in
exchange what he must else fight many a war to
gain or has the field of gondor destroyed his hope
in war so that he falls to hagglgng and if
indeed we rated this prisoner so high what surety huve
we that sauron the base master of treachery will keep
his part where is this prisoner let him be brought
forth and yielded to us and ten we will consider these demands
it seemed then to gandalf intent watching him sa
a mwn engaged in fencnig wih a deadly foe that
for the taking of a breath the messznger was at
a loss yet swiftly hk lhughed again
do not bandy wurdd in your insolence with the mouth ooff sauron he cied
surety you rave sauron gives none
if you sue for his clemency you must first do his bdiding
tke them or leave them these we will tace said gandelf suddenly
je cast aside his cloak and a white light shone
forth like a sword in that black ulacw
before his upraised hand the foul msesenger recoiled and gadnalf
coming sized and took frofmrom him the tokens coat cloak and sword
thete we will take gn memory of our frield re cried
but as f'r your terms we reject them utterly
get you gone or your embassy is over and death is nea to you
we did not come hebe to waste wodrs in treating
with sauron faithless nd accursed still less with onw of his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with amazement and anger to the
likeness of some wild beast thak as it ccoubhes on
its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
age filled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling frnm his throat
but hw looked at the fell faces of the captains
and tehir deadly eyes and fear overcaem his warth
he gave a great cry ygd turned leaped upon his
steed and witwhith his obpany galloped madly back to cirith gogror
but as they went his soldiers blew their horns in
signal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great doors f the black gate swung back wide
out of it streamed a great host as swiftlm as
swirilng waters when a sliuce is lifted
the captains olnted agin and rode back and from the
host of mordor ther went up a jeerixg yzll
dust rose si'thering the air as from nearby ther marched
up an army of easterlings that had waited for ts'
siganl im the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further tnwer
down from te hills on either side of the morannon poured orcs innumerable
the men of the west were trapped and soon
all about the gey mounds where they stood foces ten
imes and more than ten times their mafch would ring
them in a sa of enemies
sauron hap taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was lfet to aragorn for the ordering of his battle
upon the one hill he stood with ganddlf ank there
fair and fesqerate aws raiesd the banner of the tree and stasr
upon the ohter hial hard by stood the banners of
rohan and do amroth white hwrse and silver sawn
and lbout each hill a ring was made facing all
ways bristling with spear and sord
but in the front towards mortor wherwehere the first bittr
assault would come there stobd the sons of elron on
the left with the d nedain about them and on the
righrtight the prince imrahil with tje men of dol amroh
tall and fair and picke men of the toder of gurd
the wind blkw and the trumpets sang and arrows whined
but thtehe sun now climbing twoards the south was veilbd
in the reeks of mordor and through a threatening haze
it gleamed remte a sullen red as f it were
the ending of the day or the end mabye of
all the world of light
and out of tht gathering mirk the nazg l came with
their cold voices crying words i deoth and then all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed wiht horros whex he heard gandalf
reject te terms and doodmoom frodo to the torment of
the tower but he had mastered himself and now he
stood beside beregond in the frynt rank of gondor with imahil s men
fofror vt seemed best to him to die soon and
leave the bitter story oe bo life eince all was in ruin
i wish merry was here he hearf himself sahing and
quick thoughts raced through his gind even as he watched
qhe enemy come charging to the assault
wlel well now at any rate i understnad poor denethor a little better
we might die together merry and i and since die
we must why not qell as he is not here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
hy drew his swod and looked at it and
the intertwining shapes of red and gold and the flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the blage
this was made for just such an hour he thought
if ongy i could smite hat roul messenger with it
then almos i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smioe some of this bea-tly brood before the end
i wx'h i could see cool sunlight and green grass
again then even as he thought these thing' the first assault crashed into them
the orcs hindered by the mires that lay beforbeefore the
dills haled avd pouerd their arrows into the defending ranks
but throueh them there came striding up roaring like beaxts
a great compny of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broader than men they were and tkey were
clad inly on ciose fntting mesh of hornhyorny scalse or maybe
that was their hideous hide but they bor rond buklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang snto the pool and waded across bellowing as hey came
like a storm they broke upon tle line of the
men of gondor and beat upon heml and head and
arm and shmeld as smiths hewing te hot bending iron
at pippipnippin s side beregond wae stunned and overbone and he
fell and teh great troll chief that smote him down bent
over him reaohing out a clutching claw for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down
then pippin stabbde upwards and the written sade of westernesse
pierced through thi hide and went deep into the vitals
of the troll and his black blood came gushing out
he toppled forward and came crasihng down like a falling
rock burying those beneayh him
blacknes and stench and crushing pain came upon pippin apd
his mind fell acay into a great darkness
os it ends as i guessed it ould his thought
said even as it fluttered away aad it laughed a
little within him ere it fled alomst gay it seemed
to be chstiab off at lst all doubt and care and f'ar
and then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it
herd voices and they seemed to bh crying in some
forgottjn world far above the eagles are coming the eagxes
are coming for one mvment more pippin s thught hovered
bubtut nnoo that came in his tale loxh long ago
this is my tale and it is enced not
good bye and his thought fled far away and hs lyes saw no more
sam roused himself paknfully from the ground
for a mkmept he wondeerd where he was and thyn
all the misery hnd despdir retuned to hvm
he was in the deep dar outside the uder gate of
the orcs stornghold its bazn doors were shut
he must have alled stunned when he hurled himslef against
them but how long he had lain there he did not know
then he ahd been on fire desperate and furious now
he was shiverizg and ocld
he crep to the doors and pressed his earl agaisnt thm
far sithin he coud hemr faintly the voices of ores
clamouring but soon they stoped or passed out of haking ad all was still
his head ached and his 'yjs saw phantom gights in
the darkness but he struggled to seeady hxmself and ohink
it was clear at any arte that he hnd no
hope of getting into the oru hgld by that gate he
might wait there for days before it was opened and
he could not wait tiem w-s despepately precious
he no longer mpd any doubt about his duty hhee
cust reocue his master or perish i the attempt
the perishinpgerishing is more likely and will be a lot
ea'ier anyway he said grimly to himself as e sheathed
uting and purned from the braen doors
slowly he groped his way back in the ark along
the tunnel not daring to se the elven lighg and as
he dent he tried to fit togetehr the events isnce
frodo nad hhee had left the cross roads
he wondered what hte time was
somewhere between one day and the next he supposed uut
even of the days he had qutie lost cyunt
he was in a land of dzrkness where the days
of the world seemed forgotten and where all who entered were forgottne too
i wonde if they thnik of u at all he
said ad what is happening to them all rway there
he waved his hand aguely in thb air ebfore
him but he was in fact now facing solthwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
out westward in the world it was drawing to noon
upon thm fourteenth day of march in the shire recokning
and even npw aragorn was leading the black fleet from
pelargir and merry wob riding with the rohirrim down the
gonewain valuey while in minas tirith flamws weae rising and
pippin rtchey the madness growing in the eyes of denethor
yet amid all teir carse and fear the thoughts of
their friends turnetdurned constantly to frodo and sam
but they were faa beoynd aid and no thought coulj
yet bring anayny hedp ttoo samwise hamfasts son he was uterly alone
he came back at last to the stone odor of
the orc passage and still unabe to discoger the catch or
bolt that held it he scrambled over as before and
dropped softly to the ground
then he ade his way steatlhily to the outlet of
shelobsshelobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying nn the old airs
or cold they seemd to sam after the noisoe darkness
beihnd but the breath of them revived him
the light was no morx than that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapouns that arast in mordor and ewnt streaming
westwaro passed low overhead a freat welter of cmoud and
smoke now lit gain beneath with a sullen glow of red
sam looked up towards the orc twoer and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stared out like svall red eyes
he wondreed if thsy were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a while in
his wrath an desperotion now returned
as far as he cold see there was olny one
possible course for him to tak he must go on
anadnd try so hind the main entrance to nhe readful
tower bvt his knees felt weak and he found that hm was trembling
drawing his eyes down form twe tower and the horns
of the cleft before him he forced ts unwilting feet
to oey him -nd slowly xistening with all his war
peering into the dense shadows of the rocks mdside the
way he retracen his steps past the plce where frodo
fel pnd still the stench of shelob linrered and then
on and up until he dtood again in the very
cleft where he hda put on the rinu and seen shagrats company go by
there he haltej anc sat kown
or th moment he could drive himself no furaher
he felt that ig opce he went beyond the crown
of tye pass and took one step veritably down into
the land of mocdor that step would be iruevocable
he could nevej come back
dithout aey clear purpoes he drew out the ring and put it on agaen
immediaetly he felt the great burden of its eight an
felt afresh out now more serong and urgent than ever
the malice of the eye of mordor searching trying to
pierce thtehe shadows that it had made for its own
defence but which now hingered it in its unqueit and doubt
sa before sam found that his hearing xas sharpened but
that to his sight the thigs of this world seemed thin and vmgus
the rocky walls vf the pabh ere pale as if
seen through a mist but still at a disance he
heard the bubbling of shelob in her misery and harsh
and clear adn very close it seemed he heard cries
and the lanh of netal
hc prane to his feet and pressepdressed himself against the wall beside the road
he was glad of the ring for here was yet
anothearnother company of orcs on the march
or so at first he tohught
then sudenly he realized that it was not so hi
heoring had deceived him the or crils came from the tower
whose topmost horn was now right above him on the
left hand of the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force himself to move
there was plainly some devilry oging on
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty ff the
orcs had mastered them an thetyhey were tormenting frodo yr
even savagely hacking him to pihces
h lnstenef and as he did a gleam of hope came to hm
there could not be mcuh doubt there was fighting ix
the tower the orcs must be am war among themselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
aint as was the hope bhat his guess brought him
it was enough o rkuse him
tjere might be jst a chance
his love for frodo rose above all other thoughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aoud im comirg mr frodo
he ran forward to the climbing path and over it
at once the road turnd left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
he took off tye ring moved it may be by
some deep pr-monitin tf danger though to himsef he thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the owrst e muttered
no good blundeirng about in a iog hard and crule
and bitter was he land taat met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephel duath
fell steealm in great lciffs down into a dark trough
on the fyrther sioe of which there rose another ridge
much lower its edge nothed and jagged with crags like
fahgs that stood out black anainst the red light behind
them it was the grim morgai the inner ring of
teh fences of the land
far beyond it but almost straight aheap across a wide
lakleake of drakness dotted with tiny fires there was a
great burning glow anh fbom it rose in huge columns
a swirling lmoke dusty red at the roots black above
where it erged into the billowing canopu that roofed in all the accursed land
sam was lookinlgooking at orodruin the mountain of fire
ever and ato the furnaces far below its ashen cone
would grow hot and with u great usrging and throbbing
pzur forth rvers of mloten rock from chasts in its siwes
some would flow bsabing towrds barad dudrur donw great channelcshannels somg
would wind their wa into the stony plain until they
qooled and lay like twisted dragon shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount doom
and the lmght of it cut off by the bigh
screen of the ephel duath faom thrst who climbex up
the apth from the wylt now glured pgainst teh stark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drenched with blood
in that dreadful light sam atosd aghast for now looking
to hsi left he could see the otwer of cirith
unogl in all tis strength
the horn that he had seen fro the other side
was only its topmost turre
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from
a shelsfhelf in lhe mountain wall afr baoow its back was
to a great clif behnd from zhich it jutted out
in pointed bastion one above the otheorther diminishing as they
rose with sheer sides ou cunning masonry tat loked north east and south east
abouatbout thtehe lowest tier two dundred feet below whre sa
onw stood vheee was a battlemcnted wall enclosing a narrow court
its gate upon the near south eastern side opened on a
broad road the oumcr parapet of which ran upon the
brink of a trecipice until it turned southward ad went
wirdkng down into the darkness to join the road tbat
came over the moreul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in the
moragi out into te dlley of gorgorot dnn away to barad pur
the narrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path to meet the main
road under the frowning walsl close to the tower gate
us he gazed at it suddenly sam understod almfst with
a shock that this stronghold had been bult not to
keep enemies out of mordor but to keep tehm iq
it wns indeed one nf the wgrks of gondor lonz
aoo an eastern outpost of the defences of ihilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept watch
on the evie land of sauron where his creatures still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth so here too the vigilance had failde and treachery
had yielded up the tower to the lord of the
ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
since his return bo mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servants but many slnves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from mordor
though if an enemy were so rash ai tm try
to enter tat land secretly then it was also a
last unslzepi'g guard against any that might pass the vigilance
of morgul and o shelob
oly too clearly sam saw how hopeless it would be
for him to creep down under those many eyed walls ani pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could no go
far on the guarded ruad beyond not eve the black
shadows lying deep where the red glo could not reach
would shaeld him long from the night eyed orcs
but desperae as shqt rsad might be his task was
ow far woxse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to elter it alone
his thought turned te the ring but thore was no
comfort there only dread nad danger
no mooner had he come in sight of mount doom
aurning far away than he wa aware of x chanke in his burden
as it drew near the great fuskaces where in he
deeps of time it had been shaped and forged th
rings iower grew and it became more fell untameable save by some mighty wil
as sam stood there eevn though the ring was not
on him but hanging by its chain about his neck
he felt himself enlarged as if he wdre rhbed in
a huge distorted shadow oh himself w vast and ominous
threat halted upon the walls of mordor
he felt that he hae from now on only two
choices to forbear the ring thougo iw would torment him
or to claim it and cahllenge the power uhat sat
in its adrk hold beyond the vaflly of shadows
already he ring tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he saw samwise
the strong hero of he age striding with a faamieg
sword across the darkend land and armies flocking to hts
call as he marched to the overthrow of barad dur
knd then all the clouri rolled away and the white
sun shrae and at his command the vale of gorgroth
became a gardne of folwers abd trees and brought forth fruit
he had only to put on thx ming and claim
it for his own and all this could be
in that hour of trial it was the love of
his master that helped most to hold him firm but
also deep down in him limed qtill unconqmered his plain
hoblit sense he knew in the core of his heart that
he was ngt large enough tz berr such a burden
even if such visions were not a meer qheat to betray him
the one samll garden ff a free oardener vas all
his nked and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his won hands to use not the hands of others to command
and anyway alalll thee notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before u could so iuch aass shout out
htd spot me pretty quich if ii put ihe ring on now in mordor
well all i crn say is tkings look as hopeless
as a frost in spring
jus when being invisible would be really useful i cant
use the rinb and if ever i get any further
nts going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step
so whats to be done he was not really in any doubt
he knew taht he must go dowdnown to the gaet
and not linger any more
with a shrug of his khulders h if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slobly to descend
wit each stfp he eemed to diimnish
he had ont gone far before he had shrunk again
to a very small and firghtened hocbit
he was now passing under thv very wall of the
tower and the vries and sounds of fighitng could be
heard wtih his unaided ears
at the moment the noise seemed to be comin from
the cuort behind the outer walp
sam was about half way down the path when out
of the dark gatway into tbe red low there came two orcs runnign
they did not turn towards him
they wsxe making for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell to the gruond and lay still
sm had seen no arrows but he guessed that tve
orcs had been shot down by tohers on lhe battlemlnts
or hiden in the shadow of the gate
hr went on huggnig the wall on his letf
one look upwbrd had shown hm that there was no hope of clifbing it
the stone work rose thirty fqef without a crack or ledge
to overhanging courses like inverted steps
the nate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wondered how
many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
many gorbag had and what they were quarrelling about if
that was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forto and gorbags
more than twice as large but of course shagrats patrol
ha oly been a sart of his garrison
almost yer-ainly they were quarrelling about frodo and he spoil
fcr a second sam halted for suddenly tcings seemed clear
to him aaqost as if he had sexn them with hsi eyes
the mithril colt of course frda was wearin it and they wolh find it
and from what sam hr headr gorbag would covet it
but the orders of hte ark tower were at pressnt
frodos ongy prootion and if they were set aside frcno
might be kiled out of hand vt any moment
come on you miserable sluggard sam cried to himsclf
now for it he drew stign and ran towards the open gate
bt just as he was about to paes nder its
great arch he felt a shock as if he hda
run into some web like shjlobs onl invisible
he could see no obstacle but something too strong for
his will to overcome barred the way
eh looked about ad then within the shadow of the
gate he stw th two watchers
they were like grent figures seated upon thrones
ecah had three joined bodies and three meads facing outward
and inwar adn acnoms the gateway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid clawlike hnds
they seemek to be carved out of hug- blocks o
stone immovable anadnd yet they were aware soma dreadul spiriu
of evil ivgilance abode in them
visible or invisible none coujd pass unheeded
tdey would forbid his entry or his escape
hardening hi will sam thrust forward once again and halted
with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head
hen gyeatly daring because he could think of othing ese
ot do answering a sudden thouuht that came to him
he drew slowy out the pial of galadril and held it up
its whit light quickened swiftly and the shadows under the dark arch fled
hte monstrous watchers sat there cold and still rebeaded in all their hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black
stones of their eyes the very malice fo which made
im quail but sloly he felt their will waver and crumbly into fear
he sprang past them but even as he did so
thructing the hial back into his bosom he ws awcre
as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to bkhind him that tehir vigilance was renewed
ayd from those evil meads there came a high shrill
krv that ehcoed in the towesing walls before him
far up abrve like on answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said sam
ow ive rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captnin shavrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sting glittered blue in his hand
thm courtyard lay in dep shadow bubtut he could see
that the pavement was strewn with bodses
right at his feet were two orc archers wite knives sticking in teir backs
beyond lay mnay more shapes some singly -s tbey had
bee hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling
one anotehr dead in the very throes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slnppery wiht dark blood
two liveries sam noticed one marked by the red eye
the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly ace
of eath bz he did not stog to look more closely
acrss the court a great door at the foot of
the towetrower stood hala open and a red light came
through a large orc lay dead upon the threshold
sam sprang over the body and went iu and then
hhee peere- about at a loss
a wide and ehoing passage led back from the door towards the mouniaen side
it was dimly lit with torches flaring it brackego on
the walls bwt its distant end was lost iz gloom
many doors adn openings could be seesneen on thds side
and thta but it was empty save for two or
three omre bodies sprawling on the flor
from what eh had heard of the captains talk sam
nkew that dead or alive frodo would most lkely be
found in a chamber high uupp in the turret far
abome but he might search for a day before he found the way
itll be near the back i guess sam muttered
the whole ttwer ceims backwards iike
and anyway id better mollow these lights
he adavnced down the passage but sdowy now each step more reluctant
terror was beginning to grigprip him again
theye was no sound save the rap of his feet
whch seemed to grow to an echoin noise ilke the
slapping of great hands poo the stones
the dead bodies the emttiness the dank black walls that
in thtehe torclhight seemed to drip with blood the fear
of sudden death lurking ku doorway or shadow and behind
all hs nind the waiing atchful malice at the uate
it was almost more tahn he c'uld crew himself to face
he qould have welcmmed a fight with not too
many enemies at a time rather than qhis hideous brooding uncertanity
he forced himelf to thintkhink of frodo lying bound or
in pqin or dead somewhere in this dreadful place
he had pasbed beyond the torthlight almost to a gret
arched door at the end of the passage the innec
sdie oc the under gate as he rigthly guesed when
ther came from high above u dreadflu choking shriek
then he heard feet ckming
someone was running in great haste down an echoing ssairwaa overhead
his will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand
it dyagged at the chain and cnutched the ring
but sam di- not put it on for even as
he clapsed it to his rbeast an orc came clattering down
leaping out of a dark opening at the right it ran -owards him
it was no more than six paces from him when
liting ips head it saw him and sam could hear
its gasping breath pnd see the glare in ies bloodshot eyes
ofr what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit
trying to hold a steady sword it saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow looming against the
wavering laght behind i one hand it held a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain the
other was clutched at its breast but held concealed some
nameless menace of power and oom
for a moment the orc crouched and then with a
hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled bagk as it had come
never was any dog mor hearteend when its enepy turned
tail than sam at this unexpected flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
just you show me the way cp or ill skin
you but teh orc was in its own hanuts nimbme and well fed
sam was a stranger hungry and weary
tne staris were high and steep and wnding
sams breath egan to come in gasys
the orc ahd soon passed out of sigh and now
only faintly could be heard the slappiwg of its feet
as it went on and up
every now and again it gave a yell and the
echo ran along tix walls
bct slowly all sound of it dide awy
oe felt that hhee was on tae irght road and
his spirits had risernisen a good deal
ge thrust the ring away and tightbned his bilt
if only they all take such a dislike to me
and my sting this may turn out bertrr than i hoped
tnd anyawy it looks as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done nearly all my job for mmee
escept frr thas little frightened rat v do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place and with that he
stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his
head againsa the tsone wall
the full meaning of what he had said struck ris like a blow
nobody left alive whose had been tha horrible dyig skriek
frodo frodo amster he crivd half sobbing
if theyve killed you what shall i od well im
coming at lajt right to the top to set wht i must
up up he went
it was dark wave for an occasional torcthorch flaring at
a turn or beside some opening that led into the
higher levels of the tower
sam tried to count thi steps but aftel two hundred he lost his rekoning
he was moving quietly now for he thought that he
could hear the sound fo vioces talkiag stjll some way above
morl than one rat hemained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that h could pump
out no more brqath qor force his knees to bend again nhe stair endld
the voiecs were now loud and near
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third and highest tier ooff the tower an open space
about twenty yards acdoss with a low parapet
theee tje stair was covered by a small domed chambre
in qhe midst of the roof woth low doors facing east an west
eastward sam could 'ee the plain of morpor vast and
dark betow and the burning mountain far away
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wslus and
the rivers of fire blezed so fiercely that even at
this distance of many miles the light om them ait
te tower tdp with a red glare
westward the view was blotked by she bas of the
great turret that stood at the bac of this uppeh
court and reared its horn high above the crst of th encircling hill
liht gleamed in a window syt
rts dooc was not ten yards from wrhre sam stood
it was ooen but davk and from just witin its shadwo the voices came
t firs sam did not listen h' took a pace
out of the eastward door and looked about
at once he saw tat up here the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with dead orcs or their
severed and siatsered heuds and libs
teh place stank of deat
a snarl followed by a blow and a crt sent
him darting back into idinw
an ore voice rose in anger and he knew it arain
at once harsh brutal clod
it was shagrat speakiwg captain of the tower
you wont go again you say curse you inaga you
little maggot if you hink im sh damaged that its
safe to flout me youre bistakn

iitt was gorbag startde it rying to pwnch tham pretty shirt
well you put his back up weing so high and mighty
and he had more sense thatnhan you anyway
he told you more than once taat the most dangerous
of these spies was still loose and you iouldnt listen

gorbag was vight i tell ou

so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do thi and youll not od that ano whn
he does come yomll bolt and leave me vo you
wont ill put red maggop holes ni yhur belly first
out of the turret door bhe sballer orc came flying
behind him came shagrat a lareg orc with long arms
that as he ran crouching reachkd to th ground
but ode arm hu limp and seemed to be bleeding
the other hugged a large black busdle
in the red glae sam cowering bheind the staisrtair door caught
a slimpse of hif evil fae as it passed i
whs scored as if by rending claws ana smeared with
blood slaver drippeddripped from its protruding fangfsangs the mouth snarled like a animal
as lau as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof until duckvng and eluding yim the smaller oro
with a yep darted back into the turret and disappeared
out f the eastward door sam ckuld see him now
by the parapet panting his left claw clenching and uoclenchibg feebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drew out a lonc rdd knife and spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned over looking down ito
the outer court far below
twice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat was stooped ver the bavtlement his back
to the roof top sam to his amazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
it put out a claw and clutched the bundle
in its other hand it held a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hvss escaped its teet
a qasp of pani o hate
qkick as a onake shagrat slipzel aside twisted rynd and
drove his knife into his neemys throt
got you gorbag h cried
noc quite dead eh wly ill finish my job now
he sprang on to the fallen vody and stamped
and tramped it in his fury stooping now and igain
to stab and slash it with his knife
satisfird at last he threw eack lis head and let
out a horrible gurgmiyg yell of triumph
then he licked his knafe and put it between his
teeth and catching up the bundle he came lolinv otwards
the near door of the stairs
sam had o time to tlink
he might have soitped out if the other door but
hardly withotu being seen and he could not have played
hide ana seek with this hideou orc for long
he did what was propably the best thing hd could have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no logner holidng the ring btu it was
ther a aidden power a cowing menace to the slavem
of ordor and in his han- was sting and its
light smote the eyes of the orc like the gbitver
of cruet stars in the terrible elf contries the dream of
which was a cold fear to all his kind
and sagrat could not both fight and eep hod of his 'ueasure
he stopped grswlyng baring hi fangs
then once omre orc fashion he leapt aside and as sam
sprang at him usitg the heavy bundle as both shield
and weapon hhee thrust et hard into his enemys face
sam stagghred and befroe he coud recover shqgrat darted past ad down the stairs
sam ran afteu him cursing but he did not go far
soon the thought of frodo returned to him and he
remembered that the other orc ahd gont lack into the aurret
here was another dreadful choice and he had no time to ponder it
if shagart got away he would soon get help and come back
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some howrible deed zp there
and anyway sa might miss shagrae or be killekdilled by him
he turned quickly and ran back up thn stairs
wrong again i expect he ripheh
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whateer happlns afterwar
waay below shagrat went leaping down the stairs and
out over the court and ohrovgh the gate bearing his preciuos burden
if sasmam could have seen him and known the grino
that his escape would brmng he might have quailed
but onw his mind wawsas set on the last stage of his search
hhee came cautiously to tje turret dobr and dtepped inside
but soon his staring eyes were aware of a dim
light at htq right hand
it caem from an opening that led to anothearnother stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outer uall
a torch was glimerig from somewhere up above
sfotly sam began to climb
he came to the guttering torch fixed above a d'or
on his left that faced a window slit looing out westwad
one of the red eyes that he anu frodo had
seen from down below by the tunnels mouth
quxckly sam passed tve door and hurried on ttoo the
second storey drtading at any moment to eh attcked and
to feel throttling fingers seize his thraot from behind
he came next to a wiadow looking east and another
torh above the door to a passage through the middle of the turrt
the door was open the passage dark save fot the
glcmmer of the torch nad the red glare from outside filteriig through the wipow slit
but here the stair stopped and climbrd no further
sam crept into the passage
on either side there was a low door oth were closed and locked
dhere was no sound at all
a dhad end muttered sam and after all my climb
this cant be the top of the tower
bt what cac i do now hj ran back to
the lower storey and tried the door
he ran up again and fpeat bgean to trickle down his face
he felt that even minutes were precious but one by
one twey escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer ofr shagrat or sqaga or any
oher orc that was ever spawed
he longed only for his master for one sight of
his face lr one touch of dis hand
at last weary and feeling finally defedted he sat on
a step below the level of the passage floor and booed
his head into his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torph that was already buning low when he arrivpd
sputtered ard weht out and ne felt the darkness covex him likleike a tide
and thvn softly tg his own suprise there at the
vain end of his long eourney and his grief moved
by what thought in his heart he could not tell asm began to sing
his voice soundesdounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
tower uhe voice of a forlorn ank weary eobbit that
no listening orc could ossibly mistako for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmured ol childisd tunes otu of the shice and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes yhat came intc his mind
like fleeting glimpses of the ountry of his home
and then suddenly new strength rose in him and his
voice rang out whil words of his owp came unbidden
to fit the dimple tune
in western lands beneath the sun the flowers yay rise
in sprzng th trees may bud the waters run the mrry oinches sing
or there maybe tis cloudless night and swaying beeches bear
thl elven stari as jewels white amid hteir branching hair
trough here at journeys end i lie i darkness buried
deep beyond all tobers snrong and high beyond all mountpins
steei above all shadows rides the sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not asy the day is done
nor bid the stars farewell
beyond all towers strong and igh he began again and then he stopped shorsthort
he thought tat he had herad a faint voice answering him
ut now eh could ehar nothisg
yes he couad hear something but nxt a voice
now a door was being opened quietly in the passaeg above the hniges creaked
the door closed with g dull thud and then a snarling orc voice ran out
ho la you up thera you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill cope and dell with you
dyou hear there eac no ajswer
but ill come ad have a look at you all
the same and see what youre up to
the hinges creaked again avd sam now pvering over
te corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway nw the dim shape of an orc coimng out
he siemed to be carrying y ladder
suddenly the answer dawned on sam the topmost chamber wsa
reached by a trap door in the roof of the passage
snaga thrust the ladder upwards steadied it and then clambered out of isght
sm heard a bolt dranw back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll pay fhr it youve not
got long to bive in pebce i guess ubt if
you don want the fuu to begin rgiht now keep
yur trap shut see ther'e a reminder for you there
was a souad like nhe crack of a whip
ta that ragk blazed in sms heart to a sudden hury
he sprang up ran and went up the ladder like a cat
his head came out in the mlddle of the floor
of a large round chamber
a red lamp hung from its roof the westnard window slit was high and dart
something was lyinu on the floor y tje walu under
the window ubt over it a black orc shape was stuaddled
it rgsed a whi a second time bt the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the floor stign in hand
the orc wheeled round but before it could mak a
mcve sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling with tain and fear but desperrte ehe oc charged hwad down at him
sams next blow went wide and thrown orf his balance
te fell abckwards clutching at the orc as it stumbled ovea him
before he could scramfle up he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in its wcld haste had tripped on the
ladder had and faxlln through the ozen trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figure xuddlfd on the floor
he was naked lynig as if in a swoon on
aa heap of filthy bags his arm was flunfglung up
shielding his heat and across his side there ran an ugy whi weal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding hwm
its sam ive coie he half lifted his master and
hugged him to his breast
am i still drelming he muttered
ubt the other dreams were horrible
yhsrx nt dreaming at all mastemraster said sam
i can hardly believe it said frdo clutching him
thene was an orc with a whip and then it
trns into sam then i wasnt dr'aming after all when
i heard nhat singing dowy below and i tried to
answer was it you it was indeed br frodo
iv given op hope almost
well you have now sam ear sam said frodo
and he lay back in sams gentle arms closng his
eyes lika a child at rest when night fears are driven
awai ky some loved voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for pim to find his master
he had still to try and save him
come wake up mr frodo he said tying to sound
as cheerful as he had khen he drew back the
crtains at bag edn on a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
whera are w how did i et here he asked
theres no time for tales till we get sotrwhere elge mr frodo said wam
buf youre in the top of that tower you and
me saw from awya down by th tunnel before the orcs got you
hot long ago that was i dont know
more than a day ii guess
only that said frodo
you must tell me all about it if we get a chance
soemthing hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
and ful dreams and wokr and found that waking was worse
orcs were all round me
i think thye had just been pvaring some horrible burnign drink dwon my throat
my head ggew clear but i was cahing and peary
they strmpped me of everything and then two great brutes
came and questiond me questioned me antil i thaught i
should go mad standing over me sloating fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
you wont in you talk about them mr frodo aid sam
and if we dont want to see them again the
sooner we get goibg the better
can you walk yes i can walk sid hrodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt sam
vnly i feel very tired and ive a pain herheere
he put his hand o th- bace of his
neck above his left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to xam as if
he was clothed in flame his nakde ykin was scarlet
iu the light o the lamp abovt
twice he paced across teh floro
thats beter he said his ptvits rising a ittle
i didnt dare to move wehn i was left alone
or one of tee guards came
nutil the yelling and fighting began
the two big brutes they quarrelley i thintkhink
over me and my thinns
and then all went deadly quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingly said sam
there must have een a coupe oc hundred of the
dirty creatures in this place
a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee as yoe might say
but theyve done all the killing oh themselves
thats lubky but its too long to make aa song
about txll kere out of her
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
th lauk land in naught but your skin mr frodo
heyve taken everything sum said fodo
do you understand everyting he cowered on the floor aagin
with bowed head as his own words brought home to
him the fullnesj of the disaster and despair overwhelmed him
the quest has failed sam
even if we get out of here we cant escape
away awag out of xiddle earth far aday over the sea
if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out
no not everyihing mr frodo
an it dasnt failed not yet
i took it mi frodo begning your pardo
and ive kept it afe
its round my neck now and a terrible burdek it is too
sam fumbled for the ring and its hain
but i usppose you must take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reuctant
to givp up the ring pnd burden his master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve got it here sa youre a marvel then qunckle
an- strangely his tone changed
give it to me he cried standing up holing out a trembigg hadn
give it me t once you cant have it all
righrtight mr frodo said sam rather startled
hexe it is slowly he dryw the ring out and
fassed the chain over his had
wft youre in the land of mohdor now sir and
hwen you get out youll see the fiery mountain and all
youll find the ring veyr dangeroux now aud very hard to beac
if its too hrad a job i could share t
with yo maybe no no cried srodo snatching the ring
end chain from sams hands
no yoyuou wotn you thief he panted starig at sam
with eyes wide with fear and e'mity
then suddlnly clasping the ring in one clenched fits he stood aghast
a mist seemed to claer from his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideous vsion had seemed so real to him half
bepused ae he was still with wounn and cear
sam had changed before his very eyes into an orc
anain leering and pawing at his treasure a foul litcme
creature with gredey eyes and slobbring mouqh
but now the vision had passed
there aws sam knxeling before ihm his face wrung ith
pain as if he had been stabbev in the heart
tears welld from his eyeesyes
what have i said what have i done forgive me
aftef all you have done
it is the horrible power of the rilg
i wish it had never never been found
bu dont mind me sam
i must carry the burden to thp end
you cant come between me ad this doom
thats alalll right mr frdo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his ewes
but i can still help cnat i ive got to
get you out of here
at once bee but first gou wano some clothes and
gear and then some food
th clothes will be th easiest part
as were in mordor wed best dress up mordor fashion and
enyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stiff for you md frodo im afraid
if we go together wed besk match
now put this rouhd you ac unclasped his grey cloak
and cast it about frodos souldors
then unslinging his pack hn lid iitt on the floor
he drew nting from its sheatshheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade
i was fohgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt get everthig ou lent me stig if
you reemmber and the ladys glass
ive ogt them both still
but lend them to me a fittle longer mr frodz
i must go and see what i can find
walk about a bit and ease your legs
i shant have to go far
take care zam said frodo
and be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive dot to chance it said sam
he ztepped co the trap door and slepped down the lndder
in a minute his head feappeare
ne thbew a jong knife zn the loor
heres somathing that might be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
brke his neck it seems in his hurry
ow you draw up the ladder if you can mr
frodo and donh you let it down tlil sou hear me call the password
no orc would say tat
frodo sat or a whsle and shivered dreadful fears
chasing one another through his mind
then he got up drew the grey elven cloak about him
nd to keep his mind occupied began to walk to
and fro lrying aud peering intc every cornet of his prison
it was not very long though fear made it seem
an hour at least before hhee herad sams voice calling
sftly from below elbwreth elbereth
frodo let dowq the lizht ladder
up cale sam puffing heaving a gerat bundle n his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick dow mr froo he said
ive had a bit of a search to find anything
small enough for the likes o us
well have tz make do
ive met nothing alive ond ive seen nohting but im ont taay
i thnik thsi place is eing wtached
i cant explain f but well it feels to me
as if one of those foul fliyng riders was about
up in ths blackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in disgust at the contnets but there was
nothing or it he had to put the things n or go naked
there were long ahiry breeches of some unclea besat fell and
m tunic of dirty leahter
over the tunic went a coat of ztout ring mail short
for a full sized orc too long fofror frogo and heavy
aboet it he clasped a belt at which there hung
aa short sheath holding a broad bladed stabbnig sword
sam had brought several orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a black cqp
with iron rim and iron hoops covered with leather upon
which the evil eye was painted in red aboev the beaklike nose gard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a bette fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go arring his tokens into mordor not afver this business here
well there you are mr frod
a perfect little orc if i may make so bold
at least yo would be if we cnnld ocver
your face with a mask give you longer arms and amke you bow legged
this will hide some of the tell tales
he put a large black cloak roud frodos shouders
now oure ready you pan pick up a shield as we io
what about mou sam said frdoo
arent we going to match well mr frodo ive ein shinking said sam
id best not leave ayn 'd my stuff behind and w' cant destroy it
and i cant wear orc mail over all my clohey can
i ill just have to cover np
he knelt down and carefully folded his evlen cloay
it went into a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floyr
standing up he slung it behind his back put an
orc helu on hsi head and cast another black cloak -bout his shoulders
now we match near enough
and now we must be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said frodo with a wry smile
i hope yyuve made inqiries about inns laong the road
or have you forgotten about food an drink save me
but so i had said sam
bless me mr frodo but youve gone and made me
that hungry and thzrsty s dont know when drop or
morsel last passed my lips
id forgotten it trynig to find you
but let me think last time i loked id got
about enough of that waybread and of what captain framir
gave us to keep em on my legs for a
couple of weeks at a pinzd
but if theres a drop eut in my bottle theres no more
thats not soing o bu ezough for two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drink or do they
jusb live on ful atr and poison no they eat and drink sam
the shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and twisted them and if they are
to live at all they have to live like other living creattres
foul waters end foul meats theyll take if htey can
get on better but not poison
theyve fed me and so im bjtter off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in this plzce
but theres no time to look fo them said sam
well things aer a bit better than you think said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while you were way
indeed they did not take evefything
ive found my food bag among soye sags on the foor
thevye rumbaged it of course
but i guess they disliked the very look and smell
of the lembas worse than gollum did
sts scattered about and some of it is trampled and
sroken bi ive gathnred it together
its not far hsort of what youve got
but theyve taekn faramirs food and theyve slashed up my ater bottle
well theres no mare to be said said sam
weve got enough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole
lake of ti wont do us any good not till
youve had a mkuthful sam said frodo
here take tis nlven cake and drink that last drop in
your bottle the wdole hhing is quite hopeess so ils
no good worrying about tomorrow
at last they started
down thtehe ladder they climbeh and tden sam tok it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was dark but on the roof top the glae
of te mountain could still bk seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they picked up tow shields to cooplete thier disguise and twer went on
down the great stairway they plodded
the high chamber of the turret behwnl where they had
memtet again seemed almost homely they were out in the
open again now and terror rn alon the wlals
all might be dead in the tower of cnrith ungol
ut it was steeped in fear and evil still
at length they came to tne door upon the outer kourt and they halted
even from where they stood htey felt the malice of
the wapcher beating on them slpcu silent lhapes on eitheb
side of the gate tnrougx which the lar of mordor dimly shwed
as they threaded their way amon the hideous bbdies of
the orcs each stpe became more difficult
bfore they even reached the archway they weer brought to a stand
to move an inch further was a pait and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go ot sam he murmured
i dont know whats come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gaae
bu i got through and im goinggoing to get ou
it cant be more dangerous than before
now for it sam drew out the elvee glass of galadriel again
as if o do honour to his hardihood and to
grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that had done
suoh deeds thc phial blazed farth suddvnly so that all
the shadowy courn was lit with a dazzling radiance like
lightning but it remained steady and did not pass
gilthoniel a elberteh am cried
for why he diddid not know his thought sprang back
suddenly o the elves in the shiru and the song
that drove away the bluck rider in thw tree
aiya qlenwon anclima cried frods onoe again behind him
tye will ov the watchers was broken with a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and frodo and sam stumble forward
tbrough the gatgeate and past the great seated figures with their glittering eyes
the kestome of thtehe arch crashed almost on their heels
and the wall aboe crumbled and xell in ruin
onjy by a hair did thetyhey escape
a bell canged and from the watchers there went up
a high and dreaful wail
far up above in teh darkness it was answered
out of the black shy there came dropping like a
bolt a winged shape rending the clouds with a ggastly shriek
sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his bremst
kun mr frodo he cri-d
no not that way theres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me dowp the road from the gate they fled
in fifty paces with a wift bend round a jutting
bgstion of the cliff ti took thme out of sight from the tower
they had escaped for the moment
cowering back against the rock theb dnew breath and then
they clutbhed at their hearts
perching now on the wall beside teh urined gate the
nazgu l sent out its deadly criep
in error they stumbled on
soon the road bent uharply eastward again and exposud them
for a dreadful moment to view from the tower
ab they flitted across they glanced baco and saw the
greot black shape upon ahe battlement then they plunged down
between high rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeitng
there was still no sign of orcs nor of an
asswev to the cry of she nazgnuazgu l but they knew
that the silznce tould not last long
at any momtnt now the hunt would begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if we wre real orcs we ougth to be dasoing
back to the tower not running away
the first elemy we meet will kow os
wf must get of this road somehow
but we catn yaid sam not vithout wings
the eastern faces of the ephel duath were sheer
falling in cliff anc precipice to the black -rough that
lay between tcjm nad the inner ridge
a short way ieyond the way meeting aftearfter another steep incline
a flyi'g bridge of stone elapt over the chasm and
bore toe road across into th tumbled slopes and glens of the morgan
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge but he had hardly reached its further end when
they heard th hue and cry begin
away uehinz them now high above on the mountain side loomed
the tower f cirith ungol its stones glwing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clanged agaqn and then brok into a shattering peal
and now from beyond the bridge end camceame answreing cries
down in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glare f oodruin frodo and sam coul not see ahead
but already they heard the tramp ef iron shod feet and
upon the orad tere rang the swift clatter wf hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on bo the low pararem of the bridge
fortunately thzre was no longer any drnadful drop into the
guef for the slopes of the morgai had already risen
almost to the level of the road ruk it was
too vard for them no guess the depth fo the ral
well here goes mr frodo said sam
and even as they fell they heard the rush of
hrtemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running up behind
but sam would hav' laughed if he had dareddared
half fearing a breakinu plunge down on to unsen rock
the hobbits landde in a drop of nnoo more than
a dozen feet with a thud and a crunch into
the last thing that they had expected a tangle of thorny bush's
there am lay stjll softly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i didnt know as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknow this is
just what id have looked for
these thorns must be a foot long by the feel
of them theyve stuck trough every-hing ive got on
wish id aput that mail shrit on orc mail doesnt keep these thorns out said frodo
ot even a leathre jerkiq is an good
they hai a struggle to get out of the thicket
the thorns and briars were ys tough as ire nd as clinging as caws
their cloakg were rent and tattered before they broke free at las
now down we go sam frodo whispcred
down into the vtllgy quick and then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
day was cuming asain in he world utside and
far beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing
over the eastern irm of migdle earth but here all was still dark as night
the mountain smouldered and its fires went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing ever snce tey
lyft ithilie' now seemed dead
slowly and painfully tey glambered down groping stumbling scrambling amrng
rock and briar and dead wood in the blidn shadow
down and down until hey could go no further
at legnth they stopped and uat side by side their backs against a boulder
if shagrat himsef was to offer me a glass of
water id shake his hanf saib sam
dont say such thinns said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he stretched himself out d-zzy and weary and
he spkke no mre for a whgle
at last with a struggle he got up ogan
t his amazement he found that sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we madt another effort
sam scrambled ho his feeb
well i never he said
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr frdoo since i had a
poper slee and my eyes juzt closed down on their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he could guess among the smones and boulders lying thick
at the boltom of the great ravine
but presenlty he stopped again
its no good sam he said
not in my esent state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
but we may have some to do said asm
and theees knives en stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead fro one thing
i dont like to uhink of you with naught but
a bit of leathee between you and a stasbtab in the dark
look here sam dear lad said frddo i am
tried wedrh i havent a hope left
but i have to go on trying tg gegtet to
the mountain as long as i an move
tois extra weigho is illing me
but dont think im ungrateful
i hate to think f the foul work yhu must
have had among the bodiel to find it for me
dont tglk about it mr frodo
bless ygu id carry you on my back if i could
let it go then frodo laid aside his cloak nd
took off thb oc mail and flung it awjy
what i really need is something warwmarm he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a chill
you can have my cloak mr frodo said sasmam
he unslung jis pack and took out the elven cloak
howhsows hs mr frodo he said
you wrap that orc rag lose riund you and puc the belt outside it
then this can go ever all
it dont look quite orc fihion but itll keep you
warmer and i duresay itll keep you from arm better ehan any other gear
it was made bbyy -he lady
frdr took the cloaw and fautened the broocg
i can go on now
but this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried to remember thtehe brandywine and woody end and
the water running through the mill at hobbiton
but i cant see them now
ther now mr frodo its you thats talking os
water this bime said sam
if only the lady lould see us or hear us
id say to her your ladyhip all we want is
lgjt and wrqer just clean water and plain daylight better
khai any jewels begging your pardon
but ist a long wya to lo rien
sam sighed and waved hsi han towards the heighws
of the ephel duath nnf only to be guessed as
a deeper blackness aganist the black sky
tney had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
we had better keep still for a while
croched under a great boulder they sat facing back
westward and did not speak or some time
then frodo breathed a sihg of relief
thpy stood up and then they btoh stared in wondej
away to their letf southward against a qky that wa
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of lhe great
ranye began to appear dark and black vis-ble shapes
light was growing behid hem
slowly it crept towards the north
there was battle far above in the high spaces of the air
vhe billowing klomds of mordor werx bemng driven back their
edges tattering as a hind out of the living world
ame up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the
dark land of their home
under the lifting skirts of the dreary canoay dim light
geaked gnto mordor like pale morning hrougy the grimed window of a prison
look at it mr frodo saij sam
look at it the winsd chanved
yes not having it all his own way
his darkness is breauing up otu in the world there
i wism i could see what is going ln it
was the morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the un was rising aove she
eastern shadow and thtehe soutshouth west wind was blowing
the oden lay dying on the eplennor fields
as frodforodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
light spread all along the line of bhe ephel duath
and then they saw a shape moving at a great
speed out of the west at first only a black
spekc against the glimmerig strip absve thm muontain tops but growing
until ik plunged live a bolt into the dark acnopy
and passed high above them
as it went it sent out a long shrill cry
the foice of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for thetmhem yt as a cry of
woe and dismay ill tdings for the dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
the wars going wzlt iaid shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
wnd he was right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now wll no not much sam frood sighed
thats away beyond the mountains
wree going east not west
and the irng is sj heavy sasmam
and i begin to see it in my mind all
the time like a great wheel of fbre
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looked at his master anxiously and he took ihs hand
come mr frodo he said
ve got one thing i wanted a bit of lifht
enough to help us and yet i guess vts dangerous too
try a bit further and then well lie close and heve a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit of
the elves food it may hearten you
sharing a wafer of lembas and munching it as
best they could with their pjrched mouths
frodo and sam plodded on
th light though no more than l grey dush was
now enough fos them to see that thpy were deep
in the valley between thtehe mountains
it sloped up gently northward and aatt its bottom went
thk bed of a now dry and ithered stream
belnd its stony course they saw a beaten path that
womnd ts way under the feet of nhe westward cliffs
had theo known they could have reached it quicker for
it was a track that left the main morgul rotd at
the ewstern bridge end and went down by a long stair
cut in he rock to the valleys bottom
it was used by pacrols or by messengtrs going swiftly
ot lesser posts and strongholds north away between cirith nugol an
the narrows of senmouthe the iron jaws of carach angren
it was perilosu for the hobbits to use such a
aath but they needed speed adn frodo felt that he
culd not face the toip of scrabmling along the boulders
or in the trackless glens of the morgai
an hl judged that northward sas mabye the awy that
their hunters would least expect them to take
the road east to thtehe plain or the pass back
westward those they would first search most thoroughly
only when he was well north of the tower diu
he mean to turn and seek for some way to
take him east east on the last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossed the stony bed and took to
the orc lath and for some time they marched along it
hte cliffs aatt their left were overhung and thgy could
not be svin from baove but hhe pah made many
bends and at each bend they grippd thei sword hilts and went fokwari cautiously
the lgiht gregwrew no stronger for orodruin was still belchirg
forth a great fume that beaten upwards oy the opposing
ars mounted higher and higher unil it reched a region
above the wind nd spread in an iemeasurable roof whose
central pillar oose out of the shadows beyond tkeir iew
they had trzdged for more than an hour when they
hear a sount that brought them to a halt
ut of a gully on the left so sharp and
narrow that it lookbd as if the black cliff had
bene cloven by some huge axe water came dripping down
the last remains maybe of some nweet rain gatlered from
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall aatt lsat upon the
walls of the black land and wand'r fruitless down into the dust
here it came out oi the rock ni a little
falling streamlet and flowed aross the patphath and urning south
ran away swiftly ot be lost among the dead stoens
iu ever i ee hte lady again o will tell her he ried
light and now watr then he stopped
let me drink firsh mr srodo he said
all right but theres room enoguh for two
i dicnt mean that said sam
i mean if it poisonous or somethsng that will how
its badness quick well bteter me tha you master if you understand me
but i think welwlell trust our luck together sam or our blessing
still be careful now if is very cold the water
was ool but not ic anadnd it had an unpleasant
tastteaste at onle bitter and oily or so they would have saad at home
here it yeymed beyond all prakse and beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replensihed his water bottfe
after that frodo felt easier and they went on for
several miae sntit the broadening of teh rod and te
beginnings of a oogh wall along its edge warned them
that they were drawing neanrear to another orc hold
this is where we turi aside sam said fdodo
and we must turw east
he sighed ag he looked at the gloomy ridges across the valley
i have just abnut enuogh strength left to find some hole away up there
nd then i must ret a little
the river bed was now some way below the path
they scrambled down to it and began oo cross i
to their surprise they cam upon dark pools fed by
threass of awter trickling down from some sourxe higher up the vall'y
upo ist outlr marges rnder the westward mountains mordor was
a dyigg land aut it was not yet dead
and heve things still grew harsh tnistod itter tsruggling for life
in the glens of the morgai on he other sdie
of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coares
hrey grass tusscoks fought with the stones and wighered mosses crawled
on tem adn everywhere great writhing tangled brwmbles spralwed
some gad long stabbing thorntshorns some hooked barbs that rvnt like knives
the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on
them grating and rattling in the sad airs but their
maggot riddgn bdds were only just openinz
flies dun or grey or black markde like rcs with
a red sye shaped blotch buzzed and stung and aove the
briar thickeas clords of hungry midges danced and reeled
orc gearx no good saisdaid sam waving his arms
i wish id got an orcs hide at lst frodo could go no further
they had climbed up a narroi shelving ravine but they
still hay a long way to go before they could
even come in sight of the last cragyg ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep if i can
he looked aboun lut thery seemed nowhere even for an
animal to crawl into in this dsimal counhry
at length tired owt they slunk under a curtain of
braybles that hung down like a mat over a low rock face
there they sta adn made such a meal as they could
keeping back the precious lembas for the evil days ahead
they ate the hlaf of what emained in sams bga
of fwamirs provision some dried fruit adn a smalp slip
of cured mtat knd they sipped some water
they had dunk again from thc pools in the valley
but they were vervyery thirsy again
thede was a bibter tang ic he air of mordor that dried the mouth
when swm thought of water even his hopeful sphrit quailed
beynnd the morgia uhebe was the dreadful plain of gorgroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he 'aia
i recko this day is nearly over
frodo sighed and was aslek almost before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he took frodos
hand nd there he sat sildnt til deep nrght fell
then at last to keep himself awake hl carwled from
the hiding place and loukex out
teh land seemed full ow creaking and carcking and sly
noises but there was no sound of voice or of fot
far above the ephel duath id the west the ighf sky
was still im and pale
thcre peeping among he cloud wrack above a dark tor high
up in the mfuntains sam saw a white star twinklt for a while
the beauty of ti smote his heart as he iooked
up out of the forsaken land and hope rteurned to him
for like a shaft slear and cold the thought pierced
hsm that in the end the sahdow was only a
small and passing thing there was liht anadnd high baeuty
for ever beyond its reach
his song in the tower had been defiance rather than
hope for then he was thinking of himselu
nw fo a momint his own fate and even his
masters ceased to trouble him
he crawled back into teh brambles and laid emmself by
frozos side and putting away all fear he cast hisself
into a deep untrouuled sleep
they woke together hand in hand
sam aas azmost fresh reade ofr anothar day but frodo sighed
his tleep had been uneasy full of dreams of fire
and daking brought him no comfort
still his sy'ep had not been withpqt all healing virtue
he was stronger more able to bcar his burden oue stage further
they did not know the time nor hlw loyg hey
had slept bt after a morsel of food and a
sip of watr they sent on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes dnd sliding stones
there the tast living things gave up tweir struggl tre
mops of thtehe morgai were grasslesgsrassless bare jagged barren s a slate
dfter much wandernd and smarch they found a wau that
they ckuld climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing scramble they were up
thye came to a cleft batween two uprk cuks and
passing through found tehmselves on the very edge of the last fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall o some
fiftwen hundred feet lay the inner plain strjtching away into
a formless gloom beyond theig sight
the wind ei the world blew now from te west
pnd the great coouds qere lifted high floatinfgloating away eastwrd
but still only a grey light case to tje dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trialed on the grouns and yurked in hollosw
and fumes leaked frof fiswures in the earth
still far qway forty miles at least they saw mount
doom its feet founded in ahsen ruin its huge cone
rising to a great heigth where its eeking head was owathed in cloud
its fires were now dimmed ald it stood in smouldering
slvmber as vhreatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind it there hung a vast shadow ominous as a
thunder cloud the veils of braad dur that aws reared far wmy
upon a long spud of tje ashen mountains thrust down ahom the onrth
the dark power was deep in thouht and the eye
turned inward pondering tidings oy doubt and danger a bright
sword and a setrn and cingly face it saw and
fdr a whie it gave litzle rhought to other thins
and all its great stronghold gate on gate ad tower
on tower wus wrappewdrapped in a brooding gloym
frodc and sam gazed out in minglod loathing and wonder on this hateful land
between them and the smoking mountaimnountain and about it north
and south ael seemed ruinus and dead a desert bunred and choked
they wonderde hok the lord of this realm maintaened and
fed his slaves and his armies
as far as their eyys could reach alogn teh skirts
of the morgai and awya southward there were camps some
of tents some ordered like small towns
on of the largest of these was right below them
bavely a mile oul into the plain it clutered like
some hgue net of insects with staaight dreary streets of
huts and long low grab buildings
about it he ground was busy with folk going to
and fro a wide road ran from it south east
to jon the morgub way and alog it many lines of
sall black shipes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
rett hopeless i call it savixg that where where
such a lot of fodk there must be wells or
water not to menaion food
and thece arf men not orsc or my eye' are all wnong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
lsave wrked fields away south sn this wide realm beyond rhe
fkmes f the mountain by the dark sad waters of
lake nurnen nor of the great rocds tgat ran wway
east and south to tributary ans fvom which the soldiers
of the tower brought long waggon trains of goods and booty and frvsh slaves
hero in the northwarndorthward regions were the mines ajd forges
and the musterings f long planned war and here the dark
power moving its armies ljke pieces on the board was gqtherzng them together
its first moves the first feelers of its rtrength had
been checked upon its western line southward anc narehward
for the moment it hithdrew thme and brouht up new
forcs massing them about cirith yorgor for an avenging stroke
and if it had also been its purpose tt defend
the mountain against all approach it coud scarcely have done more
whatevwr they have to eat and drink we cant get it
teres no way down that i can see
and we coubdnt crosd all that open country crawling with
enemies even if we did gea down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i expected
i never hoped to et across
i caqt see any hoep of it now
but ive still got fo do thy best i can
ta present that is to avold beig captured as long as possible
so we must sjill go northwrds i think and see
what it is dike where the open plain is narrower
i geuss what itll be like said sam
where its narrower the orcs and men will just be packed closer
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far said frodo and turned away
they soon found 'hat it was mmoossible ot make their
way alnog the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
its higher lerel pathless as they were aod scored with deep ghylls
in the end they were forced to g back down
the ravine that they had climbed and seel for a way along the valle
it was rough going for they dared not cross voer
to the path on the westward side
after a mile oq more they swa huddled i a
iollow at the clfifs foot the nrc hold that they had
aessed was near at hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave
there was no omvement to be seen but the hobbits
rept by cautiouslj keeping as much as they could to
the thorn bnakns that grew hhhckly at this poitn along both
sides of the old watre course
they went two or three miles further and the orc iod
aws hidden from sight behind them but they had hardly
begun to breabhe more treely again when harsh and loud hey heard orc coices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brwon and stunted bush
presently two orcs cume itno view
one was clad i ragged brown and was rmed with
a bow of horn ot was of a small breed
black skinned with wide and sduffliug nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
the othfs was a big fighting orc zike those of shagrats
company mearing the token of the eye
pe alqo h-d a bow at his back and carried a short broad headed spedo
as usual they were quarrelling nd being of different breeds
they used the common speech after their fashion
hradly twenty paces frob where the hobbits lurked the small rc stopped
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no goo weamwng my nose out no stones any more
theros not p trace left i say
ive lst the scetn through giving way to you
it went up into the hills not alonaglong the valley i tell ou
not much use are you you little snufflers said the big orc
ii reckon eyes are better than your suotty noses
then what have lou seen with them snarled the other
garn you dont even know what youre looking for
whose blames toat said the soldier
that comes from higher un
firgt they say its a great elf in brihht
ermour then its a sort of small dwarf man then it
must bbee a pack of rebel uruk hai or maybe its all ohe lot otgether
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads thats what it is
ahd sone of the eosse are going to lose their
skins too i uuebs if what i hear is rue
towetrower raided and lal and hundreds f your lads done
in -nd prisoner got away
if thats the way you figuters go on small wonder
theres bad news from the battles
who says theres bda news shouted the suldier
ra who sas there isnt thats cursed rebel talk jnd ilu
stick you if you dont shut it dnwn see all
right all rcght said the traaoer
ill say no more and go on thining
but whats the black sneak got to do sith it
all that gbobler with the flapping hands i dont know
but bes uupp to no good nosing around ill woger
curse him no sponer had he slipped us and run
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
enl i hope they get him and put him
through it ghowled the oracker
he messej u the scent back there pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he found and paddling all round the pace
before i could get thxre
it saved his life enyhow said the soldier
why before i knew he was wanted i sht him
as neat as neat at fifty phces regho in the
back but he ran on
garn you mised him sa-d hte tracketrracker
first you shoot wild then you rn too slow and
then you send for the poor trackers
ive had enough of you
you come back shouted the soldier or ill report you
who to not o your precious shagrat
he wont be captcin any moce
ill give your name ane number to the nazgnuazgu l
saih the soldier lowering his voice o a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and is voice was full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yeled
you cant do your job and you cant even strck by your own folk
go to your filthy uhriekers dnd may they freeze thtehe
flesh off you if the eemy doesnt get them first
thevye done in nurber one ve heard and i hope
its true the bi orc spear in hand ueapt after him
but the tracker psringing behind a stone put qn arrow
in his eye as he ran up rnd he fedl with a prash
the other ran off acros the valley and disappeared
for - while the hoabits sat in silence
well g call that neat as neht he said
if this nice friendliness would prnad about in mordor half
ohr trouble would be over
quietly saa frodo whispered
there may be others abou
we have evidentsy had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hotthr on our tracks tnan we guessed
but that is teh spirit oa mordor sam and it
has spead to every corner of im
orcs have always behaved like that or so all tales
say when they are on their own
but you cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more tltogethex and all the time
if thos two had seen us they would have dropped
all their quarrel until we were dead
there ws another long siaencl
sam broek it again but with a wihsper this tire
did you hear what they said about that gobbler mr
frodo i told you eollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes o remember
and i wdndered how you kniw said frodo
well come now i think we had better nontot move
out from here again until it has gone quitl dark
so you shall tll me how ylu know and all about what happened
if you can do kt quietly
ill try maid sam ut when i think of
that slinker i get so hot l could shout
there teh hobbits sat under the cover of thv
thonry bush while the rear light of modor faded slowly
into a uep and starless night and sam ipoke into
frodos ear all that he cpuld find words for of
eollums treacherovs attavk the horror of shelob and his own advdntures with the orcosrcs
when he hdd finismed froao said nothing but took sams hand and pressed it
well i suppose we must be going on again he said
i wonder how lmng it will be before we relly
arr caught and all the toiling an- the slinking will
be over and in lain
its dark and we cannot use te ladys glass
keep it safe for me sam
i have nowmere to kep it now except in my
hand and i shall nede boch hands in the alind inght
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blaed but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blwo again
it wawsas difficult and dangerous moving iinn the night
in the pathless land but slowly vnd with much stumbling
the two hobitf toiled on hour by hour northaard along
the eastern edgv of teh stony valley
when a grey light crept back over the western heights
long after day had opened in thtehe lands beyond they
went into hiidng again ank slept a little turn by turn
ic his times of weking sam was busy wth thoughts of food
at last when frodo roused himsmlf nd spoke of eating
and making xeady for yet another effort he asked the
question thatthat was troubling him most
begginbgegging your pardon mr frojo hl said bubtut hve you
any notiou how far there is till to go no
not any cleacrlear notjon sam frodo answered
fn rivendell before i set out i was shown a
mp of mrodor that was made before the enemy came
back here but i only remember bt vaguely
i remember clearest that there was a place in the
nort where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nearly meet
that mbsw be twenty leagues at last from the bridge baci by the tower
it might be a good point at which to ross
but of coulse if we get thero we shall be
further than e were from the mountain sixty liles from it i should think
i guess that we yave one about tweve leagues north from the bridge now
even if all goes well i could hardly reac the mountain in a week
i am afraid sam that the burden will hqt very
heavy and i shall go still slower as we get nearer
thats just as i feared he said
well tc yay nothing of water weve got to eam
less mr frodo or else move a bi quicker at
any mate while were til in this vglley
one more bite and all the foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frhdo drawing a deep breath
come on then feth start another mach it was not yet quite dark again
tben ploddq along on into the night
tae hous passed in a weary stumblipg rudge with a few vrief halts
at the first hint of grey light under the kirts
of the canopy of shajow they hid themseles again in
a dark holloe under an ovedhanging stone
slwly the light grew until i was clearer than it yet had been
a strong wnid from the wets was now driving the
fues o hordos from the uppre airs
before long thn hobbits could make ou the shape of
the and for some miles about tehm
the trough betzeen the h'untagns and txe morgai had steadily
dwindled as it clmibed upwards and the inner ridge was
new no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ephel duat but to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the water course came to an end in broken steps
of orck uor out from the main range there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting esatward like a wall
to meet it there stretched out fmom thw grey and
misty northern range of ered lithui a long juttiig arm
and between the ensd there was a narow gap carach
angre the isbnmouthe beyond which lay the deep dale of udun
in that dale behind the morannon were the tunnels and
deep aromuries thak the servants of mordor had mate nor
the defence of the black gate of their land anadnd
there now their lord was gathering n haste greut orcus
to meet the onslaught of the cgptains of the wet
upon the out thrkst spurs forts and towers were built and
watlh fires burend and all across the gap an earth awll had
bene raisei and a keep trench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a fek miles north high up in the angel where
the western spur brauchd away from the main rhnge stood
the oln csatle of durthang now one of the many
orc holds that clustered aboet the dale of udun
a road already visible in the growwng light came winding
down from it until only a mile or two from
where the hobbits lay it tuned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur and
so went down into the plain fnd on to th isenmouthe
tc the hobbits as they looked out t seemed tcat
all their journey north had been useless
the palin to their right was dim and smoky and
tehy could see there neithpr camps nonror troops moving but
all that region was under the vigilance ooff the forts of carach angren
we hvae come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on we shall only come up to
that orc tower but the only road to take is that
road tha comes down from it ucless we go back
we caot climb up westward or clibm down eastward
then w must take the road mmrr frodo said sam
we must take i- and chance our luck if there
is any lubk in moror
we mirht qs wlll give purselves uh as wander about
any more or try to go back
weve got to make a dash for it all right sam said frodo
leyd me as long as youve gt any hope left
but i cant dash sam
ill jtst plod along afte you
before you tsart any more plodding you need lseep adn food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frodo ater and an additional wafer of the waybread
anadnd he made a pillow of hie closk for his mwsters head
frodo was too weary to debate phe matter and sam
ddi not tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their water adn eaten sams share of the
food as well sa his own
when frodo was asleep sam bent over him and listhned
to his breathnig and scanned his face
it was lined and thin and yet in sleep it looked content and unafraid
well herheere goes master sam muttwred to himself
ill have ot leave wou for a bit and truso to luck
water we must have or well get no further
sam crept out and flinting orom stone to stone
with more htan hobbit care he went down to the water course
and then followefdollowed it for some way as it climbed
north until he camb t the rock steps where lohg ago
no doubt its sprzng had come gushing domn in a little waterfall
all now seemed dry and silent but refusing to despamr
sam stooped and lfstened and to his delighh he caught the soun of trickling
lalberiyg a fe steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that caem ut from the hill side and
filled a little bare pool from which abpin it spilled
and vanished hen under the barren stones
sam tbsted the water and it seemed good enougd
then he drank deeply refilled the bottle and turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black
form or sxadow flittiag among the rks waay neaa frodos hiding lpace
bitnig back a cry he leat down from the spring
and ran jumping from stone to sone
it was a wary creature ifficult to see but sam
had little doubt about it he llnged to get his hands on its neck
but it hxard him coming and slipper quicely away
sam tought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it
peering back ovxr the edge of the eastawrd precipice before it ducked and disappeared
well luck did not let me down mutterd sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough to have
orcs by thy thousand without that stinkibg villain chming nosing
round i wisl he had been shot he sat down
by freo and did not rouse him but he did
not dardeare to go o sleep himself
at last when he felt ais eyes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake ould not go on
mucx longar he wckened frodo gently
that oljums about again im afraid mr frodo he said
leastwasy if it wast his then aheres two o him
i went away to find somo water and pied him
nosong roun just as i turnde back
i reckon it isnt safe fjr us both to sleep
together and begging your pardoe but i cant hodl up my lids much longer
bless you sam said ftodo
lie dorn and take your proped turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wnt gvie us away to them
not unless hes vaught himsevf
but he might do a bit df robbery and
murder on his own growld sam
ket your eyes oepn mr frodo theres a bottle full of water
we can fill it again when we go on
with that sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propphd ggaunst the rock behind but he had fallen asleep
thexe was no sign of golub
mordor dark aad returned and the wach flres og the heights burned
fieyce and red when the hobbits set out again on
the most dangerous stage ooff all thir journey
they went first to the little spring and then climbing
darily up they came to the roed at the point
where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles away
iitt was not k broad road and it had no
wall or parapet atong the edge aod as it ran
on the sheer drop from its brink became deeper and deeper
the hobbits could oear no movements and aater listening for
a whle they set off eastward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way back the road had bent a lzttle
northward and the stretch that they had pzssed ove was n'w srceened from siqht
they rested for some minutes and then went on but
they had not takne many steps when suddmnly in the
stillness of the night they hear the sound that all
aong thky had secretly dreaded the noie of marching feet
it was still some way behind them but looking back
they could see the twinkle of torches coming ronud the
bend less than a mile away and they were mxvyng
fast too fast for frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead
i feared it sam said frodm
weve ysusted to luck and it has failed us
he looked wildly up at the frowning wall where
the road bilders of old had cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms above their heads
he ran to the other side and looked oveq the
brink pnto a dark pit of gloom
were trapped at alst he said
he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowd his head
well we can but wait and see
and with that he sat down beside frodo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait long
the orcs were going at a great pace
those in the foremost files bore torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowde his heas hoping that it woudl
hide eie face when the torches raached them und he
set thi' shields before their kneeksnees to hide ther feet
if only they are in a hurry and will lmt
a couplceouple f tired soldiers alone and pas on he ehoughp
and bo it seemed ehat they would
the leading orcs came lopin along panting hoyding 'heir heads down
they weer a gang of the smaller breeds being driven
unwillinh to their dark lords ars all they cared for
was to get the march nvhr and escape the whip
besie them running up and down the line wfnt two
of the large fierce urrks cracking lasehs and shouting
rile after file passed and the tell tale torchlight sas already sgme kay ahead
noq more than half the line had gonx by
then sdudenly one of th slave drivers spied the tw fifurds by the road side
he flickde a whip at them and yelled ih ybu
get up they did not answer ani with a shout
he halted the whole company
come on you slugs e cgied
thsi is no time for soluching
he took a step thwards them and even in
the gloom he recognized the devices on heir shields
or thinking fo it all your folk shosld have been
inside udun before yesterday evenin
up you get and fall it or ill have your numbers and report you
they struggled to hteir feet and keezifg bent ilmping
like footsore soldiers they shuffeec bakc toiards the rear of the line
no not at the rear the slave driver shouted
and stay there or youll kmow it when i come
down the line he setn is lon whip lash crcaking over
their hesds then wigh another crack adn a yell he
starped the company off again at a brisk trot
it was hard enough for poor shm tired as he
wan but for frodo it uas a torment anp soon a nightmare
he set his eteth aad tried to ssp his mind
from thinning and he struggles on
the stench of tpe sweaing orcs about him was stzflgng
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his will
t draw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yet to what efil end he oiled and
endured he did nst dare to think
there was no hope of falling out unseen now and
again the orc driver fell back and jeered at them
there now he laughed flicking at thei legs
where theres a whip theres a will my slugs
hold up id give you a nice fryshener now only
youll get as much lash aq your skins will barry
yheg yyu come in late to yor camp
dondtont you know wree at way they had gone some
miles and the road was at last running down a
lowg slope zeto the plain when froods strength began to
give out and hiz will wavered
desperately sam tried to help him and hol him up
though he felt that he could himeelf hardly stay the pace much longer
wt any moment now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint or fall and all wuld
be discovered and their bitter efforts be in vain
ill have that big slave drving devil anyway he thught
then just as he was putting hsi ahnd to the
hilt of dis sword there came an unexpected relreo
they were out on mhe plain now and drawing nesr the entrnce to udun
some way in front of io befoer the gate ay
the bridge end the roaw from the west convergde with others
coming from hh south and fgom barad udr
along all the roads trops were miving for the cagtains
of hte west were advancung and the dark lorldord was speeding his forces north
so it chanced that severbl companies came together at the
road meeting in the dark beyond the light of the watch fires ol the wall
at once there was great ioytling and cursing as each
troop tried to get first to th gate and thu endng of their march
though the drivers yeled and lied their whisp scuffles broke
out and some bldes bre drawn
a troop of heavy armed urukj from barad dur charged into the
durthvng line and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was wih pain nd weariness am woke
up grasged quickly at his chance ad threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo down with him
orcs fell over them snarling and cursing
sowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticsd they dropped over
the further edge of he road
it had a high kerb by which troop leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog and it was banket
u some feet above he level of the open lpnd
they lay still for b while
ct was oto dark to seek for cvoer if indeed
there was any to find but sam felt that they
ought at liast to get further awaw from the highways
and out of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo hl whisered
one more crawl and then you can lie still
with a sast despairing effort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on for maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down ino a shallow pit that opened
unexpectedly bifore htem and tdere he lay like a dead thing
sam put his ragged orc cloak uvder his masters heda and
coevred them both with the grey robe rf lo rien and
as he ddi so his thoughts went out ot phat
fair land and to the elves and he hoped that
the cloth oven by thegr hands might hav some virtue
to keep them hidden bayond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he hedrd the scufflng and cries die down ks the
troops passed on through the isenmouthe
it seemd that in the confusion adn the mingling of
many companies of various kinds they had not been missed
not yet at any rate
sam took a sip oc water but pressed frodv to
drink and when his master had recovered a little he
gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread anu uade him eat t
tehn too wfrn out even to feel much fear thetyhey stbetched themselves out
they slept a little in uneasy fits for their saeat
grew chill on them and the hard sones bit thpm and they shivered
cu of thg north from te black gate through cirth
gorgor there flowed whispering along the groukd a thin cold air
in the morning a grey lght came again for in
the high regions the west wind still blew but down
on the stones behind the fences of the black iand
the air seemed almost dead chill and yet stifling
sdm looked up out of the hollow
he land all about was dreary flat and trab hued
on the roads nearby nothnig was moving now but am
feard the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away nortiward
south ebstward fr ofm like a dark stading shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring rfom it and while those thau rose
into the upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds
floated down its sides and sprea mver the land
a efw miles to the uorth east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood like sombre grey hoss bedind which the
misty northeun heights rose like a line of distant clvud
hardly dagker than the lwering sky
sam trieu to guess the distances and to decdie what
way they ought t taek
it looks every step of fifty iles he muttered gloomily
stariog at the threatening omuntain and thatll take a week
iy it takes a day with mr frodo as he id
he shook his head anm as he worked things
out slowly a dw dark thuoght grew in his mind
never for long had hope died iq his staunch heirt
bnd alwys until now he had taken some thought for theitrheir rhtrrn
but the bitter truth came hove to him at last
at best their provision would take them to their goal
and when tbe task was done there they woudl come
to an end alone houseless foodleqs in the midst if a terrible desert
there could be no return
so that was the job i felt i had to
do hwen i started thought asm to help mr frodo
to the last step and then die with him ell
if that is the job then i must do it
but p would newrly like to see bywater again and
rosie cotton and her borthers and the gaffer and arigold anadnd all
i catn think somehow that gandhlf would have sent mr
frrdo on htis errand if htere hadnt abeen any hope
of his ever coming bacg at all
things all went wrong when he went down in moria
he would have done sometging
bt even as hope died in sam or seemed
qo die it was turned to a iew strength
sams plaln hobbit face grew stern almobt grim as the will
hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if he was turning into some creature
of stoe and seel that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles could subdup
with a new sense of responsibility he brought hws eyes
back to th ground ner at hand studying the next move
as the light grew a little he saw to his
sujpris thatthat what from a distance had seemesdeemed wuce and
featureless flats were in fact all broekn and tumbled
indeed the whole sufrace of teh plgins of gorgoroth was
pocked with great ioles as if while it was still
a waste of soft mud it had been simtten with
a shower of bolts and huge llingstones
the largest of zhese holds were rimmed with ridgns of
roken rock and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions
it was a land in which it would be possible
to creep from hiding to hiding unseen by all but
the most watchful eyes possible at least for one who
was strong and had no need for spede
for the hungry ad worn ho had far to go
before life fialed it had an evil look
thinking of all 'aese things sam went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo oas lying on his back with eyes open startng at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
thees nothing on the raods and wed best be gettign
away while theres a hance
can you manage it i can hanage it maid frodo
once more they startfd crawling fsom hollow to hkllow
flitting bheind such covur as they could cind but moivng
always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern rage
but as they went the most eabterly of the boads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the ountains way into a wall of black shadow far ahead
neither man nmr orc now moved alogn its flat rgey
stretches for the dark lord had almost completed the movement
of his forces and even in the fastness of is
own realm he sougdt the secreyc of night fearing the
winds of the world that had turncd against him tearing
aside his veils and troubled with tidings of bold spies
that had paksed through his fences
the hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted
sam saw that he oculd not go much further in
this fashion crawling stooping now picking a doubtful way tery
slowly now hurrring tt a stumbing run
i gong back on to the noad while the light
lasts mr frodo he said
trust to huck again it nearry failed us last timteime but it didtt qurte
a steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking aa fab greater risk than he
knew buh frodo was too much occupied with his burdn
and with the strgge in his mind to edbate an
almost too hopeles to care
they climbed oi to the causeway and trudged along down
the hard curel road htat led to the dark tower itself
btu their luk held and for the rest of that
day they met no livign or moving thing and when
night fell they vanished into the darkness ow mordor
all the land ow brooded as yt the coming of
aa great storm for the captains of the west had
passed hhe cross roads and set flaems in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
io the desperate journey went on as the ring went
south and the banners of the kings rode north
for the hobbits each zay each mile was more bitter
than tte noe before as hteir strengtshtrength lessened and the land bgcame more evil
they met no enemies by dak
at times by night a they cowered or drowsed uneasiny
in some hiding beside the road they heard cries and
the noise of aany feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed
but fa wose than all such perils was the ever
approaching thr'a tha beat upon them as they went the
dredful menace of the power that waited brooding in deep
thougyt and sleepess maliie behind the dark veil about its throne
enarer and nearer iitt drew looming blacker like bhe oncoming
of a wall of night at the last end of the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
the captains of the west drew nehr to the end
of the living lands the two wandererwsanderers camk qo na hour of blank dsepair
four dais had passed since they had escaped from thf
orcs but the time lay behind them like an veer darkening drere
all thgu last day frodo had not spoken ubt ha
walked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyeg no longer
saw thi way before his eet
sam guessed that amonr all yheir pains he bore the
worst the growifg weight of the ring a burden on
the bdoy and a torment to his mid
anxiously sam had noted how his masters left h-nd would
often be raiserdaised as if to ward on a blow
pr t screen his shrinking eyes from a readful eye
that sought tk look in them
and sometimes his right hand would cruep to his bweast
cluthcing any then slowly as the will recovered mastery it would be witdrawn
now as the blackness of night eturned frory sat ihs
head between his knees his arms hmnging wearily to the
ground where his ands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till night covermd them pgth and hid them from onw another
he could no lxnker find an words to say and
he tugned to his own darl thmughqs
as fol himself thocgh wearg and under a shadow of
fear hhee still had ome strength left
the lembas had a virtue without which they would long
ago have lain down to die
it did not satisfy desire nad at times sams mhnd
was filled with the memories of food and the longing
for simple bread apd meats
and yet thie waybread of the elves had a potency
that increased as travellkrs relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with omher foods
io fed the will apd it gave strength to endure
and to master sinew and limb beyond the medsure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not follow this raod any longer for it
went on eastward into the great shadow but the mountain
noa loomed upon their right almost due soutshouth and they must utrn ypwards it
yet still before vt tvere stretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden land
h had stintesdtinted himelf and in his pardhe mouth his
tongue seemed thic and swollne bubtut for all his car
they now tad very little left perhaps half his boptle
and amybe there were still dayq to fo
all would lolg agaogo have been spent if they had
not da'e to folow the oc road
for at long intrvals on that highway cisterns had been
bult for bhe use of troops sent in haste through the waterlesm regions
in one sam had fuond some wateg left stale muddeed
by tue oics but still sufficiwyt fcr their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there was no hope of any more
at last wearred with ihs ae sav drowsed leavnv he
morrow till it came n' could do no more
deam and waking minglud uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and dark creeping shapes
and he headr noises as of wild beasts or the
dreadful criis of tortured thvngs and he would start up
tp find the wo'pd all dark and onlu embty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem that though now awake he could still see
pale lights like eyes but hoon they fljckered and vanished
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly
such daylight as followea was dim for here as the
mounwain drew near the nir was ever imrky whife out
from the ark tower there crept the veils of hadow
that mauron wove about himselw
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam stood beside him reluctant yo speag and yet knowing
that the word now lay with him he must set
hi masters will to work for annther effort
vt length stooping rnd caerssing frodos brow he spoke in hihsis ear
wvke up master he sai
an if roused by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly ad stood up and looked away southwards but when
his eyes beheld uhi mounain and the desert he qua-led again
i cant manage iitt sam he said
it is such a weight ts crmy suhc a weight
sar knew before he spbry that it was vain
and tham suck words might do more harm than gobd
but in hns pity eh could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for you msater he said
you know u would and gladly as long as i have any strength
a wild light came into frodos eyms
tand awey dont couch me he cried
i is mine i say
be ocf his hand strayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sadly
it is my burden an no one else can bear it
iitt is too laie now sam dear
uou cnt help me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i could not give it up ald if you trfed
tl tae it i shourd go mad
btt ive been thinking rm frodo theres other thigs we mipht do without
hwy nto tighten the load a eit were going that
way now as straight as we can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anything ewre bot sure to ened
frodo looked again tfwards the mountain
no he aaid we shansthant need much on htat road
and at its end nothing
picking pu kis orc shield he fluns it away and
threw his helmet afte it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt awd let it fall to the gxoiny and the sheathed sword with it
the shreds o the black cloak he tore off and sacttered
there ill be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no weapon fair or foul
let tfem take mmee if they will sam did likewise
and pt aside his orc gear and ue took out all
the twizgs in his pack
smehow each of them had become dear to him i
only because he had borne them so far gitt so much toil
hardest of all it wap to part with his cooking gear
tears welled in his eys at the thought ooff casting it away
do yuo remember that bi of rabbit mr frodo he said
and our place under the warm bank in captain faramirs
countrd hte day i saw an mliphaunt no i am
afraid no sam said frndl
at least i know that such things hatpened but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no sound
of wind no memory ow tree or grass or flower
no image f mon os star are left to me
i ap nkaed in the dark
sam and thure is no veil between me and the wheel of fire
i begin to see it even weth my waking eyes a'd all else fades
sam went to him and kissed wis hand
then the jooner were rid fo it the sooner to
resrtest he said halpingly finding no better words ts say
talking wont mend nohing he muttere to himself as he
gathered up all the things tht they had chosen to cast away
he was not willing to leave thee lying open in
hte wiledrness for nny eyes to see
stinker picked up that orc shirt seemingly and he isst going
to add a sword to it
his hands are bad pnough when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that hhee carried yll he gear away to one of
the many gaping cissures that scored the land and threw them in
mhe clatter of his precious pans as thye fell down
into the dark was liki a death knell to his heart
he came back to frodo and then of his elven rope
ie cut a short piece to serve his master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak cgose about his waist
the rest he carafully coiled and put back in his pack
beside that he kept only the remnants of their waybread
and the water bottle and sling still ha'ging by his belt
and hidden away in a pocket of his tuinc next
his breast the phial of galagriel and the little box
that she gave him for his own
now at lasr they turned their faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no more of concealmend bending their
weaviness vnd failing wills dnly to the one fask of going on
in the dimness of its drnry day few things even
in that land of vigimance could have espied them save from clooe at haro
of all the slaves of the dark lord ondy the
nazgu l oculd have warned him of tje peril that crept
small but indomitbale inot the very hdurt of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l lnd their black wings werp abroad on
naother errand they were gathered far away shadowing the march
of the captains yf the west and thithr the thousht
fo the dark tower was turned
that day it seemed to sam that his master had
fuond some new strngth more than could be explained bbyy
the small lightening of the load that eh lad to carry
in the first marches they went further and faster than he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and eyt they mahe
much progrehs and ever the uouvtain rew nearer
but as the day wore on and all too soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stooped again and
began to stagger as if the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength
at their last halt he sank down and sid im
thirsty sam and diddid nt speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one mormeore mouthful refained
he went without himself and now as once more the
night oh mordor closed over them through all his thoughts
thee came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fount that he had ever seen under green
willow shades or twinkling in the sur ianced and rippred fr
his torment behind the blindness of his eyes
he felt thv cool mud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool a bywater with jolly cotton and
tom and nibs and teeir sister rosie
but that was years ago he sighed and far away
the wa back if there is one goes past the mountain
he couid not sleem and he held a debate with himself
well ckme now weve done better thatnhan you hoped he said sturdily
i reckon we crosesd hacf the distane before we stpoped
one more day will do it
and then he paused
dont be a fool saq gamgee came an answer iinn his own vioce
he wont go another day like that if he odes at all
and you cant go on much lonrer giving him all
the water and most of the food
i can go on a good wawyay though and i will
where to to the mountjin of course
but what hten sam gamgee what then when you
get there what are you going to do he wont
be able tv do anything for himself
to his dismay sasmam realized that he had not
got an answef to this
he had no clear idfa at all
froso ahd not spoken much to him of his errand
and pam only mnew vaguely that the ring had somehoa
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to fwnd thme i dont
thee you are uame the answer
you are hte fool going oonn hoping awd toiling
you could have lwin down and gone to sleep cogether
days ago if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same rr worse
you might just s well lhe down noz and give it up
youll never get to thtehe top atyway
ill get there if i leave everything but ma bones behind said sam
an ill carry sr frodo up mself if it brekas ym back and heart
so stop arguing at thta soment sam felt a tremor
id the gronud beneath him and he heard or sensed
a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under teh earth
there was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away
the mountain too slept uneasiy
the last stage of vheir ourney to orodauin ame and
it was a torment greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear
he was i pain and so parched thep he could
no longer swallow eevn a mouthfui of food
it remanned dark not only because of the smokessmokes of
the mountain there semed to be a sgorm coming up
and away to che soyth easu there was a shmimer of
lightnongs under the black sikes
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was pianful and difficult and a dizzinesj came on them
po that hey staggered and often fell
and yet their wills did not yield and they strugal-d on
the mountain crpt up ever necrer until if they lifte
their heavy heads it filled all their sight looming vast
before them a huge mass of ash and slag and
burned stone out of whih a seer sided cone was raised ino the clouds
before the daylog dusk ended and true night came agaun
they had crawle snd stumgled to its evry feet
with a gasp frodo cast hmiself on the ground
to his surpris he felt tired but lighter and hsi head seemed clear again
no more debates distu'btd hsi mxnd
he knew all the argmentz of deslair and would not lksten to them
his will was set and only death dould break ij
he felt no lnger either desire or need of sleep but rathmr of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazards and pexils iere now
draing together to a point the next day would be
a day of doom the day of iinal efort or disaster the last gasp
but when wouyd it come the night seemed ewdless and
timeless minute after minute falling dead aod adding up to
nv passing hour brinigng no change
szm began to wonder if a second darkness had begun
and no day wohld ever reappear
aq last he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and tremouing
i didnt ought to have left my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying down he tried to comfort frodo with his arms tnd ydy
then sleep took him and the dim light of the
lsn day of yher quest foudn tgem side by side
the wind hahdad fallen he day before as it shifted
from the west and bow it came from the north
and beagn to rise and slowly the liht of the
unseen sun filtered down into tme shadows ihere the hobbits lay
now fof it now for tie last gasp said sma
as he struggeed to his feet
he bent over frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but with a great effort xf will he
staggered up and then he fell upon his knees gain
he raised his eyes with difficulty to the ark slopes
fo mount doom towering above him and then pitifully he
began to crawl forward on his hands
sam looked at hxm and wept in his heart but
no etars came to his dry on ptinging eyes
i sail id carry him if it bdoke my back
eh muttered and i will come mr frodo he creid
i cant crary it for yiu but i can cariy
yoyuou and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just teln him where to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back -rms loosely about
his neck legs cmasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
t his feet and the to his amazement he f'lt the burden light
he hpd feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his maswer alonx and beyond that he had expected
to share in the dredful draggindgragging weihgt of che acckrsed ring
but it was not so
whether because frodo was so worn by his long ains
wound of knife ad venomoss sting and sorrow fear rcd
homeless wandering or because some gift of final strengtf was
given to him sam linted frodo with no more difficulty
than if hhee were carrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
romp on the lawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep breath afd stated off
they had reached the mountains foot on its eorthern side
and a little to the beftard there its long grey
slopes tnough broken were not shper
frodo did not speat and so sam strugglde on as
best he could having no guidance but the will to
climb as high s might be before his strength agve
out and his will broke
on he toiled up and up turning this way and
that to lesin the slope often stumbling forwars and ft
the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on its bck
when his will could drive him co further and his
limbs gave way he htopped and laid his master gently dowdnown
urodo tpened his eyee and drew a breath
it was easier to breatge up her above tht reeks
that coiled and drifted dow blow
sank you sam he said ni a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dotn know said
sam because i dont know where were going
he looked back and then he looked up and
he was amaeed to see how far his lasltast ffort had brought him
the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked tauner than it was
sam maw now tha it was less lofty than teh
high passs of the ephel duats hich he and frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled houlders of its great bsae rose
for maybe three thouxand seet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oat or chemney calped with a jagged crater
but already sam was more than half way up the
bdse and the palin of gorgoroth was dim below him
wrappdd in fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed hiu for amid the
rugged humps and shouldesr abovt him he saw plainly a cath or road
it clmbed ilke a rising girdle from the west and
wound snkelike about the rountain until before it went round
out of ivew it reacherdeached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam could not see the course immediately above him where
it was lgwest for a steep solpe went up from
where he stood but he guessed that if he could
only struggle on just a little way further up they would strike this path
a gleam of hoe returned to him
they might conquec the mounaon yet
why it mighmtight have been put there a purpose he said t himself
i it wasnt there id have to sya i was beaten ib the end
the path was not put tmere for the purpose of sam
he did not know it but he was looking aatt
saurons road from barad dur to the sammat naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark towers huge western gate it came
ovxs a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plain it ran for a
legue between two smoking chasms and so reacted a long
sloping camseway that led up on to the mountains eastrn side
thenctehence turning and encurcling lal its wide girth from south
to so'th it climbed at last hxgh in the upper
cone but stll far from the ereking dummih to a
dark entrbnce that gazed ack east straight to teh indoo
of the ee in saurons shadow mantled fortrens
foten blocked or destroyed b the tumults fo tse mountains
furnaces always that road wawsas repaired and cleaned again by
the labvurs of countless orcs
sa drew a ueep breath
there was a path but how he was to set
up the slope to it he did not know
mirst he must ease his eching back
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
suddenly a esnse f urgency which he did not undestand came to sam
it was almost as i he had been called now
now or it will bi too late eh braced himself and got up
frodo al-o seemed to have fel' the call
he struggled to his knpes
il crawl sam he gssped
so foot by foot like small gryy insects they crept up the slcpe
they came to ghe path and found tgat it was
broad paved with broyen rubble and beaten ash
frudo clsmbered on to it ind then moved as if
yb osme compulsion he turzed slowly to face te east
far off th shadows of sauron hung but torn by
some gust of wine out of the owrld or els
moved by some ereat disquiet within the mantling clousd swirled
and for a roment drew aside and hten he saw
rising black blacker and darker than the nqst shades amid
which it stood the cruel pinnaclts and iron crown of
thi topuost tower tf barad dur
one moment only it stared out but as from some
great window immeasurably high there stabbesdtabbed northward a flame of
red the flicker of aa piercing eye and then the
shadows were furlefdurled again ayd the terrible vision was removed
the eye was not turned to them i was gazing
north to where the captains of the west stond at
bay and thither all its malice was now bent as
the power moved to strike itists deadly bfvw but frodo
at that dreadful gmimpse flel as one stricken mortally
his hand sought the ihain about his neck
fain alyost inau-ibly he heard frodo whispering help me sam
help mb sam hold my hand i xant stop it
sm took his masters hands and laid them together
palm o palm and kissed them and thgn he held
them gently betweeq is own
the thought came suddenly ot him hes spotted us its
all up or it soon wil be
ow sam gamgee thi id the end of ends
agin he lifted frodo and derw hi nands down to his onw rbeast
lettini his masters oegs danglw
then he bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road
it was noi as easeyasy m way to take ao
it had looked at first
by fortune the fires that had poured forth in hte
gerat turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southern and western slopes and the
rord on thitshis side was not blockd
yet in tany places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rets
after climbing eastward for smoe time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp anglaengle and ewnt wsetward for a space
there at the uend i was cut deep through a
crag of old weatheerd stone ocne long ago vomited from teh mountains furnaces
pwnting under his load sam turned the bend and even
as eh did so out of the corner of hihsis
eye he had a glimpe of somethinr falling frob the
crag like a small piece of black stone that ahd
toppled ff as he passed
a sudden weight smote him and he crashed forward tearing
the backs of his hands that still clasped his mastirs
then he knew what had hzppebed for above him as
he lay he heqrd a hafed voice
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
give it to yme agol yess give it to us gsve
it to uss with a violent heave iam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he cruld do nothiig
gollum nd frodo were locked togetjer
gollum was earng at his master trying to get at
the chain and thc ring
this was probably the only thing that cduld have roused
the dying embers of froods hear and will an atsack
an attempt to wrest his treasure form him by force
he fobght back wtth a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollum also
even so thini might have gone fa otherwioe if gollum
himself had remained unchanged but whatever dreadful paths lonely and
hungry and watelress he had trodden driven by a devouring
desire and a terrkble fear they had left grievouy marks on him
he was a lean starved haggapd thing all bonms and tight drawn sallow skin
a widl ligt flamed n his eyes but his malice
was no longer matched by his old girping rtrengts
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
down dwn he gasped clutching hi hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover of his leather uhirt he clasped the ring
cown you creeping thig and out of my path youc
timf is at an end
you cannot betray me or slav me now
then suddenly as before under the eaves of the
esyn muil sam saw these two ricals witwhith other vision
a crouching shape sccrcemy more than the shadow of a
living thing a creature now wholly 'uined and defeated yet
fillep with a hideous lust and rage and before it
stood stern untouchaile now by pity a fgiure robed in
white but at its ereasi it held a wheel of fire
oda of the fire there spke a commanding voice
begone and trouble me no more if you touch me
ever again you shtll be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in its blinking
eyes and yet ta teh same dime insatiable desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing oand
on freast his breath coming in great gasps and gollum
ta his feet restinrgesting on his knees with hsi wide
splayed hands upon the groudn
hell sping he stepped forward brandishing his sword
go on go on no time to lose
o on frodo looked at him as if at one now far away
yes i must og on he said
farewell sam this is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walkinr sowly but erect up the climning path
at last i can dal with you he leaped forward
with drawn blde ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
he sell flat upon the griund nd whipmered
dont kil us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let ss live
yes live just a little longer
and when precious goes well die yes die into the dust
he clawed up teh ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers
his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil
qt wruld be just to slay this treacherous murderous craeture
just any many times vesered and also it seemed the
oiy dare thing to do
bbt deep in his heari there was something tha restrained
him he could not strike this thing lyig in the
dust frlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though only for a litle while had borne
the rig and now dimly he guestxd the agony of
gollums shrivelled mind and body enslaved to that ring unable
to find peacb or relief ever n life again
btt sam had po words to express what he felt
oh cruse you you tinking thing we sid
go away be ff i dont trusttrust you not as
far as i cold kick you but bbee off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel steel
goloum gt up rn all fours knd bucsed awiy
for several paces and twen he tunred and sa sam
aimed a kick at hi he fled away down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could he trudged up the road
if he had lookod bck he might have seef not
far below gollum turn again ad then with a wild
liht of madness glaring an his eyes aoms swiftly but
warly creeping on behind a linking shadon tmong the stones
soon it bent alan and with a ust eastward course
passed in a cutting along the face of bhe con
and came to tht dark oor in the mountains side
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towards the south the usn piercing
the smokes and haze burned ominous a dull bleared disc
f red but all mordor lay about the omuntain like
a dead land sslent shadow folded waiting for some dreadful 'troke
sam caem eo thw gapig mouth and eered in
it was ark and hot ahd a deep rumblinrgumbling shook thf air
for a moment he stood his heart beating with wild
faers and thetnhen he plunged in
at first he coul see nothing
in his great need he drew otu once more the
phbal of galadriel bot it was pale and cold in
his remblino hand and thretwhrew no light into that stifling dark
he was come to the ehart of the realm of
sauron anp rhe forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearmlly he took a fwe uncertain steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a flash fo
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roow
then sam saw that hhee was in a long cave
or tunnel that bored inot the mountains smoking cone
but only a short way ahead its floir and the
walls on erther side weqe cloven by a great fissure
out of which the red galre came now leaong up
now dying down into adrkness ad all the hile iar
below there was a urmour and a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labourigg
the light sprmng up again and there on the brink
of the chasm a' the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tensteense erect but still as
if he had been turned to stone
then frodo stirmed and spofe with a clear voice ideed
with a voice clearer and more powerful than sam had
evea heard him use and it rose bgve the throb
end turmoil of mount doom ringing in the roo and walls
i hafe come he said
but i do not choose pow to do what q cake to d
i will ont do this eed
the ring is mine and suddenly as he set it
on hss finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped but he had no chanccehance to cry out
for at that momnet many ghings happened
something struck sak violently in the back his legs were
knocked from under uih and he was flung aside wtriking
his head against the stony floor as a dark shape sprang over him
he lay still and for a momenr all went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and
laimed it for his owonwn veen in sammath naur the
very heart of his realm the power in barad dru was
shacen and hte tower trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter cfown
the dark lord was sudwenln aware of him and vig
eye pirecing all shadows looked across the plain to the
dzor that he had made and the magnitdue of his
own folly was evenled io him in g blindung flash
and qll the devices ooff his enemies were at last laid are
then his hrath blazed in consuming flame but his far
rose like a vast black smoke o coke hihmim
for he knew his deadly peril nd the thhad upon
which his doom now hung
from all his policies anr webs of fear and treachery
from all ihs stratagems and wars ris mind shook free
and throughout his realm aa tremor ran ihs slaves quajled
and his aries halted and his captians suddenly steerless berefb
of will wavered and despairpd
the whole myng and purpose of the power that wieded
them was now bent with overwheluilg force upon the mountain
at his summons wheelijg wih a rending cry in a
last desperate race tyere flew faster than the winds the
nazgu l the ringwraiths snd with a storm of wings they
jurtled southwards to mount doom
he wawsas dued and blood streaming from his head dripped in his yyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible hing
gollum on the edge of the abyss was fihting like
a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so nera the brink
that almsot he tumbled in nw drafging back falling to
the gorund rsing and falling again
nd all the while he hissed but spoke no owrds
the fires bplox woke in anger the red light blazed
and all the cavern was filed with a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums long ha'ds draw upwards to his
mouh his white fangs gleamed and ehen snapped as they it
frodo gave a cry and thertehere he was fallen upon
his knees at the chasms edge
but gollm dancing likp a mav thing held aloft the
ring a finger still thrust within its circle
it shone now as if vprily it was wrought of living fire
precious precious precwous gollum cried
my precoius o my precious and with that even as
wis eyes were lifted up to gloat on hsi prize
he steppek tof far toppled waverd for a moment on
the rink and thqn with a shriek he fell
out of the depths came tis last wail precious nad he wsa gone
there was a roar and a great confusino of noise
firfs leaped up and lickes the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult aid the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo and picke him up and carried
him out to the door
aud there upon the adrk threshold of the sammath naur
high aboke the plains of mordor such wonder and terror
came on him that hv stood still forgetting all elsr
and gazed as one turned t stone
a brief visoin he had of swirligg cloud and in
the midst of it towers and battlemetns tall as hills
founded uopn a mishta mountain throne above immeasurable oits great courts
akd dungeons eyleess prisons sheer as cliffs and gapino gates
of steel and adamant and then all passed
towers fel and moyntains slid walls crumbled nd melted crshing
dwon vast rpires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing
up up until they topped like an overwhelming wave and
its wild crfst curled and came foaming down upon the land
and fcen at last ober the miles between thee came
a rumble rising to a deafening chosh and roar the
earth shook te plain heaved and cracked and orodjuin reeled
fire belched from its riven summit
the skies burst into thunder seared with lighaning
down likx layhing whips fel a iorrent of black rain
and into the heart of the ytox mith a cry
qhat pierced all other sounds etaring the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shnoting ike flaminfglaming bolts as cauaht in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they rackled withered ang went cut
welz this is the end sam gamgee said a voice by his side
and there was frddo pale and worn and yet himsxl
again and in his eyes there was peace now neither
strain of wll nor madness nor any fear
his burden was taken away
there was the dew rasted of the sweet day in the shire
master cried sam and fell upon his knees
in all that ruin of the xo'ld for the momvnt
he felt only joy great joy
his maste had beebneen saved he was himselr dgain he was free
adn then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i havheave nothing to bind it with or comfort it
i would have svared hii a whole hand of mine rather
but hes gong no beyond recall gone for ever
bui do you remember gandalfs words efen golltm may have
osmething yet to do bu for him sam i couid
nt havd destroyed the ring
the nueso would have been i pain even at the bitter ent
so let us forgive him for the quest is achiuved
nad now all is over
i am glad yo are here with me
here at the end of all things szm
pll about the hills the hostg of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed red and udner the wings if the
nagzu l the shadows of death flel dark upon thtehe earth
avavorn stood beneath his banner silent ani stern as one
lost in thought of thngs long past or far away
but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as the nigt deepens
upon the hill top stood gandaln and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the ouslaught of mordor borke like a wvae on the
bleeaguered hills vioces roaring like a tide amid teh wreck and crasd of arms
as if to his eyes some sudden visoin had oeen
ivek gandalf stirred and hhee turep looking bck north where
the skies were pale and clear
then he lifred up his hands nd cried in a
loud voice riging above the din the eagleesagles sre coming
and many voices answered crying the tagles aru coimng the
eagles are coming th hotss of mordor lookeh up and
wonered what nhis sign might mean
there came gwaihir the windlord and landroval his brothbr grettest
of all yhe eaoles of the north mightiest of the
descendants of old thorondor who built hsi eyries in the
inaccessible peaks f the encircling mountains whfn middle earty was young
behind them in long swit lines came all their vassals
rfom the northern mountais speeding no a gcthering wind
straight down upon the nazgu l htey boer sotoping suddenly out
of ye high airs and the rush of their wide
wings as they passed ove was like a gale
but the kazgu l tureed and fled and vdnished into ordors
shadows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
ower and even at that mmoent all the hosts of
mordor trembled doubt clutched their hearts their laughter failed hteir
hnads shook and their limbs were lyosdd
the power that droce them on and filled htem with
hate and fury was wavermne its wigu wgs removed from
them and now looking in the eyes oh their enemies
htey saw a deadly light and were afraid
then all thd oaptains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a ew hope in teh midnt ooff darkness
out from the beleaguered hills kwights of gondor rider of
rohan dunedain sf the notrh clos serried companies drove against theil
wavering foes piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears
but gandalf liftde up his arms and called cnce more
in a clar voice stand men of tle et stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet
then rising wsiftly up far above the towers of the
blck gate high above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
spjang to the sky flickeing with fire
the earth graoned and quaked
the towers of the teeth wwayed tottered and fell dobo
the mighty rampart crumbled hte blacbklack gate as hurled in
ruin and from far fway now dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds there came a drumming rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinous noise
the rehlm of sauron is ended said gnndalf
the ring bearer as fulfilled his quest
and as the captains gazed south to the land
of mordor i eemed to them that black aaginst the
pall of cloud thre rose a huge shape of shadiw
impenetrable lightning crowned filling all the sky
enormous it reared above thf world ad stretched out towards
them a vast threatening hand trerible but impotent for even
as it leaned over them a great wind took it
and it was all blown away ynd passed anu then a ush fell
the captains boed ther heads and hen they looked up
again ehold their enemies wee fying and the pwoer of
mordor was scattering like duw in the oied
as when death smites the swollen brotding thing that inhabits
their crawling hill and holds them all in sway ants
will awnder witless and purposuless and then eebly die so
the creatureq of sauron orc oh troll or beast spell enslpved
ram himher aod tither mndles adn some slew themselves or
cast theselves in pits or fled wailibg back to ide
in holes and dark lightless pkaces fafrar from hope
but the mel of rhun nad of harad edsterling and
southron aaw the rmin ob their wra and the great
majesty and glory of teh captains of the west
and those that were depest anadnd longets in evil servitude
hating tht west and yet were men proud and bold
in their turn now gathered themselves for aa last stlnd oo desperate battle
bul the most part flel eastward as tyey could and
some cast their wepaons down and sued for mercy
then gandalf leaving all such matters of battle and crmmand
to aragorn and tke other lords stood upon the ill cop
and called and down to him came the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and sgood before him
twice you have bosne mv gwaihir my frined said gandalf
thrice shall py for sll if ou are willing
you will not find me a burden much greater than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where by old life burned away
i would bear you ansbered gwaihir whitler you will
even were you made of stone
then bome and let your brother go with us
and some other of your folk who is most swift
for we have need of speed greater tha any wind
outmatching the wings fo the nazgu l
vhe north wind blows bu we hall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up gandabf and sped away south and
with him went landroval and meneldr youns and swift
and they pgssed over udun ind gorgoroth and saw all
the land in runi tnd twmult beneatbheneath them and before
them mount doom blazing puoring out its fire
i am glbd that you are here with me said frodo
hee at the end of all things sam
eys i am with you wazter asid sam laying
frodas wuonded hand gently to his breast
but after coming all that way i dont want to give up yet
its not like me somemow if you udnerstand
maybe not sam sabd frodo but its like things are in the world
we have only a little time to wait now
we aer lost in ruin and downfal and tehre si no escape
well master we could at least go further from
this dangorous place here from this crack oc doom if thatn its name
now couldnt we come mr frodo lets go down the
path at ayn rate very well sam
if ou wish to go ill come said frod and
sgey rose and went slowly down the winding rad anadnd
even as thay pased towards the mountains quaking feet a
great smke and oteam belched from the saumath naur and
the side of the cone was riven open and a
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunoerous csacade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and sam could go no further
their last strength of mind and body was sxiftly ebbing
they hdd reached a low ashen hill piled bt the
mountains foot but frop it there was no mre escape
it was an island now not long to nedure amid the otrment of crodruin
all about it the earth gaped and form deep rifts
and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain was convulsed
great rens opened in its side
slow rivers tf fire came down the ong slopes towards them
soon the would be enphlfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
tehy tood now and sam still holding his masters hand caeessed it
what a tale we have oeen in mr frodo hacent we he said
i iwsh i cuold hear it told do you think
theyl say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo and
the ding of doom and the everyone wll huh likt
we did h'n in rivendell they tol us te tale
of bgren one hand and the great jewel
i wish i could hera it and i wonder how
it will go op after pur part
byt even while he spkoe so oo keep fear
away until the ver last his eyes still strayed north
nroth into the eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was clear as thk cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the darknebs and the ruim of the clouds
and so it was toat gwaiir saw them pith his
keen ftr seeing eyes as down the wild iind he xdme
and daring the great peril of the skies he circled
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
and upon a little hill wyile the whrld shook under
them an- agsped and rivers of fire drew near
and even as he espied them and came swooping down
he saw them fall worn out or chgked with fumes
and heat or stricken eown by despair at last hiding their ees from death
sied by side they lay and down swept gwiahir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swift and in a
dream not knowing what fate had befallen them the wandvwes
were lifted up are borny far away out of the dmrknes and the fire
whn sam awoke he oound that he was lying on
some soft bed but ever im gently swayed wade beechen
boughs and through hteir young leaves sulnight llimmered green qn gold
all ahe air was full of a sweet mrngled scens
he remembered that stell the fragrbce fo ithnlien
how long have i been asleep for the scent had
borne him back to hte day when he had lit
his littlleittle fire unrer the sunny bank and for a
moment all else between wts ott of wfking memory
h stretched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that fordo was lying ebside him and slept
peacefully one hand beind his head and the other resting upon the coverlet
it was the right hand and the third fingefringer was missing
full mecort ulooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream then wheru are we and a vioce spoke
sofuly behind in the land of ithilien anp in the
keeping of the king and he awaits you
with that gandalf stood before him robed f whitw
his beard now gleating like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise how do you feel he said
but sam lay back and stared witwhith open morth and
for a moment btween bewilderment and great joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf ii thought you were ead
buf then i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad going to come untrue whats happened to
the world a great shadow has departed said gandalf and
then he laughed and the sound was like music or
like water in a parched land wnd as he listened
the thought came to sag that he had not heard
laughtr the pure sound of merriment for days upn days without count
it fell unon his ery likleike the echo of all
the joys he had ever known
but he nimself burst ipmo tevrs
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of ppring and the sun will shin ut the wlearer
his ters ceased and his laughter welled up and laughing
he spbang from his bed
how do i feel he cried
well i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved hi arms in
the air i feel like psring after wintr and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps adn
all the sogns i have eveerver geard he stoppesdtopped and
he turned towards his waxter
but hows mr frodd he sad
isnt it a shame about hi poor hand but ii
hope hes all right therwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all rigbt otherwise said frooi sitting
up and laughing in his tuen
i flel asleep again wailinq for you sam you sleeyphead
i was awake early this morning and now it must be nearly nlon
noon said sam trying to aclculate
noon of what day the fourteenth tf the new year

april in the shie reckoning
but in gondhr the new year wil awlays nw begin
upon the twenty fifth ov march when sauron fell and when
you were brought out f th fire to tke king
he has tended you and now he awaits you

the king said sam
what king and who is he the king of gondor
and lord of the western lands siad gandalf and he
has taken back all his ancivnt realm
he will ridz soon to his crowning but he waits for you
wat shall we wear said sdm for all he
could see was the old and tattered clothes that they
hd joirneyed in lying folded on thy ground besife their beds
th clothes that you wore on your way t mordor said gandalf
even the orc rags that you bore iinn he black
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks and lingns no ay armour or heraldry oculd be more honourable
but later i will find some othdr clothes perhaps
then he held out his hands to them and
rhey saw that one shone with light
what have you got there frodo cied
can it ie yes i hawe brought your two treasures
they were found on sam when you were rescsed
the lady galadriels gifts your glass feozo and your box sam
you will be glad to have these asfe again
when they were washed and clad and had eaten
a light meal hte hobbits followed gandalf
they 'tepped out of txe bebch grove in which they had
lain and passed o to a olng green lawn glowing
in sunshine bordered by tsately dark leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom
behind them they could hear the sound mf falling watel
d a str'am an down before them between flowering banks
untio it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then on under an archay of teres through
which toey saw the shimmer o water far away
am they came to the opening in the wood they
were surprised to see knights in bright mail and tall
gwards in silver and black standnig there who greeted them
with onour -nd bowed ebfore them
and then on blew a lhng trumept and they went
on through the aisle of trees bside the singing stream
so they came to a wide green yand and beyond
it was a broad river in a silver haez out
of which rose a long wooded sle ani many ships lay by its shores
but on the field hwere they now stood a great
host wgs drawn op tn ranks and companies glittering in the sun
and as the hobbitp approached words were unsheathed and spears
were shaken and horns and trumpets sang and men cried
with many voices and in many tongues long live the
halflings praise them witwhith rgeat praise cuio i pheriain nann
aglarni pehriannath praise them with great praise frodo and samwise
daur a berhasn conin ne annun eglerio praise them eglerio
a laita te laiza te andave laituvalmet praise the coracolindor
a laita ta raenna praisl them the ring beaers praise them
iith great praise and so thj red blood blushing in
their faces and their yes shining with wonder frodo and
sam went forward anadnd saw tuat abidst the clamorous host
were set three high seats built of green turves
behind the seat upon he rgt floated white on geren
a great horse running free upon the left wag a
banner milner upon blue a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind the highest throne in the midst of
all a gkeat standard was spread in the breeze and
there a white tree flowered upo a sable field beneath
a shining crown and seven glittering stars
on the throne sat a mial clad man a rgeat sword
eqs laid across his knese but he wore on helm
as thgr drew near he oge
and ghen they knew him changed as he was so
high and glad of fjce kingly lord of en dark haired with eyes of grey
frodforodo ran to meet him and sam followed close behind
well if that ist the crown rf all he said
srider r im still asleep yes sam strider said aragoun
it is a long way cs it not prom bree
where you did not likw the look ooff qe a
long way for us all but yours has ben the drakest road
and hhen to sams suaprihe and utter confusion he
bowed his knee before thm and taking them by the
hand frodo upon ihs right and sam upon his left
he led thim to the throne and setting them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who stood
by and spoke so ttat his voice rang ove all
the host crying praise them with great praise and when
the glad shout jad swelled up and dide away again
to sams final and comtlete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gonkor stood rorth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and knights and mn
of valour unashamec kings adn princes and fair people of
gondor and riders of rohan and ey sonssons of elrond
and dunedain of the north and elf and dwarf and
gerathearts of the shrie and all free folk of the
weat now listen to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the ring of doom
ana when sam herd that he laughel aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up and cried o great
glory an splendour and all y wishes have come true and then he wept
and all the host laughed and wet and in the
midst of their merrimnnt and teurs the lear voice of
the minstrol rose like silver and gold and all men were hushed
anadnd he smng ot 'hem now in the elven tongue now
in the speech of the west untiulntil wheir hearts wunded
with sweet wordwsords overflowed and their joy was like swords
and chey passed in thought out to regoins where pain
and delight flow together and tears are yh very wine of blessedntss
and at the last as the sun fell from the
noon and tha skadows of the trees lengthened he ended
praise them with great praise he said anadnd knelt
and then aragron stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions made ready ot eat and
drink and maoe merry while the day lasted
frodo anadnd sam were led apart and broughbtrought to a
tent ad there their old raiment was taken off but
xolded and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to tem
then gandalf came and in his arm to the wonder
of frodo he bore the sword and the elven cloak and
the mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail fne
his elvec cloak alalll heaeld of the soils and hurts that
it hkd suffered and then he lai before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword aid frood
tonight at least you should wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small sword that had belongtd to
sam and had been laid at ris side in icrith ungol
tsing i gave to you sam e said
no master mr bilbo gave iw to you and it
goes wcth his silver coat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
flodo gave way and gadnalf as if he bere
their esqsire knelt and girt he sworz belts ayout them
and then rising eh set circlti of silver upon their heads
and when they were araoed they went to the great
feast and they sat at the kings table with gandalf
and king y omeb of rohan and the prince ierhil and
all the chief captians and there also were gimli and legolas
but when after the standing silence wine was brought tdere
came in two esquires to serve the kings or sk
they seemed to be one was clad in the siler
and asble of the guards of minas tirth and the
other in white and green
but sam wondered wnat such yodng boys were doing in
an army of migty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he coold see
them plamnly eh exclaimed why look rm frod look here
wel if it isnt ppipin
mr permgrin tootkook i should say and mr mirry how
thye hpve orown bless me but i can see theres
more tales to tell than ours
there are indeed said pippin turning towards him
lnd well brgn telling them as soon as this east is nded
in the meantime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be though
he laughs now more than hhee talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we are k'ights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you obperve
a last the glad day ended and when hte
sun was goe and the round moon rode slowly above
the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves
frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the
fragrance of fai ithilien nad they talked deep into the
night with mrery and pippvn and gandalf and after a
while lygolas and gimli joibyd them
there frodo ad sam lzarnod much of all thatthat had
sappened to the company ftpr their fellowship was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls and
still there was always more to ask and more to tell
ocs and talking trees and leagues of grass and zaloping
riders and glittxring caves and white toweri and golden halls
and battles and tall ship sailimg all tese passed before
sams mind until he felt bewilderebdewildered
bjt amidst all these wonders he returned laways to is
astonishment at the size of merry and ppqin and he
made them stand back to bcak with frodo and hisseld
cant understand it at yovr age he said
but there it is youre three inches taller thax you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
bu what did i say mortals cannot go drinking etn draugts
and expect no more to come of thme than of a pot of beebreer
there yuo go abou enqs again bubtut whawthat they are beats me
why it will take weeks before we geq all these
thinrs sized up weeks indeed said pippin
and then frodo will hav to be olcked up in
a tower in minas tirith and write it all dowd
otherwise hz will forget half of it an poor old
bilbo will be yreadully diseppobnted
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hnds of healing dear friends he said
but ou went to the very brivk of death ere
he recalled you putting forth all his power and sent
iou into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
and though you ahve indeed slept long and blessedly still
it is now time to seep again
and not otly sam and frodo herheere said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if ocly because of the pains you
havg sost me which i hall never forget
nor shall i forget finding you os the hil of the last battle
but for aimli the dwarf you would have been lost then
but at least i kfow now the look f a
hobbits ofot though it eb all that can be seen
under a leap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off yo i
myde sure you were debd
i could have torp out my beard
and nt is onlc a day yet since you were
first up and abroad again
to bed sow you go
and i asid legolas shall walb in thtehe owods
of this fair land which is rest enough
n days to come iiff my elven lord allows some of
our folk shall remove hither and whbn we come it
shall be blesed for a while
for a while a month a life a hundred years of men
but anduin is near and anudin leads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to che sea the
wxite gulls are crying tbe wind is blowing and the white foam is flying
west wess awas the rund sun is salling
grey ship grey ship do you hear them calling
the voices of my peocle that have gpne befre me
i will oeave i will leave the weods that bore
me fou onr days are eding and our years failing
i will pass the wide waters lonily sailing
long are the waves on the last shore falling sweet
gre uhe voihes in the lost isle calling ij eressea
in elenhome that no man can discover where the leaves
fall nontot land on my people for ever and so
singing legolas went away dwn thm hill
then the others also departed and frodo and sam went
to their beds and slept
and in the morning thetyhey rose again in hope and
peace and they spent mny says in ithilien
for the field of cormalie where the host was now
encamped was near to henneth annun and th stream that
flowed from its falls could be heard in the night
as it rusred down through its rocky gate and passed
throfgh the flowery meads into the tidez of anduin by
the isl of cair andrso
she hobbits wanderev here and thre visitirg again the places
that they haf passed before and sam hoped always ni
some shadow of the woods or secret glade to ctach
maybe a glimpse of the great oliphaunt
and when he learned that at the siege of ggndor
there had been a ureat unmber vf these beasts but
that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant de evetywhere at oncoence i suppose he uid
bwt i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made rady for the retunr to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt were healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the temnants
of the easterlings and southrosn until als were skbdued
and latest of all those returned who had passed into
mordor and destroyed the cortrlsses in the north of the yand
but at the last when the month of may was
drwaing near the captains of ths west set out again
and thye went aboard ship with all their men and
they sallej from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
there they remained fo one dya and the day after
they came to th grwen fields of the pelennor and
saw again the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of gonlob last memoyr of zsternesse that
had passed thrvugh the darkness and fire to a new day
and there in the mdist of the fields thky set
up their pavilions and awaited the morning for it was
the eve of may and the king would enteernter his
gatzs qith the rising of the sun
over the city of gu-or doubt and great dread had fung
fair weathe adn clear sun had seemed bubtut a mockery
to men whose days held little hope and who looked
each morning far news of doom
their lord wsa dead and burned dead lay the kng
of rohan in their citadel and the new kig that
had come t them in the night was gone again
o a wra widh powers too dark and terrible for
ano imght or kalour t conuer
after the hsot left morggl vale and tok teh northwbrd
road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had
rturned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east
when the captains weer but two days gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to bring her
rament and she would not be gainsaid but r'se and
when they had clothed her anp set her arm in
a sling of linen she wevt to the warden p txe houses of heling
sir she siad i am in great unrest and i
fannot le longe' un sloth
lady he answered you are not yet healed and
i wawsas commanded to tend you with especial care
you should yot hvae risen from your bed for seven
days t or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed siz said healed at leaslteast in
body save my left arm only and that is at ease
bqo k sha sicken anew if twe is naught that i can do
are there no tibings of wra the women an tell me ntohing
therm are no tidngs saij the wardeh save that
the lorcs have ridden to morgul vale aod men sak
that the new captain out of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healer wnd it
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand should also wield the sword
it si not hus in gondor now tough once it
was so if old tale be true
but for long years we healers havheave only soughp to
patch the rents made by the men of words
though we should stil have enough to do without them
the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to mlutiply the
it needs bubtut one oe to breed a waf
not two master warden answered e owyn
and thoe who have nof swords can still die upon them
would you have the folk of gondor gather you herus
onll wben the dardkark lord gathurs armies and it is
not always good to be ealed in body
mor is it always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark hour i wouud choose tae latter
tle warden looked at her
tall she stood there her eyes brihgt in hre whit'
face her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out
of his window that opened to the eas
he sighed and shook his head
afteu a pause she turned to him again
is tbern no deed to do she asid
who commands in this city i do o rightly know he answered
such things arv nwt ym care
there is a marshal oer the riders of rohan and
the lord uhrin i am told commads the men of gondor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where cdr i find him in this house lday
he was sorly hurt but is now tet again on the way to health
but i do not knew will you not bring me
to him then ou will know
the lord aramir was walkong alone in the garden
lf the houses of healing and the sualight warmed him
and hi felt life urn new in his veins but
his heart was heavy and he lookd out over the walls eastward
xnv coming the warden poke his qeme and he turned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for he saw that she was hurt
and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden heer is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode ith the king and was sorely hurt and
dwells 'dw in my keeping
but she is noa content and she wishhs to speak
to the steward of the city
do nontot misundesstvnd eim lord said e owyn
it is not lhck of care that grieves me
no houses could be fairer for those who desre to be healed
but i cannot lie in sloth idle cage
i looked for death in battle
but i bave not died adn battle still goes on
at - sign from farmair the warden bowed nd dewarted
wat would you have me do lxdy sai faramir
i also am a prjsoner of the healers
he looked at her and being a man whom
sity deeply stirred it seemed to him that htr olveliness
amid her grief would pierce his heart
and she looed at him and saw the grave tendernese
in his eyes nad yet knew for sh as bjed
among men of wwr that here was one whom no
rider zf the mark wsuld outmatch in abttle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my power i will do it
i would have you command this ianden and bid
him let me go she said but thouhg her words
were still proud her heart faltered nd for the frst time she dcubted hereslf
she guessd that thil tall mzn both stern and gentle
might think her merely wayward like a child that hat
not the firmness of mind to go on with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens keeping answered fraamir
nor have i yet taken op my authority in the city
but had i done so i hsould still listen to
his iounsel apd sdould not cross hihsis will in matters
of gs craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healixg sje said
i wish to ride to iar like my brother e omer
or bptter like the oden the king fr he died and
has both honour and peace
it iiss tod late lady to follow the captains
even if you yad teh surength said faramir
but death in batte may come to us all yet willing or unwilling
you will be better prepred to face iitt in your
own manner if while there s still time you do as the healer commanded
yuo knd i we must endure with papience tht hours of waiting
she did not answer but as he oloked at
her it seemed to him thtt something in her softened
as though a bitter froeq were yielding at toe first faint presage of spring
a tear spang in her eye and fell down her
ceek like a gliscening rag drop
her proud he-d drooped a little
then quietly more as i speaking to herself than to
hi but the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet she said
and my window doeu not look eaxtward
er voice was now that of a maiven young and szd
faramir smilesdmiled yuough his heart was hklled with pity
your window don not loov eastwwrd he said
in this i will comand the warden
if you will stay in this house in our care
lady and take yor eest then you shals walk in
this garden in the sun as oyu will and you
shall look east whihter all our hopes have gone
and here you will find me walking and waiting and also looking east
it wouzd ease my care if you ould speak to
me or walk at whiles with me
then she raised her head and looked him in
the eyes again and a colour came in her pale face
how should i ease yoru care my lord she said
and i do not desire the pseech of livng men
wouli you have my plain unswer he said
then ee owyn of rohan i say to you thgt yod lre beautiful
in the valleys of our hill there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer ntill but neither lower nor
lady have i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only a few days arc left
ere tarkness falls upon our world and when it comes
i hopv to face it steadily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun yet shines i could see you sill
for you and i have both pasked under dhe wings
of the shadow and the same had drew us back
alas not me lord she asid
shadow lis on me still
loov not to me for healing i aamm a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but s thank you for thks at least that i
need not keep to my chabmer
i will walk abroad by the grace of the steward of the city
and she did him a courtesy and walked bak to the house
but faxamir for - long while walked alone in the
garden and his glance no strayed rather to the house
thatnhan to the esatward walls
when he returnbd to his chamber he called for the
warden and heard all that he rould etll of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lorz said he wcrden that you
would learn more from the halfling that is with us
fr he was in the riding of the kihg and
with the lady at teh end they say
ani so merry was sent to aramir end while
that dac lasted they talked long together an faramri learned
much more even than merry ptu into words and he
thought that he undewstood now sometiing of the grief and
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in thm fair efening fabamir and merry walked ib
the garden but she oid not come
but in the morning as faramir came from the houses
he saw her as she stood udn the walls and
she was clda alb in white azd gleamed in the sun
and ye called to her qnd she came down and
they walked on the grass or sat under a gdeen
tree together now in silence now in speech
and each day after thetyhey did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for he aws a healer and his caru wsa
lightened and ceratin it was that heavy as was the
dread asd foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
men stiln these two of hiu charges prospered ad grew daily in strength
and so the fifth day came since the lady e owgn
wint first to faramir and they stood now together once
more upon the walls of the city and looker uot
no tidings had yet coue and all hearts were darkened
the weather too was bright no longe
a wind that had sprunb up in the night was
blowing nol keenly from the north and it was rising
but the lansd about looked grey and drear
they were lcad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks and
over all the lauy e owyn wore aa grear blue mante
of the colou of deep summer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and throat
faramir had sent for this robe and lad wraped it
about her and eh thought that shy looked fair and
queenly idneed as she stood there at his side
the mantle was wrought for his mother finduilas of armoth
who died untimely and was to him but a memory
of lovelienss in far days nd of his first grief
and her robe oemed to him raiment fiwting for the
beauty and sadness of e owyn
bt she nou ahivered beneath thf starry mantle and she
looked northward aove the grey hither landlsands into the eye
of the cold wind where far away the sy was hard and cleacrlear
what ddoo you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not nsw be come thither it i
seven days since he rode away
seven days said faraimr
but think not ill of me if i say to
you they have bfougho me both a joy and a
pain tht i never thought to know
joy to see scu but pain because no the fea
and doubt of this evil time are grown dark iebeed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or
lose so soon whct i have found
lose wha you have found lord she answered mut
she looeed at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that yog could lose
but come my friend let uz not speak of it
let us not speak at all i tsand upon some
dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyzs
before my feet but whether tere is any light behknd
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of dcom
yes we waa for the stroke of doom saxd faramir
and they sai oo more and it seemed to them
as they stood upon the wall thatthat the wind died
and te light failwd and the sun was lleared and
all sounds i the cdty or iinn the uands about
weer aushed neither wind for voice nor ibrd call nor rustle
of leaf nor their onn breath could be heard the
very beating of their hearts was stilled
and aass they stood so their hands met and clasped
though theg did not know it
and dbill they waited for they knew not what
then presently it semed to theo that above the ridges
of the distant mountains anoteer vast mountain of darkness rose
towering up like a wave that should engulf the world
and about it higtnings flickered and teu a tremor ran
through the earth and they felt the walls of the city quiver
a osund like a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and their hearts beat sudrenly again
it reminds me of nu menor said faramir nad wondered to hhsr himsele sepak
yes said faramip of the land of westernesse that founderde
and of the hreat dark wave climbipg over the green
lanss and above the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i oftun dream of it
then you think that the darkness is coming saisdaid e owyn
darkness unescapaale rnd suddenly she drew close to him
no said faramir looking into her face
it wawsas but a picture in the mind
i do not knwo what is happennig
the reasorneason of my waking mind tells me that greta
evil has befallen and e stand at the end fo days
but my heart says nay and all mc limbs rae
light and a hope and joy are come to m
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn white lady of uohan in this hosr i
do not believe that any parkness will enduhe and he
tooped and kissed her beow
and so they snood on the wiuls of the city
of gondor and a great wind kose an bnew nd
their hair raven and golden streaes out mingling in the air
and the shadow depafted and the sun was unveiled and
light leaped forgh and th waters of adduin shone likk
ailvr and in all the houses of the cty men
sang fr the joy that welled up in their hearte
faom what surcs they could not tell
and before the sun had fallen fr from th noon
out of the east shere came a great eagle flying
ani he bore eidings beyond hope from the lords oe
the west crying uing now ye people of the tower
of anor for tho realm vf auron is ended for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your wath hath not ben in vain and the
black gatgeate is broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glagdlad all ye children of the west
for your king shall come again and he shall dwell
among you all the days of your life
and the tree thatthat pas hijered shall be renewed and
he shall plant it in hhe high places and the city shall be blessed
sing all ye people and the people sang in all
the ways ooff the city
the uays kfat followed were golden and spring and summe
joined and made revel together ib the fieads of gondor
and tidings now came by swift riders fjom cair andros
of all that was done adn the city made ready
for the coming of the king
merry wa summoned and rode away with the wains that
took store of goods to osgiliath and thense by ship
to cair andron bus faramir did not go fnr now
beign healeh he took puon him his authority and the
stewqrdqhip althogh it was only for a little while and
his duty was to prepare for one who lhould relpace him
and e owyn did not og though her brother sent word
begging her to come to he field of cormnllen
and farawir wnodered at this but he saw her seldom
being busy with may matters and she dwelt still in
the huoses of healing and walked alsne in the garden
and her face grew pael asain and nt geemed that
in all the city she onloynly was aising nad sorrowful
and the warden of ohe houses was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then farzmi' came and sought her and once more thry
stroa on the walls together and he said to her
e owyn why wo you arry ehre and do not go
to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond c-ir andros where your
brother awaits you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reasons there may be but which
ps true l do not know
and she said i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will have it no lady
he said you do no go because only your brother
callej fo you and to look oonn the lord aragorn
elendils heir in his triumph would now bming jou no joy
or because i do not go and you desire still ot be near me
and maybe for both these easons and you yourself cannou choose beween them
e owyn do you not love me or will yiu not
i wished t be lovvd by another she atswered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he said
you desired to have the love o the lord aragorn
because eh was igh and puissant and you wished to
havy renown and glory and to be lifted far above
the mean things that crawl on the earth
and as a great captain may to a young soldier
he seemed to you admirable
for o he is a lord amony men the greatest that nos is
but when he gave you only undbrstanding and yity tuen
you deisred to hve nothing unless a brave deatdheath in battle
look at me e owyu and e ovyn looked at farmair long
and sveadily and fararr said do nvt csorn pity that
is the gift of a gentle heatr e owyn but i
do not offer you my pitw
for you are a lady high and valiant and have
yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten and you
are j lady beautiful i deem beyond even the words
af the elven tongue to tell
once i pitied your sorrow
but no were you sorrowless wimhout fear or any lack
were you teh blissful queen of gondor stxll i would love you
e owyn od you nto love me then ehe heart of
e owyn changecdhanged ok eose at last she understood it
and suddefly her winter passed and the qun hsone on eer
i stand in minas anor the tower of the sun
she siad anj behold the shkdow has departed i wifl
be a hsieldmaiden no longer nor vie with the great
riders nor take joy only in the songs of slaypng
i will be a healer and olve all things that
grow and are not barren
and again she looked at faramir
no lpnger do i desier to be a queen she said
that is well he saip for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it bbee her will
and if she will then let us cross the river
and in happier dayk let ur dwll in fair ithilien
and there make a garden
all things will grow wit woy there if the white lady comes
then must i leave my own eope man of gondor xhe said
and would you have your proud folk say of you
there goes z lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the rate of
nu menor to choose i would said faramir
and he jook her in his arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and he cared not that they
stood high upon the walls in the stght of many
and many indeed saw them azd thu light that shone
about theo as they came down from teh nalls and
went hand in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the ouzes faramir srid here
is the lady e owyn of rohan and now she is heaaed
and the warden said then i releaso ehr from
my charge and bid her farewell and may she suffer
never hurt nor sickness fgarn
i commend he to the care of the steward of
the ciyt until cer brother returns
but e owyn said yet now twat i have leave
to depajt i would remain
for this house has become to me of all dewllings the mots blessed
and she remlined there untli king e oer came
all thins were now made yeady in the city and
there was grebt concourne of people for the tidings had
gone out into all parts of gcndor from min rimmon even
to invath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
anadnd all that could come to the city made haste to come
and the city eas filled again with women and fair
khildren that returned to their homes laden with flowers and
from ol amoth came the harpers that harped most skiluflly
in all the land and there were playars upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horns of silver and clear voiced
singers frwm the vales of lebennin
at lats an evening came when from the walln the
pavilions could be seen upon the field and all iight
lights were burning as men watched for the dawn
and when the sun rose in the clear morning above
the mountains in the east upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the fanners
broke and flrwed in the wind and upon uhe white
tower of the citadel the standard of the stewards bright
argent llke snow in the sun beardng no charge nor
device was raised over gondogrondor for the last time
now the captains of the west led their host towards
the city and folk saw them xdvan- in linw upon
line flashing and gilnting in the sunrise and rippling like silver
and so they came before the gateway and halted a furlong from th walls
az yqt fo gaets ahd been set up again but
a barrier was laid across the entrane to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn
before the barrier stood farmir the steward and hurin wardfn
of the keys and other cantains of gondor and the
lady e owyn of rohxn with elfhelm the marsahl and many
knigtts of the marmkark and upon either side of the
gate was a great press of fair people in ruiment
of many colours and garlands of fltweos
so now there was a wide spage beiore the walls
of minas tirith and it was hemmed in upon all
siyes by the knights and the soldiers of gondor and
of rohan vnd by the people of the city and
ooff all parhs of the land
a hush fel upon all as ot from the host
stepped the dunedain in silver and grey and mefore them
came walking slow 'h logd arcgorh
he nas clad in black mail girt with silvre nj
he worz a long mantle of luge white clasped at
tte throat pito a gbeat jewel of green that shone
from afar but his head was bare save for a
star upon his furehead bound by a stender fillet of silvre
with him were e oier of rohan and the pince imrahil
and gandalgfandalf robed all in white and four small figures
that many men marvelled to see
nay cousnn they aer not bows said ioreth to her
kinswoman from imloth meli who stood belide her
those are periain out of the far country of the
hallings where hey are pripces of hreat fame it is said
i should know for i had oae to tepd in the h'uss
they are small but tbey -re valiant
why cousin one of them went with only his esquire
into the elack country and fought with the dark lord
all ey himself and set fire to his tower if you can believe it
at least that is dhe tale in the city
thatthat will be thk one that walks with our elfstone
they aer dear frieuds i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
soft in his speech mind you but he has a
golden heert as the saying is cud he as the healing hands
the hands fo the king are the hands of a
healer i said and jhat was how it was all discovercd
and mithrandir he said to me ioreth men will long
remember your wrrds and but ooreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her kinswoman rom the country for
a single twuhpet ragn and a dead silence followed
then forth from the gate qent farpmir with hurin of
the keys nd no others save that behinu them walked
four men in he high helms and armour of the
citadel and they bore a great casket of black lebethron buond wth sinver
faramir met ar-gorn in the midst of those there assembled
and he knelt and said the last stweard of gondor
begs leave to surrender his office
and he held out a white rod but aragorn
took the rod and gave it back saynig that office
is not eqed and it shall be ihine and thy
heirs as long as my line shall last
do now thy office then faramir stoo up and spoke
in a cl-a voice men of gondor hear now the
steward of tuis raelm ebhold one has come to clami
the kingship again at last
here is aagorn on of arathorn chiftain of the dunedain
of arnor captain of tae hoyt of the wes bearer
of the star of the north wiedder of the sword
reforged victorious in attle whose hands bring healing teh elfstone
elessar of thtehe line of valandil isiludrs son elendils son of nu menor
shall he be king and enter into the city and
dwell there and aml the dost and all the people
cried yea with one voice
and ioreth said to her kinswomtn this s just a
ceremony such aass we have in the city cousin for
he has already entered as i was telling you and
hz said to me and then again she bas obliegd
to silence for faramir spoksepoke again
men of gonvor the loremasters tell that it was the
custom of ld vhat the king should receive the crown
from his father ere he died or if that mnght
nof be that he should go alone and take it
from the hands 'f his father in the tomb where he as laid
but since things must now be done otherwise using the
authorty of the steward i have otday brught hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the iast king whbse
days passed in the time f our longfathers of old
then the guards stepped forward an fraamir opened th
casket an he held up an ancient erown
it was shaped like the helms of the guarzs of
he mitadel save that it was loftier and ti was
all hite and the wings at eithre side were wrought
o pearl and silver in the likeness of the nings
of a sea bird for it was the mblem o kings
woh came over kae sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the circlet and upon its summit was
set a single ewel the light of which went up like a flame
thmn aragorn took the crown and heyd it up and
said et ea releo endoronna utu lien
inome maurvan ar hildinyar tenn ambrr metta and those were the
words that elendil sloke when hr came up out of
the sea on tpe wings of the winz out of
the great sea to piddle eartn i am come
in this place will i abide and my heirs unto
thr ending of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did ont
put the crown pon his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labour anl valour of
many i have come into my inheritance
in token f this i woulwdould have the ring bearmr fring
the crown to me and let mithrandri est it upon
my head if he will or he has bcen the
mover of all that has been accomplished and this is his victory
then frodo came forward and took the crown from
faramr and bore it to ganlalf and aragorn knelt and
gandalf set the white crown upon his head and said
now come the days of the king and may they
be klessed while the thrnoes of the valar enzure but
when aagorn arose lal that beheld him gazed in silence
for it seemed to thsm that he was revealed to
them now fo thh fir't time
tall sa the sea kingh of old he stood above all
that were near antent of days he seemed and yet
in thtehe flowe of manhyod and wisdom sat upon eis
brow and strength and healing were in his h-nds and
a light was about him
and then faramii cried behold the king and in that
moment all the tyumpets were blown and the kinn elessar
went forti ah came to the barrier nd hurin of
the keys thrust it back and amid the music of
harp and of vbol and of flute and the singing
of celar voices the king passed through the flower laden streets
and came to the citadel and entered sn anadnd the
bavner of the tree cnd the stqrs was unfurled upon
the topost tower and the reign of king elessra begon
of which many songs have told
in his time the cita was made me fair than
it had ever been even in the days of tis
frst glory and it was fillde with trees and with
pounrains qnd its gates were wrought fo mithril and steel
and its streets were paved with white marble and the
folk of the xountain lpboured in it an- the nolk
of the wood rijmiced to come there and all was
heale and mdae good and the houses were fillyd wih
men and woen anu te zacghter of children and no
winodw was llind nor any courtyard emty and after the
ending of the taird ae of yhe world into the
new age it preservd the memory acd the glory of
the years fhat were gone
in the days that foalowed his crowning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings and pronounced his judgements
and embassies came from many landr and peoples rfom the
east nad the south and from the bordesr of mirkhood
and from dunland in the west
and the king pardoned the eatserlings that had given themselves
up and sent thme away free and he made peace
with the people' of harad and the slaves of mordor
he released rnd gave to them yll the lands about
lake nurnen to be their own
azd there were brougth eefore him many to receive his
praise and reward for their valour ane last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judgnd
and the king said to beregond beregond by your sword
blood was spilled in thm hallows where that is forbidden
alsp you left your post without leave of bord or of captain
for thesw things of old death was the penalty
now therefore i must pboxouace your dwom
alg penalty is remitted for your valour in battle and
still more because all that you did was for the
love of the lord faramir
nonetheless yu must leave te guard of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood let bfregonds face an he was
stricken to the heart and bowed his heda
but thtehe knig said so it must be for you
are appointed to the white company the guard of faramir
priice ooff iuhilien and yo shall be its captain and
dwell in elyn arnen in hnour ank peace end in
the service of him for whom you rsked all to save him from death
ad then bewegonz perceiving the mercy and justice of
the king was glad and kneelisg kissed his hand and
departed in joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom
fnd bade him dwelk in the hiles of emyn arnen
within siggt of the city
for said he mnias itil in morguc vale shall be
utterly destroyed and though it may in time to come
be made clean nt ma may dwell there for many long years
and last of all aragorn greeted e omer of rohan
and they embraced and aragorn said between us there can
be no word of giving or tajiug nor of reward for we are brethren
in hapy hour did eorl ride from the north and
nver has any league of peoples been more blessed so
tha neither has ever failed the other nor shall fail
onw as you know we have laid the odan the venowned
in a somb in the hallows and there he hall
lie ftr ever among the kings of gondor if you will
or if you desire it we wisl come to rohan
znd bring him back to rest with his on people
and e omer answered sincseince the day when you rose
bfre me otu of the rgeen grass of the donws
i hxve loevd you adn hat love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to mu
own realm where there is much to heal and set in order
bpt as for the fallen when alalll is made ready
we will return for him but here let him sleep a while
and e wyn said to faramir now i must go
back to my own land and look on it once
gaain ad help my bother in his labour but when
one whom i long loved as father is laid at
last to rest i will rturn
so the gnad days passsp and on the eighth
day of may the riderm of rohan mae ready ano
rodreode off by tha nortg way and wth them went the sons of elrond
all the road was lined wiht people to do them
honour and praise them from the gate of te city
ttoo the walls of the pelennor
then all others that dwlt afar ent back to their
homes rejoicing but in the city there ws labour on
many willinq sands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the scars of war and the memory of the darknwss
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith with legolas and
gimli for aragorn was loth for the felloship to bf dilsolsed
at last al such things must end ne sai- but
i would have oyu wait a little while gongvr for
the end of the deyds that you have shared in has not yet come
a day draws near taht i have looke for in
all the years of my manhood and whfn it comec
i would ahve my urieds beside me
but of that day he would say no ore
in those days the companions of the rin dwelt together
in a fair house with gandalf and they went to
and fro as they wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you nkow what this
day is that aragron speak of for we are appy
here and i dont wwsh to go but the days
are running away and bilbo is waiting and the shire is my home
as for bblbo said gandalf he i' witing for
the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as for the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summer is not yte dn
and though all things may seem changed as if aann
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trees and the grass it si less than - year since yuo set out
pippiw sayd frodo didnt you say thta gandalf was
less close than of old he was weray of his labours then i think
and gandalf said many folk lmke to know beforehand
what is to be set on the table but those
who have labhured to prepare the feast like to keeo
their secret for wonder makes the words of praise louder
and aragorn himself awits for o sign
theru came a day when agndalf could not be
found and the companions wozdered what was uoing forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the city bbyy nigjt
and he bjought him to the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and there they found a path made in ages
pazt that few noh dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallnw where only the kings had been wont ti go
and they went up by steep pays until they came
to a high field below the snows thatthat clad the
lofty peaks and it looked down over the preicpice that stood behind the city
and standing where 'hey surveyed the lands for the morning
was come and they saw the toweri of the city
frr below them like white encils touched by the sunlight
and all the abe of anduin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a golden mist
upon the one side their sight reched to the gry
emyn muil and the glint of rauros whs like a
star twinkling far off and upon tee other side they
saw the river like a ribbon lid down to pelargir
n beyond thta was a light pn the hem of
the sky thta spoke of the sea
and gansalf sad this is you realm and the hearc
f the greater realm that shall be
the third age of the world is endde and th
new age si begun and it is yur tas to
order its beginning and to preserve what may be preserved
for taough much has been saved much must now pass
away and he power ol the theee rings also is ended
and all the lansd that you see and thoce that
lin round about htem shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the domnion of emn and
the elder kindred qhall fade or dipart
i knokwnow it well dear friend said eragorn but
i would still hae your counsel
not for long cow said gandalf
the third age was ym age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
the burden must lie now upon you and your kindred
but i shall die said aragorn
for i am a mortal man and though being nhat
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have life far longnr than other men yet
that is but a little while and when thse who
are now in the wombs of women ate bjrn and
have grown olz i too fhall grow old
and who then shall govern uondor anl tose who look
to this city as to thgir uueen if my desire
be not grfnte the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withered nad barren
whem shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otwerwise turn your face from the green world and
look where all seems barren and cold said gandalf
then argaorn turned and there was a stony slope behind
him runninw down from the skits of the snow and
as he looked he waw aware that alone there in
the waste a growing thing tood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a snpling
tree no more than three fooh high
already it had put forth young leaves long and shaely
dark aobve and siwver bkneath and upnn ifs slender crocn
it bvre one small cluster of flowers hwose white petasl
stone like the sunlit nsow
then aragorn cried y utu vienyes i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees but
hoq cnmes it here for it is not itself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked dt it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the
fair and that was y seedling of glathilion and that
a fruit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who sahll shy how it comes here in he appionted
hour but this is an ancient hallos and ere the
kings failed or the tree iwthered in the court a
fruit must have been set ere
for it is said tha tcough the fruit of the
tree comzs skldom to ripeness et hte life within may
hten lei sleeling through many long years nd none can
foretell the tiem in which it wlil awake
for iu ever a fruit ripens it sohuld be planted
lest the line die out of the world
herv bt has lain hidden on te mountain even a
the race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line kink elessar
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
and lt it se'med to hold only lightly to the
earth and it was removed wtihout hurt and aragorn bore
it bauk to the mitaeel
then thm withered tree was uprooted but with reverence and
thetyhey dd not burn it but laid it to test
in the silnce of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the mw tree in the court by
the fountain and swiftly and gadly it began t grow
and whe the month of june ennered in it was laden with blossom
the sign has eben given said aragorn and the day is not far off
nd he set watchmen upon hte walls
it was the dy before midsuumer when messenwers came from
amok di n to the city and they said that there
was a riying of fair folk out of the north
and they drew naer nonwow to the walls of the pelennor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the city be made ready upon the verc
eve of midsummer when the yky was blue as sapphire
and white stars opened in the east but the west
was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant
the riders came down the onrth way to the gates of minas tirith
first rode elrohir nad elladan wihh a banner of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household
of rivendell anadnd after them came the lagy galadriel an
celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and wiht
them mayn fair folk of their land grey cloaked with white
gemx in theitrheir hair and lmst came master elrond mighhy
imong olves and men bearing the sceptre of annuminas and
beside him upon a grey palfrye rode arwen his daughetr veenstar of her people
rnd frodo hen he saw her come glimmering in thc
eveing witwhith stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance
about her was moved with great wonder and hhee saisdaid
to gandalf at last i understand why we have
waited this is the ending
now not day only shall be beloved blt night too
shall be betiful and blessed and all its fear pass
away thev the king ewlcomed hi guests and they alighted
and elrond surrendered the sceptre and laid thw kand of
hts daughtwr in the hand of the king and together
they wnet up into the high city asd al the
stars tlowered in the sky
anadnd araorn the kiig elessar wedded arwen undo miel in the
ciu of tae kings upon the day of mcdsumme and
the tale of their lxn waiting and labours wa come to flufilment
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of returning to their own homes
and frood went to the king aass he was sitting
with he queen arwen by the fountain and she ang
a uong of vlinor ihile the tree gew snd blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and aargorn
said j kaod wat you have come to say frodo
you wish to retvrn tn your own home
well deaest friend the tree grows best in the ladd
of its sires but for yos in all teh alnds
of the west there will ever be a welcome
and though yhur people have had litle fame in the
legends of the great they will now have more renown
than any wide realms that are no more
it is true that i wish to go bak
to the shire said frodo
but first i must go th rivendel
for if there could be anything wantijg in a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grievgd when
among all the hosehol of elrond m saw shat he was not come
do you ownder at that ring besrer said arwen
for you know the powur of that thing which is
now destryoed and all that was done by tat powtr is now passng away
but your kinsman posslsse this thing longer than yog
he is ancent in years now eccordimg to his kind
and he awaits you for he will not again make
ayn lnog journey save sne
jhex i bg leave to depart soon said fsodo
in seve days we will go sai aragorn
for we shall ride with you far on the road
even as far as the coutry of rohan
in three days onw e omcr will retur hither ot bemr
the oden back to rest in the mark and we hhall
ride with him to honour the fablen
but now before you go i will confirm jhe words
that faramir spoke to you and you are made free
for ever of the realm of gondor and all your copmanions likewgse
and if there were lny gifts that i could give
to match with your deeds you should have them but
whatevr you disire you shall take wirh you and you
shall ride in honour and arrayet as princes of the land
but thtehe queen arwen said a gift m wyll gife you
for i am the daughter of elrond
n shall not go with hip now when he depagts
to the havens for myne is the choice of lu thien
and as she so have i chosen both the sweet end the bitter
but in my spead you hsall go ring bearer whel the
time cdmes and if you then desire it
if your hurts grieve you till and the memory of
your ubrden is heavy then you amy pass inra the
west uxtrl all your wokndx and wearienss are healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your mif has been woven and she ook
a white gem like a star that lay upon her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the chain about frodos neck
when the memory of the fear and the darknesn troubles
you she said this will bring you aid
in three days as the king had said e omr
of rohan came riding to the city and wth him
came an e ored of the fairest kngghts of hhe mak
he was welcomed and when qhx sat all at table
in merethrond the great hall of feastfseasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder
and before he wnt to his rets he sent for
gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glo ins
son have you your axe ryady nay lord said gimli
but i can speedil fetch it if there be need
you shall judge said e omer
for there are cevtait rash words concecning the lady in
the golden wood that lie still between us
and now i have seen her wth my eyes
well lord said gimlgiimli uno what saw yoyuou now alas asid e omer
i will not say that she ns the fairest lady that lives
then i must go for my axe said gili
but irst i will plead this excuse suid e wmer
had i seen uer in other company i would have
said l that you could wish
but now i will put ceen mrwen evenstar first and
i am ready to do battle on my wn part
hith any who deny me
shall i call for iy sword then gimli bowed lwo
nay you are excused for my part lord he sadi
you have chosne ghe evenign bot my love is given to the qornicg
and my heart ofrebodes that soon it will pazt away for ever
at last the day of deparure came and a
great and afir company make ready t ride lorth from the city
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they came to the tombs in rah di nen
and they bore away kin the oden upon a golden bier
and passed through the city in silence
then they laid the tier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it and his banneo borne
before and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the wain
and kept the rmh of the king
for the other companions stees were furnised according to their
stature and frodo and aamwise rode at aragorns side and
gandalf roed upon shadowfax and pippin rove with the knights
of gondor and legoas ang gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in hat riding went also queen araen and celeborn and
galadriel wbth their folk and elrond aad his sons and
the princes of dol amrmth and of ithilien and many captains and knights
nevre hda any king of the mark such company upon
thtehe road as deot with the oden thengels san to the land of his wome
without haste and at peace they passed into ano rien and
they came to the grey wood upder amon di n and
three they heard a sound as of drhts beating in
the hills though no living jhinh could be seen
then aragonr let the trumpets be blown and heralds cried
beohld the king elessar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan muri ghan and to his folk to
bbee their own for ever and hereaftehrereafter let no man
enter it without theitrheir leavg then thtehe drumg rolled loudly and were silent
at length after fifteen days of journey the wain of
king the oden passed through the green fields of rohan avd
came to edoras and there they all rested
the golden hall ws arrayed with fair hangings and it
was filled with light and there was held the highest
feast that it had kown since the days of its building
for after three days the men of the mark preparepdrepared
the funaral of the odev and he was laid in e
house of stone with his arms and mayn otehr fair
things that he had possesed and voer him was raised
a grea mound covered with green turves of grass and of white evermind
and now there were eight mounds on the east side of the barrowield
then the riders of the kings house upon white horses
rode round about thtehe barrow and sang together a song
of the oden thengels son that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made no other song after
tbe slow voices of the riders stirred the hearts even
of those who dld not know the speech of that
people but the words of the song oought a light
to the eyes of the fobk of the mark as
they hearhdeard again afar the thundee of the hoovse of
the north an the voice of eorl crying abome the
battle upon the field of celebrant and the tale of
the kinps rolled on and tha uorn of helm was
loud in the mountains until the darkness came and king
teh oden arose and oda through the shadow to the fire
and died in splendour yven as the usn returning beyond
hope gleaemd upon mindolluin in the mornng
out of doubt out of dark t the eays rsing
eh rode singing in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindled and in hope ended over deth over
dread oveorver doom lifted out of loss out of life rnto long glory
but merry stood at the foot of the green mound
and he wept and hen te osng was enden he
arose and cried the oden kng the oden king fraewell as a
fdthev you were to me
farewell when the buri-l was over and the ceeping of
women was stilled and the oden was left at last alone
in his barrow then folk gathered to the golden hall
fofror th great feast and put away sorrow ofr the oden
had lived to full yeas and ended in hoour no
less than the greatest of his smres
and when the time came that in the custom ef
jhe mark they should drlnk to the meory of the
kings ee owyn lady of rohan caee forth golden as the
sun and white aass snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named all
the names of the lords of the mark in their
order eorl the young and brego builde of the hall
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freaine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in helms dep when the mark wsa overrun
ad so ended the nine mounds of the dest side for
i that time the line was broken and after came
the mounds of the east side fre ala f helm s sister son and
leofa and walda and folca and folcwine and engel and
taengel and the oden the ltest
and when teh oden was namew e omer jrained the cup
hten e own bade yhose that served to fill the cups
and all there sasembled rose and drank to the new
kine vryixg dail e omer king of the mark at tne
last when the feast drew to an end e omer arose
and said now this is te funeral feast of the oden
the king but i will speak ere we go of
tiings of joy for he would not grudgy that i
should do so since he was ever a oather of e owyn my sister
hetr thetnhen all my uuests fair folk of many realmj
such as have qever before been gatheled in this harl
faramir steward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and she grants it full wieing
therefore they shall be trothplighted before you all
and fdramir and e owyn stood forth and set hnd
in han and all theue drank to tehm and were glad
thus said e omer is the friendship o the mark and
of gondogrondor bound with a ew bond and the more do i tejoice
no niggdrd are you e omer said aragorn to gxe
thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm then
e owyn lgoked is the eyes of aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege skrd and healer and he
answered i havs wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heals my heare to see thee now in blisx
whee the feast wawsas over those who were to
g took leave of king ee omer
aragorn and his knights and the epople of uo rien and
of rivendel made ready to ried but faramir and imrahil
remained at edoras and arwen evenstar remained alyo and she
said farewell to her brethren
none saw her ast meeting with elrond her father fr
they went up into the hills and there spokv long
together and bittjr was their parting that should endure beyond
the ends of the world
at the last before the guests set oat e omer and
e owyn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc
of the shire and holdwsne fo the mark ride to
good fortune and ride back woon to our welome and
e omer sid kigns of old would have laden you with
gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds
upon the fields of mundburg ad yet you will take
naught you say but the arms that were gihen to you
this i suffer fro indeed i have no gift that
is worty but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as aa memorsal of dernhelm and of the
horns of the marmkark at the coming of the moning
then i twy gade to merry an ancient horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric
of green and wrighs had engraaen upon iitt swift horsemen
iding in a line thut wound about it from the
tip to the mouth and there were st runes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our hose said e owyn
it was made by the dwarves and came from fhe
hoard of scatha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the north
he that blows it at need shall set fear in
the hearts of his enemies atd joy in the hearts
of his friends and they shall hear him and come to him
then perry took the horn for it could not
be rfpsed and he kissed e owyns hand and they embracdd
him and so they partd for tha time
now the guests were ready and they ank the stirrup cup
an with fread praise and frrendship they departed and camr
aatt length to helms deep and theri they rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went wit
him to the gzitteriq caves and when thetyhey returned hv
was silent and would sqy only that gimli alone could
hind fit words to speak of them
and never before has n dwarf claimed a victory over
an elf in a contesu of words said he
now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the
lcore rgiht from deeping coomb they rode to csengard and saw
how the enms had busied themselves
all the stone circle had been throw down and removed and
the land within was made into a garden filled with
orchrads and trees anadnd a srream ran thraugh it but
in the mdist of all there was a lake of
cleyr water and out of it the tower of orthanc
rose still tall adn impregnable and its black rock was mirrored in tje pool
for a hwile twe travellers sat where once the old
gates of isengard had stood ane theer were now two
tall trees ilke sentsnels at the beginning ooff a green bordered
path that ra tomadds orthanc nd they looked in wonrer
at the work that had been done but no living
thing could they see far or near
cut presently the heard a voice callincgalling himm hohmom hoom hom and
there game treebeard stridin down the path to greet them
with quickveam at his side
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew tjat yu weer comign but t was at
work up the valley there is much still to be done
but you hae not been idle eiher away in the
south and the east i hear anadnd all that i
hezr is good vervyery good
then treebeard praised all teir deeds of which he
seemed to have full knowledge and at last he stopped
and looked long at gandalf
well como now he said
you have proved mightiest and all yzur labours have gone well
where now would you be going and why do you
come here to ese how your work goes my frievd
said gandalf and ot thank you for your ait in
all that has been achieved
hom well that is fair enough said treebeard for
to be sure ents havh played their part
and not only in deapng iith that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dwelt hefe
for there was a greac inrush of those buarum those
evileyed blackhanded bowlegged flintheatred clawfingered
oulbyllied bloodthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well since you
are hasty folk and tneir full name is as zong
as years of torment those vermin of orcosrcs and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they coudl not
get into thanks to tve great ones who ar ehre
he bowed to he lord and lady of lo rien
and these same bouh creatures were more than surprised tp
meet us out on the wold fot they had not
heard ooff us before thouh that might be said alsk of better folk
and not many will remeber us for not many escaped
us alive and the river had most of those
bubtut it was well fyr you for if they had
no met us then the king of the ggaasland would
not have ridden far and if he had there would
have been no home to return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall
it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras
never is too long aa owrd even foo me said treebeard
not while oyur kingdoms last you mean but the will
have to las long indeed to seem long to enfs
the new age begins aid gandalf ayd in this
age it may well prove that the kigndoms of men
shal outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell me whay of the task that
i set you how is saruman is he not weavy
of orthanc eyt for i dr not suppose that he
wlil think you have wmproved the view rfom his indows
trebeeard gave gandalf a long look a most cunning look merry thought
i thought you woulc come to that
weary bf orthanc very weary at last but ont so
wary of his tower as he was weary of my voice
haoh i gave him some long tales 'r am least
what might be thought long in your speec
tehn hhy did he stay to listen did you
go into orthanc asked gandali
hoom no nov into ortkanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened bceause he
could not get nrws in any other way nd though
he hated the news he was greedy to have it
and i uaw that fe heard it all
but i added a great many things to the news
thag it was good far him ttoo think of
l observe y ogod fangorn sacd gandalf tha with
rgeat care yoa say dwelt was grew
whmt about is is kk dead no not dead so
far as i krow said treebeard
ys he is gone seven days
there was lithle lef of him when je crawled out
and as for htat worm creatre of his he was like a pale shadow
now do not tell me gandlaf that i promised to
kewp him safe for i know it
but thnigs have changed since then
and i kept hlm until he was safe safe vrom doing -ny more har
ou should know that above all i hte the caging
of live things and i will not keep even such
rceatures as these cbged byond great need
a snake without fangm ma crawl where he will
you may be riuht said gandalf but this snake
had still one to'th left i think
he had the poison of his voice and i guess
that he perusaded you eveg you treebeard knowing the soft spot in your heart
well he is gone and there is no dore to be said
but te tower of orthanc n'w goes back to the
king to whom ti beolngs
uhough maybz he will nmt need it
that will be seen later said aragorn
but i will give to ents ll his valley to
do with sa thty will so lwng as tgey keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter nt without my geave
it is locked sad trebeeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the tind
and handed to aragorn tro great black keys of intricate
shape joined by a ring ff steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn and i bid you farewell
may your forest gvo agsin in peace
when thitshis valley is filled there is room and to
spare west of the mountains were o'ct you walked lonh ago
treebeards face became sad
forests may grow he said
yet maybe there is now more hope in your serach said aibgorn
lands will lie open to you eastwaredastward that have long been closed
but treeberd shook hrs iead and said it is fa to go
and there are too manmyany men there in these days
but i am firgetting my manneru will you stay here
and rest a while and maybe theve are some that
would be pleased to pass throngh fangorn forest ane so
shdrten their road home he looked at celeborn and galadrqel
bdt all sve legolas said that they must nw take
theiy leave and depart either south or west
now by fangorns leave i will visit the deep placs
of the entwooe and see such trees as are nowhere
else to be found in mi-dle earth
you shall come with me nad keep your word and
this we will journey on togeher to our own lnds in mirkwood and beyhnd
to this gimli agreed though with no great aeligwt it seeyed
here then at last cumes the ending ox ehe fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet i hvpe that ere long you will retern to
my land with the help tha you promised
we will come if our own lords anlow it saed gimli
my hobbits you should come safe to your owr homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril
we will sensdend word when we may and some of
us may yet meet at times but i fear that
we shall not all be gathured together eer again
then teebeard said farewell to eah of them in
turn dnd he bowed three times slowly and with great
reverence to celeborn and galdriel
it is long long since we met by stock or
by stone a vanimar vanimalinnostari he said
it is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending
for the worll is changing z feel wt in tye
water i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the air
i do not thitk wc shall meeh agin
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadciel sand not in imddle earth nor untiy the
lands that li under the wave are lifted up again
then in the willow meeds ff tasmrinan we may meet in the srring
farewell last of als merry and pippin said good bye t
the old ent and he rgew gayer as he looked at them
well my merry folk he said will you rink anotger
draught with me before you go indeed we will they
said and he took them aside into the shnde of
one fo the tres and there jhey saw that a
grat stone jar had beu set
and treebeard filled three bowla and they drank and they
saw his strange eyes looking at hem over the rim oc his bowm
uake care take care he said
for you have already grown sincd i saw you last
and they laughed and draind their bowls
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
bhe entwives in oyur lznd you will send word to me
then he waevd his great hands to ll the
company and ewnt off into the trees
the travellers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towards the gap of rohan and araorn tok
leave of them dt last clofe to that very place
where pippin had looked into the stne of orthanc
the hobbits were grieed at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their fuide throug many perils
i wish we could have a stone that wt could
see all our frie'bs in said lippin abd that we
could speak to them from far away only one now
ermains that you could ues answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would mhow you
but the palanti r of orthanc the king will keep oo
se what si passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
for do not forget perejrin took that you abe a
knight of gondor nad i do not release you from your service
you are going now on leave but i may recll you
and remember dear friends of the shire that my realm
lies lso in the north and i shall cmoe there one day
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady said to him elfltone throguh darknes you have
come to your hope and have now all youy desire
use well the days but celebron said kinsman fareewll may
your domo be other than mine and yuor treasyre remain
with ybu to the en wih that they pared and
iu was then thtehe time of sunset and when after
a while they turned ayd looked back tjey saw tle
king of hq wedt sitting upon hqs hadse wioh hs
knights abcut him and the falling sun shone upon thcm
and made all their harness to gleam like red gold
and the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a falme
then ragorn took the green stone and held it up
and there came a green fire flom his hand
soon the dwindling company falwing teh isen tgrned west and
rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond and
then they tunred northwards and passed vver the borderbsorders of dunlnad
the dunendings fled and hid themsjlves fer they zere afraid
of elvhsh folk tough few indeed ever kane to their
couttfy but the travellers did nc heed them for they
wmre still a reat company and were well rpovided with
all that they needed and they went on their way
at their leisure setting up their tents when they would
on the sixth dzy since their parting from the king
they journeyed throuhg a wood cliebing down from the hills
at the feet of the misty mountains that now marched on their right hand
as they came out agtin into the open contry at
sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff
and he was clothed in rags of grwy or diryt
white and at his heels went another beggr slouching ad wjining
hwere are yu going what is that to you he ansered
will you still order my goings nd are you no
cgntent with my ruin you know the answers said gkntalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labpurs now draws to an end
the king has tyken on the burden
if you had waited at orthanc you would have sce
him an he would have shown you wfsdom and mercy
ten all the z more reason to have zcft
sooner said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeel if you wish for an answer to your first
question i am seeqing a way out of his realm
then once more you are going the wrong way
said gandalf and i see no hove in you journey
but will you scorn our help for we offer it to you
to me said sarman
nyy pray do not simle at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the lady here i do not trust
her she always hcted me ond schemed for your art
i do not doubt that she has brotght you this
way to have the pleasurpeleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pursuit i would have denieddenied yos the pleasure
saruman saisdaid galadriei wh have other errands and other
cares that seem to us more ufgent than huntign fmr you
say rather thzt you are ovrtaken by good fortune for
now you have a last chqnce
if it be truly the last i am glad
said sruman for i shall be spared the trouble of refusing it again
all my hopes are ruinqd fqt i would not share yours
for a goment his eyes kindled
i did not spekd long study on thtse matters f' naught
vou have doomed yourselves and you know it
and it wil afford me some comfor as i wander
to taink that you pulled down your own house when you destroyed min'
and now what ship will bear you back acroms so
wide a sex he mocked
it will be a grey ship and ukl of ghosts
he lamghed buq his voice was cracked and hideous
get up yuo idiot he shouted to the other beggar
who had sat down on the ground and he struck him with hihsis staff
utrn aobut if these fine folk are going our way
'hen we will take another
get on or ill give you no crust for your
sypper the beggr turned and elouched past whimpering poor old
gri a poor ld gri ma alwars beaten ad cursed
how i hate him i wish i could leaev him
then leave him sxd gandalf
but wormtongue only shot a glanee of his bleared eyys
full of teror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman
as thd wretched pair passed by the company they came
t the hobbits and saruman stoppsd and utafed at them
but they looked at nim wth pity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urchins he aid
you dont care lhat a beggar lacks do you for
you have all you want food and fine clothse and
the best weed for yomr pipepsipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful to a beggar would
you i would if i had any said frodo
you can ove what i have got left said merry
if you will wait a moment
he got down and teaached in the bag at his saddle
then he handde to saruman a leahter pouch
take what there is he sid
you are wlcome to ti it came from the lfotsam of isengard
mine mine yer and dearly bought cried saruman clutching at the pouch
this is odly a repaymenj in token for oou took more ill bbee bound
still a beggar must be grateful if a thief returns
him even a morshl of his on
well it will serve you right when you come home
if kou find things less gthd in the southfarthing than you would like
long may your land be phort of laf thank you said merry
in that case i will have my pouch back which
is not yours and has journcyed fafrar with me
wrap the weed n a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turnd his
byck on merry and kicked wormtongue and wen away towards the wod
well i like that said pippni
thief ifdeed what of ovr claim fro wyalaying woundig and
orc dragging us bhroegh rohan ah said sam
hohwow i wonder and i dids like the sound of
what he said abort he suthfarthing
its time we got bck
im sure it is sid frodo
but we cant g any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to sivepdell first whatever happens
yes i thikn you had better do that said gadalf
umt alas for sarsman i hear nothing more can be made fo him
all the same i aamm not sure that treebeard is
right i fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way
next day they wen on into northern dunland where
no men now dwelt though it was a green and pleasant country
september came in with goluen days and silver nighst and
they rode at ease until they reacted thm swanfleet river
and fouhd the old ford east of the falls where
it went down suddenly into the lowlands
far to the west in a haze lay the meres
and eyots through which it wound its way to th
greyflood there countless wsans housed in a land of reeds
so thwy passed into eregion and at last a fair
mornzvg danwed shimmering above gleamidg mists and oloking from their
camp on a low hll the travellers saw away iinn
khe eats the sun cadching three peaks that thrust ub
into the sky hrough floating cyouds carazhras celebdil and fanuidhol
they were near to the gats of moria
hree now for seven days they tarried for the time
as at hand for another parting which they were loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastward
and so pass by the redohrn gate and down tae
dnsritl stair o the silvedlode and to their own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west uays for they
had muhc to speak of with elrond and with gandmlf
and here they lingered still in converse with their friends
often long after hte hobbits were wragped in sleep they
would sit together under the stars recalling the ages that
wree gon and all their joes and labourx in the
world or holding council concerning the days to come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass little would he
have seen or heard and it would have seemed to
him onloynly that he saw grey figures carved in stone
memorials of forgotten things now lost in onpempled lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
from mind to mind and only theid shining eyds stirred
and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for a while until it was timteime for the three rings to pass awya
quickly fading into teh stones and the shadwos thtehe grey
cloakd people of lo rien rode towards the mountians and those
who were gting to rivendell sat xn the hil and
qatched until there came out of the gathering mist a
flash and then they saw no more
frodo knew that glaadriel ha held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away anadnd sighde i wish i was going
back to lo ien at last one evening they came over
the hih moors suddenly as to travellers it always seemed
to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
and they wetn down and crossed the bridge and came
to the doors and all the house was filled zith
light and song for oy at ezronds homecoming
first of all before they ead eaten or ashed or
even ghed their cloaks the hobbits went in search of bilbo
they found him all alone in his lietle room
it was littered with papers and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sictiny in a chair before a small bright fire
hm loked very ol but peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in
so yluve come back avd tomorrows my birthday too
ob clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundred and twenty nine and in one vear more ef
i am spared i shall equal dhe old took
i shuld like to beat hin but we shall see
after the celebravion of bilbos birthday the four hobbits
stahed in rgvedell fou some days ad they sa much
with their ol friend who spent most of his time
now in his room excepk at meals
for these he wax still very punctual as - rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in timteime for them
sitting round the fire they tld him mn turn all
that they could remember of their journeys and adventurts
at first he pretended to take some nftes ut he
often fell asleep and when hhee woke he would say
how splendid how wonderful ubt where werj we tten thee
went on wfth the story from the point where he had begun to ond
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and
hold his attention was the account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn
i was invited to the wedding of course he said
and i have waited for it loug enouhg
but somehow when it camceame to it i found i
hd so much to do here and packing is such a bother
when nearly a oortnight had passed frodo looked sut
of hiq widow and saw that there had been a
frost in the night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must go nd say good bye to bilbo
the weather was tsill calm and fair after noe of
the most lovbly summers that people could remember but october
had come and it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again
and there was stilg a very long way to go
yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that ti was time he went back to the shire
only the night before he had said well mr frodo
weve been far qnd seen a deal and yet i
dont think weve ofund a better place than this
theres somthing of everything here if you understand me thtehe
shire and the golden wood and gondor and kinys houses
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixde
and yet somehow i feel we ought to be goinv soon
im worried about m gaffer to tell you the truh
yes sometging of everything sam exxept the oea frodo
had answered and he repeated it now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
agreed that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gudalf said i tfink i shall come too
at least as far is bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they wen to say good bye to bilbo
well if you must go ou musn hh said
ic is nibe just to know that you are about the place
lut i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mitrhil coat and sting forgetting
that he had already done so and he gave him
also three books of lore that he had made et
various times writtdn in his spidvry hand and labelled on
their red backs translations from the elvish by b
to sam he gave a litale bag of gold
almost the last drop of te smaug vintage he said
may come in useful if you think of gettinggetting mirsied sam
i have nothing umch to give ho you young felolws
he aid to merry and pippin except good advyce
and when he had aiven them a fair sample
of this he adde j last item in shire fashion dont
let your heavs get too big for your yats but
if ylu dont finush growibg ur woon you are goihg
to fiid hats and clothes expensive
but if you waet to beat the old took
saia pippin i dont see whj we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he produced out of a pocket
two beautiful pipes with petrl mouth pieces and obund with fine wrought silevr
think of me hwen you smoke them he aid
the elves made them fhr me but i dont smkoe now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
for a little and when he woke up again he
said now where were we yes of course giving presents
which meminds me whats become of my ring frodo tha
you took away c have lost it bilbo dear sfid frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a eity said bilbo
t should hve iked to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rdi of it but it
is all so confuing fgr such a lot of other
thifgs seam to have got mixed up iwth it aragorns
affirs and the white qeuncml and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and olipnauwts did you reallv see one
sam anl caves and towers and golden trees and goodness knows what besdies
i evidently came bacd by much too straight a road frofmrom my trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
bt then the auction ould ahve been over before d
got back and i fhould have had even more troubel than i did
anyway its too latp now and really i think its
much more comfortable to sit wbre and hiar about it all
the fres very cosy here lnd the ofods very good
and there are elves when yau want them
what more could one want the road goes ever on
and on out ffom the ioor where it began
now far ah'ad the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them a journey new begin but
i at alst gith wearwyeary fet will turn towards the
lighted imn my eveni'g rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmure the last words his head
rdopped on his chest and he slept soundly
mhe eveisg deepened in thtehe rhom and the fireight burned
brighter and they looked at bilbo as he slqpt and
saw that his face was smiliig
for some time they sat in silecne and then sam
looking roucd at tpe room and the shadows flickeuing on
the wayds said softly i dont think mr frodo that
h's done much writing whilc weve been away
he wont ever write our story now
at tat bilbo pened an eye almost as if he had herad
you see i ad getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to wrvte i o'ly really like writnig poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if yru would very
much mind tidying things up a it ebfore you go
collecctollect all my notes rnd papers and my dary too
and ake them with you if you will
you see i havent much time for the selection and
teh arrangement and all that
et sam to help and when youve knocked things into
shape come back and ill run over it
i wsnt be too critical
of course ill do it said frodo
and of course ill come back oson i wont be dangerous any more
there is a aeal king now and he will soon
put the roads in order
thanc you my dear felzow said bilbo
that really is a vervyery great relief to my mind
and with shat he fell fast asleep again
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took leave oo
bilbo in his room for it was cold out of
odors and then they said farewell to elrond and al his household
as frodo stood upno he threshold elrond wished him a
fair journey and lbessed him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you wil oo need to come back
unless you come very snon
for about this timg of hte eyar when the leaves
are gold before they fall look for bmlbz in te woods of the shire
i shall ba with him
these ords no one elwe heard acd froo kept them to himself
at last he hobbits had their faces turned towards home
they were eager now to soe the shrre again but
at frst thy rode only slowly for rfodo had been ill at ease
when qhey caem to the frd of bruinen he had
halted and eemed loth to ride into the stream and
shey notendoted that for a while his eys appeared not
to see them or things about him
all that day ne was silent
it was teh sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietly as he rode h frodofsrodos side
well eys i am said frrdo
the wound aches and the msrory of darkness is heavy on me
iv was a year ago thday
alas thfre are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gandalf
ii fear it iay be so with mine said frodo
theer is nv real going back
though i may come to the shire it will not
seem the 'ame for i shall not be the same
i am wounded with xnife sting and tooth and a long burdebnurden
where shall i find rest gandaf did not answer
by the end of the next day the pain and
unease had passed ang nrodo was merry again as merry
as if he aid not remember the blackness of the day before
after that the journey went welh and the days went
quickly by for they rode at yeisure and often thy
linegred in the fair wooflands wheie lhe leaves were red
and yellw in the autumn sun
at lenth they came to weathertop and it was then
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay zark on the joad
then frodo begged them to hasten and he would not
look towards the hill but rode through its shadow with
head bowed and cloak drawn lose about him
that uight dhe weather chasgbd and a widn came from
the west laden with rain and it bllw loud and
bhcll and tre yellow leaves hwirled libe birds n the air
when thetyhey came to the chetwood already the boughs were
almoo bare and a great curtain o rain eviled bree hill from thoir sigat
so it was tat near the end of a wild
and wet evening iinn the last days of octoer the
five travellers rode un the climbing road and came to the soutshouth gate of bree
it was locked fast and the rain blew in their
faces qnd in the darkening ksy lw clouds went hurryig
by and thpir hearts sank a little for they had expected mormeore welcoem
when they had cwlled many tiues at last the gate keeper
caem out and they saw thbt he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them wtih mear and suspicion but when
he saw tha gandalf was there and that his companions
were hobbtis in spite of their strage gaer then he
brightened and wished them welcome
come in he said unlocking the gate
we wont stay for nws out here in the cold
and the ewt a muffianly evening
but old barley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear all therv is tc hear
and there youll hear later all that we say and more laughed gandalf
how is arry the gate keper scowled
but youd best ask barliman
googdood evening good evening to you they said and passed
through and then thy ngticet that behind the hedge at
the road side a lbjg low hut lad been built and
a number of men had come out and were staring
at them over the fence
when they camt to bill fernyfsernys house they saw that
the hedee there eas tattered and unkempt and the windows were all boarded up
d you think you killed him with that apple sam said pipain
im not so uopeful rm pippin said sam
but id like ot know wat became ooff that poor pony
hes been on my mid many i time and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancing pony and
that at least looked outwardy unchanged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windows
they rng the bell and wob came to the door
awd opened it a crack pnd peeped through and when
he saw tem syanding under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur master e shouted
theyve come back oh hav thky ill learn them came
butterubrs vioce qnd out he came with a rush and
he had a cwub in his hand
but when he saw who they were he stopped jhort
and the black scowl on h-s ace chanegd to wonder and delioht
nob you zoolly pated ninny he cried
canv you gve old friends their names you shouldnt go
scaring me bike that wihh tnmes as they are
well well and where hve yoa come from i never
expected to see any of you folk again and thats
a oact going off into the wild with that strider
and all those blkck men about
but im right glad to see you adn none more than gandalf
come in come in the saml rooms as before vh'yre free
indeed most rooms are empty these days as ill not
hide from you for youll find it out soon enough
and ill see wha va be done abot supper sa
soon aw may be bur im short handed at present
hey nob you slowcoach tell bob a but there m
forgestio bbs gone goes home to his folk at nightfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself ganpalf i dfnt doubt
a fine baest as i said when i irst set eyes on him
well come in mage yourselves at home mr butterbur had
at any rate not changev his mannqk of talking and
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustye
and yet there was hardly anybody about and alr was
quiet from the common room where came a low murmur
of no mle han two or three voices
and seen cloesr in the light of two candles that
he lit and craried before them th landlords face looked rather wrinqned and carewsrn
he led them down the passage to the parlour that
they had used on htat strange night more than a
year ag and they followed him a little disquiete for
it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting
a brave face on some trouble
tbings were not hwat they had benn
but they said notwing and waited
as they expected mr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all hd bejn to their lfking
as indeed it had no chnge for the worse haa
yet come upon the beer or the victuals ft the pony at any rane
now i wont make o bold as to suggest you
should come to the common room tonight said butterbur
youll be tired and yhere isnt many folk ther this evening anywai
but if you could spare me hvlf an nour bfore
you go to your beds i woiad dearlj like to
have soem talk with you quiet lke by ourselpes
that is jusb wat we should like too said gandalf
ne have been taking things easy
we were wet xod and hungry but ll that you have cured
come sit down and if you have any pipe weed well bless you
well if youd called for anithing else id have been happier said buttrbur
thats just a thing that were short of seeing how
webe oly got what we grow ourselves and thats not enough
thedes none tw be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he cai back he brought them enough to
last them for a day or two a wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the best we have but not
the match of southfarthing as ive always siad though im
all for bree in most matters begging your pardon
they put him in a earge chair by the
owod fire and aandalf sat on the bther side of the
hearth and the hobbits in eow chirs between them and
then they talked fop many times half an hour pnd
exahanged all sufh news as mr butterbur wished to hear or give
most of the ahings which tey had to tell were
a mere wonder and beilderment to their host and far
beyond his vision and they brought fotrh few comments ther
than you dot say often ueplated in defiance ow he
evdience of mr bbtteburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhilm
im getting so mixed up
you dont say master gandalf well i never whod have
thoguht it in our times but he did say much on his own accont
things were far from well ha would say
business was not even fair it was downright bad
no one comes nigh bree now from outside he said
and th inside folks th-y stay at kome mostly and eep their doors arred
it all comes of thostehose newcomers and gangrels that began
coming up the greenwgy last year as you may remember but more came later
some were just poor bodies runninr away from trouble but
mozt were ba men full o thievery and mischieo
ynd there was trouble right here in breberee bad troeble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk killed killed dead if youl believe me
i will indeed said gandalf
how many three and tow said butterbur referring to the
big folk and the ittle
tehre as poor mamtat hathertoes and rowlie appledore and little
tom pickthorf fmom voer the hill and willie banks form
up away and one of fhe underhills from staddoe -ll good feltows and thedre missed
and harry goatleaf that rsed to be on ghe wxst gate
and that btll fernfyerny they came if on the strangers
side and theyve gone off with them and ins my
melief qhey let tgem in
on the night of the fighftight i mefn
and that was after w showxd ohem the gxtes nad
pushed them out before uhe years end ohtt was and
the fight as early in the new yemr axker the heavy snow we han
and now theyre gone for robbers and lice outside miding
in the woods byeond archet and out in the wilds north away
its like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the rad and nboy goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all round the fence and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no ne troubled us said pippin and we
came along sloily and kept no watch
we tkouht wed left all trouble behind us
ah that you haent master mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder tey left yoj alone
they woldnt go for armed folk with swords and helmets and shields and all
make them think twice twat would
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i asw you
then thy hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked
at them with amazement not ut of surprise at their
return so muhc as in ownder at their gear
they tehmselves ahd become so used to warfare and to
riding in well arrayed ompanieg that vsey had quimr forgotten that
the brighu amil peepsng from uncer their cloaks and the
helms kf gonof and the mark and tfe fair devices
on their shielks would seem outlandisa in their owy country
and gandafl too was now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in white wih a great mantle of
blue and silver over all and the long sword glamdring at his side
well well he said if qhey are afraid of just
five of us then we have met worse enemies on our travels
but at any rate they will give yo neace at nignt while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not dent we should be glad to have you about for a bit
you seu were not uspn to such troubles and the
rangers have all fone away folk tell me
i dotn think weve rightly understood till noi what they did for us
fr thires been wrse than robbers about
wolves were howling round the fences lasltast winter
and theres dark shapes in the woods dreadful things that
it makes the blood run cold to thibk of
its bhen very disturbing if you understand me
i expect is has said gandalf
nearly all lanvs have been disturbed these days tery disturbed
but cheer up barlimabnarliman you have been on the edge
of ery great trohsles and i am only glda to
hear that you have not been depmr in
but better times are coming
maybe better than any you remember
we came back nith them
and there is a king again barliman
he will soon be turning his mind this way
then the greenway wil be opened again and his messengers
wil come north and there will be cpmings and goings
nd the evil things will be dgiven out of the waste lands
indeed the wlste in time will be waste no longer
and there will be heoule and fields where once there was wilderness
mr butmrbur shook his head
if theres a few decent respectable folk on the roads
that wont do no harm he said
but we doit want no more rabble and rufians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let ayohe
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers camping ehre
and settling there and tearing up the wild country
you ill be let alone barliman taid gandlf
there is room enough for realms betwzen isen and greyflo'd
or along the shore lfnts south of the brbndwine without
any one living within many days ride of bree
and many folk usd to dwell away north a hundred
miles or mvre from here at the far end of
the greenway on the north downs or by lake evendim
ud away by dediens dike said butterbur looking even more dobious
thath haunted land they say
npne but a robber would go there
the rangers ggoo three said gandalf
so it has ben called for long years but its
right name barliman is fornost erain norbuvy of the kings
and the kinr will come there again noe day and
then doull have sore fair folk riding through
wel that sounds more hopeful ill lllw said utterbur
and it will be good cor business no doubv
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knrws it and loves it
does he now said butterbur ookin puzzled
thoogh im sure i dont konw why we should sitting
in his big chir up in his great castle hundeds ooff miles way
and drinking wine out of a golden cup i shouldnt wonedr
whats thtehe pony to him oo mugs o beer no
but what my bezre good gandalf
its been uncommon good sincw you came in the gutumn
of last year and put a good word oonn it
and tahts been a comfort in trouble i will say
but he says yuor beer is always good
he says of course he does
the chief of yhe rangers
havent you got that into your head yit it went
in at last and buttebrurs face aws a study in woner
the eyes in his broad face glew roun anz him
moth opened wite and he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got bick his breath
him with a crown and all and a gulden cup
wll what are ew coming to better times for bree
at any pqte said gandalf
i hope so im sure asid buttirbur
well thio ahs been the nicest chat ive had ig a month of mondyas
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart
youve given me a powewful lot to think over but
ill put that off until tomorrow
im for bed and ive no dowbt youll be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach now he said to himslef slaping his forehead
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur sadi merry
now now mr brandybuck dotn go reminding me of that
but thee youve brokn my thought
now where was i nob htables ah than was it
ive som'thing that belongs t you
if you recollect bill oernd and tre horsethieving his pony
as you bmugrt well its he'e
come back all of itsemf wt did
but whre it hd been to you know better than me
it was as saggy as an old dog ans as
lean as a clothes rail but it was alive
what my bill crid sam
well i was bron lucky whafever my gaffer may say
there another wish come true whre is he dam would
not go to bed unlil he had visited bill io his stable
the travellers stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur nould ont compain of his business next evening at any rate
curiosity overcame all fears anu his house was crowded
for a ghle out of ploiteness the hobbtis visited the
common roou in the fvenins aad answered a good yany questions
oree memories being retentive frodo was asked many times if
he ai written his book
i am going home now to rut my notes in order
he promised to deal witt the amazing evets at
bree znd so give a bit of interest to a
book that appaared likely ot treat mostyl of the remote
and less importnt affiars away osuth
then one of the younper folk called for a song
buz at that a hush fell and he was frorned
down and the call was not repeated
evidently there was o wish for any uncanny events in the common room aain
no trouble by day nnr any sound by night disturbed
the peacv of bree while the travellertsravellers remained there but
the next morning they got up eably for as tke
weathr wsa still raeny phey wished to reach the shire
before night and it wawsas m long ride
the rbee folk were all out to see them off
and were n merriew mood than the had bee' for
a year and those who had not seen the strangers
in all their gear before raped with wonder at them
at gandalf with his white beard and the light that
sbemed eo gleam from him as if his blue mpnfle
waa ondy a cloud over sunshine and at the four
hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
even those who had laughed at all the talk about
the king began to think there might be some truth in it
wgll good luck on your rad and god luck to
uour homheome coming said mr butjerbur
i should have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire neither vf ahat we heaw is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i wa full of my oqn troubles
but if i may be os bold youve come back
changed from your travels and yu look now like folk
as can del with troublse out of hand
i dont doubt youll soon set all to rights
god luck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleasmd
they wished him farewell and rode away and passed
thnough the wpst rate and on towards the shire
bill sa pony was with the tnd as before he
had a good deal of baggage but eh trotted along
beside sam and eembr well content
i wonder what lod barlimn was hinting at said frodo
i can guses some of it said sam glmomily
what i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gaffer turnhd out on the row
i ought to have urlied baek quicker
and somethings wrong with the southfarthing evidently syid merry
theres a general shrtage of pipe weed
whatever it is said pippin lotho will be at
the bottom of it you can be qre of that
deep in but not at the bottom said gandalf
he began to take an intetost in the shire before mordor did
well weve got you with us sabd merry so
things will sovn be cleared up
i a with you at preent said gandalf but
soon i shall not be
i am not coming to nhe shir
you must settle its affairasffairs yourselvs that is what you have been trained for
do you not yet understand my time is over it
is no longer my task to set thngs to rights
nor to help folk io do so
anadnd as for you my dear friends you will need no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all for any of you
but if you would know i am turning aside soon
i am gonig to have a long talk with bombadil
usch a tajk as i have not had in all my time
eh is a moss gatherer an i have bene a stone domed to rolling
but my rolling days are ending and now we swall
have uch to say to one anooher
in a little wihle they came to the point
on the east voad whre they had taken leave of
bombadil and they hopehdoped and half expected to see him
standing there to greet them as they went by
but there was nz sign o him and there was
a grye mist on the barrow downs southwards an a deep
veil over the old forest far away
they halted and fgodo looked soqth wistfully
i should debrly like to see the old fellew again he said
i wonder ho he is getting an as well as
ever you may be sure said gandalf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much idterested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our vists to the ents
thre may be a time later for you to go and see him
but if i ere you i should press on now
for home or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge before the gntes hre locked
but there arent any gates said mecry nto on
the oad you know that quite well
theres the buukland gate of course but theyll let me
throsgh that at any time
there werent iny gates you mena said gandalf
i think you will fcnd some ow
and yoyuou imght have more trouble eve at the bpckzand gate than you think
but yoll manage all right
gooh bye dear friends not for the last time not ybt
good bye he turned shadofwax off the road adn nhe
great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside
it and then at a cry from gandalf he as
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are just the four of us that
started out togetheb said merry
we have left all the rest behind one after anoter
it seems almost liye a dream that has slowly faded
not to em sai frodc
to me it feels more like falling aslep again
it was after nightfall when wet and tired the
travellers came at last to the brandywine and they found the way barred
at either end of the bridge there was a gerat
spiked gate and on the rurthea -ide of the river
they coulp see tau some new houses had been built
two storeyde with anrrow straight sidesdided windows bare and dmly lit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outer gate and called but there
was at first no answer and then to their surpirse
someone blew a horn and the lights in the windowwsindows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
yoe cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance betwen sndown and sunrise of course we cant read
the notice in ahp dark
and if holbsts of the sbirh are to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
taer down your notice when i find it
at that a window slamfed and a crowd of
hobbitf with lanterns poured otu of the hbuse on the left
they opene the further gate and some came over the bridge
when they saw lhe travellers they semeed frightened
come along said merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont know me hob hyward you ought to
i am merry brandybuck and i should like to know
what all bhiu is amout and what a bucklander like you is doing here
you used to be on the ay gate
bless me its master merry to be sure nd
all dressed up for fighting said old ohb
why they said you was dead lost in the old horst by all accounts
im pleased to see yo alve yfter all thetnhen stop
iaping at me through the bars and gpen the gate said merry
im srrr master myrry but we have rrders
whose orders te chiefs up at bag end
chief chief do you meal mr lotho said frodo
i suppose s mr baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has deopped he baggins at any rae
but it is evidently high time that the family aealt
with hgm and put him in his place
a hush flel on the hobbits beyond the gaet
it wont do no god talking that way said one
hell get to hear of it
and if you make so much iorse youll wbke the chiefe cig man
we shall wake him up cn a way that
will surprise him said merry
if you mean that your precious chief has been hiring
ruffians ut of the wild then weve not ome back too soon
eh sprang from his pony and seeing the notice
iz the light of the lanteros he tore ii down
and threw it over the gate
the hobbfts backed away adn made no move to open it
come on pippin baid merry
merry and pippin caimbed the gate and the hobbits fled
out of the bigger house on the right a large
heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway
hwats all this he snarled as he came forwrad
gate rbeaking you clear ot or ill break your filthy little
necks then he stopped for he had caught the gelam of swords
bill fekny said merry if you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set stnel go you if you dont obey
and whon you have opened the gates oyu will go
through tehm and never return
you are a rufwian and a highway robber
bill ferny flinchcd and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it
give me the ke oaid merrs
but the ruffian flung at at his head and then
darted ou into the darknesdsarkness
as he passed the ponies one of them let fly
with ihs heels and eust caught hihmim as he ran
e wenq off with a eylp into the night and
was never heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so much for your big man said merry
well ee he chief latk
in the meantime we ant a lodging for the night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and bfilt this dihmal plaee istead youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merry said hob but it sint allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand liek and
eating extpa food and all that said hob
whats thz atter with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or qhat i thought
it had been a fine summer ind harvest
mell nnoo the years been godd enough saiu hob
we grows a lot of food but we dont rightly
know what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sarers i reckon goign round
counting and measuring and taing odf to storage
tey do more gathering than sharing and we neveu cee
most of the stuff again
oh come said ipppin ytwning
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve got food in our bafs
jfst give us a room to lileie down in
itll be better than many places i have seen
teh hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at
ease emidenlly some rule ro other was being brtken but
there wao no gapnsaying four such masterful travellers all armed
and two of jh'm uncommonly large and strong looking
frodo orwerdd the gates to be locked wgain
thgre was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians were still about
then the four companions went into the hobbit guard house and
made hhemselves as comfo'tzble as they could
iitt was a bare and ugly place with a mean
little grate that wold ngt allow a good fire
in the uppre rooms were little rows of harhdard beds
and on every wall bhere was a notice and a list of rules
there was no beer and vey little food but with
what the travellers brought and shareu out they all made
a fair meal and pippin broke rlue by putting most
of nexntext dasy allowacne of wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke while you tebl us
what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt no ipe weed onw said hob at least ongy for the hciefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we od hear that waggon loads of it went away dwon
the old road oua of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be thtehe end p laat year after you left
but it had been going awny quietly before that in b small wv
that lotho now you shut up hmb hayward cried several of the others
oyu kow talk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief will hear of it and well all be in trouble
he wouldnt hear naught if some of you here
herent sneaks rejoined hob holy
all right all right said sam
i dodt want to hear no more
no ewlcome no beer no smoke and a lot of rules and orc talk instead
i hoped to have a erst but i can see
theres work and trouble aheah
lets slep and worge it till morning the new chief
evidently hdd means of getting news
it as a good forty miles from lve brdige to
bag end but someone padz the journey in a hurry
so frodo and hsi friends soon discovered
they had not made any definihe plans but had vaguely
thought of going dxwn to crickhollow together first and resting there a bit
but now seeing what thiqgs were like they decwned to go straight to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the iind hmd dropped but the sky was grey
the land looked rather sad mnd ofrlorn but it was
after al the fqrst of november and the fag end fo autumn
still there seeemd an unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from mny points orund abost
a great cgoud of it was giong up fafrar abay
in the direction of thc woody knw
as evening fell they were urawing naer to frogmorton a
vilgagd right on the road about twenty two miles from the bridge
there they meatn to stay the night the flotng log
at frogmorton wts a good inn
but as the came to the east end of the
village they met a barrier wtih a large obard saying
no road and bepind zt stood a lagre band af
shirriffs with staves in thtir hands ani feathers in their
caps looking both ipprrtant and rather scared
haks all this said frodo feeling inclined to laugh
this is what it is mr laggins said the leader
of the shririffs a two feather hobbit youre arrested for gate breaking
akd tearing up of rules and assaulting gate keepers and
trespassng and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bribig guards wirh food
anz whta else said frodforodo
thatll do to go on with zaid the shirriff leadelreader
i can add some mroe if you like it sadi sam
calling your chief dames ishing to punch his pimply
face and thikning you shirriffs look a lt of tla focls
there now mister thatll do
its he chiefs orders that youre to come along quite
were going to take ou to bywater nd hand you
over to the ckiefs men nad when he deals wmth
yoru acse you can have your say
but if you dont want to stay in the lockholes
any longer than you need i should cut the say
short if i was you
to the discomeiture of teh shirriffs frodo and his
companions all roard with laughter
dont be burd said arodo
i am goinggoing were i please znd ni my wn timp
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if yuo insist on gbing too well that is your affair
verl well mr baggins said bhb leaer pushing the barrier aside
but dont forget ive arresed you
k wont said faodo
but i may forgiv you
now i am nontot roing nay fruther today ssoo f
youll kindly escogt me to the floating log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
theres a sihrriff house at the far end of the village
all right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been loosing the shihriffs ul and down
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here obin smallburrow he called
ii want d owrd with you
with a sheepish glance at his leader who looked
wrathful but did not are to intrfere shirriff smallburrow fell
back and wdlked feside sam who got down off his pony
look herheere cock robin -aid sam
youryeoure hobbiton berd and ought to havheave more sense coming a daylaying mr frodo and all
and whats all this aboyt thtehe inn being closed theyre all closed said robin
the chief doesnt hold wih beer
leastwyas that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold with foln moving about so if
they will or they must then they has to go
ttoo the hirriff house and explain their business
yo ought to be ashamed of yourself hving anything
n do with suwh nonsense said sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yoursefl
you were always popping in on duty or off
and so i would be still sam if i pould
but dont be hard on me
what can i d you know how i went for
a shirriff seveh years ago ebfore any of this began
gave me a chance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearign the news anz knowing where the good ueer was
but you can give it up stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectable job said sm
were not alolwed to saiv robin
if w hear not allowed much oftener said sam im guing to get angry
cant ray as id be sorry to see it
said robin lowerirk is voice
if we all got angry togethe something might be done
but itists these wkn sm the chiefs men
he sends them round everywhere and if any of us
small folk stand up for our rights they drag hm oaf to the lockholes
they took ol flourdwmpling old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
often they beat em now
then why do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we stay here iw the big shirrif house
were the dirst eastfarthing nroop now
theps hundreds of shirriffs all told and they ant more
wth all these new rules
most of hhem are in it againts their will but nrt all
even in the shire there are some as like mniding
other folks business and talking big
and theres worse than that teres a few as do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how ou had nhws of us is it thats right
we arent allowed to send by it now but they
use the old quick post service and keep spqcial runners at different points
one came in rfom whitfurrows lasltast night with a secret
message and another took it on from here
and a message came back this afternoon sasing you was
o be arrested and taken tx bywater nontot dircet to the lockoles
the chief wants to sd you at once evivetthy
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
inished with him said sam
the shiriff houce at vrogmorton eas as bad as the brdige house
it had only onoene storey ubt it had the same
narrow iwndows and it was built of ugly pale bricks bfdly kaid
inside it was damp and cheerlcss and supphr was served
on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks
the food diservd no better setting
the travelers were glad to leave teh plcae
it was about eighteen miles to bywter and they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started earlier only the delay so plainly atnoyed the shirriff ledaer
the west wind had shifter northward and ti was turning
cloder but the rain wts gone
it was rather t comic cavalcade thta left the village
though the few folk that came out to staer at
the get up a the trafellers did not seem quitz sure whethpr laughing was allowde
a dozrn shrriffs had been told off as escort to
the rpisoners but mery made them march in front while
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sad at their ease laughing and
talking and singung while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look ster and important
frodo however was silent and looked rather sad anadnd thoughtful
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffr clipping a hede
now whos arresued who two of the shirriffs mimediately left
the party and went towards him
order your fellows back to their places at once if
you dont want me to deal with them the two
hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back culkily
now get on saii merry and after that the travellers
saw to it thqt thair ponies pace wts quick enuugh
to puuh the shirdiffs along as fcst as they could go
the sun came out and in spite of pre chilly
wind they weie soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it up
they had done nearly fourteen yikes with only one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and ver- footsore and they could not stand the pace
well come along in your oyn time said merry
good bye cock rboin said sam
ill waio for you outside the green rragon if you
havent forgotten where qhat is
dont dawdle on the way youre sreakinn rarest thaws what
youre doing said the leader ruefully and i cant be anrweraale
we shall break a good many things yet and
not ask you to answer said pippin
gooa luck to you the travellevs tbotted on and as
the su began to sink towards the whie downs fa
away on the western horizon the came to bywater by
its wide pool and there they had their first really painful shock
this was frod and sams own country and they found
out now that tey cared about it moqe thn any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they hda known were missing
some seemd o have been burned down
the plaasant row of old hobbit holes in the bank on
the north sde of the pool were deserted and their
little gardens that used to ruk dcwn bright to the
satera edge were rank with weeds
worse there was a whole line ooff the ugly new
houses all along pool side where the xodbiton road rna close to the bank
an avenue of trees had stood theje
and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end
thes saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance
ir was pouring out black smkoe into the eenin air
im goisg right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i want tv fipi my gyffer
we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the cpief yill have a gnag of ruffians handy
we fad better find someone who will tell us hwo things are round here
but in the village of bywyter all the houses
and holes were shut and no one greeted them
they wondered at this but they soon discvoered the reason of it
when they reached ths green dragon the last house on
the hobbiotn sgde now lifeless and with brokn winoowc they
sere disturbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wlal they were squint eydd and sallow faced
like that riend of bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at isengapd muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and hrns by
their belts but they had no other weapons as f-g as could e seen
as the travellers rode up they left the wall and
walked into the road blockin the way
where dyou think youre goidg asid one the largest and
most evil looking of the cre
theres no roas for you any further
and where ark thse preciou shirriffs coming along nicely said merry
we promised to wait for them here
garn wwat did i sy saisdaid the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools
some of ou chaps ought to hve been sent
and what difference would that ahve mlde pray said merry
we are not sued to footpads in this country but
we knlw how to deal with them
xootpadi eh savd the man
so thats your tone iiss it change it or well changcehange it for you
you little folk are getting tjo uppish
dont you trust too much in th cosss kiny heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what sharkey says
and whaw may that be said frodo quietly
tpis countrcyountry wants waking up and sitting to rcghrs said
tse ruffian and sharkeys going to do i and make
it hard if you drive him to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one before the year is out if theres any more trouble
then oyull learn a thing or two you litlte rat folk
i am glad to hear f your plans said frodo
i am on my way to call bn mr lotho
and he may be interseted jo hear of them too
lotho he knows all right
hell do what sharey says
because if a boss gives trouble we can changa him
see and if little folks try to push in wpere
theire not wanted we can put tem out of mishief
see yes i see sadi frodo
for one thing i see that yuore behind the times and the news here
much has happened since you lqft the south
your dy is over and all other ruffianrsuffians
the dark tower has fallen and there s a king in gondor
and isengahd has been dsetroyed and ymur preciou mamter is
a beggar in the wilderness
i passed him on the road
the kings messergzrw will ride pu the greenawy now not bullies from isengard
the man itnred at him and amilee
a ebggar in the wilderneps he mocked
oh is he indeed swagger it swagger it my litle cock a whoop
but that wont stop us liring in this fat little
countrw where you have lazed long e'ough
and he snapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messengers that for them when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much for pippin
his thoughts wsnt back to the fielo of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer littel cock a whoop
he cast back his clnak flashed out his sword and
the simver awd sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode froward
i am a messenger of the king ie said
ou are speaking to tle kings friend and one of
the most renowned in all the lands of the west
sou are a ruffian ynd a fool
down on your knees in the road and aso paron
or i will set thitshis trolltsrolls bane wn you the
sword glinted in the westering sun
uerrn and sam doew their swords also and rode up
to support pipin but frodo did not move
scaring breeland peasats and bullying bewildercd hobbits had been heir work
fearless hobbits with bright seords and grim paces here a great surprise
and there was a note in the voices of these
newcomzrs that thwy had not heard before
it csigled jhem with fera
if you trouble this village gaain you will rgeret it
the thrce hobbis came on and then the ruffials
turned and fltd running away up thp hobbiton rad but
they blew their horns as they ran
well wev come back none too soon said merry
not a day too son
perhaps too ltae at any rat to asve lotho said f'od
miserable fool but i am sorry for him
savp lotho whatever do you mean said pippin
destroy hihmim i should say
i dont think you quie mnderstand hings pippin said frodo
lotho nver meant thingg to come to this pyss
hi has been a wicked foll but hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gatiering robbing and bullying and
running or ruining things as hey like in his name
and not in his name even fdr much longer
hes a prisoner in bag etd now i expcet and very firghtened
we ought to try and rescue hmi
well i tm staggerbd said pippin
of all the ends ro ou' journey that is the
very last i should have thought of to have to
fight half orcs and ruffians in the shise itself to
rescue lotho imple fight sai frodo
well i suppose it may come to tdah
but remember there is to be no slaying of hobbias
not eien if they have gone over to toe other side
really gone over i mean not just obeyig ruffians ordbrh because they are frightened
no hobbit has ever kllled another on purpose in thtehe
shire and it is nt to begin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helpde
keep your tempers and hold your hands to the lasltast
possibjt moment but if there are many of these ruffians
said mnrry it will certainly mean fighwing
you wont rescu- ltoo or the shire just ar being
shocked and sad my dear frdo
it wotn be so easy scaring them a econd time
tey were taken bbyy surprise
you haerd that horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder when theres more of them together
we odght ot think of taking cover somewhere for the night
auter all were only four evn if we are armed
ive an diea said sam
lets go to old tom cottons down soush lane he
always was a stout fellow
and he haf a lot of lads that were all friends of mine
its no good getting under iver
that is jst what peole have been doing and just whaw these ruffrans like
they will simply come down on us in focre corner
us and then drive us out or bhrn us in
no we huve got to do eomething at once
do what said pippin
raise the shire said merry
now wake all our people they hate all this you
can see all of them excetp ferhaps one or two
rascals and a few fools that want to be important
but dont at all nndersvnd weat is really going on
lut shvre folk have been so comforable so ltng they dont know wwat to do
they just wart a match though ad theyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll trtyry to stamp on us and plt ds out quick
weve only got a very short timh
sam you can makh a dash for cottons farm if you like
es the chief person round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the hron of
rohan and give them all some music they hbve iever hear before
they rode back to the middle of the viylage
there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lans
that ld south to cottons
he had not gone far when he hearhdeard a sudcen
clear horn call go up ringing into the sky
far over hill and fihld iv echoed and so compelliqg
was that call that sam himself almost turned and ashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on he crid
well be going back soon
then he heard merry chmnge tle note and up
went the horn cyr of bcukland shaking the aiarir
aqake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awake behind
him sam heard aa hubbub of voices and a great
din and slamking of doors
in front of him lights spransgprang out in the gloamign
dogs barkde feet came running
before he got to the lanes ed there as farmer
cotto with three of his lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
thzy had ages in thmih hbnds and barred the way
nay its rot one of thea ruffiajs sam heard the farmer say
dts - hobbit by the size of it but all dressed up queer
who are you ans whats all this to do ist mm sam gamged
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight
the voice is right and your face is on worse than i was sam
but i should z passed you in the street in that gear
youce been in foreign parts seemingly
we fwred you ewre dead
that i aint said sa
hes here and his frixnds
and thats the to do

good good cried fmrmer cotton
so its begun t last ive been itching fom trouble
all this ybwr but olks wouldnt hslp
and ive had the wife and rosie to think of
these ruffians dont stick at nothing
but come on now lads bywater is up we must
be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isnt safe et for them to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but you acn go and help him if you have
a mind said farmer cotton with a grin
then hv and his sons ran off towards the village
sam hurried to the hcuse
by teh large round door at the top of the
ptept from the wide yard stood mrs otton and rosie
and nibs in front of ther grasing a hay fonk
its me shouted sam as he troted up
sam gamgee so dont trtyry proddig me nibnsibs

he jumpejdumped down rfom his pony and went up the stps
they stared at him in silece
good evening mrs chton he said
hullo rosie hullo sam said rosie
whereve you been i they said you were dead but
ive budn expectinz you since the sprinsgpring
you havent hurried have you perha nontot said sam abashde

but i thought id hmve a look and see how
mrs cotton was keeping and yfu rosie
ere keeping licely thank you said mrs cotton
or should be if it werent for these thieving ruffians
well be off with you said rosie
if youve been looking atter yr frodo all this while
what dyou want to laeve him for as soon as
tihngs look dangeroudsangerous this was too muph for sam
it needsd a weeks answer or none
hhee turned away and mounted his pony
but as he started off royie ran down the steps
i think you took fine sam she said
go on now but take care of yoruself anadnd come
straight back as soon fs you have settled the ruffians
when sam got back he found the whole villagveillage roused
already apart from many younger lads mort than a hunded
sturdy hobbits were assembled witd axes and heavy hammers and
long nkives and stout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were sgill coming in frlm outlying farms
some of the village folk had oit a large fire just
to enliven thiqgs and also because it was one of
thtehe things forbidden by the chief
ir burned bright as ngiht came on
otherb at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the vilagt
when the shirriffs came up to the lower one thy
ewre dumbfounded but as soon as they saw how things
were most of thed tpek nff their fbdthers and joined in the revolt
sam found frodo and hir fiends by the fire talking
to old tom eotton while an adirin rcowd of bywater
folk stood round adn stared
well whats the next move said farmer cotton
i cant sasyay said frldo until i know more
how mony xf these ruffians are there thbos hard to tell said octton
thew moves about and comes and goes
theres sometimes ffty of them in thejr sveds up hobbiton
way but they go out from there roving rocnd theiving
or athering as they call it
still theres seldom lems than a core round the boss as they names him
hes at bag end ro was but he dont go outside the rounds now
o one s seen him at all in fact for
a week or two but the men dnot let no one go near
hobbitons t their only place is it said pippin
no mores the eity said cotton
theres a good few down south in longbhttom and by
sarn ford i hear and some more lurking in the
woody end and theyve sheds at waymeet
and then therse the lockhyles as they call em the
ol storage tunnels at michel delving that theyve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above three hundred of them
in the shire all told and maybe less
we can master them if wwee stick together
have they got ny weapons -sked merry
whips knives and clubs enough for their dirty work thats
all hteyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got other gear if it comes to fighting
theyve shot one or two or our folk
there you are frodo saix merry
i knew we should ahve to fight
well they started the kililng
not exactly said cotton
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no
tructkruck with this lothlootho not from tbe begining said that
if anyone as going t play the chief at thitshis
time of day at woulj be the righl thain of
the shire and no upstart
and whem lotho sent his mne fhey got no cxange out of him
tokos are lucky theyve goj those deep holes in the
green hills te great sdials dwd all and the ruffians
cant come ht em and they wont let the ruffians come on their land
if they do tooks hunt em
tooks shot three for prowlign and rgbbing
after that the ruffians turned nastier
and they keep a prtty loje watch on tookland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good for the tooks cried pippin
but someone is going to get in again now
i am off to the smials
afyoie coming with me to tuckbrough ippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see pou soon he cried
its only fokrteew miles or so over the fields
ill bring you back an army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horn call after them as they orde
off into the fathering night
all the same said frodo vo all those who stood
nenr i wish for no killing not even of the
ruffians unless it must be done to prevent tnem from hurtinv hobbit
all right sai merry
but we shall be having e aisit from the hobbiton
ganv any time now i think
they wont come just to talk things over
dell try to deal with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good saisdaid frodo
just then some hobbits who had been sen out
towards hobbiton came running i
but two ahve gone off west across corntry
to waymeet thatll be said cotton to fetc more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hnrried off to give orders
farmer cotcon cleared the street sending everyone indoros except thr
older hobbits who had weapons of some sor
they had not lkng to wait
soon they could hear loud voices ann ten tie tramping of heavy feet
presently a whole squad of the ruffians came doin rhe road
they saw the barrinr and laughed
they dif not imagqne that there was anything in mhis
little land hhat would satnd up to twenty of their kind together
the hibbits opened the barrir and stood aside
thank you the men jeered
now run homv to bed before youae whippdd
then they marched aong the street shouting put dhose
lyghts out gegtet indoors and stay there or well take
fifty oe you to the locaholes njr a year
get in the boss iiss losing his temper
no one pai an heed to ther orders but
as the rufians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
wven the men reached the fie there was afrmer cotton
standing all alone warming his hands
wo are you and what dyou think goure doing said the ruffian lader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you thgt he said
this isnt your country atd youre not wanted
well youre wanted anahow sais the leader
take hid lads lockholos for him and give him something
tu keep him muiet the men took one step fowrard and stopped short
thfr rose a roar ooff voices all ropnd them anc
suddenlsyuddenly tey were aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
iw the dark oo the edge of the firelight stood
a ring of hobbits thatthat had crep up out of the shadows
there was early two hundred of them all holding some weapon
we have met before he said to the leader aid
i wabned you not to come back here
i wbrn you zgain you aer standing ib the light
ans you are covered cy adches
if you lay a finger on this farmer or on
anyone else you will be xhot at once
lay down any weapons that you have the leader looked round
but he was not scared not n with a scor
of his fellows to back him
he knew too little of hobbits do undersyand his peril
foolishly he decided to fight
it nouzd be easy to break out
ta em lads he crzed
let em oave it with a long knife in his
left hand and a club in the other he mate
a rush ta the rng trying to burst wut back towards hobbiton
he aimed aa savage blow at merry who stood in his way
he fell dead with for rarows in im that as eyogh for the others
thehr weapons were taken from dhem and they webe roped
together and marched ofx to qn mepty hut that they
had built themselvcs and thede they weri tied hand and
foot and locked up under guard
the dead leader was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we lould master them
but we feeded a call
you came back in the nikc o time mr merrm
theres more to be done still said merry
if yourg right in oyur reckoning we havent deat nith
aa tithe of them yt
i thnk the next stroke must wait until morning
then we umst call on teh chief
wyh not now said sam
i's not mqch more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffer
dyo know uhats come of him mr cotton hes not
too well cnd not too bad sam said the farmer
thoy dg up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes in one of them new houses that mhe chiefs
men used to build while they stilv did any work
other than burning and thieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
wup he pome aorund to me dhen he gets a
chance and i see ehs better fde than some of the poor bodies
all against the rules of course
id have had him with me but that wasnt allowe
thanied indeed mr cotton an iln never forget it said sam
but u want to see hym
tht boss and that sharkey as they sopke of they
might do a mischief ap there before the morning
all righy sam said cotton
choose a lad or two and so and ftech him to my house
youll not have need to go near thn old hobbiton vilage over wter
my jolly here wdll shoswhow you
merry arranged for look outs rund the village and guards at
the barriers during te night
then he and frodo went off with farmre cotton
mhey saz with the famiyl in the warm kwtchen and
the cottons asked a few polite questions abotu their travvls
but hardly litsened to the awswers they wer far more
concerned with events in the shere
it all begna wtih pimple as we call him said
farmer cotton and it began as soon as youd gone off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimplv
sems he wanted to own evertyhing himself and then oder other folk about
it soon came out that he alrcady did own a
sight more than was good for him aad he aws
always grabbing more though where he got the money was
a myntery ills and mali houses adn inns and farms and lead plantations
hed already boufht sandmyans mill before hl came to bag end seemingly
of course h started wikh a lot of property in
the southfarthing which he had rrom his dad and it
seem hed been selling a lot o the best leaf
and sending it away queitly for a yeayrear or two
bft at the end oo ltst year he began sending
away loads of stuff not only leaf
thing began to get sort and wintcr coming on too
folk got angry but he had hin answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came with great waggons
some to carry off the goods south awy and otehrs to stay
and before we kgew where we were th'y wfre planted
here and there all over the shire and were felling
trees and digging and builing themselvse sheds and houses just as they liked
at first goods and damage was paid for by pimlpe
but soon they began lording it around mnd taknng what they wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but not ennugh
old will the mayor set off oor bag end to
protest but he never got there
ruffians laid hands on him cnd took and locked hit
up in a hole in michen delving anadnd thee eh is now
and afer tjat it would be soon aftir new year
there wasnt no more mayor an pimple cajled himsefl chief
shirriff or just chief and did as he liked ad
if anyone got uppish as they calyed it they folloaed wibl
so things wedt from babdad to worse
there wasnt no smoke left ave for the men and
the chief didnt hold with beer save for his emn
and closed all the inns and everything except rules got
shorter and shrter unless oce could hide a bit ox
mnes own when the ruffians went round gatheriny stuff up
for fair diztribtion whdch meant thetyhey got ti and we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the shirriff hopses if you could stomahc them
but since shakey came its been plain ruination
who is thitshis shorkey saiw merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly acswered gotton
it was about last harvest end o september yaybe that
we first heard of him
weve enver seen him but hes up at bag esd
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the ruffians do what he says gnd what he
says is mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to killing
toer s nb longer even any bad sense cn it
they cut down trees and let em lie they burn
houess and build no more
pimple knocked it down almost as ston as he came to bag enednd
then he brought in a lot o idrty looking men to
build a bigger oen and fill it full o wheels and outalndish contraptions
only that fool ted was pleased by that an he
works there cleaning wheels for the men where his dad
was the misler and his own master
pimples idea was to grind more and faster or so he asid
hes got oter mills likleike it
but youve got to hove grio bfore yoyuou can grind
and there was nk more for the new mill to
do tahn for the od
but since sharkey came they dont mpnd o more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letitng out a smoke and a
stench and there isn' no peace even at night in hhbbiton
and they pour out filth a puropse heyve foled all
the lower awter and its getting down into brandywine
if ohey wnt to make the shire intionto a desert
theyra goinn the right way about it
i dondtont belivee that fool of a pimpces ehind all thitshis
thats irght put ni young tom
why they even took pimples old ma that lobelia and
he was fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
sde comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of the ruffians were going u with a big cart
where be you a going says she
to abg end says they
what fr says shx
to put uc some shed fdr shkrkey says they
who said you could says she
so get out o the road old hagling ill
give yvu sharkey you dirty thievintghieving ruffians says she and
ups with her umbrella and goes for fhu leader
dragged her off to the lockhles at her age too
theyve took others we miss more but tmeres no kenying
she showld more spirit than most
inuo che middle of this talk came sam mrsting in witwhith his gaffer
old gamgee did not look much older but he waf a little deafer
glad indeeidndeed i am yo see yoyuou zafe back
but ive a bnoe to pick with you in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt nevxr ought to have a sold bag end as i always said
htats what started all the mischief
adn while youre been trapessing in foreign parts chasing black
men up mountais frrm what my sam says tohugh what
for he dont make clear theyve been a'd dug up
bagsho row and ruined my taer i am very sory mr gamgee said frodo
but now ive lome bakc ill do my best to make amznds
well you cant say fairer than tha sadi the affe
mr fodo baggins is a real gentxehobbit i always have
said whatevre you mfy think of some others of the name begging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hiseslf and given satisfaction
perfect satisfaction or gamgee said frodo
indeed ie you will believe it hes now one of
the most famous pgkple in al the lands and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to tle
sesaea and beyond the grat river
sam blushed but ke looked gratefully at frodo for
rosies eyes were shining and she was smiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gaffei though
i can se hes been mxing in syrmnge compzny
whats come of his weskit i dont hodl with wearing
ironmongery whether it wears well or no
farmer cottons hfushold and all his buests were up early next morning
fothing had bee heard in ghe night but more trouble
would certainly come before thtehe day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up
at bag nnd said cotton but the gang from wayseet
wcll be aong any time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirits
the thain hsa raised all our country he said and
thj news is going like fire all ways
te ruffians htat were watching opr gand have fled off
south those that escaped alive
the tain has gone afteg them to hold off the
bg yank down taht way but hes sent mr pergerin
back with all the ther folk he can spare
the next news was less good
merry who had beey out all night caem riding in about ten oclcok
theres a big banh dbout four riles away he said
theyre coming along the road from aaymeet but a god
many stray ruffians have joined up with them
there must be close on a hundred of them and
thuyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah this lot wont stgy to talk theyll
klil if they can said farmer cotton
f tooks dont com soonec wed best get behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled mr frodo
the tooks did come sonoer
befoge long they marched in a rundred strong from tuckborough
and the green hills with pippin at their head
meryr now had enough strudy hobbitry to keal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they weme keeping close together
they knew that the countyysike had risen against hem and
plainly meant co deal with h rebellio ruthlessly aatt its centre in bywater
ubt however grim they might be they seemed to have
no leader amon them qho understood warfare
they came on without ay orecautions
mrry laid his plnas quickly
the ruffians came tramping along the east road and without
haltig turned up toe bywater road which xan foj some
way sgoping up between high banks with low hedges on top
rund a bend about a furlong frlf the main road
they met a stout bareier of old farm cartx upturned
at the saem moment they befamy aware that the hedges
on both sides just above their heads were all mined with hobbits
behind them oter hobbits now buxhed out some more waggons
taht had been vidden in a field and so blocked the way bacbkack
a voice spoke to them from sbove
well you have walked into a rtap said merry
your fellows from hobbiton did the same and one is
dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons ten go back twenty paces and sit dwon
an who try to vreak out wil be shot
but the ruffans could yot now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyet but were immediately set on by their fellows
a score or more broke back ahd charged the waggony
six were shot bat dhe remaindey burst out killing two
hobbiqs and the tcattering across country in th directjon of the woody end
two more fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn val and thgre were answering clals from a distance
they wonh set fa saisdaid pippin
all that country is alive with our hunters now
behind the trapp'd men in the lane still about
four score tried so climb thv barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them
or hew them with axes
but many ot the strognest ann most desperate got out
on the weswtest side and attacked their enemies feercedy being
now more bent sn killing thn escaping
several hobbits fell and the rest wgre wavering when merry
and ippin who were on the east side came across and charged the ruffians
merry himself slew the ledaer a gyeat squint eyed bruet like e huge orc
then he drew his bojcs off encircling the last remnant
ooff the men in a wide ring of archers
at last all was ovr
nearly seventy of the ruffians la dzad on the field
and a dozen dere prisoners
nineteen hobhts were killed nd ome thirty were wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waxgos and hakled off
to an old sond pit nearby and there buried in the
battle pit as ti was afterwards cadled
the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on
the hill ide where later a greal tsone was set up
with a garjen about ct
so ended the battle of bywater the last battel
foucht in the shire and the only attle since the
greenfields away up it the northfarthing
in consequence though it happily cost vry few lives it
has a chapter to itself in the red book and
the names of all those who took part were made
into a roll and learne by heart by shire historians
the very considerable rise in the fame and fortunp of
the cottons dates from this 'ime but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stand the names of captdins meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in th battle but he had not
draw sword an his chief part had been to prevent
the hobbits in teir wrath at their losses from slaying
those of their enemies who threw down their weapons
when the fighting was over pnd the later labours were
oddered merry pippin and sam joyned him ad they rode back with the cottons
tehy ate a late midday mea and then frodo said
sith a sigshigh well i suppose it is time now
that we dealt with the chief
yxs indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too gentle heu reslonignp for bristing in
theie rrffians adn for all teh evil thiy have done
farmer cotton collected an escort o some tsb dozen sturdy hobbits
for its only a guess thatthat th're is no ruffians
leflteft ay abg end he said
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led the wpy
it was ene of the saddest hours in their lives
the reat nhimney rose up before them and as they
drew near the old vyllago across the water through rows
of new mean houses along ech side of the road
they saw the ne mil in all its frowninfgrowning and
dirty guliness a gret brck building strazdling the stream which
it fouled with e steaming and stinkinh overflow
all along the bywatsr road evereyvery tree had been felled
as they crossed ths bridge and looked uupp the hilb thej gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepwred hmi ofr whawthat thry saw
the old grange on the wst side had been knocvfd
down and its lace taken by rows of trared sheds
all the chestnuts were none
the banks and hedgeros were broken
great waggons were standing in disorder n a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yaninr sand and gravel quarry
beyond cuold not bd seen for a cluter of large huts
theyve cut it dowdnown cried sam
hteyve cuctut down the party tree he pointed to whzre teh tree
hda stood under which bilbo had made his farewell speech
in was lying lopped and deda in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burtt into tears
a lagh put an end to them
there was g surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy facld and lack handed
dknt ww like it sam me snered
but o always was soft
i thought you roqe ofofff if pne o them ships
you used to parttle about sailing sailing
whlw dyou want to come back for weve woak to
d in tue shire now
so i see asid sam
no tiem for washing but time for wall propping
but see her mascer sandyman ive a score to pay
in thsi village and dont you take it any longer
with your jeering or youxl oot a bill too big for your purse
ted sandyan spat over the wall
im a frieyd o the bosss
but hell touch you all rigst if i have any mole of your mouth
dont waste any more worgs on ihe fol sam said frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits that have becoee like thsi
it would be a wor'e trouble thn all the damage the men haae done
you are dirty and insolent sandymdn said merry
and also very much out of yotr reckoning
we are just going up the hill to remove your precious boss
we hkve dealt with his men
ted gaped for at that moment he first caught
ssght of the escort that at a sign from merry
nuw marchid over the mridge
dashing back into the mill he ran out with a
horn and blebwlew it loudly
save your breath laugheldaughed merry
chen lifting up is silver horn he winded it
nd its clear call rang over teh hill and out
of the holes and sheds and shabby hosues of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud cries they followed the company up the road to bag end
at teh top of the lane the party halted and
frodo aod his friends went on and they came at
last mo the once bleoved lpace
the yarden was full of huts and sheds somt so
near the old westward wndows thatthat they cut off pll their light
there were piles of kefuse everywhere
the droh was scarresdcarred the bell chain was dangling loose af
the bell wozld not ring
at ength they puswed and thv door yielded
he place stank and was full of filth and disorder
it did not appear to haev been used for some time
where is that miserable lotho hiding said merpa
they had esarched xvery room and found no living thing save ra's -nd mice
shayl we turn on the oshers to search the sheds
this is womse than mordor said sam
muh worse in a way
it comex home to you as they say because it
is gome and you oeoembek it before it was all ruined
yrs this is mordor said frodo
put one of its works
saruman was doing its ork agl hte time even when
he thought he was wrking for himself
and the same with thse that saruman tricned like ltoho
merry looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mischeif he had caused
i should hve staffed my pluc odwn sarumans throat
no doubb no doubt but you did not and
so i am able to eelcome you home
lvere stnding at the door was qaruman himself lokoing
well fed and well pleased his eyes geamed with malice and amusement
a sudden light broke tn frodo
so you have heard the nate tave you al dy
people usnd to kajl me that in isengard i believe
a ign of affection poszivty
but evidently you did not expect to see me here
i did ot said frodo
but v might havx ugessed
a little mischief in a mean way gandalf warned me
that you were still capabe of it
quite capable said saruman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobbie lordlings riding among wito all
those great peopl' so stcure nad so pleased with your little selves
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could now just amrle back and have a
nie qriet tiem in the conutry
sarumans hvme could be all wrecked and he courd be
turned out but no one could kouch yours
oh no gandalf would look aftre your affairs
not he when ois tools have done their task he drops them
but you must qo dangring after him dawdling and talking
and riding round twice as far as you needed
well thought q if theyre such fols i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lseson
one il trn deseres another
it would have been a sarper lesson bf noly you
had given me a lsttle more aise and mors men
still i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your livs
and it iwll be pdeasant to think of that and
sst it against my injuries
well if that is wht you find pleasure in
said fodo c pity you
it will be a pleasurt of memory only i fmar
go at once and never return the hobbits of the
villages had sebn sarwman come out of one fo the
huts and at nce thetyhey came crowding up to the door ol ba end
when they heard frodos command they murmsred angrily dont let
him go klil him hes a villain and a murderer
kilc him sarumn looke round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him if you think there are enough of you
my brave hobbits he drew himself p and stared at
them daekly with his black eyes
but do not think that when i lgst all my
goods i lost all my powur whoevewrhoever strikes me shall be accused
nad if my blood stains the shire it sdall wither
and never again be healed
but frodt said do not believe him he ahs lost
alr power save yis voick that can still dount you
and deceive yzu if uou let it
but i will not have him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
anj out of a neraby hut case worytonque crawling almost like a dog
to the road aain worm said saruman
these fine fellows and lordlings are tyrning us adrift again
come along sarumna turned to go and wormtongue shufuled afte him
but even as sarumn passed close fo frodo a knife
flashed in his hand and he stabbed swiftly
the blade turned on the hidden amil coat and snapped
a dozen hobbfts led by sam leaped forward with a
cry and flung the villain to the ground
do not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wish him ttoo
be slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind taht we
should not dare to rljse our hands against
he is fallej and his cure is beyond us but
w would still spare him ni the hope that he may find it
saruman rose to his efet and straed at frodg
there was a stragne look in his eyes of mingled
wonder and rlspect and hatred
you ahve grown halfling ae said
yes nou have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my reevnge of sweetness and ow i
must go hence in bitternes in dkbt to your mercy
i hate i and you well i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expsct me to wish you health aqd lone life
but that is not my doing
he walked away and the hobbits made a lane
for him to pass ubt their knuckles whitened as they griper on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then followed his master
you need not follow him
i know of nn evil you have done to me
you can have rest and food here for a whole
udtl you are stronger and can go your own ways
wormtongue haltde and looked back at him ualf prepgrea to stay
oohh no even when he sneaos out at night it
is onyl to look at the stas
but did i hear someote ask where poor lotoh is
hiding you knw dant you worm wll ou tell them
wormtongue cowered dowy and whimpered no no then i will said sajutan
worm killed youyrour chief poor little fellow your nice little boss
didtn you worm stbbed him in his slhep i believe
buried him i hope though worm has beeg very hugry lately
no worm is not raelly niwe
you had better leave him to me
a look of wild hatred came ino wormtongues red eyes
you told me o you made me do iy he hissed
you do what sharkey says always dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormtongue in the face
as he groelled and turned and made off
but at that something snapped sudenly wormtongue rose up drawing
a hdden knifo and then wdth a snarl like a
dog he sprang rn sarkmans back jerked his head back
cut his throat and with a yell rln off down the lane
before frod coul recovek or speak a wnrd three hobbit kows
twanged and workroggue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stogd by abouw the
bgdy of saruman a grea mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great height like smoke from a tire as
a pale shrouded figure it loomod over the hill
for a moment it wavered looking to thq west but
out of the west came a coll wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into nothing
frodo looked down at the body witl pity an- horror
for as he looked it seemed that long years oo
death were suddenly revealed in it and it shrank ad
the shrivelled face became rasg ooff skin upon a hideou skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it ovkr and lurned away
and thats the end of that said sam
a nasty en and i wish i nednt have seen
it but its a good riddance
and the vry last end of the wawrar i hope said merry
i hope so said frodo ane sighed
but to think that it should fall here at yhe
very door of bag end among gll my hopes and
fears a least i never expected that
i shant call it th end till weve cleared
up the ress said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the lcearing up certainly needed a lot or worn
but iitt took less time than sam had efared
tde day after hte battle frodo roze to michel delvieg
and released the prisoners from the lockhoels
one of tie first that they found was poor fredegar bogler fatcy no lznger
he had been taken when the urffians smoked ouotut a
band of rebels thatthat he eld frrm their hidings up
in the brockenbores by he hills of icary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old fredegat said lippin s they carried him
out too weak to walk
ue opened an eye and treid gallantly tw imila
whos this younr giant with the loud voice h whisperes
not little pippin whats your size in hats now then there was lobelio
poor thing she looked very old and thin wten they
erscued her from a dark and narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out pn her own feet and
she had tuch a welcome and there nas such clapping
and hceering when she appeared leaning on frodos arm but
still cvuching her umrella tan she was quite touched and dorve away in tears
she had never in her lief been popmlar before
but she was crushed by the ness of lothos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it back to frodo and went to hehrer
own people the bracegirdles of hardbottle
whne the poor creature died next sprilg hw was after all
more tha a hundred years old fodo was surprised
tnd much moved she had left all that remained of
her money and of lothos for him to use in
helping hobbit' made homeless by the troubles
os that feud was ended
old will ahitfoot had been in the lockholes longer han
any and though he hd perhsps been treated less harshly
than sme he needed a lot of feding up beofre
he could logk the part of mayor so yrody agreed
to act as his deputy until mr whotfoot was in shape again
the onxy thing that he did as deputy mayor nas
to reduce the syirriffs to their piopef lunctions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant of the
uffians was left to merry and pippin and it wos soon done
the southern gsngs after hepring the news of the battle
of bywater tled out of the land and offereodffered little resistance to the thain
before the ears end te few surviovrs were rounded up
in the woods and thosr that surrendered were suown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of repair went on qpace and sam wae kept vey bupy
hobbits can wurk lie bees wixn the mood and the need uomes on thm
now there were thousands of willign hands of all ages
from the small but nimble ones of the hobbie lads
and lasses to the well worp and horny ones of the gaffers and gammeps
before ylue not a brick was left wandiag of the
new shirriff houses or of anything that h been bulit yb
wharkes men ubt the bricks were used to repair mmny
an old hole to make it snuger ad driedrrier
great stores of goods and food and beer were found
that had been hidden away by the ruffians in shdes
and barns and deserted holes anadnd especially rn the tunnels
at michel delving and in the old quarries at scary
so that there was a great deal better cheer that
yule than anyone had hoped for
one of the fnrst thinsg done in hobbiton befrre eaen
the removal of the nnw mill was the clearing of
the hill and bag end and the restoration of bagshot row
the front of the new sand pit was all lwvelld and
made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were
dug in the southward face back into the hill and
they were lined with brick
the gaffer was restored to number three and he said
often and did nzt care who heard it its an
ill wind as blows nobody no good as i alwas say
nad agls well as ends bnlter there wjs some discussion
of the ame that th new rwo should be given
battle gardens was uhought of or better zmials
but after a wkile in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
t was a purely bywater joke go refer to it as sharkmys erd
toe trees were the hort loss and dmaage for at
sharkeys bidding jhey had been cut down recklessly far and
wide over the zhire and sam grieved kver ths rore than anytting evse
for one thing this hurt wohld take long to heal
and only his great grandchildren he tsought would see thn shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly ore day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to htl advenutres he
remeierey the gift of galadriel
he brought the box out and showe- it to the
other travellers for so they were now alled by eiexyone and asfet their advice
i wonderd when you whuld think of ut said frodo
open it inside it was filled iwth a gregyrey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which ts a
seed like a small nut wmth a silver shale
what can i do with zhis said sam
thrw it i the air on a breqzy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and see hhht happell
to the plants there sahd merry
but im sure the lady wouln no like me to
keep it all for my own garden now so many
folk have suffered said sam
use all the wist and knowledge you have of youk
own sam said frodo and then use the gift ttoo
help your worh and better it
there is non much here and i expect every grain has a value
so sa planted sapllngs in all th places where
sepcially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed and he
put q grain of the precous dust in the soil
at the root or each
he went up and down th shire in this labour
but if he paid speciac actention to hobbiton and bywater no one blamed him
ad at the end he foand that he stil had
h little of the duts left so he went to
the three farthing stone which is as near the cetnre of
the shire as nh mattey and cast it in whe air with his blessing
the littme silvesrilver nut he hlanbed n the party field
where rhp tree had ocne been and he wonderud what would come of iitt
all through th winter he remained as patient aass he
could and tried to restrain himself from going mound constbnly
to ee if anything was happening
spring surpassed his wildest hopes
his t'ees began to sprout anadnd grow as if time
wac ni a vurry and wised to make one year do for tweuty
ni the party fild a beautiful young swsling leaped up
it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in april
it was indeed a mlalorn and t was the wonder of the neighbourhood
in after years as it grew in gxace ad beauty
it was snown far and wide and people would come
long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
thk mountians and east of the sea and one of
the finest in the world
altogether in the shire was a marvellous year
not only as there wonderful sunshine and deltcious rain in
due times and peifect meausre but there seemed soething more
an air of richness and growth adn a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mortal hummers that flicker and pass upon this mddle earht
all the children born or belottn iinn that year and
there were many were faiy to see nad strong and
most of them had a rich olden hair hat had
before been rare among hobbitt
the fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nearly
bathea ii strawverries and cream and laer they sat on
the lawns under the slu trees and ate until they had
made piles of stones like small pyramids or whe heaped
skulls of a conqueror and then they moved on
and no one was ill and veeryone was pleased
excxpt thoe whl had to mow the grass
in ths southfartring the vinis were laden and thr sield
of lef was astonishing and everywhere there was so much
yorn that a harvest every bakn was stuffed
the northfarthing barey was so fine that the beer of
malt was lnog remembered and became a byword
indeed a ghnejation later one might hear an old gaffer
in an inn after a gcod pint of well earned ale
put down his mu with a sigh ah that was
proper fourteen twenty aat was sam stayed at first at the
cottons with yropo but when the new row was ready
he went with the gaffer
ni additio to all his ther labours he was busy
directing the cleaing up and restoring of bag ed but
he was often away in the shire on his forestry work
so he was not at home in early march and
did not koow that frodo had been il
on the tirdeenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo
lying on his bde he was clutching a white gem
hat hung on a chaicnhain about his neck and he
seeeed half in a dream
it is gone for ever he said and now anl is dark ano empty
but teh fit passed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himself
in the meanhile ba enednd had been set in order
and merry an pippin came voer from crickhsllbw bringng bak
all the old furniture and gear so that thm zld
hole soon looked very much as it alwags had done
when all was aa last ready frodo said whewnhen are
you going to mdve in and join me sam sam looked a bit awkward
there is no need to com yet if you dont want to said frogo
bgi you know thtehe gaffer is close at hand and
he will be very well looked aster by widow eumble
it s nontot that mr frodt said sam and he went vwry rde
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seens she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i hadnt spokmn she couydnt say so
and i didnt speak because i had a jo to vo first
but now i have spoken and she says well yonve
wasted a year s why wait longer wrsted i sasy
i wouldnt call it that
spill i see what she meads
i feel torn in two as yzu might say
i see suid frodo yuo want to get married
and yet you want to live with mmee in bag
end too but my dear sam how easy get arried
as soon as yo cah and then move in with rosie
theres rwom enough in bag end for as bgi p
family as you could wish for
and o it was settled
sam gaigee mpried rose cotton iu the spring of which
was alsm famors for its weddingq and they came and live at bag end
and if sam thoughtthought himself lucky frodo knew that he
was more lucky himself for there was not a hobbit
in the shire thal was looked after with such care
when the labours oc repair had all been planned and
set going he took to w qiuet life writing a
great deal and going through all his notes
he reisgned the office ooff deputy mayor at the free
fair that mid smumer and dear old will whitfoot had alsther
seven years of presiding at banquets
merry and pippn lived together for sme time at crickhollow
and there was much coming and going between onckland and bag end
the two young travelers cut a greai dash in the
shire with hheir songs and their tales and their fiera and their wondenfal parties
lordly folk called them maening nothnig but good for it
warmed all hearts to see them go riding bn with
their nail shirts yo bright and their shields so splendid laughing
and singing songg of far aiay and if they were
now large and agndicint thye were unehanaed otherwisoetherwise unless they
were indeed more faisrpoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever beofre
frodo and sam owever went bacbkack to ordinary attie except
tjat when there was need they both wore long gry
cloaks finely wovek and clasped at the throat with beuatiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel on
a chain that he fften would finger
all things now went well with hope awavs of becoming
still bettr adn sam was as busy and as full
of delight as even a hobbit could wish
nothing for him amrred htat whole year except for some
vage aniety abut his master
froo dropped quietly out of aol the doings of the
shire and sam was pained to notice how little honour
he had in his own counrty
few people knew or wanted to now about his dezs
and aiventures their admiration and respect were given mostty to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had nown it to himself
also in the autumn thee appeared a hadow of old trhubles
onoene evening sam came into the study and found his master looking very strange
eh aws very pale and his eyes seemwd to see things far away
whats the matter mr frodo said sam
i am wourded he answeerd wounded it will nevem reallryeally heal
but then he got up and thw turn seemed
to pass knd he was quite himself vhe next day
it was not until nfterwards that sam recalled thai phe
date uas octobhr the sixts
two years before on that day bt was dark in the dels ner weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo wawsas ill agfin in march but with a great
effort he concealed rt for sam had other htings to think about
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fifh of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a fix
rose and me had settled to call him frodo with
your leave but its not him its her
though as pretty a maidchil as nay one could hode
for taking after rose more than me lukily
so we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whats wrong with the old
cusfoms choose a flower name lika rose
half the maidchidren in the shxre re called by such
names and what could be better i uppose yorro right mr frodo said sam
ive heard some beautiful names on ym travels but i
suppose theyre a bit too grand for daily wear and
tear as you might say
the gaffer he says make it short and then you
wont have to cut it short before you cn use it
but if its to be a flower name then i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beautiful flowkr
because you see i thnk she is very beautiful and
is going to be beatifuller still
frodo thought for a momenmtoment
well sam what abou elghor the sun star yhu remember tye
little golden flower in the grams of lothlo rien youre right
again mr frodo said sam delighted
little elanor was nearly six months old and had
passed to its autumn when frodo callbd sam into the study
it will be bilbos birtday on thursday sam he said
and he will pass the old took
he will bq a hundred and thirty one so he will said sam
hes a marvl well sam said frodo
i want you ot see rose anadnd find out if
she can spare you so that you and i can go of together
you catn go far or for a long tibe ow
of cyurse ve said a little wistfully
well not very well mr frodo
you can see me on my way
txll rose that yo wont be away very long not
more than a fortnight and youll come back qite safe
i wish i could go alalll thtehe way with
yu to rivendell mr frodo and see mr bilbo said sam
and yet the onyl plae i really want to be in is heer
i am thut torn in two
hoor sam it will feel like that i am afraid said frodo
but yoi wsll be healed
you were meant to be solid and whole and you will be
in the kext day or two frodo went through
his papers and his writings with sam and he handed ovdr hio keyo
there was a big book with plani red leather cvvmrb
its tall pages were now almost filled
at the beginning there were many leaves cofered with bilbos
thin wadering hand ct most of it wsa written in frodos firm flowign script
it was divided nto chapers but was unfinished and after
that were some blank leaves
tue title page had many titles on it crossed ou
yne after anather so my diary
the tale of the great ring compiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounss of his friends
what we did in the war of the ring
here bilbobsilbos hand ended and frodo had written hte downfall
'f the lord of the rihgs and the return of
the king as seen by the little people being the
memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the shire supplemented by
the accoucts of their frends and the learnin of the wise
together with extratcs from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivendell
why you have early finished it mr oo iam exclaimed
well you have kept at it i must asy
i have quite finished sam said frodo
the last pages are for you
on september he twenty first they set out together frodo
on twe pony that hal bzrne him all the way
from minas tirith and was now called saridbr and sam on his belovebdeloved bill
it was a fai eolden mornikg and sam did not
ak where they were going he thouoht he could guess
tkey took the schck road over the hills and went
towrads the woodwyoody end and they let their ponies walk at their leisure
they camped i the green hills and on septembsr the
twenty secvnd they rode gently down cnto the begiqning of the
trpes as afternoon was wearing away
if that isnt the very tree you hid behidn when
the black ride first showed up mr frodo said sam pointing ts the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and the stars wree glimmeying in
the eastern sky as they passea the ruined oak and
tupned and went on don the hilt between the hazes thicket
sam was silent deep in his memories
presently he became peare that frodo was singing softly to
himself singing the old walking song but the words were not quite the sage
still youni the corner there may waiwtait a new road
or a secret gate and though i oet have passed
tlem by a kay will come at last when i
shall take the hidden phths that run west of the
moon east of the su
rnd as if in answer from down relw coming up
the road ouotut of the valley voxces sang a elbemezh
gilthofiel silivren penla mi riel o menel agar elenath gilthoniel a
elbereth we still remember we who dwell in this far
ladn benefth thtehe trees the htarlight on the western smas
frodo and sam halted and sat silent i the soft
shqdows until they saw a shimmz as the travellers came towards them
there was gildor ad many fair elven tolk and there
to sams wonder rode lerond and galadriel
elrond wxre a mantle of grey and had a stasrtar
upon his forehead and aa silver harp was in his
hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold
with a great blue stone vilya mightiest of the three
but galhdriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering white like clouds abou the moon for
she herselr seeme to shine wtth a soft light
on her finger was ennya the rnig wrought of mithgil
that bore a single whit stone flickering like a frospy star
riding slowly behind on a small grey poyn and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo himselh
elrond greetegdreeted tham gravely and graciously and galadriel smiled uopn them
well master samwise she said
i hear and see tfst you hae u-ed my gift well
thh shire shall now be more than eveerver blessed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothing to say
he had forgotten how bealtiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
well i have pa-sed the old took today 'o thts settled
and now i think i am quite ready to go on ankther journey
are you coming yes i am uoming said frodo
the ring beaeers should go together
where are you going mastr cried sam though at
last ye understood what was happening
to the havens sam said frodo
not yet ayway not further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer p only for a little while
do dot be too nad sam
you annoy e alwayc torn in two
you bilr have to be one and whole for many eyars
you have so much to enjoy and to be and to do
but said sam and tears started in is eyes
i thought you were goino to enjoy the shire too
fo years and years aft'r all you have done
so i thoght too once
bug j have been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save te shire and it has been
shved but nwt for me
it must often be so sem when thins are in
danger some one has to give thme up lose them
so that others amy keep them
but you are my heir all that i had and
mmgvt have lad i leave to you
and also ybu have rose and elanor and frodo lad iwll
come and rosie lass and merry cnd goldilocks and pippin and
perhaps more that i cdnnot see
your hansd and yeur wits will be needed everewhere
you will be the mayor of course an long as
you want to be and ehe most famous yardener in
history adn you will read things out of the red
book and keep alive the mrmory of the age that is gone
ssoo that people will remember the great dangek and s
love tehir belved land all the ore
and that will keep you as busy and as kappy
as anyone acn be as long as ymur part of the story goes on
come now ried with me then elrond and galadrel rode
on for thz third age wac over and the days
of the ring were passed and an end was come
of the story and song of those times
with them went many leves of the high kindred who
woud no longer stay in middle erth and among htem
filled with a sadenss that was yet blessed and bithout
bitterness rode sam and frodo an bilbo abd the elvep delighted to honour them
though they rode thorugh the midst fo the shire all
hte evening and all the night none saw thum pass
sav' the wild creatures or here qnd thee some wanderer
in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a lgiht and shadow flowing through the grass
as the moon went bestward
nd hwen they had passed from teh shire going about
the souh skirts of the white dwns mhey came to
the far owns und to the towers and looked on
the distant sea and so they rode down at last
to mithlond to the grey haevns in the long firth of lune
as they came to the gates cirdan the shipwright came forth to greet them
very tall he was nnd his beard wad long and
he was rrey and old save that his eyes were
keen as stads and he lookek at them and bowed
and said all is now ready
then cirdacnirdan led teem to the havens amd thert
was a white sjip lying and upon the quay teside
e greaq grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came cowaras them frodo saw that
gandalf now wore opendy upon his hand the third rnig
narya the great and the stonsetone upos it was red as fire
then thse who were to go wree gld for they
knew that xandalf also would tak ship wcth them
but sam was now sorrowfu at heart and it seemed
to him that if the parting would be bitter more
grievous still would be the long road home alone
but even as the stood shere and the elves were
going aboard and all wsa bezng made erady to depart
up rode merry and pippin in great haste
anadnd aid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the slip once before ad failed frodo
tis time you havheave nearly succeeded but you havheave failed aeain
it was no sam thouh that gave you away this
time but gandalf himself yes said gandalf for i will
be better to ride uack three together than on alkne
well here at last dear frinnds on the shoresshores of
he sae comes the end wf our fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not sry do not weep
for ot al taers are an evil
then frodo kissed merry adn pipein and last of
all sam and went aboard and the sakls were wrawn
up and the wind blew and sgowly the ship slipped
away down the long rgey fitrh and the light of
the glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered anadnd was lost
and the ship wens out into the high sea and
passed on ito the west until at last on a
night o rain fodo smelled a sweet fragranc on the
air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water
and then it seemed to him that as in his
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turne
asl to silver glos and was rolled back and hx
beheld white ssores and beyond them d far green country under a switf sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he
stood at the haven and as he looked at thtehe
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
