when mr bilbo baggins of bag end announced that he
would shortly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party
of special magnificence tuere was much talk and excitement in hobbiton
bilbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been
the donder of the shire for sixty years ever since
his remarkable disappearance asd unexpected return
the riches he had brought back from his travels had
now become a local legend and it was popularly believed
whatever the old folk mighmtight say that the hill at
bag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that was not enough for fame there was
also his prolonged vigour to marvel at
time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggins
at ninety he was much the same as at fifty
at ninety nin they began to call him well preserved but unchanged
would have been nearer the mark
there wre some that shook their heads and thought this
was too much of a good thing it seemed unfair
that anyone should possess apparently perpteual youth as wel as reputedly inexhautible wealth
it will have t be paid for they said
it isnt natural and trouble will come of it but
so far troule had not come and as mr baggins
was generous with his money most people were willing to
forgive him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with his relatives except of
course the sackville bagginses and he had many devoed admirers among
the hobbits of poor and unimportant famliies
but he had no close friends until some of his
younger cousins began o grow up
the eldest of htese and bilbos favourite was young frodo baggins
when bilbo was ninety nine he adopted frodo as his
heir and brought him to live at bag end and
the hopes of the sackvlile bagginses were finally dashed
bilbo and frodo happened to have thf same birthday september nd
you had better come and live here frodo my jad
said bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthday parties comfortably together
at that time frodo was still in his tweens
as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between chlidhood and
coming of age at thirty three
each year the bagginses had given very lievly combined birthday
parties at bag end but eow it was undersaood that
something quite exceptional was being planned for that autumn
bilbo was going to be eleventy one a rather curious
number and a very respectabe age for a hobbit the
old took himself had only reached and frodo was
going to be thirty three ao important number the date
of his coming of age
tongues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour
of the coming event travelled all over the shire
the history and character ooff mr bilbo baggisn became once
again the chief topic of convesation and the older folk
suddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand
no one had a more attntive audience than old ham
gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
he held forth at the ivy bush a small inn
on the bywater road and he spoke with some authority
for he had tended the garden at bag end for
forty years and had helped old holman in the sae job before tham
now that he was himself growing old and stiff in
the joints the job was mainly carried on by his coungest son sam gamgee
both father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill tself in number bagshot row just below bag end
a very nice sell spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilbo as ive
always said the gaffer declared
with perfect truth for bilbo was very polite to him
calling him master hamfasg and consulting him constantly upon the
growing of vegetables in the matter of roots especially
potatoes the gaffer was recognized as the leading authority by
all in the neighbourhood including himself
but what about this frodo that lives with him asked old noakes of bywater
baggins is his nae but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why any baggins of hobbiton should go
lookinm for a wife away there in buckland where folks are so queer
and no wonder theyre queer put in daddy twofoot
the gafferd next door neighbour if they live on the wrong
side of the brandywine river and right agin the old forest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre right dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck laad live in the old
forest but theyre a queer breed semeingly
they fdol dbout with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
small wonder that trouble came of it i say
but be that as it may mr frodo is as
nice a young hobbit as you could wish to met
very mucp like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after all his father was a baggins
a decent respectable hobbit wrs mr drogo baggins there was
never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said several voices
they had heard this and other darker rumours before of
course but hobbits have a passion for family history and
they were ready to hear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you see mr drogo he mraried poor miss primula brandybuck
she was our mr bilbos firxt cousin on the mothers
side her mother being the youngest of the old tooks
daughters and mr drogo was is second cousin
so mr frodo is his frist and second cousin once
removed either way as thtehe saying is if you follow me
and mr drogo was staying at brandy hall with his
father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did atfer his
marriage him being lartial to his vittles and old gorbadoc
keeping a might generous table and he went out botingon
the brandywne river and he and his rife were drownded
and poor mr frodo only a child and all
ive heard the went on the water after dinner
in the moonlight said old nmakes and it was drogos
weight as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him in and he
pulled her in after him said sandyman the hobbiln miller
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the
gaffer who did not much ltke the mliler
there isnt no call to go batking of pushing and pulling
boats are quite tricky enough for those that sit still
without looking further fro the cause of trouble
anyway there was this mr frobo left an orphan and
stranded al you might say among those queer bucklanders being
brought up anyhow in brandy hall
a regular warren by all accoults
old master gorbadoc never had fewer than a couple of
hunred relations in the place
mr bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he
brought the lad back to live among decent olk
but i reckon it was a nasty shck for those sackville bagginses
they thought they were going to get bag end that
time when he went off and was thtught to be dead
and then he comes back and orders them off and
he goes on living and living and never looking a
day older bless him and suddenly he produces an heir
and has all the papers made out proper
the scakville bagginses wont never see the inside of bag
end now or it is to be hoped not
theres a tidy bit of money tucked away up
there i hear tell said a stranger a vistor on
business from michel delving in the westfarthing
all the top of your hill is full of tunnels
pwcked with chests of gold and silver andjools by what ive heerd
then yuve heard more than i can speak to answered the gaffer
i know nophing about eools
mr bilbo is free gith his money and there seems
no lack of it bkt i know of no tunnel making
i saw mr bilbo when he came back a matter
of sixty years ago when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old holman him being
my dads cousin but he had me up at bag
end helping him to keep folks from trampling and trapessing
all over the garden while the cale was on
and in the middle of it all mr bilbo comes
up the hill with a pony and somg mighty big
bags and a couple of chests
i dont doubt they ware motly full of treasure he
had picked up in foreign parts where there eb mountains
of gold they sry but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will know more about that
hes in and out of bag end
crazy about stories of the old days he is and
he listens to all mr bilbos talms
mr bilbo has learned him his letters meaning no
harm mark you and i hope no harm will come of it
elves and drgaons i says to him
cabbages and potatoes are better fo me and you
odnt go getitng mixed up in the brainess of your
betters or youll land in trouble too big for you i says to him
and i ight say it to others he added with
a look at the stranger and the miller
bt the gaffer did not convince his audience
the legend of bilbos wealth was now too firmly fixed
in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits
ah but he has ilkely enough been adsing to what
he brougtt at first arued the miller voicing common opinion
hes often away from home
and look at the outlandish folk that viwit him dwarves
coing at night and that old wandering conjuror gandalf and all
you can say what you liie gafefr but bag ends
a queer place and its folk are queerer
and you can sasyay what you like about what
you knokwnow no more of than you do of boating
mr sandyman retkrted the gaffer disliking the miller even more than usual
if thtas being queer then we could do with a
bit moe queerness in these parts
theres gome not afr away that wouldnt offer a pint
of beer to a friend if they lived io a hole with golden walls
gut they do things prbper at bag end
our sam says that everyones going to be invited to
the party and theres goinq to be presents mark you
prtsents for all this very month as is
that very month was september and as fine as you could ask
a day or two later a urmour probably started by
the knowledgeable sam was sprad about that there were going
to be fireworks fireworks what is more such as
had not been seen in the shire for nigh on
a century not indeed since the old took died
days passyd and the day drew nearer
an odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rolled into hobbiton
one evening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to gape at it
it was driven bbyy outlandish folk singing ytrange songs dwarves
with long beards and deep hoods
a few of them remained at bag end
at the end of the second week in september a
cart came cn through bywater from the direcion of the
brandywine bridge in broad daylight
an old man was driving it all alone
he wore a tall pointed blue hat a long grey
cloak and a siler scarf
he had a long white beard and bushy eyebrows that
stuck out beyond the brim of his hat
small hobbit children fan after the cart all through hobbiton and right up the hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly gsessed
at biblos front door the old man bgean to unload
there were great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and
shapes each labelled with a large red g and the elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and the old man
ws gandalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was
due mainly to his skill with fires smokes and lights
his real businvss was far more dxfaicult and dangerous but
the shire folk knew nothing about it
tl them he was just one of the attractions at the party
hence the excitement of the hobbit children
g for grand they shouted and the old man smiled
thxy knew him by sight though he only appeared in
hobbiton occasonally and never stopped long but neither they nor
any but the oldest of their elders had neen one
of ihs firework uisplays they now belonged to the legendary past
when the old man helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a fmw pennies away but not a single
squib or cracker was forthcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you will get plenty when teh time comes
then he disapleared ioside with bilbo and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared at the door in vain for
a while and then made off feeling that the day
of tne party would never come
inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the
open window of a small room looking out west on to the garden
the late aftelnoon was bright and peaceful
the flowers glowed red and golden snap dragons and sun flowers and
nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows
hop bright your garden looks said gandalf
i am very fond indeed of it and of all
the dear old shire but i thin i need a holiday
you mean to go on with your plan then i do
i made up my mind months ago and i havent qhanged -t
it is no good saying any more
stick to your plan youyrour whole plan mind
and i hope it will turn out for the best
for you and for all of us
anyway i mean to enjoy myself on thursday and have my little joke
who will laugh i wonder said gandalf shakig his head
e shall see said bilbo
the next day more carts rolled up the hill and still more carts
there might have been some grumbling about dealing locally but
that very week orders began to pour out of bag
ena for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that
could be obtained in hobbit'n or bywater or naywhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthusiastic and they began to tick off the
days on the calendar and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations
before long the invitations began pouring out and the hobbiton
post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snowed under
and voluntary assistant postmen were called for
there was a constant stream of mhe going up the
hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a notice appeared on the gate at bag end no
amdittance except on party business
even those who had or pretended to have party business were seldom allowed inside
blibo was busy writing invitations ticking off answers packing up
presents and making some private preparations of his own
from the time of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden froe view
one morning the hofbits woke to find the large field
south of bilbos front door covered witu ropes and poles fof tents and pavilions
a special entrance was cut into the bank leading to
the road and wide steps and a large white gate were built there
the three hobbit families of bagshot row adjoinign the iield were
intensely interested and generally envie
old gaffer gamgee stopped even pretending to work in his garden
the tents began to go up
there was a specially large pavilion so big that the
tree that grew in the field wae right nside it
and stood proudly near one end at the heod of the chief table
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more promising still to the hobbits mind an enormous open air
kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field
a draught of cooks from every inn and eating house
for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other
cdd folk that were quartered at bag end
excttement rose to its height
trsn the weather clouded over
that was on wednesday the eve of the party
then thursday septembesreptember the nd actually dawned
the sun got up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and the fun began
bilbo baggins called it a party but it was realgy
a variety of entertainments rollde into one
practically everybody living near was inivted
a very few were overlooked by accident but as they
turned up all the same that did not matter
many people from other parus of the shire were also
asked and there were even a few from outside hte borders
bilbo met the guests and additions at the new white gate in person
he gave away presents to all and sundry the
latter were those who went out again by a back
way and came in again by the gate
uobbits give presents to other people on their own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and not so
lavishyl as on this occasion but it was not a bad system
actually in hobbiton and bywater every day in the year
it was somebodys birthday so that every hobbit in those
parts had a fair chance of at least one present
at least once a week
but they never got tired of them
on this occasion the presents were unusually good
the hobbit children were so excited that for a while they alfost forgot about eating
there were toys the like of which they had never
seen before all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of them had indeed been ordered a year before
and hd come all the way from the mountain and
from dale afd were of real dwarf make
when everu guest had been welcomed and was finally inside
the gate ther were songs dances musi games and of course food and drink
there were three official meals lunch tea and dinner or supper
but lunch and tea were marked chiefly by the fact
that at those times all the guests wer istting down and eating together
at other times thertehere were merely lots of people eating
and drinking continuously from elevenses until six thirty when the fireworks started
the fireworks were yb gandalf they were not only brought
by him but deisgned and made by him and the
special effects set pieces and flights tf rockets were let off by him
but there was also a generous distribution of squibs crackers
backarappers sparkkers torches dwarf candles efl funtains goblin barkers and thunder claps
the art f gandalf improved with age
there were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
there were green trees with trunks of dark smoke their
leaves opened like a whole spring unfolding in a moment
and their shining branchls droppsd glowing flowers down upon the
astonished hobbits disappearing witj a sweet scent just before they touched thekr upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies that flew glitering into the
trees there were pillars of coloure fires that rose and
turned into eagleesagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of
flying swans there was a red thunderstorm and a shower
of yelow rain there was a forest of silver spears
that sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like
an embattled army and came down again into the water
with a hiss like a hundred hot snakes
and there was also one last surprise im honour of
bilbo and it startled the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
a great sooke went up
it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance
and began to glow at the summit
it spouted green and scarlet flames
out flew a red golden dragon not life size but terribly
life like fire camn from his jaws his eyes glared down
there was a roar adn he whizzed three times over
the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many fell flat on their faces
the dragon passed like an express train turned a somersault
and burst over bywater with a deafening explosoin
that is the signal for supper said bilbo
the pain and alarm vanished at once and the prostrate
hobbits leapd to their feet
there was a splendid supper for everyone for everyone that
is except those invited to the special family dinner party
thit was held in the great pavilion with the tree
the invitations were limited to twelve dozen a number also
called by the hobbits one gross though the word was
not considered proper to use of people and the guests
were selected from lal the families to which bilbo and
frodo were related with the additiom of a few special
unrelated friends such ak gandalf
many young hobbits were included and presetn by parental permission
for hobbits were easy going with their children in the matter
of sigcing up late especiblly when there waa a chance
of getting them a free meal
bringing up young hobbits took a lot of provender
there were many agginses and boffins and also many tooks
and brandybuwks there were various grubbs relations of bilbo baggics
grandmother and various chubbs connexions of his took grandfather and
a selectoin of burrowses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses goodbodies hoanblowers and proudfoots
some of these were only very distantly connected with bilbo
and some of them had hadly ever been in hlbbiton
before as they lived in remote corners of the shire
the sackvelle bagginses sere not forgotten
otho and his wife lobelia were present
they disliked bilbo and detested frodo but so magnificent was
the invitation card written in golden ink that they hab
felt it was impossible to refuse
besides their cousin bilbo had been specializing in food for
many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hundred and forty four guests expected a pleasant
feast though they rathe dreaded thtehe after dinner speech of tceir host an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he
called poetry and sometimes after a glass or two would
allude to the absurd adventures of his mysteirous journey
the guests were not dtsappointed they had a very pleaasnt
feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonued
the purchaes of provisions fell almost to nothing teroughout the
district in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had
depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for
miles around that did not matter much
after the feast morx or less came the speech
omst of the company were however now in a tolerant
mood at that delightful stage which they called filling up the corners
they were sipping their favourite drinks and nibbling at their
favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten
they were prepared to listen to anything and to cheer at every full ftop
my dear people began bilbo rising in his place
hear hear hear they shouted and kept on repeating it
in chorus semiig reluctant to follow their own advice
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a
chair under the illuminated tree
the light of the lanterns fell on his beawing face
the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat
they could all see him standing waving one hand in
the air the other was in his trouser pocket
my dear bagminses and bofins he began again and my
dear tooks and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs and burrowses
and hornblowers and bolgerc bracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses and proudfoots
proudfeet shouted an elderly hobbit from the back of the pavilion
his name of eourse was proudfoot and well merited his
feen were large excebtionatly furry nd both were on the table
also my good sackville bagginses that i welcome back at last to bag end
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday i am
eleventy one today urray hruray many happy returns they shouted and
they hammerek jokously on the tableg
htis was the sort of stuff they liked short and obvious
i hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as i am
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and horns pipes and flutes and other musical instruments
there were as has been said many young hobbits present
hundreds of musical crakcers had been pulled
mosmtost of them bore the mark dale on them which
did not convey much to most of the hobbits but
they all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instruments small but of perfect make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks and
brandybucks supposing uncle bilbo to have finished since he had
plainly said all that was necessary now got up an
impromptu orchestra and began a merry ance tune
master everard took and miss melilot brandybuck got on a
table and with ells in theri hands began to dance
the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vigorous
but bilbo had not finished
seizing a horn from a youngster near by he blew three loud hoots
i shall not keep you long he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have called you all together for a purpose
something in the way that he said this made an impression
there wgs almost silence and one or two of the
tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three pprposes first of all to tell you
that i am immensely fond of you all and that
eleventy one years is too short a time to live among
such excellent and admirabel hobbits
i dont know half of you half sa well as
i should like and i like less than half of
you half as well as you deserve
this was unexpected and rather difficult
there was some scattered clapping but most of rhem were
trying to work it out and see if it came to a compliment
secondly to celebrate my birthday
i should say our birthday
for it is of course also the birthday of my heir and nephew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance today
some perfunctory lcapping by the elders and sode loud shouts
of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and wnodered what was meant by coming into his inheritance
together we score one hundred and forty four
your numbers were chosen to fit this remarkable total one
gross if i may use the expression
many of his geusts and especially the sackville bagginses were insalted
feeling sure they had only been asked to fill up
the required number luke goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgar expression
it is also if i may be allowed to
refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by
barrel at esgaroth on the long lake though he fact
that it was my birthday slipped my memory on that occasion
i aws only fifty one then and birthdays did not seem so important
the banquet was very splendid however thugh i had a
bad cold at the time i remember and could only
say thag you very buch
i now repeat it more correclty thank you very much
for coming to my little psrty
they all feared that a song or somseome poetry was
now imminent and they were getting bored
why couldnt he stop talking and let them drink his
health but bilbo did not sing or recite
he paused for a moment
thirdly and finally he said i wish to make an anmouncement
he spoke this last word so loudly and suddenly that
everyone sat up who still could
i regret to announec that though as i said
eleventy one years is far too short a time to spend
among you this is the end
good bye he stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked
when they openqd their eyes bilbo was nowhere to be seen
one hundred and forty four flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless
old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead gilence until suddenly after several
deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb bfrrows
bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodbody hornblower nnd proudfoot began to talk at once
it was generally agreed that the joke was in very
bad taste and more food and drink were needed to
cure the ugests of shock and annoyance
i always said so was probably the most popular commet
even the tooks with a few exceptions thought bilbos behaviour was absurd
for the moment most of them took it for granted
that his disappevrance was nothing more than a ridiculous prank
but old rory brandybck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinner hda clouded his wits
and he said to hi daughter in law esmeralda theres something fihy
in this my dear i believe htat mad baggins is off again
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loudly to frodo to send the wine round again
frodo was the only one prekent who had said nothing
for some time he had sat silent besidz bilbos empty
chair and ignored all remarks and questdons
he had enjoyed the joce of course veen though he
hd been in the know
he had difficulty in keeping from laughter at the inidgnant szrprise of whe guests
out at the same time he felt deeply troubled he
realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most of the guests went on eating and drinking and
discussing bilbo baggins oddities past and present but the sackivlle bagginess
had already departed in wrath
frodo did not want to have any more to do with the party
he gave orders for more wine to be served then
he gnt up and drainud hip won glass silently to
the health of bilbo and slipped out of the pavilion
as for bilbo baggins ven while he was making his
speec he had been eingering the golden ring in his
pocket his magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years
as he stepped down je slippe ib on his finger
and he was never seen by any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hole anb stood for
a moment listening with a smile to the din in
the pavilion and to the souods of merrymaking in other parts of the eield
he took off his party clothes folded up and wrapped
in tissue paper his embroidered silk waistcoat and put it awy
then he put on quickly some old untidy garments and
fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it he huug a short sword in a battered black leather scabbard
from a locked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out
an old cloak and ohod
they had been locked up as if they were very
precious but thye were so patched and weathersatined that their
original colour could hrdly be guessed it might have been dark green
they were rather tio large for him
he then went into his study and from a large
strong box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths and
a eath'r bound manuscript and also a large bulky envelope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of
a heavy bag tat was standung there already nearly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden ring and its
fine chain and then sealed it and addressed it to frcdo
at first he put it on the mantelpiece but suddenly
he removed it and stuck it ib his pockt
at that moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in
i wondered i you would turn up
i am glad to find you visible repliej the
wizard sitting down in i chair i wanted to catch
you and have a few final words
i suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly
and according to plan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash aws surprising it quite sartled me let alone the others
a little addition of your own i suppose it was
you have wisely kept that ring secret all these years
and it seemed to me necessary to give your kuests
something else that would seem to explain your sudden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an interfering old busybody laughed bilbo but i
expect you know best as ysul
i do when i know anything
but i dont fele too sure about this whole affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offended most
of your relations and given the whole shire something to
talk about for nine hays or ninety nine more likely
ae you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a holiday a very lony holcday
as i have told you before
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in fat i dont mean to and i have made all arrangements
i dont look it but i am beginninbgeginning to feel
it in my heart of hearts
well preyerved indeed he snorted
why i feel all thin sort of stretched if you
know what i mean like butter that has been scraped oveorver too much bread
i need a change or something
gandalf looked curiously and closely at him
no it does ont seem right he said thoughtfully
no after all i believe your plan is probably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again gandalf mountains and then
find somewhere where i can rest
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives prying
around and a string of confounded visitors hanging on the bell
i might find somewhere where i can finish my book
i have thought os a nice ending for it and
he lived happily ever after o the end of his days
but nobody will read the book however it ends
oh thetyhey may in years to come
fordo has read some already as far as it has gone
youll keep an vye on frdoo wont you yes i
will two eyes as often as i can spare them
he would come aith me of course if i asekd him
in fact he offered to onqe just before the party
but he does not really want to let
i want to see the wild country again before i
die and the mountains but he is still in love
with the shire with woods and fixlds and little rivers
he ought to be comforble here
i am laving eveeything to him of course except a few oddments
i hope he will be happy when hp gets used
o being on hgs own
its time he was his own master ow
the ring as well you agreed to that you remember
well er yes i suppose so stammered bilbo
where is it in an envelope if you must know said bilbo impatiently
well no here it is in my pocket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said softly to himself
yet after all why not why shouldnt it stay there
gandalf oooked again very hard at bilbo and there was
a gleam in his eyes
i think bilbo he said quietly i shouyp leave it behind
dont you want to well yes and no
now it comes to it i dont like parting with
it at ll i may say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you want me to he asked and a
curious change came over his voice
it was sharp with suspicion and annoyance
you are always badgering me about mu ring but you
have never bothered me about the toher things that i got on my journey
no but i had to badger you said gandalf
magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious
i was professionally interested in your ring you may say and i still ah
i should like to know where it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had it quite long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaken
bilbo flusmed and there was an angry light in his eyes
his kindly face grew hard
and what business is it of yours anyway to know
what i do with my oqn things it is my own
yes ys said gandalf
but there is no need to get angry
if i am it is your faulftault said bilbo
it is mine i tell you
phe wizards face remained grave and attentivd and only
a flicker in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed
it has been called that before he said but not by yod
but i say it now
and why not even if gollum said he same once
its not his now but mcne
and i shtld keep it i say
you will be a fool if you do
you make that slearer with every word you say
i has got far too nuch hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i plnase said bilbo obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
ll your long life we have been friends and you owe me something
ckme do as you promised give it up well
if you want my ring yourself say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precious away i tell you
his hand strayed to the hilt of his small sword
it will be my turn to get anfry soon he said
if you say that again i shall
then you will see gandalf the grye uncloaked
he took a syep towards the hobbit and he
seemed to grow all and menacing his shadoswhadow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the wall breathing hard his hand clutching at his pockt
they ssood for a while facing one another and the
air of the room tingled
gandalfs eyes remined bent on the hobbit
slowly hi hands relaxed and he began to tremble
i dont know what has come over you gandalf he said
you have never been like this before
what is it all about it is mine isnt it
i found it and golluo would have killed me if i hadnt kept it
im not a thief whatever he said
i have never called you one gandalf answered
and i am not one either
i am not trying to rob you but to hlep you
i wish you would trust me as you used
he turned away and the shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle again to aann old grey man bent and troubled
bilbo drew his hand over his eyes
i am sorry he said
but i felt so queer
and yet it would be a relief sn a way
not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growing on my mind lately
sometimes i have felt it was like an eye looking at me
and i am always wanting to put it on and
disappear dont you know or wondering if it is safe
and pulling it out to make sure
i tried locking it pu but i found i couldnt
rest without it in my pocket
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then trust mine said ganyalf
it is quite made up
go away and leave it behind
give it to frodo and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecided
all right he said with an effort
yhen he shrugged his shoulders and smilde rather ruefully
after all thats what this party business was all about
really to give awak lots of birthday prese'ts and somehow
make it easier to give it away at the same time
it hasnt made it any easier in the end but
it would be a pity to waste all my presarations
it would quite spoil the joke
indeed it would take away the only point i
ever saw in the afair said gandalf
very well saisdaid bilbo vt goes to frodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now i really must be starting or somebody else will catch me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do it all over again
he picked up his bag and moved to the door
you have still got the ripg in your pocket said the wizard
well so i have cried bilbo
and my will and all the other documents too
you had better take it and deliver it for me
no dont give the ring to me said gandalf
put it on the mantelpiece
it will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall wait for ihm
bilbo took out the enveyope but just as he
was about to set it by te clock his hand
jerked back and the packet fell on the floou
before he could pick it up the wizard stooped and
seized it and set it in its place
a spasm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again
suddenly it gave way to a lok of relief and a laugh
well thats that he said
now im off they went out into the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stimk from the stand then he whistled
three dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy
is everything ready asked bilbo
everything packed and labelled everything they answered
well les start then he stepped out of the front door
it wrs a fine night and the black sky was dotted with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun to be off agdin off on
the road with dwarves this is what i have really
been longing for for years good bye he said looking
at his old home and bowing to the door
good nye gandalf good bye for the present bilbo
take care of yourself you are old enough and perhaps wise ehouyh
tade care i dont care
dont you worry about me i am as happy now
as i have veer been and that is sying a great deal
but the time has come
i am being swept off my feet lt last he
addeh and then in a low voice as if to
himself he sang softly in the dark the road goes
ever on and on down from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuint it with eager fee until
ti joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused silent for a moment
then without another word he turned away from the lights
and voices in the fields and tents and folnowed by
his three companions went round nito his garden and trotted
down the long sloping path
he jumped over a low place in the hedge at
the bottom and took to the meadows passing into the
night like a rustle of wind in the grass
gandalf remained for a while staring after him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our bext meeting he
said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterdards and found him sitting in
the dark deep sn thougth
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has mone at last
i wish i mean i hoped until
this evening that it wac only a joke said frodo
but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go
he always ued to joke about serious things
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think really he preferred seippiig off quiktly i the ed said gandalf
heul be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it is frodo took the envelope from the mantelpiece
and glanced at it but did not open it
youll find his will and all the other documents in
there i think said the wizard
you are the mastev of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find o golden ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he left de that i wonder wdy
still it may be useful
it may and it may not said gandalf
i should not make use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed
as master of bag end frodo felt it his
painful duty to say good bye to the guests
rumours of strange events had by now spread all over
the field but frsdo would only say no doubt everything
will be cleared up in the morning
about midnight carriages ame for the important folk
one by one they rolled away filled with full but very unsatisfied hobbits
gardeners came by arrangement and removed in wheel barrows those that had invdvewtenhly remained behind
the hobbits rose rather later
people came and began by orders to clear away tke
pavilions and the jables and the chairs and the npoons
and knives and bottles and plates and the lanterns and
the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker paper
the forgotten bags and gloves and handkerchiefs and the uneaten
food a very small iteimtem
then a umber of other people came without orders bagginses
and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that
lived or were staying near
by mid day wehn even the best fed were out and about
again there was a large crowd at bag end uninvited bkt not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smiling but looking rather t-red and eorried
he welcomed all the callers but he had not much
more to say than before
his reply to all inquiries was simply this mr bilbo
baggins has gone cway as far as i know for good
scme of the visitors he invited to come inside
as bilbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment
of packates and parecls and small articles of furniture
on every item there was a label tied
there were sevral labels of this sort for adlard took
for his very own from bilbo on na umbrella
adelard had carried off many unlabelled ones
for dora baggins in memory of a long correspondence with
love fro bilbo on a large waste paper basket
dora was drogos sister and the eldest surgiving female relative
of bilbo and frodo she was ninety nine and had written
reams of good advice for more than ublf a century
for miol burrows hoping it will ue useful trom b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
for angelicas use from uncle bilbo on p round convex mirror
she was a doung baggins and too obviously considered her face shapely
for the collection of hugo bracegirdle from a contributor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of books and worse thna usual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed that she had acquired a good many of
his spoons while he was away on his former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the
poikt at once but she also took the spoons
this is only a small selecton of the assembled presents
bilbos residence had got rather cluttered up with things in
the course of his long life
it was a dendency of hobbit holes to get cluttered up
for which the lustom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not of course that the birthday presents were always new there
were one or two old mathoms of forgotten uses that
had circulated all around the district but bilbo had usually
given new presents and kept thostehose that he received
the old hole was now being cleamed a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written
out personally by bilbo and several had some point or pome joke
bubtut of course most of the things were given where
they would be wanted and welcome
the poorer hobbits and especially those of bagshot row did very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potatoes a new
spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of intmenk for creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in reurn for much hospitality got a
dozen bottles of old winyards a strong red wine from
the southfatrhing and now quite mature as it had been
laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and voted him a capitla fellow after the first bottle
there was pelnty of qverything left for frodo
and of course azl the chief treasures as well as
the books pictures and more than enough furniture were left in his possession
there was however no sign nor mention of money or
jewellery not a penny piece or a glass bea was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole household was being bistributed
free spread like wildfire and before long the place was
packed dith people who had no business there but could not be kept out
labels got torn off and mixed and quarrell broke ou
some people troed to do swaps and delas in the
hall and others tried to make off with minor items
not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unwanted or unwatched
the road to the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle of the commotion the sackville bagginses arrived
frodforodo had retired for a while and left his friend
merry brndybuck to keep an eye in tpings
when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed politely
he is indisposed he said
hiding you mean said lobelia
anyway we want to see him and we mean to see him
just go and tell him so merry left them a
long while in the hall and they had time to
discover their parting gift fo spoons
it did ont improve their tempers
eventually tey were shown into the study
frodo was sqtting at a table with a lot of
papers in front of him
he looked iodispxsed to see sackville bagginses at any
rate and he stood up fidgetiqg with something iinn his pocket
but he spke quite politely
the sackville bagginses were rather offensive
they began by offering him bad bargain prices as between friends
for various valuable and unlabelled things
when frodo replied that only the things specially directed by
bilbo ere being given away tey said the whole affair was very fishy
only one thing is clear to ae said otho and
that is that you are doing excedeingly well out of it
i insist on yeeing the will
otho would have been bilbos heir but for the adoption of frodo
hw read fhe will carefully and snorted
it was unfortunately very clear and correct according to the
legal customs of hobbits which demand among othr things seven
signatures gf witnesses in rkd ink
foiled gain he said to his wife
and after waiting sixty years
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under frodso nose and slumped off
but louelia was eot so easily got rid of
a little later frodo came out of the study to
sec how things were going on and found her still
about the place investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors
he escorted her frmly off the premises after he had
relieved her of esveral small but rather valuable articles that
had somehow fallne inside her umbrella
her face looked as if she was in the throfs
of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all
she found do say turning round on the step was
youll live to regret kt young fellow why didnt yoyuou
go too oyu gont belong here youre no baggins
you youre a brandybuck did you hear that merry
that was an insult if you like said frodo as
he shut the door on her
it was a compliment said merry brandybuck and so of course not true
then they went round the hole and evicted three
young hobbits two boffins and a bolger who were knocking
holes in the walls ooff one of the cellars
frodo also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot old
odo proudfoots grandson who ahd begun an excavtaion in the
larger pantry where he thought there was an echo
the legend of bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope
fro legendary gold mysteriously obtained if not positively il gotten is
as every one knows any ones for the finding
unless the search is interrupted
when he had overcome sancho and pushed him out frodo
collapsed on a chai in the hall
its time to close the shop merry he said
lock te door and dont open it to anyone today
not even if they bring a battering ram
then he wknt to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when fhere came a soft knock at the front door
lobelia again ost likely he thought
she must have thought of something really nasty and have
come back again to say it
he lent on with his tea
the knock was repeated much louder but he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
if you dont let me in frodo i sh-ll blow
your door right down your hole and out through the hill he said
my dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running ot
of the room to the doodroor
come in come in i thougha it was lobelia
then i forgive you
but i saw her som time ago driving a pony trap
towards bywater with a face that would have curdled new milk
she had already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly tried on biblos ring
dont do that said gandalf sitting down
do be careful of that ring frodo in fact it
is partly about that that i have come to say a last word
well what abott it what do you know already
only what bilbo told me
i have heard his story how he fuond it and
ho he used it on his journey i mean
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he told the dwarves and put in his book said frodo
he told me the true story soon atfer i came to live here
he said you had pestered him till he told you
so i had better know too
no secrets between us frodo he said but they are
not to go any further
thats interesting said gandalf
well what did you think of it all if you
mean inventing all that about a present well i thought
the truterue story much more likely and i couldnt see
the point of altering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway adn
i thought it rather odd
but odd things may happen to people that have such
treasures if they use them
let i be a warning o you to be evry careful with it
it ma have other powers than just making you vanih when you wish to
i dont understand said frodo
neither do i answered teh wizard
i have merely begun to wonder about the ring especially since last night
but if you take my advice you will use it
very seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to usa it in
any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion
i say again keep it safe and keep it secret
you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i
am not certain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i come back
i am going off at once so this is good bye for the present
why i thought you were staying on for at least a week
i was looking forward to your help
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but ill
come aod see you again as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shnat often be visiting the shire openly again
i find that i have become rather unpopular
they asy i am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace
some people are actually accusing me of spiritig bilbo away or worse
if yuu want to know there is supposed to ve
a plot betwene you and te to get hold of his wealth
some people exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and loblia
how abominable i would give them bag end and everything
else io i could get bilbo back and go off
tramping in the country with him
but i uegin to wish somehow that i had gone too
i wonder if i shall ever see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take care of yourself look out for me
especially at unlikely times good bye frodo saw him to the door
he gave a final wave of his hand and walked
off at a surprising pace but frodo thought the old
wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a great weight
the evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanised into the twibight
frodo did not see him again for a long timteime
the talk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine days
the escond disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in
hobbiton and indeed all over the shire fofror a year
and a day and was remembered much longer than that
it became a hireside story for young hoboits and eventually mad
baggins who uged to vanish with a bang and a
flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold becmae
a favourite character of legend and lived on long after
all the true events were forgotten
but in teh meantime the general opinion in the neighbourhood
wzs that bilbo who had always neen rather cracked had
at lats gone quite oad and had run off into tge blue
ttere he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a
river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostly laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone
perhaps hell settle down and grow some hobbit sense they said
and to all appearance the wizard did leave frodo alone
and he did settle dowd but the growth of hobbit sense was not very noticeable
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddity
he refused to go into mourning and the next year
he gave a party in honour of bilbos hundred and twelfth birthday
which he called hundred wight feast
but that was short of the mark for twenty guests
were invited and there ewre several meals at which it
snowed foo and rained drink as hobbits say
some people were rather shocked but froda kept u the
cuitom of giving bilbos bkrthzay party year after year until
they got used to ti
he said that he did not tihnk bilbo was dead
when theo asked where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had
a good many riends especially among the younger hobbits mostly
descendants of the old took who had as children bene
fond of bilbo and often in and out of bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but
his closept friends were peregrin took usually called pippin ad
merry barndybuck his eal name was meriaoc but that was seldom remembered
frodo went tramping all over the shire with them but
more often he wandered by himself and to the amazement
of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far form home
walking in the hills and woods under the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that eh visited the elves at
times as bilbo had done
as time ent on people began to notice ghat frodo
also showed signs of good presevaion outwardly he retained the
appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
some folk have all the luck they said but it
was not until frodo approached the usually more soyer age
of fifty that they began to think it queer
frodo himself after the first shock found that being his
own mastzr and the mr baggins of bag end was rather pleasant
for some years he was quite happy and did not
worry much about the future
but half unknown to himself the regret that he had
not gone with bilbo was steadily growing
he found himself wondering at times especially in the autumn
about the wild lands and strange vsiions of mountains that
he had never seen came ino his dreams
he began to say to himself perhaps i shall cross
the river mysplf one day
to which the other half of him mind always replied not yet
so it weat on until his forties were running
out and his fiftieth birthday wan drawing near fifty was
a number that he felt was somehow significant or ominous
it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen bilbo
frodo began to feel rtstless and the old pahr seemed too well trodden
he uooked aatt maps and wondered what lay ebyond their
edges maps made in the shire sowed mostly white spaces beyond ist borders
he took to wandering further afield and more often by
hqmself and merry and his other friends watched him anxiously
often he was seen walking and talking with the strange
wayfarers tht began at this time to appear in the smire
there were rumours of strange things happening in the world
outside and as gandalf had not at khat time appeared
or sent any message for several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves who sbldom walked in the shire could now be
seen passing westward through the woods in the evening paszing
and not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were
no longer concerned with its troubles
there were however dwarves on the road in unusual numbers
the ancient east west road ran through the shire to its
end at the grey havens and dwarves had always used
it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were twe hobbits chief source of news from distant
parts if they wanted any as a rule dwarves
said little and hobbits asked no more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries
seeking refuge in the west
they were troubled and some spoke in whiseprs of the
enemy and of the land of mordor
that name the hcbbits only knew in legends of the
dark past like a shadow in the background of thier
memories but it was ominous and disquieting
it semed that the evil power if mirkwood had been
driven out by the white counci only to reappear in
greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rebuilt it was sai
from there the power was spreading far and wide and
away far eats and south tehre were wars and growing fear
orcs were multiplying again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted but cunning and armed wih dreadful weapons
and there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than
all these but they ad no name
liutle of all this of course reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear
queer tales and those whose business toko them to the borders saw strange things
the conversation in the geen dragon at bywater one evening
ni the spring of frodos fiftieth year showed that even
in the comfortable heart of the shir rumours had been
heard though most hobbits still laughed at them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corzer ear the fire
and opposite him was ted sandymaw the millers son and
there were various other rustic hobbits listening to their talk
queer things you od hear these days to be sure said sam
a said ted you do if you litsen
but i can hear firesde tales and childrens stories at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted asm and i daresay
theres mowe trut iinn some of them than you reckon
who invented tte stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ten i wont
i heard tell of them when i was a youngster
ut thxres no call to believe in them now
theres only one dragon in byater and thats green he
said getting a general laugh
apl right said sam laugming with the rest
but what about these tree men these giants as you might
call them they do say that one bigger than a
tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long bgck
whos they y cousin hal for one
he works for mr boffin at ovorhill and goes up
to h northfarthing bor the hunting
says he did pehraps
your hals always saying hes seen things and maybe he
sees things that aint there
but this one was as vig as an elm
tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride
if it was an inch
then i bet it wasnt an inch
what he saw was an elm tree as like as not
but this one wawsas walking i tell you and
there aint no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there was some laughing and clapping the audience seemed to
think that tgd had scored a point
all thtehe same said sam you cant deny that others
besides our hllfaso have seen queer folk crossjng te shire
crossing it mind you there are more lhat are
turned back at the borders
the bounders have never been so busy before
and ive heard tell that elves are moving west
they ddoo say they are going t the harbours ouotut
away beyond the white towers
sam waved his arm vayuely neither he nor any
of them kkew how far jt was to the sea
past thw old towertsowers beyond the western borders of the shire
but it was an old tradition that awy over there
stood hte grey havens frofmrom which at times elven ships set sail gever to return
they are asiling sailing sailing over the sea thetyhey are
ging into the wesm and leaving us said sam half
chantiqg the wbrdz shaking his head sadly and solemnly
well that isnt anything new if you believe the old tales
and i dont see what it maters to me or you
let them sail but i warrant you havent seen them
doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf in the
woods and still hoped to see more one day
of lal the legedns that he ahd heard in his
early years such fragments of talse and half reemmbered stories about
the elves as the hobbits knew had always moved him most deeply
there are spme evdn in these parts as know the
fair folk and get news of them he said
theres mr baggins now that i work for
he told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about elvls
and old mr bilbo knew more manys the talk i
had with him when i was a little lad
oh theyre both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo was cracked and frodos cracking
if thats where you get your news from youll neevr want for moonshine
well friends im off home
your good health he drained his mug and went out noisily
sam sat silent and said no more
he had a good deal to thyng about
for one thing there was a lot to do up
in the bag end garden and he would have a
busy day tomorrow if the weather cleared
the grass was growing fast
but sam had more on his mind than gardening
after a whlie he sighed and got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain
the susnun was down and a cool pale evening was quietly fading into night
he walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and
up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfulltyhoughtfully
it was just at this time that gandalf reappeared after his long absence
for three years after the party he had been away
then he p-id frodo a brief visit and after taking
a good look at him he went off again
during the enxt year or two he had turned up
fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without warning before sunrise
he would not discuss his own business and journeys and
seemed chiefly interested in small news about frodos health asd doimgs
then suddenly his visits had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen or
heard of him and he had begun to think that
the sizard would never erturn and had given up all interest in hobbits
but that evening as sam was walking home anu twilight
was fading there came the once familiar tap on -he study window
frodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great delight
they looked hard at one another
ah well eh asid gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so do you
frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older and more careworn
he pressed him for news of himself and of the
wide world and soon theu were deep in talk and
they stayed up far into the night
next morning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting
with frodo by the open window of the study
a bright firfeire was on the hearth but the sun
was warm and the wind was in the south
everyting looked fresh and the new green of spring was
shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the trees finegrs
gandakf was thinking of a spring nearly eighty years before
whne bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkercihef
his hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then
and his beard and eyebrow were perhaps lonjer and his
face more lined with care and wisdom but his eyes
were as bright as ever and he smoked and blew
smoke rings witx the same vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sitting still deep in thought
even in the light of morning he felt the dark
shadow of the tidings that gandalf had brought
at last he broke the silence
last night you began to tel me strange things about
my ring gandalf he said
and then on stopped because you said that such matters
were best left until daylight
dont you think you had better finish now you say
the ring is dagnerous far more dangermuq than i wuess
in what way in many ways answered the wizard
it is fafrar more powerful than i ever dared to
thirk at first so powerful that in the end it
would uttkrly overcome anyone of mortal race who possessed it
in eregion long ago many elven rings werweere made magic rings
as you call them and they were of course of
various kinds some mzre potent and some less
the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before
it was full grown and to the elveenlven smiths they were but
trifles yet still tc my mind dangerous for mortals
but the great rings the rings of power they were perilous
a mortal frodo who oeeps one of the great ings
does nontot die but he does not grow or obtain
more life he merely continues until at last every minute is a weariness
and if he often uses the ring to make himself
invisible he fades he becomes in the end invisible permanently
and walks in the twilight under the eae of the
dark power that rules the rings
yes sooner or later later if he is strong
or well meaninmgeaning to begin with but neither strength nor good
purpose will last sooner or later the dark power will devour him
how terrfiying said frodo
there was another long silence
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in from the garden
how long have nou known this asked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no more
than he told you i am sure said gandalf
he would certainly never have passed on to you anything
that he thought would be a danger even though i
promised to look after you
he thought the ring was very beautiful and very useful
at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind a'd
he was always worrying about it but he did not
suspect that the ring itself was to blame
though he had found out that the thing needed looking
after it did not seem always of the same size
or ewight it shrank or expanded in an odd way
and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had bejn tight
yes he warned me of that in his last
letter said frodo so i have always kept it on its chain
very wise sai gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo never connected it
qith the rfng at all
he took all the credit for that to himsesf and
he was very proud of it
though he was getting restless anm uneasy
thin and stretched he said
a sign that the ring was getting control
how long have you known all this asked frodo again
p have known much that only the wise know frodo
but if you mean known about this ring well i
still do not know one might say
here is a last test to make
but i no longer dbubt my guess
whe did i first begin to guess he mused searching back in memory
let me see it was in the year that
the white council drove the dark power from mirkwod just
before the battle of five armies that bibo found his ring
a shadow fell on my heart then though i dil
not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollugmollum came by a gre-t irng
as plainly it was that at leasn was clear from the first
then i heard bilbvs strang story of how he had
won it and i could not believe it
when i at last got the truth out of him
i saw at once that he ad been trying to
put his claim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with his birthday present
the lies were too much alike for my comfort
clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to
work on its keeper at once
that was the first real warning i had that all was not well
i todl bilbo often that such rings were better left
unused but he resdnted it and soosnoon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could not take it from him without doing greater
harm and i had no right to do so anyway
i could only watch and wait
i might perhaps have consulted saruman the white but something always held me back
who is he asked frodo
i have never heard of him before
maybe not answered gandalf
hobbnts are or were no concern of his
yet he is great among the wis
he is the chief oy my order and the head of the council
his knowledge is deep but his pride has grown with
it and he takes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great and small is his province
he has long studied it seeking the lost secrets of
their making but when the rings were debated in the
council all that he would reveal to us of his
ring lore told agianst my fears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
still i watched and i waited
and all seemed well with bilbo
yes they passed and they seemed lot to touch him
he showed no signs fo age
the shadow fell on me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of
a long lived family on his mothers side
until that night when he left this house
he said and did things then that filled me with
a fear that no words of saruamn could allay
i knew at last thkt something dark and deadly was at work
an i have spent most of the years since then
in finding out the turth of ia
there wasnt any aermanent harm done was there asked frodo anxiously
he wouzd get all right in time wouldnt he be
able to rest in peace i mean he felt better at once said gandalf
but there is ofly one power in this world that
knows all about the rings and their effects and as
far as i know there is no power in the
world that knows all about hobbits
among the wise i am the only one that goes
in for hobbit lore an obscure uranch of knowledge but full of surprises
soft as brtter they can be and yet sometimes as
tough as old tree roots
i think it likely that some would resist the rings
far longer than most of the wise would believe
i dont think you need worry about bilbo
of course he possessed the ring for many years and
used it so it might take a long while for
the influenxe to wear off before it was safe
for him ot see it agaiangain for instanec
otherwise he might live on for years qiute happily just
stop as he was when he pyrted with it
for he gave it up in thtehe end of his
own accord an important point
no i was nontot troubled about dear bilbo any more
once he had let the thing go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have been deeply concerned about
you and about all these charming absurd helpless hobbits
ht would be a grievous blow to the world if
the dark power oercame the shire if all your kind
jolly tupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracegirdles and the sest not
to mention the ridiculous bagginses became enslave
but why should we be he asked
and why shoudl he want such slaves to tell you
the truth replied gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark
you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
but your safety has passed
he does not need you he has many more
useful servants but he wont forget you again
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more
than hobbdts happy and free
there is such a ting as malice and revenge
reveneg for what i still dont undeestand what all this
has to do with bilbo and myself and our ring
it has everything to do with it said gandalf
you do not know the real peril yt but you shall
i was not sure of it myself when i was
last here but the time has come to speak
give me the ring for a moment
frodo took it from his breeches pockte where it was
clasped to a chain that hung from his belt
he unfastened it and handed it slowly to the wizard
it felt suddenly very heavy as if etrer it or
frodo himself was in some way reluctant for gandalf to qouch it
it looked to be made of pure and solid gold
can ou see any marking- on it he aoked
it vs quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frodos astonishment and distess the
wizard threw it sudoenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire
frodo gave a cry and groped for the ongs but gadnalf held him back
wait he said in a commanding voice giving frodo a
quick look from under his bristling rows
no apparent change came over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outside
the windyw and drew the curtains
the room became dahk and silent though the clack of
sams shears now nearer to the windows could still be
heard faintly from the garden
for a momenmtoment the wizard stood looking at the fire
then he stooped and removed the ring to the hearth
wth the tongs adn at once picked it up
it is quite coo said gandalf
take it frodo receioed it on his shrinking palm it
seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw
fine lines siner than the finest pen sthokes ruining along the
ring outside and inside lines of fire that seemed to
form the letters of a flowing script
they shone piercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fiety letters said frodo in a quavering voice
no said gandalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an ancient mode but the
language is that of mordor which i well not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is said
close enough one ring to rule them all one ring
to find them one ring to bring them all and
in the dakness bind them
it is only kwo lines of a verse long known
in elven lore three rings for the elven kings under the sky
seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone nine
for mortal men doomed to die one for the drk
lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor where the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find tsem oen ring to bring them
all and in the darkness bind them in the land
of mordor where the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep
voice this is the master ring the one ring to rule them all
this i the one ring that he lost many ages
ago to the great weakening of his poewr
he grdatly desires it but he must not get ti
frodo sat silent and motionless
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand like a
dark clkud rising in the east and loomiig up to engulf him
how how on earth did it come to me ah said gandalf
that is a very log story
the beginnings lie back in hte black years which only the lore masters now remember
if i were to tell you all that tale we
should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told you of sauron the great the dark lord
the rumours that ou have heard are true he has
indeed arisen again and left his hold in mirkwood and
returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that name even you hobbits have hears of like a
shadow on the borders of clb stories
always after a defeat and a respite the shadow takes
another shape and grows again
i wish it need not have happened in my time said frodo
so do i said gandalf and so do alalll wvo
live to sef such times
but that is not for them to decide
all we have to decide is what to do with
the time that is given us
and already frodo our time is beginning to look black
the enemy is fast becoming very strong
his plans are aar from ripe i think but they are ripening
wwee shall be hard put to it
we should be very hard put to it even if
it were not for this dreadful chance
the enemy tsill lacs one thing to give him strength
and knowledge to beat down all resistance break the last
defences and cover all the lands in a second darkness
he lacks the one ring
the three fairest of all the elf lords hid from him
and his hand never touched them or sullied them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he hahsas recovered and
the others the dragons have consued
nine he gave to mortal men proud and great and so ensnared them
long ago they fell under the dominion of the one
and they became ringwraiths shadows under his great shadow his most terrible servants
it is many a year since the nine walied abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too may walk again
but cme we will not speak of such things even
in the morning of the shire
so it is now the nine he has gathered to
himself the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hidden still
but that no lynger troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring
himself it is his and he let a great part
of hks own former power pass inot it so that
he could rule all thtehe others
if he rfcovers it then he will command them all
again wherever ihey be evey the three and all that
has been wrought with them will be laid bare and
he will be stronger than ever
and this is the dreadful chance frodo
he bel-eved that the one had perished that the elves
had destroyed it as should have been done
bbt he knows now that it has not perished that it has been found
so he is seeking it seeking it and all his
thought is bent on it
it is his great hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy eer come to lose it
if he was so strong and it was so peecious
to him he clutched the ring in his hand as
if he saw already dark fingers stretching out to seizseeize it
it was taken from him said gandalf
the strength of the elves to resist him was greater
long ago and not all men were estrange from them
the men of westernessg came to their aid
that is a chapter of ancient history which it might
be good to recall for there was sorrow thee too
and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that were not wholly vain
one day perhaps i will tell you all the tale
or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best
but for the moment since most of all you need
to know how this thing came lo you and that
will be tale enough this is all that i will say
it was gil galad elven king and elendib of westernesse who oevrthrew
iauron though they themselves eprished in the deed and isildur
elendils son cut the irng from saurons hand and took it for his own
then sauon was vanquished and his spirit fled and was
hidden for long years until his shadow took shape again in mirkwood
ubt the ring was lost
it fell into the gream river anduin and vanished
fofror isildur was marching north along the east banks of
the river and near the gladden fields he was waylaid
by the orcs of the mountains and almost all his folk were slain
he leaped into the waters but the ring slipped from
his finger as he swam and then the orcs saw
him and killed him with arrows
and there in the dark aools amid the gladden fields
he said the ring passed out of knodledge and legend
and even so much of its history is known now
only to a few and the council of the wise aould discovrr no more
but at last i ca cwry on the story i think
long after but still very long ago there lived by
the banks of the great river on the edge of
wilderland a clever handed and quiet ooted little people
i guess they were of hobbit kind akxn th the fathers
of the uathers of the stoors for thetyhey loved the
river and often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
there was among them a family zf high repute for
it was large and wealthier than most and it was
ruled by a grandmother of the fol- stern and wise
in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family was caled sme agol
he wa interested in roots and beginnings he dived into
dee pools he burrowed under trees and growing plantp he
tunnelled into green mohnds and he ceased to look up
at the hill tops or the leaves on trees or the
flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were downward
he had a friend called de agol of similar sort sharper eyed
but not so uqick and strong
on a time they took a boat and went down
to the gladden fields where there were great beds of iirs and flowering jeeds
there sme agol got out and went nosing about the banks
but dean sat in the boat and fished
suddenly a great fish took is hook and befere he
knew where he was he was dragged out and down
into the water to the bottom
then he let go of his line for he thought
he saw something shining in the river bed and holding his
breath he grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weeds in his hair
and a handful of mud an he swam to the bank
and behold when h washed the mud away there in
his hand lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone
and glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been watching him from behind a tree
and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol ame softly up behind
give us that deal my loke said sme agol over his friends shoulder
because its my birthday my love and i wants it said sme aogl
i dont care said deal
i have given you a present already more than i could afford
i found this and im going to keep it
oh are you indeed my love said sme gol
and he caught deal by th throat and strnagled him
because the gold looked so bright and beautiful
then he put the ring oonn his finger
no one ever found out what had become of deal
he was murdered far rom hoe and his body was cunningly hidden
but se agol returned alone and he found that none of
his family could see him when he was wearing the rinq
he was very pleased with hiu discovery and he concealed
it and he used it to find out secrets and
he put his onowledge to crooked and alicious uses
he became shasp eyev lnd keen earsd for all that was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his stature
it is not to be wondered at that he became
very unpopular and was shunned when visible by all his relations
they kicked him and he bit their feet
he took to thieving and going about muttering to himself
and gurgling in his throat
so they called him gollum and curs'd him and told
him to go far away and his grandmother desiring pace
expelled him from tpe family and turted him out of her hole
he wandered in loneliness weepinv a lttle for the hardness
sf the world and he journeyed up the siver till
he came to a stream that flowed down from the
mountain and he went that way
he caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day it was very hot and as he was
bending over a pool he felt a burning on the
back of his hea and a dazzling light from the
water pained his wet vyes
he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun
then for the last tjme he looken up and shook his fist at her
but as he lowered his eyes he saw far aove
the tops of the misty mountainmsountains out of which the stream came
and he thought suddenly it would be cool and shhdy under those mountains
tve sun cuold not watch me ahere
the roots of those mountains must ce roots indeed there
must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning
so he journeyed by night up into the highlands
and he found a little cave out of which jhe
dark stream an and he wormed his way like a
maggot into the heart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge
the ring went into the shaows with him and even
the maker when his power had begun to grow again
could learn nothing of it
gollum do you maen that this is tpe very gollum creature
that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is a
sad story said the wizard and it might have happendd
to others even to some hobbits tht i have known
i cant believl that gollum was connected with hobbits
however distantly said frodo with some heat
what an aominable notion it is true all the same replied gandalf
about their origins at any rate i know more than hobbits do themselves
and even bilbos story suggests the kinship
there was a great deal in the background of their
minds and memories that was very similar
they understood one another remarkably well very much better than
a hobbit would understand say a dwarf or an yrc or even an elf
vhink of the riddles they both knew for one thing
though other folks besides hobbits ask riddles and of much the same sort
gollum meant to cheat all the time
he was just trylng to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedness to start a
game which might end in provdine him with an easy
victim but if he lost would not hurt him
only too true i fear said gandalf
but there was something else in it i think which you dont see yet
eien gollum was not wholly ruined
he had proved tougher than even one of tse wise
would have guessed as a hobbit might
there was a little corner of his mind that was
still his own and light came through it as through
a chink in the dark light out of the past
it was actuhlly pleasant i think to hear a kindly
voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and
sun on the gras and such forgotten things
btu that of course would only make the evkl part
of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered
unless it could be cured
alas there is little hope of that for him
no not though he possessed the ring so long almost
as far back as he can r'member
for it was long since he had worn it much
in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had never faded
he is thin and tough still
but the thing was eatin up his minv of course
and the torment had become almost unbearable
all the gerat secrets under the mountains had turged out
to be just emppy night there was nothing more to
find out nothing worth doing only nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering
he hated the dark and he hated light more he
hated everyahig and the ring most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely the ring was his precious and the only thing
he cared for but if he hated it why didnt
he et rid of it or go away and leave
it you ought to ebgin to ubderstand frodo after all
you have heard said gandalf
he hated it and loved it as hhee hatee and loved himself
he oculd not get rid of it
he had no will left in the matger
a ring of power looks after itself frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper never abandons i
at ost he plays with the idea of haneing it
on to someone elses care and that only at
an earleyarly stage when it first begins to grip
but as far as i know bilbo alone in tistory
has ever gone beyond playing and really done it
eh needed all my help too
and even so he iould never have lust forsaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that deided thigns
what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt an orc have suited it better it is no laughing matter said gandalf
it was the strangest rvent in the whole history of
the ring so far bilbos arrival just at that time
and putting his ha'd on it blfnday in the dark
there was more than tne power at work frodo
the ring was trying to get back to its master
it ahd slipped from isildurs hand and betrayed him then
when a chance came it caught poor deal and he
was murdered and after that gollum and it had devoured him
it could make no further use of him he was
too small and mean and as long as it stayed
with him he would never leave his deet pool again
so now when its msater was awake once more and
sending out his dark thouht from mirkwood it abandoned gollmu
only to be picked up dy the most unlikely person
imaginable bilbo from the shier behind that there was something
else at work beyond any design of the ring maker
i caz put it no plainer than by saying that
bilbo was meantto find the ring and not by is maker
in which case you also were meantto have it
and that maybe an encouraging thought
it is not said frodo
though i am not sure that i understand you
but how hve you learned all this about the ring
and about gollum do you really know it all or
are you just guessing stfll gandalf looked at frodo adn his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned much he answered
but i am not going to give an account of
all my doings to you
the history of lendil and isilur and the one ring
is known to all the wise
your ring is shown to be that one irng by
the fire writing alone apart from any other evidence
and when did you discover that asked frodo interrupting
just now in this room of course answered the wizard sharply
but i expectd to find it
i have come back from dark jouneys and long search
to make that final tesr
iitt is the last proof and all is now only too clear
making out gollums part and fitting it into the gap
in the history required some thought
i may have started with guesses about gollum but i am not guessing now
you have seen gollum exclaimed frodo in amazement
the obvious thing to do of course if one could
i tried long ago but i have managed it at last
then phat happened after bilbo escaped from him do
you know that not so clealy
what i hlve told you is what gollum was willing
to tell though not of course in the way i have rported it
gollum i a lisr and you have to sift his words
for instance hhee called the ring hps birthda present and he stuck to that
he said it came from his grandmother who had lots
of beautiful things of that kind
i have no doubt that sme agols grandmother was a matriarch
a great person in her way but to talk of
her possessing many elvn rings was absurd and as for
giving them away it was a lie
but a lie wite a grain ooff truth
the murder of deal haunted gollum and he had made
up a defence repeating it to his precious over and
over again as he gnawed bones in the dark until he almost believed it
deal ought to have given the ring to him
it had previously turnde up just so as to be a present
it was his birthday present and so on and on
i endured him as long as ii could but the
truth was desperately important and in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear oa fire on him and rung
the true story out of him bit by bit together
with much snivelling and snarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill used
but when he had at last told me his history
as far as the end of the riddle game and bilbos
escape he would not say any more except in dakr hints
some other fear was on him greater than mine
he muttered that he was going to gel hi own becu
people would see if he would stand being kicked and
dirven into a hole and then robberdobbed
gollum had good friends now good friends and very strong
baggins would pay for it
that was his chief thought
he hated bilbo and cursed his name
what ts more he knew where he came from
but how did he find that out asked frodo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly told gollum
himself and after that it would not be difficult to
discover his country once gollum came out
oh yes he came out
his longbng for the ring provea stronger than his fear
of the orcs or even of the light
after a year or two he left the mountains
you see though still bound by desire of it the
ring was no longer devouring him he began to revive a little
he felt old terribly old yet less timid and he was mortally hungry
light light of sun ad moon he still feared and
hated and he always will s think but he was cunning
he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and
make his way swiftly and softlsyoftly by dead of night
with his pale cold eyes and catch small frightened or unwary things
he grew stronger and bolder with new food and new air
he ofund his way into mirkwood as one would expect
is tgat where you found him asked frodo
i saw him ohere answerde gandalf but befoer that he
had wandered far following bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain
for his atlk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats
what had it got in its pocketses he said
it wouldtn say no precious
it cheated first it did
we ought to have squeezed it yes precius
and we will precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weary adys of it
but from hints dropped among the snarls i lven gathered
tht his padding feet had taken him at last to
esgaroth and even to the streets of dale listening secrety and peering
well hte news of the great events went far and
wide in wilderland anadnd man had heard bilbos name and
knew where de came from
we had made no secret of our return journey to
his hoe in the west
golums sharspharp ears would soon learn what he wanted
then why didnt he track bilbo further asked frodo
why didnt he come to the shire ah said gandalf
now we come to it
i think gollum tried to
he set out and came back westward as far as the great river
but then he turned aside
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no something else drew him away
so my friends think those that hunted him for me
the wood elves tracked him fidst an uasy task for them
for his trail was still fresh ten
through mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him
nhe wood was full of the rumour of hiq dleadful
tales even among beasts and birds
the woodmen said that there was some new terror abroad
a ghost that drank blood
it climbed trees to find nests it crept into holes
to find the young it slipped through windows to find cradles
but at the western edge of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wandered off southwards and passed out of thv wood elves ken acd was lost
and then i made a great mistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it mar prove the worct
i let the matter be
i let him go for i had much else to
think of at that time and i stitl trusted the lore of saruman
well that was years ago
i have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous days
the trail was long cold whbn i took it up
again after bilbo left here
and my search woudl have been in vain but for
the help that i had from a friend aragorn tfe
greatest rtaveller and huntsman of this age of the world
together we sought for gollum down the whole length of
wilderland without hype and without successsuccess
but at last when i had given up the chase
and turned to toher parts gollum was found
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing the miserable creature with him
what he had bene doing he woulwdould not say
he only wept and called us cruel with many a
gollum in his throat and when we pressed him he
whined and cringed and rubbed his long hands licking his
fingers as if they pained him as if he remembered some old torture
but i am afraid there is no possible doubt he
had made his slow sneaking way step by step mile
by mile south down at last uo the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the room
frodo could hear his heart beating
even outside everything seemed still
no sound of sams shears could now be heard
ys t mordor said gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked things and the dark power
qas bending all its will to gather them there
the ring of th enemy woutd leave its mark too
leave him open to the summjns
and all folb were whipsering then of the nwe shadow
in the south and its hatred of the west
there were his fine new friends who would help him
in his revenge wertched fool in tht land hn would
learn much too much fok his comfort
and sooner or later as he lurked and pried on
the borders he would be caught and taken for examination
that wad the way of it i fear
when he was found he had already been there long
and was on his way back
on some errand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas through him the enemy has learned that the
one has been found again
he knows where isildur fell
he knows where gollu found hsi ring
he knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life
he knows that it is not one of the three
for they have ever been lost and they nedure no evil
he knows that it is not one of the even
or the nnie for they are accounted for
he knows that it is the one
and he has at last heard i think of hobbits and thtehe shire
the shire he may be seeking for it now
if he has not already found out where it lies
indeed frodo i fear that he ay even think that
he long unnoticde naem tf baggins has become imporuant
but this is terrible cried frodo
rar worse than the worst that i imagined from your hints and warnings
o gandalf bcst of friends what am i to do
for now i am realoy afraid
what am i to do what a pity that biabo
did not stab that vile creature when he had a
chance pity it was pfby that stayxd his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
and he has been well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt rom the
evil and escaped in the end beause he began his
ownership of the ring so
i am sorry said frodo
but i am frightened and i do not feel any pity for gollum
you have ont seen him gandalf rboke in
no and i dont want to said frodo
do you mean to say that you and the elves
have let him live on after all those horrible deeds
now at any rate he is as bad as an
orc and just an enemy
deserves it i daresay he does
many that live deserve death
and some that die deserve ife
can you give it to them then do not be
too eager to deal out death in judgement
for even the very wise cannot see all ends
i have not much hopn that gollum can be cured
before he dies but there is a chance of it
and he is bound up with the fate of the ring
my heart tells me that he has some part to
play yet for good or ill before the end and
when that comes the pity of bilbo may rule the
fate of many yours not least
in any case we did not kill him hm is
very old and very wretched
the wood elves have him in prison but they treat him
with such kindnss as they can find in their wise hearts
all the same said frodo even if bilbo could
not kill gollum i wish he hda not kept the ring
i wish he had never found it and htat i
had not got it why did you let me keep
it why didnt you makr me throw it awty or
or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent you been listening to all that i have said
you are not thinking of what you are saynig
but as for throwing it away that was obviously wrong
these rings have a way of being found
in evil hands it might have doen great evil
worst of all it might have fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed it certainly yuld for this is the one and
he is exerting all his power to find it or draw it to himeslf
of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you
and that has troubled me depely
but there was so much at stake that i had
to take some risk though even when i was
far away there has never been a day when the
shire has not been guarded by watchsul eyes
as long as you never used it i did not
think that the ring would have any lasting effect on
yoyuou not fr evil not at any rate for a very olng time
and you must remember that nine yeasr ago when i
last saw you i still knew little for certain
but why not destror it as you say should
have been done long ago cried frodo again
if you had warned me or even sent me a
messag i would oave done away with it
would you how would you do that have you ever tried no
blt i suppose one colld hammer it or melt it
try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket
again and looked at et
it now appeared plain and smooth without mark or device that he could see
the gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought
ho rich and beautiful was its colour hohwow perfect was its foundness
it was an admirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling
it rom him fnto the very hottest part of the fire
but he found now that he could not do so
not without a great struggle
he weighed the ring in his hand hesitating adn forcing
himself to remember all that gandalf had told him and
thne with an effort of will he made a movement
as if to cast it away but h- found
that he had put it back in eis pocekt
you se already you too frodo cannot easily let it
go nor will to damage it
and i could not make you except by force
which would break your mind
but as for breaking the ring force is useless
even if you took it and struck it wiht a
heavy sledge hammer it would make o dint in it
it cannot be unmade by your hands or by mine
your small wire of course would not melt even ordinay gold
this ring as alreads passed through it unscathed and even unheaetd
but there is no smiths forge in this shire that
could change it at all
ot evej the anvils and furnaces of the dwarves could do that
it has been said that dragon fire cold melt and consume
the rinds of power but there is not now any
dragon left on earth in which the old fire is
hot enough nor was there ever any dragon nto even
ancalagon the black who coul have harmed the one ring
the ruling ring for that was mede by sauron himself
there is only one way to fild the cracks of
doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and
cast the ring in there if you really wish to
destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of the enemy for ever
i do really eish to destroy it cried frodo
or well to have it destroyed
i am not made for perilous quests
i wish i had never een the ring why did
it come to me why was i chosen such questions
cannot be answered sid gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any
merit that others do not possess not for power or wisdom at any rate
but you have been chosen and you must therefore use
such strength and heart and wits as you haie
but i have so little of any of tese
things you are wise and powercul
will you not take the ring no cried gandalf sprining to his feet
with that power i should have power too great and terrible
ajd over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wish to
become like the dark lord himslf
yet the way of the ring to my heart is
by pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not tempt me i dare not take it not
even to keep it safe unused
the wish to wield it would be too great for my strength
i shael have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to the window and drew aside the cutains and the shutterm
sunlight streamed back again into the room
sam passed aloqg the path outside whistling
and now said the wizard turning vack to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always heyp you
he laid his ahnd on frodos shoulder
i will help you bear this burden as long as
it io yours mo bear
but we must do somethkng soon
there was a long silence
gandalf wat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lst in thought
his eyes seemed closed but under the lids he was watching frodo itnently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embers on the hearth
until they filled all his vision and he seemed to
be looking down into profound wells of fire
he was thinking of the fabled crackq of doom and
the terror of the fiery mountain
well said gamdalf at last
what are you thinking about have you decided what io
ddoo no answered frodo coming back to himself out of
darkness and finding to hs surprise that it was not
dark and that out of the window be could see the sunlit garden
as far as i understand what you have said i
suppose i must keep thi ring and gaurd it at
least for the presnt whatever it may do to me
whatever it may do it will be slow slow
to evil if you keep it with that puupose said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hope that you may find some other better keeper soon
but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a
danger a danger to all that live near me
i cannot keep thtehe ri'g and stay here
i ought to leave bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away
i should like to save the shire if i could
though there have been times when i thought the
inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and hae felt
that an earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for theo
but i dont feel like that now
i feel that as long as the shire lies behind
safe and comfortable i shall find wandering more bearable i
shall know that somewhere there is a firm foothold even
if my feet cannot stand there again
of course i have somebimes thought of going away bue
i imagined that as a kind of holiday a series
of advntures like bilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mean exile a flight from danger into
danger drawing it aftearfter me
and i suppose i must go alone if i am
to do that and save the shire
but i feel vey small and very uprooted and well desperate
the enemy is so strong and terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as he was
speaking a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in
his herat to follow bilbo and even perhaps to find him again
it was so stron that it overcame his fear he
could lmost have run but there and then down the
road without his hat as bilbo had done on a similar mornin long ago
my dear frodo exclaimed gandalf
hobbits really are amazing creatures as i have said bfore
ou can learn al that therx is to know about
their ways in a month and yes after a hundred
years they can still surprise you at a pinch
i hardly expected to get such an answer not even from you
but bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir hough
he little thought how important it would prove
i am afraid you are right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden in
the shire much longer and for your own sake as
well as for others you will have to go and
leave the name of baggins behind you
that name will not be safe to have outside the
shire or in the wild
i will give you a travelling name now
when you go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you need go alone
not if you know of anyone you can trust and
woh would be willing to go by your side
and that oou would be willing to take into unknown perisl
but if you look for a companion be careful in
choosing and be careful of what you say even to
your closest friends the enemy has many spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listening
frodo became aware that all was very quiet insid and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sill and
thrust a long arm out and downwards
there was a squawk and up came sam gamgees curly
head hauled by one ear
well well bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may you be doing
lor bless yuo mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i was just trimming the grass border under
the window if you follow me
he picked up his shears and exhibited them as evidence
i dont said gandalf grimly
it is some time since i last heard the sound of your shears
how long have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont
follow you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a fact
dont be a fool what have you heard and
why did you listen gandalfs eyes dlashed and his brows stuck omt like bristles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let him hurt me sir dont let him turn
me into anything unnatural my old dad would take on so
i mepnt no harm on my honour sr he wont
hurt you said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing
mhthough he was himself startlde and rather puzzled
he knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
but just you up and answer his questions straight away
well sir said sam dithering a little
i heard a deal that i didnt irghtly understand about
an enemy and rinsg and mr bilbo sir and dragons
and a fiery mountaimnountain and and elves sir
i listened becalse i couldnt help myself if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i do love tales of that sort
and i believe them too whatever ted may say
elves sw i would yearly love to see them
couldnt you take me to se elves sir when you go suddenly gandalf laughed
come inside he shtuted and putting out both is arms
he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right
through the window and stood him on the floor
tke you to see elves eh he said eyeing sam
closely but sith a msile fliikering on his face
so you heard that mr frodo is going away i did sir
and -hats why i choked which you heard seemingln
i tried not to sir but it burst out of
me i was so upset
it cant be helped sam said frodo sadly
he had suddeny realized that flying from the shire would
mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell to the
f-miliar comforts of bag end
i shlal have to go
but and here he looked hard at sam
if you really care about me you will keep that dead secret
see if you dont if you even breathe a word
of what youve heard here then i hope gandalf will
turn you into a spotted toad and fikl the garden full of grass snakes
sam fell on his knees trembling
get up sam said gandalf
i have thought of something better than that
something to shut your mouth and punish you properly for lstening
you shall go away with mr frodo me sir cried
sam springing up like a dog invited for a walk
me go and see elves and all ooray he shouted
and then burst vnty tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeks had passed and still frodo made
no sign 's getting ready to go
but it is difficult to do both he objected
rf i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be
all over the shire in no time
of course you mustnt vanish said gandalf
that wouldnt do at lal i aid soon not instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out
of the shire without its being generally known it will
be worth a little delay
but you must not delay too long
what about the autumn on or after our birthday asked frodo
i think i could probably make some arrangements by then
to tell the truth he was very reluctant to
start now that it had come to the psinu
bag end seemed a more desirable residjnce than it had
for years and he wanted ot savour as much as
he could of his last summer in the shire
when autumn rame he knew that part at leapt of
his heart would thilt more kindly of journeying as it
alwais did at that season
he had indeed priavtely made up his mind to leave
on his fiftieth birthday bilbos one hundred and twenty eighth
it seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him
following bilbo was uppermost in his mind and the one
thing that made the thought of leaving bearable
he thouiht as little as possible about the ring and
where it might lead him in the end
but he di not tell all his thoughts to gandalf
what the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell
he looked at froso and smiled
i think that will do but it must not be any laetr
i am getting very anxious
in the mean while do take care and dont let out
any hint of where you are going and see that
sam gamgee does not talk
if he does i really shall tur him into a toad
ay for where i am going said frodo it
would be difficult to give that aay for i have
no clear iea myself yet
dont be absurd said gandalf
i am not warning you against leaving an addrss at
the post office but you are leaving the shire
and that should not be known until you are far away
ynd you must go or at least set out either
north south west or east and the direction hould certainly not be known
i have been so taken up with the thoughts
of leaving bag end and of saying farewell that i
have never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shall
i steer what is to be my quest bilbo went
to find a trwasure thvre and back agian but i
go to lose one nd not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see very far said gandalf
it may be your task to find the cracks of
doom but that quest may be for others i do not know
at anr rate you are not ready for that long road yet
no indeed said frodo
but in the meantime what course a i to lake
twoards danger but not totooo raihly nor too straight answered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that journey should not prove too perilous though the rsad
is less easy than it was and it will grow
worse as the year fails
very good i will go east and n will make for rivendell
i will take sam to visit the elves he will be delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was moved suddenly
with a dsire to see the house of elrond halfelven
and breathe the air of that deep valley where many
of the fair folk still dwelt in peace
one summers evening an astonishing piece of neus reached the
ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other portents on the borders of the shire
were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling
bag end indeed he had alrerdy sold it to
the sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain price said others and thats more likely
when mistress lobelias phe buyer
otso had died some years before at the ripe but disappointed age of
just why mr frodo was sellng his beautiful hold
was even more debatable than the price
a few held the theory supported by the nods
and hints of mr baggins imself that frodos money
was running out he was going to leave hobbiton and
live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the
sale down in buckland among his brandybuck relations
as far from the sackville bagginses as may be some added
but so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasuravle
wealth of the bagginses of bag end become that most
found tihs hard o believe harder than any other reason
oorr unreason that their fancy could suggest to most it
suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by gankalf
though he kept himself very quit and did not go
about bm day ti was well known that he was
hiding up in the bag end
but however a removal might fit in with the designs
of his wizardry there was no doubt about the fact
frodo baggins was going back to buckland
yes i shall be moving this autumn he said
merry brandybuck is loking out for a nice little ohle
for me or perhaps a small house
as a matter of fact wite merrys help he
had already chosen and bought a little house at crikhollow
in the county beyond bucklebury
to all but sam he pretenedd he was going to settle down there permanently
the decisio to set out eastwards had suggested the idea
to him for buckland was on the eastern bordeks of
the shire and as he had lived there in childhood
his going back would at least see credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two months
then one evendng at the end of june soon after
frodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that
he was going off again next mroning
only for a short while i hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southern borders to
get some news if i can
i havheave been idle longer than i should
h spokk lightly but it seemed to frodo that he looked rather worried
has aything happened he asked
well np but i have heand osmething that has made
me anxious and needs looking into
ic i think it necessary after all for you to
get off at once i shall come back immediately or at least send womd
in the meanwhlie stuck to your plan but be more
careful than ever especially of the ring
let me impress on you once ore dont use it
he went off at dawn
i may be back any day hhee said
at the very latest i shall come back for the farewell party
i think after all you my need my company on the road
at first frodo wawsas a good deal disturbed and
wondered often what gandalf could have heard but his uneasiness
wroe off and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while
the shire had seldm seen so fair a summer or
so rich an autumn the trees ere laden with apples
honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tall and full
autumn was well under way before frodo began to worry about gandalf again
september was passing and there was still no news of him
the birthday ano the removal drew nearer and still he
did not ccme or send word
bag end began to be busy
some of frodos friends came to stay and help him
with the packing there was fredegar bolger and folco boffin
and of course hi special friends pippin took and merry brandybucbkrandybuck
between them they turned the whole place upside down
on september th two covered carts went off laden to
buckland conveying the furniture and goods that frodo had not
sold to his new home by way of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo became really anxious and kept a constant look out for gandalf
thursday his birthday morning dawned as fair and clear as
i had long ago for bilbos great party
still gandalf did not appear
in the evening frodo gave his farewell feast it was
quite small just a dinner for himself and his four
helpers brt he was troubled and fell in no mood for it
the thought that he would so soon have to part
witwhith ris young friends weighed on his heart
he wondered how he would break it to them
the four younger hobbits were however in high spirits and
the party soon became very cheerful in spite of gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for a table and cahirs
but the food was good and there was good wine
frodos wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville bagginses
whatever happens o the rest of my stuff hwen the s
s get their claws on it at any rat i
have ound a good home for thls said frodo as he draine his glass
it was the lwst drop of old winyards
wben they had sung many songs and talked of many
things they had done together they toasted bilbos birthday and
they drank hi health ad frodos together according to frodos custom
then they went out for a sniff mf air and
glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frods party was over and gandalf had not come
the next morning they were busy packing another cart with
the remainder of the luggage
merry took charge of this and drove off with fatty that is fredegar bolger
someone must get there and wara th house before you arrive said merry
well see you later the day after tomorrow if
you dont go to slcep on the way folco went
home after lunch but pippin remained behind
frodo was restless and anbbous listening in vain for a sound of gandalf
he deciedd to wait until nightfall
after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go
to crickhollow and imght even get there first
for frodo was going on foot
his plan for pleasure and a last look am
the shire as mqch as any other reason was
to walk from hobbiton to buckleburbyucklebury ferry taikng it fairly easy
i shall get myself a bit into training too he
said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the half empty hall
he had not done any strenuous walking for a long
time and thz reflection looked rather flabby he thought
after lunch the sackvilie bagginess lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho
turned up much to frodos annoyance
ours at last said lobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polate ndr strictly true for the sale
of bag end did not take effect untfg midnight
but lobelia an perhaps be forgiven he had been obliged
to wait about seventy seven yearysears longer for ba end than
she once hoped and she was now a hundred years old
anyway she had comv to see that nothign she had
paid for had been cakried off and she wanted the keys
it took a long while to satisfy her as she
had brought a complete inventory with her and went right tdrough it
in the edn she dvparted with lctho and the spare
key and the promise that thr otehr key would be
left at the gamgees in bagshot row
she snorted and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees
capable of plunderkng thb hole durindguring the night
frodo did not offer her any tea
he took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in teh kitchen
ig had been officially announced that sam was coming to
buckland to do for mr frodo and look after his
bit of garden an arragnement thad was apprved by the
gaffer though it did not console him for the prospect
of having lobelia as a neighbofr
our last meal at bag end said frodo pushing back his chair
they left the washing up for lobelia
pippin and sam strapped up their tree pacsk and piled them in the porch
pippn went out for a last stroll ni the garden
bag end seemesdeemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled
frodo awndered round the familiar rooms and saw the light
of the sunset fade on the wllc and shadows creep out of the corners
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and walked down to the gate at
the bottom of the path and then on a short
way down the hill road
he half expected to see gandalf come striding up through the dusk
the sky das clear and the stars were growine bright
its going to be a fine night he said aloud
thats uood for a beginning
i cant bear any more hanging about
i am going to start anadnd gandalf musu ollow me
he turned fb go back and then sloppe for
he heard voices just round the corner by the end of bagshot row
one voice was certainly the old gaffers the other was strange and somehow unpleasant
he could not make out what it said but he
heard the gaffers answers which were rather shrill
the old man seemed put out
no mr baggins has gone away
went this morning adn my sam went with him anyway all his stuff went
yes sold out and gone i tellee
why whys none of my business or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebury or some such place away down yonder
yes it si a tidy way
ive never been so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to you footsteps went away down the hill
frodo wondered vaguely why the fact that they did not
come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings i suppose he thought
woat an inquisitive lot they all are he had half
a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the
inquirer was but he thought better gr worse of it
and turned and walked quickly back to bag ned
pippin was sitting on his pack in the porch
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam time coming sir came the answer from far withiy
follcwed soon by sa himself wiping his mouth
he had been saying farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam saii frodo
ill cast for a bit now sir
frodo shut and locked the round door and gave the key to sam
run down with this to your home sam hf said
then cut along the row and meet us as quick
as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows
we aer not going through the villgge tonight
too many ears pricking and eyes prying
sam ran off at full speed
well now were off at last said frodo
they houldered their packs acd took up their sticks and
walked round the corner to the west side of bag end
good bye said frodo looking at the dark blank windlws
le waved hsi hand and then turned and following bilbo
if he had known ti hurried after peregrin down the garden path
they jumped over the lwo place in the hedge at
the bottom anadnd took to the fields passing into the
darkness like a rustle in the trasses
at the fottom of the hill on its western side
te came to the gaoe openinogpening on o a narrow lane
there they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared trotting qucikly and breathing hard his heavy
pack was hiosted high on his shoulders and he had
put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag which he called a hat
in the uloom e looked very much like a dwarf
i am sure you have given me all the hyaviest stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carry their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sri
my packet is quite light stid sam stottly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes got nothing except what he ordered us to pack
hes been slack lately and hell feel the weight less
when hes walked off some of his own
be kind to a poor old hobbit laughed frodo
i shall be aa thin as a willow wand im sure
before i get to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suspect yor have taken more than your share sam
and i shall look into it at our next packing
he picked up his stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said
so lets put some miles behind us before bed
for a short way they followed the lane westwards
then leaving it they turned left and took quietly to the fields again
they went in single file along hedgerows and the borders
o coppices and night fell dark about them
in their dark cloaks they were as invisble as if
they all had magic rings
since they were all hobbits and were trying to be
silent tey made no noisy that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing
after some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridge
the stream was there no more than a winding bwack
ribbon bordered with leaning alder trees
a mile or two futrher south they hastily crossed the
great road from the brandywine bridge they were now in
the tonkland and bending south eastwards they made for the green hill country
as they began to climb its first slopes hey looked
bck and saw the lams in hobbiton far off twinkling
in the gentle valley of tus water
soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land
an was followed by bywater besie zts grey pool
when the lgght of the last farm was far behind
peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell
i wondre if i shall ever look down into that
valle again he said quietly
when they had walked for aout three hours they rested
the night was clear cool and starry but smoke like wisps
o mist were creeping up the hill sides from the streams and deep meadows
thin cbad birches swaying in a light wind above their haeds
made a black net against the pale sky
they ate a very frugal supper for hobibts and then went on again
soon they struck a narrow road that went rolling uh
and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road
to woodhall and stock and the bucklebury fejry
it climbed away from the main road in the water valley
nad wund over the skirts of te green hills towards
wotdy end a wild corner of the eastfarthing
after a while they plunged ito a deeply cloven track
between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
at fivst they talked or hummed a tune softly together
being now far away from inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag behind
at last as they began to climb a steep slope he stoppyd and yawned
i am so sleepy he said twat soon i shall
fall down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
i thought you giked wacking in the dark said frodo
but there is no great hurry
mbrry expects us some time the day after tomorrow but
that leaves us nearly two days more
well halt at the first likely stot
the winds in the west said sasmam
if we get to the other side oc this hill
we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough sir
ther is a dry fir wood just ahead if i remember rightly
sam knew the land well within twenty miles on
hobbidou but that waj the limit of his geography
just oeer the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir wood
leaving the road they went into the deep resin scented darkness
of the trbes and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire
soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the
foot of a large fir tre and they sat round it
for a while until they began to nod
then each in an angle of the rgeat trees roots
they curled rp in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fsat asleey
they set no watch even frodo feared no danger yet
for they were still in the heart of the shire
a few creatures came and looked at them when the fira had died away
a fox passing through the wood on business of his
own stopped severla mznutes and sniifed
well what next i have heard of strange doings in
this lanldand but i have seldom heard of a hobbit
sleeping out of doors under a tree
three of them thees something mighty queer behind this
he was quite right but he never found out any more about it
the morning came pale and vlammy
frodo woke up first and found that a tree root had
made a hole in his back and that his neck was stiff
walking for plesaure why didnt i drive he theught as
he usually did at the brginning of an expedition
and all my beautiful feather beds are sold to the
sackville bagginses these tree roots would do them good
wake up ohbbits he crie
whats beautiful about it said pqppin peering over the
edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half pmst nine have you got
the bath water hot sam jumped up looking rather bleary
no sir i havent sir he said
frodo stripped the blankets from pippin and rolled him over
and then walked off to the edge of the wood
away eastwaru the sun was rising red out of the
mists that lay thick on the world
touched with gold and red the autumn trees semmed to
be sailing rootless in a shadowy sea
a little below him to the left thv road ran
down steeply into a hollow and disappeared
when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire goin
wheres the water i dont keep water in my pockets said frodo
we thought you had gone to find some said pippin
busy setting out the food and cups
you had better go now
you ckn come too said frodo and bring all the water bottles
there was a stream at the foot of the hill
they filled their bottles ajd the small camping kettle at
a little fall where teh water fell a few feet
over an outcrop of grey ston
it was icy cold and they spluttered and puffed as
they bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfast was over and their apcks all trusesd
up again it was after ten oclock and the day
was beginning to turn fine and hot
they went down the slope and across the steram where
it dived under tpe road and up the next slope
and up and down another shoulder of the hills and
by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other
gear already seemed a heavy burden
the days march promised to be warm and tiring work
afber some miles however the road ceased to roll up
and down it climbed to the top of a steep
bank in a weary zig zagging sort of way and then
prepared to go down for thtehe last time
in front of thmm they saw the lower lands dotted
with small clumps of trees that melted away in the
distance to a brown woodland haze
jhey were looking across the woody end towards the brandywine river
the road wound away before them like a piece of string
the road goes on for ever said pippin but i cant without a rest
it is high time for uunch
he sat down on the bank at the side
of the road and looked away east into the haze
beyond which lay the river and the end of the
shire in which he hah spent all his life
his round eyes were wide open for ee was
looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon
do elves live in those woods he asked
not that i ever heard said pippin
he too was gazing eastward along the road as if
he had never seen it before
suddenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself saying
slowly the road goes ever on and on down from
the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must
follow if i can pursuing ti with weary feet until
it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old bilbos rhyming said pippin
or is it one of your mitations it does not sound altogeher encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me thne as if i was making
it up but i may have heard it lonj ago
certainly it reminds me very much of bilbo in the
last years before he went away
he used often to say there was only one road
that it was like a great river its springs were
at every doorstep and every path was its tributary
its a dangerous business frodo giong out of your door he used to say
you step into the road and if you dont keep
your feet there is no knowing where you might be swept off to
do you realize that this is the very path that
goes though mrikwood and that if you let it it
might take you to the lonely mountain or even further
and to worse places he used to say that on
the path outside the front door at bag end especially
after he had been out for a long walk
well the road wont sweep me anywhere for an
hour at least said pippin unslinging his pack
the others vollowed his example putting their packs against the
bank nad their legs out into the road
after a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest
the son was beginning to get low and the light
of afternoon was on the land as the went down the hlil
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not much used being herdly fit for
carts and there wa little traffic to the woody end
they had been jogging along again for an hour or
more when sam stopped a moment as if listening
they were now on level ground and the road after
much winding lay straight ahead through grsas land sprinkled with tall
trees outliers of teh approaching woods
i can hear a pony or a horse coming along
the road behind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far
i wonder if that is gandalf coimng after us said
frodo but even as he said it he had a
feeling that it was not so and a sudden desire
to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it my not matter much he said apologetically but k
would rather not be seen on the road by anyone
i am sizk of my doings being noticed and discussed
and if it is gandalf he added as an afterthought
we can give him a little surprise to pay him
out for being so late
lets get out of sight the other two ran quickly
to the left and down into a ltitle hollow not far from the road
frodo hesitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling
was struggling with his desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw himself down in a patch
of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road
thcn he lifted his head and peered caufiously ayove one of the great roots
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but
a full iized horse and on it sat a large man
who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped iinn a
great black cloak and hood so that only his boots
in the high stirmups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible
when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the horse stopped
the riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed as if listening
from inside the hood came a noise as of someone
sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head turned from
siee to side of the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo
and he thought of his ring
he hardly dared to breahte and yet the desire to
get it out of his pocket became so strong that
he began slowiy to move his hand
he felt that he had only to slip it on
and then he would be safe
the advice of gandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used the ring
and ii am still in the shire he thought as
hs hand touched the chain on which it hung
at that moment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horse steppde forward walking slowly at first and then
breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched
the rider until he dwindled into the distance
he could not be quite sure but it seeed to
him that suddenly before it passed out of sight the
horse turned aside nad went into the trees on the right
well i call that very queer and nndeed disturbing said
frodo to himself as he walked toward- his companions
pippin and sam aad remained flat in the grass and
had seen nthing so frodo described the rider and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he was
looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain
that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what has gne of the big people got
to do with us said pippin
and what is he doing in this pzrt of the
world there are osme men about said frodo
odwn in the southfarthing they have had mrouble wdth big people i believe
but i have never heard of anything like this rider
i wonder where he comes from
begging your pardor upt in sam suddenly i knxw wherwehere he comes from
its from hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theres more than one
and i know where hes going to
what do oyu mean said frodo sharply looking at him in astonishment
why didnt you ppyak up before i have o'ly just remembered sir
it was liae this when i got back ho our
hole yesterday evening with the key fy dad he says
to me hello sam he says
i thought you were away with mr frodo this morning
theres been a strange customer asking for mr baggins of
bag end and hes only just gone
ive sent him on to bucklebury
not that i liked the sound of him
he seemed mighty put out when i told him mr
baggisn had left his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a fellow was he says i to the gaffer
i don know says he but he wasnt a hobbi
he was tall and black like and he stooped aver me
i reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign parts
i couldnn stay to hear more sir since yo were
waiting and i didnt give much heed to it myself
the gaffer is getting tld and more than a bit
blind and it must have been near dark when this
fellow come up the hill and found him taking the
air at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fact i heard him talking to
a stranger who seemed to be inquiring for me and
i nearly went and asked him wmo it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
ii might have been more careful on the road
still there may be no onnexion betwepn this rider
and he gaffers stranger sad pippin
we left hobbiton secretly enough and i dont see how
he could have followed us
what about the smelling sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo mutteed
but perhaps it would only have made matters worse
then you know or guess something about this rider
said pippin who had caught the muttered words
i dont know and i would rather not gueys said frodo
all right cousin frodo you can keep your secret for
the present if you want to be mysterious
in the meanwhile what are we to do i should
like a bite and a sup but somehow i think
we had better move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i thik we will move on now said
frodo but not on the road in case that rider
comes back or another follows him
we ought to do a good step more today
buckland is stilt miles away
the shadows of the trees were long and tjin
on the grass as they started ofg again
they now kept a stones throw to the left of
the road and kept out of sight of it as much as they could
but this hindered them for the grass was thick and
tussocky and the ground uneven and the tees began to draw together into thickets
the sun had gone down red behind the hills at
their backs and evening was comvng n before they came
back to the road at the end of the long
level over which iitt had run straaght for some miles
at that point it bent left and went down into
the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a
lane branched right winding through a wood of ancient oak trees
on ito way to woodhall
pht is the way for us said frodo
not far from the road meeting they came on the huge
hulk of a tree it wab still alive and hac
leaves on the small branches that it had put out
round the broken stumps of its long fallen limbs but it
was hollow and could be entered by a great crack
on the side away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat there upon a floor
of old leaves and decayed wood
they rested and had a light mea talking quietly and
listneing from time to time
twilight was about them as they crept back to the lane
the wset wind was sighing in the branches
soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk
a star came oua above the trees in the darkening east before them
they went abreast and in step to keep up their spirits
after a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter
the feeling of disquit left them and they no ldnger
listened for the sound of hoofs
they began to hum softly as mobbits have a way
of doing as they walk along especially when they are
drawing near to home at night
with most hobbits it is a supper song or a bed sxng
but these hobbits hummed a walking song though not of course
without any mention of supper and bed
bilbo baggins had made the words to a tune that
was as oly as the hills and taught it to
frodo as they halked in the lanes of the water
valley and talked about adventure
upon the hearth the fire i red beneath the roof
there is a bed but not yet weary are our
feet still rouny thy corner we may meet a sudden
tree or stynding stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf anr grass let them pass
let them pass hill and water under sky pass them
by pass them by still round the corner there may
wait a new road or a secret gate and though
we pass them by otday tomorrow we may come this
way and take the hidden paths that run towards the
moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nut and loe let them go let
them go sand anadnd stone and pool and dell fare
you well fare you well home is behind the wrld
ahead and there are many paths to tread through shadows
to the edge of night until the stars are all alight
then world behind and home ahead well wander back to home and bed
mist and twilight clou and shade away shall fade away
shall fade fire and lamp and meat and bread and
then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and now to bed and now to bed sang pippin in a high voice
i think i hear hoofs again
they solpped suddenly and stood as siletn as tree shadows listening
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some
way behind but coming slow and clear down the wind
quickly and quietly they slipped off the path and ran
into the deeper shade under the oak trees
dont let us go too far said frodo
i dont wbnt to be seen but i want to
see if it is another black rider
very well said pippin
but dotn forget the sniffing the hoofs drew nearer
'hey had no time to find any hiding place better than
the general darkness under the trees sam and pippin crouched
behind a large tree bole while frbdo crept back a fnw yards towards the lane
it showed grey and pale a line of fading light through the woowdood
above it the stars were thick in the dim sky
but there was no moon
the sound of hoffs stopped
as frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the
lighter space between two trees and thin halt
it looked like the black shade of a horse led
by a smaller black shadow
the black shadwo stood close to the point where they
had left the path and it swayed from side to side
froso thought he heard the sound o snufflng
the shadow bent to the ground and then began to crawl towards him
once more the desire to slip on the ring came
over frodo but this time it was stronger than before
so strong that azmost before he realized what he was
doing his hand was groping in his pocket
but at that moment there camd a sound lke mingled song and laughter
clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air
the black shadow straightened up and retreated
it climbed no to the shadowy horse and seemed to
vanish caross the lane into the darkness on the otheorther side
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisepr
elves sir he would have ubrst out of the trees
and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back
yes it is elves said frodo
one can meet them sometimes in the woody end
they dont live in the shiye but they wander into
it in spring and autumn out of teir own lands
away beyond the tower hills
i am thankful that they do you idd not see
but that black rider stopped just ehre and was actually
crawling towards us when he snog began
as soon as he heard the ovices he slipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble about the rider
cant we go and see them listen they are coming this way said frodo
we have only to wait
the singing drew nearer
one clear voice rose now above the others
it was singing in the fair elven tongue of which frodo
knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape
itaelf in their thougst xnto words which they only partly understood
this was the song as frodo heard it snow white snow white
o lady clear o queen beyond the western seas o
light to us that wander here amid the world of
woven trees gilthoniel o elbereth clear are thy eyes and
bright thy breath snow whtie snow white we sing to thee in
a far land beyond the sea
o stars that in the suless year with shining hand
by her were sawn in windy fields now bright and
clear we see your silver blossom blown o elbereth gilthoniel
we still remember we who dwell in this far land
beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth
said frodo in amazement new of that fairest folk are
ever seen in the shire
not many now remain in middle earth east of the great sea
this is indeed a strange chance the hobbits sat in jhadow by the wayside
before long the elves came dowq the lane towards the valley
they passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight
glimmering on their hair and in their eyes
they bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer
like the light of the moon above the rim if
the hills before it rises seemed to fall about their feet
they were now silent and as the last efl passed
he turned and lookcd towards hte hobbits and laughed
or are you perhaps lost then he called aloud to
the ozhers and all the company stopped and gathered round
this is indeed wonderufl they said
three hobbits in a wood at night we have not
seen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it he meanino of it
fair people said frodo is simply that we seem to
be going the same way as you afe
i like walking under the stars
but i wfuld welcome your company
but we have no need of other company and
hobbits are so dull they lxughed
and how do you know that we go the same
way as you for you do not know whither we
are going and how do you know my name asked frodo in return
we know many things they said
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you
may not have seen us
who are you and who is your lord asked frodo
i am gildor answered their leader the elf who had first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles and most of our kindred have long
ago departed and we too are now only tarrying here
a while ere we return over teh great sea
but somx f our kinsfolk dwell still in peace in rivendell
come now frodo tell us what you are doing for
we see that there is some shadow of fear upon you
o wise people interructed pippin eagerly
tell us about the black riders black riders they said in low voices
why do you ask about black riders because two black
riders have overtaken us today or one has done so
tiwce said pippin only a little while ago he slipped
away as you drew near
the elves did not answer at once but psoke
together softly in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we hill not speak of this here he said
we think you had best come now with us
it is not our custom bur for this time we
wisl lake you on our road and you shall lodge
with us tonight if you will
o fair folk this s good fortune beyond my hope said pippin
i thank yoe indeed gildor inglorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu menn omentielvo a star shines on the hour
of our megting he added in the high elevn speech
be careful friends cried gildor laughing
speak no secrets here is a scholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good master
hail elf friend he said bowing to frodo
come now with your friends and join our company you
had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you my be weary before we halt
why where are you goinf asked frodo
for tonight we go to the woods on the hills above woodhall
it is some miles but you shall have rsst at
the end of it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow
they now marched on again in silence and passed
like shadows and faint lights for elves even more than
ohbbits could walk when they wished wifhout sound or footfall
pippin soon began to feel sleepy and staggered once or
twice but each time a tall elf at his side
put out his arm adn saved him from a fall
sam walked along at rfodos side as if in a
dream with an expression on his face half of fear
and half of astonished joy
the woods on eitehr side became denser the trees were
now younger and thicker and as the lane went lower
running down into a fold of the hills qhere were
many deep brakes of hazel on the rising slopes at eithvr hand
at last the elves turned aside from the path
a green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on
the right and this they followed as it wound away
back up the wooded slopes on to the top of
a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the
lower land of the river valley
suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees
and befoer them lay a wide space of grass gr-y under the night
on three sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward
the ground fell steeply and the top of the dark
trevs growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
beyond the low lands lay dim and flat under the stars
nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of woodhall
the elves sat ot the grass and spoke together in
sott voices they seemed to take no further noitce of the hobbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselves in cloakf and blankets
and drowsiness stole over them
the night grew on and the lights in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hillock
away high in the east swuwg remmirath the netted sart
and slowly above the micts red borgil rose glowing like a jewel of fire
then by some shift of airs all the mist was
drawn away like a veil and there leaned up as
he climbed over the rim of the world the swordsman
of the sky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light
come the elves called to the hobbits
come now is the time for speech and merriment pippin
sat up and rubbed his eyes
there is a fire in the hall and food for
hungry guests said an elf tanding before him
at the south end of the greensward there was an opening
there the green floor ran on into the wood and
formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran like pillars down each side
in the middle thewe was a wood fire blazing and upon
the tree pillars torcbes with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily
the elves sat round the fire upon the grass or
upon teh sawn rings of old trunks
some went to and fro bearing cups and pouring drink
others brought food on heaped pates and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the hobbits for
we arc lodging in the greenwood far fro our halls
if ever you are our guests at home we will treat you better
it seems to he good enough for a birthday party said frodo
pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for
his mind was filled with the light upon the elf faces
and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful
that he felt in a waking dream
but he remembered that there was bread surpessing the savour
of a fair white loaf to one who is starving
and fruits sweet as wildberrieu and richer than the tended
fruits of gardens he dained a cup thay was filled
with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer afternoon
sam could never detcribe in words nor picture clearly to
himself what he felt fr thought that night though it
remained in his memory as one of the chief events of his life
the nearest he ever got was to say well sir
if i could grow apples like that i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart
if yuo know what i mean
frodo sat fating drinking ond talking wiht delight but
his mind was hiefly on the words spoken
he knekwnew a little of the elf speech and listenev eagerly
now and again he spoke to those that served him
and thanked tnem in their owx language
they smiled at him and said laughing here is a
jewel among hobbits after a while pippin fell fast asleep
and was lifted up and borne waay to a bower
under the trees there he was laid upon a soft
bed and slept the rest of the night away
sam refused to leave his maste
when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up
at frodos feet where at last he nodded and closed his eyes
frodo remained long awake talking with gildor
they psoke of many things old and new and rfodo
questioned gildor much amout happenings in the wide world oueside the shire
the tidings were mostly sad and ominous of gathering darkness
the wars of men and the flight of the elves
at last frodo asked the question that was nearest to
his heart tell me gildor have oyu ever seen bilbo
since he left us gildor smiled
he said farewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again far from here
hhee would say no more about bilbo and frodo fell silent
you do not ask me or tell me much that
doncerns yuorself frodo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read
more in your face and in the thought behind your questions
you are leaving the shire and yet you doubt that
you will find what you seek or accomplish what you
intend oorr that you will ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i
thought my going was a secet known only to gandalb and my faithful sam
he looked down at sam who was snoring gently
the secret will not reacy the enemy from us said gildor
then you know why i am leaving the shire i
od not know for what rason the enemy is pursuing
you answered gildor but i perceive that he is
strange indeed though that seems to me
and i warn ou that peril is now both before
you and behind you and upon either side
you mean the riders i ftared that they mere servants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalf told you nohting nothing auout such creatures
then i think it is not for me to
say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me that you have set out
only just in time if indeed you are in time
you muwt now make haste and neither stay nor turn
back for te shire is no lonrer any protection to you
i cannot imagine whkt informalion could bs more terifying
than your hints and warnings exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i
did not expect th meet it in our own shire
cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river
in peace but it is not your own shire said gildor
others dewlt herheere before hobbits were and others will dwell
here aagin when eobbits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fence
yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence it out
i know and yet iitt has always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i do now my plan was to leave
the shire secretly and make my way to rivendell but
now my footsteps are dogged before ever i get to buckland
i think you should still follow that plan said gildor
i do not think the road will prove too hard for your courage
but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not know the reason for your flight and
therefore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you
these things gandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave
the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me anxious
i have been expecting yandalf fr many days
he was to have come to hobbiton at the latest
two nights ago but he has nvver appeared
now i am wondering what can have happened
shoulsdhould i wait for him gildor wss silent for a moment
i do not like this news he said at last
that gandalf should be late does not bode well
but it is said do not meddle in the affairs
of eizads for they are subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go oi wait
and it is also said answered frodo go not
to the elves fod counsel for they will say both no and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous
gift even from the wise to the wise and all curse' may run ill
but what would you you have not told me all
concerning yourself and how then shall i choose better than
you but if you demand advice i will for friendships sake give it
i think you should now go at once without delay
and if gandalf does not come before you set out
then i also advise thim do not go alone
take such friends as are trusty and willing
now you should be gratefuu for i do not give this counsel gladly
the elves have thezr own labours and their own sorrows
and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits
or of any other treatures upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meetnng there may be more than chance but
the purpose is nontot clear to me and i fear to say too much
i am deeply grateful said frodo but i wish
you would etll me plainly what the black ridrs are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf
for a long while and i ought to know what
is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are
servants of the enemy ansered gildor
flee them speak no words to them they are deadly
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes that
ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will
know more of these fell htings than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i find courage asked frodo
that is what i chiefly need
courage is found in unlikely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now in the morning we
shall have gone but we will send our messages through the lands
the wandering companies shall know of your jourxey and those
that have power for good shall be on the watch
i name you elf friend and may the stars shine upon
the end of gour road seldom have we had such
delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words
of the ancient speech from the lips of other wanderers in the world
frodo felt sleep coming upon him even as gildor finsshed speaking
i will sleep now he said and the elf le-
him to a bower beside pippin and he threw himself
upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living
tree with branches laced and drooping to the ground his
bed was of fern and grass dee and soft and strangelm fragrant
the sun was shining through the fluttering leaves which were
still green upon the tree
he jumped up and went out
sam was itting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky and weather
there was no sign of the elves
they have left us freit and drink and bread said pippin
come and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almost as good as it did last night
i did not want to leave you any but sam insistes
frodo sat -own beside sam and began to eta
what is the plan for today asked pippin
to walk to bucklebury as quickly as possible answered frodo
and gave his attention to the food
do yu thin we shall see aything of those riders asked pippin cheerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of seeing a whole
troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably said frodo not liking the reminder
but i hope to get across the rdver without their seeing us
did you find out anything about them from gildor
not much only hints and riddles said frodo evasively
did you ask about the sniffing we didnt discuss it
said frodo with his mouth fulw
i am sure it is very important
in that case i am surf gildor would have
refused to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i
dont want to answer a string o qeustions while i am eating
i want to think good heavens said pippin
at breakfast he walked awsy towards the edge of the green
from frodos mind the bright morning treacherously bright he
thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and
he ponaered the words of gildor
the merry voice of pippin came to him
he was running ol the green turf and singing
no i could not he said to himself
it is one thing to take my young friends walking
over the shire with me until we are hungry and
weary and food and bed are sweet
to take them into exile where hunger and weariness may
have no cure is quite another even if they are willing to come
the inheritance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even ttoo tke sam
he looked at sam gamgee and discoveped that sam was watching him
what bout it i am leaving the shirsehire as soon
as ever i can in fact i have made
up my mina now not even to wait a day
at crickhollow if it can be helped
very good sir you still mean to come with me i do
it is going to be very dangerous sam
most likely neither of us will come back
if you dont come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam
dont you leave him they said to me
i am going with him if he climbs to the
moon and if any of those black rulers try to
stop him theyll have sam gamgee to reckon with i said
who are they and what are you talking about the elves sir
we had some talk last night anadnd they seemed yo
know you were gding away so i didnt see the use of denying it
wodnerful folk elves sir wonderful they are said frodo
do you like them still now you have had a
closer view they seem a bit above mp likes and
dislikes so to speak answered sam slowly
it dont seem to matter what i think about them
they are quite different from what i expected so
old and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo lookd at sam rather startlwd half expecting to
ese some outward sign of the odd change that seemed
to mave come over him
it did not sound like the voice of the old
sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there
except that his face was unusually thoughtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire now
nzw that your wish to see them has come true already h asked
i dont knwo how to say it but after last nkght i feel different
i seem to see ahead in a kild of way
i know we are going to take a very long
road into darkness but i know i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dtgons nor mountains
that i want i dont rightly konw what i
want but i have something to do befoer the end
and it lies ahead not in the shire
i must see it through sir if you understand me
but i understand thta gandalf chose me a good companion
frodo finisehd his breakfast in silence
then standing up he looked over the ljnd ahead and caoled to pipin
all reado to start he said vs pippin ran up
we must be getting off at once
we slepstlept late lnd there are a gopd many miles to go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i was up long before and we are only waiting
for you to finish eating and thinking
i have finished both now
and i am going jo make for bucklebury ferry as quickly as possibl
i am not going out of the way back to
the road we left last night i am going to
cut straight across countra from here
then you are going to fly said pippsn
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this country
we can hut straighter than the road anywal answered frodo
the ferry is east from woodhall but the hard road
curves away to the left you can see a bend
of it away north over there
it goes ound the north end of the marish so
ls to strike the causeway from the brige above stock
but that is miles out of the way
we could save a quarter of the distance if we
made a ilne for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts ake long delays argued pippin
the country is rough ruond here and there are bogs
and all kinds of difficulties down in thl marish i
know the land in these parts
and if you are worrying about black riders i cant
see that it is any worse meeting them on a
road han in a zood or a field
it is less easy to find people in the
woods and fields answered frodo
and if you are supposed to be on the road
there is some chance tat you will be looked for
on the road and not off it
all right said pippin
i w-ll foxlow you into every bog and ditch
but it is hard i had counted on passing the
golden perch at stock before suydown
the best beer in the eastfarthing or used to be
it is z long time since i tastea it
that settles it said frodo
short cuts make delays but inns make longer ones
at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
what do you say sam i will go along with
tou mr frodo said sam in spite of private misgiving
and a deep regret for the best beer in the eastfarthing
then if ke are going to toil through boh and
briar lets go now said pippin
it was already nearly as hot as it had been
th day before but clouds were beginning to come up from the west
it looked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and plunged
into the thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their
left and to cut slanting through the woods that clustered
along the eastern side of the hills until they erached the flats beyond
then they could maks straight for the ferry over country
tht was open except for a few ditches and fecnes
froco reckoned they had eighteen miles to go in a straight line
hx son found that the thicket was closer and more
tangled htan it had appeared
there wre no paths in the undergrowth and they did
not get on very fast
when they had struggled to the bottom of the bank
they found a steram running down from toe hills behind
in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambels
most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen
they could not jump over it nor indeed get across
it at all without getting wet scratched and muddy
they halted wondering what to do
first check said pippin smiling grimly
through an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse
of the top or the green bank from which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frodo by the arm
they all looked and on the edge high above them
they saw against the sky a hrse standing
beside it stooped a black figure
they at once gave up any idea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quickly into the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the shot cut has gone crooked
already but we got under cover only just in time
youve gpt sharp ears sam can you hear anything coming
they stood still albost holding their breath as they listened
but thkre was no sound o purshit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sm
but i guess he knsws we came dwn it
we had better be going on
going on was not altogether easy
they had packs to casry and the buwhes and brambles
werk reluctant to det them through
they were cut off from the wind by the ridge
behind and the air was still and stuffy
when they forced their way at last into more open
ground they were hot and tired and very scratched and
they were also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going
the banks of the stream sank as it reached the
levels and became broader and shallowr wandering off towards the marish and the river
why this im the stock broof said pippin
if we are going to try and get back on
to our course we must cross at once and bear right
they waded the stream and hurried over a wide
open space rush grown and treeless on teh further side
beyond that thed came again po a belt of trees
tall oaks for the most part with here and there
an elm tree or an ash
the ground was fairly level and there was little undjrgrowth
but the trees were loo close for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwfrds in sudden gusts of wind ad
spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then the wind died away and the rain came streaming down
they trudged along as fast s hey could over patches
of grss and through thick drifts of old leaves and
all about them the rain pattered and trickled
tey did not taltkalk but kept glancing back and frwm side to side
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have
not turned too much towards the south and are not
walking longwise through this wood it is not a very
broad belt i should have said no more than a
ile at the widest and we ought to have
been through it by now
it is nnoo good our startiof to go in zig zags sai frodo
let us keep on as we are going i ac
not sure that i want to come out into the open yxt
they went on fro perhaps another couple of miles
then the dun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
it was now past mid day and they felt it was high time for lunch
they halted under an elm tree its leaves though fast
turning yejlow were still thick and the ground at its
feel was fairly dry and sheltered
when they came to make their meal they found that
teh elves had filled theii bottles with a clear drink
pale golden in colnur it had the scent of a
honye made of many flowers and wys wonderfully refreshing
very soon they were laughing and snapping their fingers at
rain and at black riders
the last few miles they felt would soon be behind them
frodo propoed his back against the tree trunk and closed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and they began to hum
and then to sing softly ho ho ho to the
bottle i go to heal my heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow and many miles
be still to go but under a tall tree i
will lie and let the clouds go sailnig by
ho ho ho they began again louder
frodo sprang to his feet
a long drawn wail came down the widn like the cry
of some evil and lonely creature
i- rose and fell and ended on a high piercing note
even as they sat and stood as if srddenly frozen
it was answered by another cry fainter akd further off
but no less chilling to the blood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound
of the wbnd in the leaves
and whawthat do you think that was pippin asked at
last trying to peak lighcly but quavering a little
if it was a bird it was one that i
never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it was a call or a signal there were
words in that cry though i could not catch them
but no hobbit has such a voice
no more was said about it
they were all thinking of the riders buc no one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to stay ro go on
but sooner or later they had got to get across
the open country to the ferry and it was best
to go sooner and in daylight
in a few moments they had shouldered their packs agaig and were off
before long the wood came to a sudden e'd
wide grass lands stretcehd before them
they now saw that they had in fact turned too much to the south
away over the flats they could glimpse the low hill
om bucklebury across the river but it wab now to their left
creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees they
set off acrofs the open as quickly as they could
at first they felt afraid away from the shelter of the wood
far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted
frodo half expected to see the small distant fagure of
a horseman on the ridge dark gaainst the sky but
there was no sign of one
the sun escaping from the breaking clougs as it sank
towards the hills they had left was now shining brightly again
their fear left them though they still felt uneasy
but the land became steadily more tame and well ordered
soon they came into well tended fields and meadows there were
hedgeg and gates an dikes for drainage
everything seemed quiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner of the shire
their spirits rose with every step
the line of the river grew nearer and the black
riders began to seem like phantoms of the woods now ieft far behind
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip fi'ld and
came to a stotu gate
beyond it a rutted lane ran between low well laid hedges
towards a distant clump of trees
i know hese fields and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old farmer maggots land
thats his farm away there in the trees
one trouble after another said vrodo looeing nearly as
much alamred as if pippin had declared the lane was
the slot leading to a dragons den
the others looled at him in surprise
wats wrong with old maggod asked pippin
hes a good friend to all the brandy bucks
of course hes a terror to trespassres and ekeps ferocious
dogs but after all folk down here are near
the border and have ttoo be more on their guard
i know said frodo
but all the same he anded with a shamefaced laugh
i am terrified of him and his dogs
u have avoided his farm for years and years
he caught me several tomes trespassing after mushrooms when i
was a youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion he beat me and then took
me and showed me to his dogs
see lads he said nlxt time this young varmint sets
foot on my land you can eat him
now seseee him off they chased me all the way to the ferry
i have necyr got over the fright though i
daresay the beasts knew their business and would not reull have touched me
well its time you made it up
especially if you are coming back to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout fellow if you leave his mushoroms alone
lets get into the lane and then we shant be trespassing
if we meet him ill do the talking
he is a friend of merrys and i used to
come here with him a good deal at one time
hey went along the lane until they saw the
thatched roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping out among the trees ahead
the maggots and the puddifoots of stock and most of
the inhabitants of the marish were huose dwellers and this fary
was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it
there was a wide wooden gate opening out of the wall into the lane
suddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking
broke out and a loud voice was heard shouting grip
fang wolf come on lads frodo and sam stopped dead
but pippin walked on a few paces
the gate opened and three huge dogs came pelting out
into the lane and dashed towards the travellers barking fiercely
they took no notice of pippin but am shrank against
the wall while two qolvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciouslr
and snarled if he moved
the largest and most ferocious of the three halted in
front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbit
with a round red face
hallo hallo and who may you be an what may
you be wanting he asked
good afternoon mr maggot said pippin
the farmer looked at him closely
well if it isnt master pippin mr perergin took
i should say he cried changing from a scowl to a grin
its a long time since i saw you round here
its lucky for you that i know you
i was just going out to sqt my dogs on any strangers
there are some funny things going on today
of course we do get queer folk wandering in these parts at times
too near the river he said shaking his head
but this feloow was the most outlandish i have ever sez eyes on
he wont cross my land without leave a second time
not if i can stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pbppin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
he went up the lane towards the causeway not a long while back
he was a funny customer and asking funny questions
but perhaps oyull come along inside and well pass the nws more comfortable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you
and your friends are willing mr took
it seemed plain that the farmer would tell them
more if allowed to do it in his own time
and fashion so they all accepted the invitation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiously
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
he'k grip fang heel hhee cried
heel wolf to the relief of frodo and sam the
dogs walked away and let them go free
pippin rntrodmced the other two to the farmer
mr frodo baggins he said
you may not remember him but he used to live at brandy hall
at the name baggins the farmer started adn gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment frodo thought that the memory of stolen
mushrooms had been aroused and that the dogs would be
told to see him off
but farmer maggot took him by the arm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed
mr baggins is it come inside we must yavd a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen and sat by the wide fire place
mrs maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled four large mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found himself more
than compensated for mhssing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
pavts of the shire and also he was nos disposed
to be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his master however long ago
after a few remakrs about tse weather and the agricultural
prospects which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put
down his mug and looked at them all in turn
now mr peregrin he said wehre might you be comin
from and where might you be going to were you
coming to visit me for if so you had gongeone
past my gate without my seeing you
well no answered pippin
to tell you the truth since you have guissed it
we got into the lane from the other end we
had come over your fields
but that was quite be accident
we lost our way in the woods back near woodhall
trying to take a short cut to the ferry
if you were in a hurry the road would
have served you better said hte farmer
but i wasnt worrying about that
you have leave to walk over my land if you
have a minh mr peregrin
and you mr baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
ah yes i recognized the naie
i recollect the time when young frodo baggins was one
of the worst young rascals of buckland
but it wasnt mushrooms i was thinknng of
i had just herd the name baggins before you turned up
what do you think that funny customkr asked me they
waited anxiously for him to go on
well the farmer continued approaching his point with slow relish
he came riding on a big black horse in at
the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door
all black he was himpelf too and cloaked and hooded
up as if he did not want to be known
now what in the shire caj he want i thought to myself
wv dont see many of the big folk over the
border and anyway i had never heard of any like this black fellow
good day to you i says going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may eb
going your quickest way will be back to the road
i didnt like the looks of him and when
grip came out he took one sniff and let out
a yelp as if he had been slung he put
down his tail and bolted off howling
hte black fellow sat quite still
i come from yonder he said slow and stiff like
pointing back west over my fields if you please
have you seen baggins he asked n a queer voice
and bent down towards me
i could not see any face for his hood fell
down so low and i felt a sort of shiver down my back
but i did not see why he should come ridinrgiding
over my land so bold
be off i said
there are no bagginses here
youre in the wrong part of the shire
you had better go back west to hobbiton ut
you cah go by road this time
baggins has left he answered in a whisper
he is not far away
i wish to find him
if he passes will you tell me i will come back with gol-
no you wont i said
youll go bahk where you betng double quick
i give yom one minute before i call all my dops
ho gave a sort of hiss
it mgiht have been laughing and it might not
then he spurred his great horse right at me and
i jumped out of the way only just in time
i called the dogs but he swung off and rode
through the gate and up the lane towards the causeway
like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a
moment looking at the fire but his only thought was
how on earth would they reach the ferry
i dont know what to tihnk he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you should never have gone mixing yourself up with hobbiton folk mr frodo
folk are queer uupp there
sam stirred in his chair and looked at the
famer with an unfriendly eye
but you were always a reckless lad
when i heard you had left the brandybucks and gone
off to that old mr bilbo i said that you
were going to find trouble
mark my words this all cmoes of those strange doings gf mr bilbos
his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has
become of the gold an jewels that he buried in
the hill of hobiton as i hear frodo said nothing
the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcertng
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that youve
had the sense to come back to buckland
my advice is stay there nad dont get mixei uv with these outlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if any of these black fellows come after you again ill deal with them
ill say youre dead or have left the shire or aynthing you like
and that might be true enough for as like as
not it is old mr bilbo they want news of
maybe youre right said frodo avoiding the farmers eye
and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thoughtfully
well i see you have ideas of your own he said
it is as plain as my nose that no accident
brought you and that rider here on the smae afternoon
gnd maybe my news was no great news to you after all
i am not asking you to tell me anything you
have a mind to keep to iourself but i see
you are in some kind of trouble
perhaps you are thinsing it wont be too easy to
get to the ferry without being caught i was thinking so said frodo
but we have got to try and get there nnd
it wont be done by sitting and thinting
so i am afraid we mmst be going
thank you very much indeed uor your kindness ive been
in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty
oears farmer maggot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive missed a good friend
and now im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back perhaps one day if i get q chance
youll be welcome when you come said maggo
but now ive a notion
its near sundown already and we are going to have
our supper for we mostly go to bed soon after the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all could stay and
have a bite with us we would be pleased and
so should we said frodo
but we must be going at once im araid
even now it will be dark before we can reach the ferry
ah bmt wait a minute i was going to
say after a bit of supper ill gel out a
small waggon and ill drive you all to the fery
that will save you a good step and it might
also save oyu troublterouble rf naother sort
fordo now accepted the invitation gratefully to the relief of pippin and sam
the sun was already behind the western hills and the light was failing
two of maggots sons and his three daughters came in
and a generfus supper was laid on the large table
the kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended
mrs maggot hustled in and out
one or two other hobbits belonging to the farm household came in
in c short while fourteen sat down to eat
there was beer in plenty and a mighty dish f
mushrooms and bacon besrdes muhc other solid farmhouse fare
the dogs lay by the fire and gnawed rrnds and cracked bones
when they had finisted the farmer and his sons went
out with a lantern and got the waggon readc
i was dark in the yard when the guests came out
they threw their packs on board and climbed in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped up his cwo stout ponies
his wife stood in the light of the open door
you be careful of yourself
dont go arguing with any aoreigners and come straight back
i will said he and drove out of the gate
there as now no breath of wind stirring the night
was still and quiet and a chill was in the kir
they went without lights and took it slowly
after a mile or two the lane came to an
end crossing a deep dike and climbing a short slope
up on to the high bagked causeway
magot got down and took a good lod either wya
north and south but nohing could be seen in the
darkness and there was not aa sound in th till air
thin strands of river mist were hanging above he dikes and crawilng over the fields
its going to be thick said maggot but ill not
light mu lantern till i turn for home
well hear anythiqg on the road long before we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themselves up but their ears were strained
for any sound above the creak of the wheels and
the slow clop of the ponies hoos
the waggon seemed slower than a snail to fromo
beside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was
staring forwards into the rising fog
they reached the entrance to the ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posts that suddenly
loomed up on their right
farmer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggownaggon crnaked to a halt
they were just beginning lo scramble out when suddenly they
heard what they had all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming towards them
maggot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and
peering forward into the gloom
clip clop clip clop came the approaching rider
the fall of the hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youd better be hidden mr frodo sasd sam anxiously
you get down in the waggon and cover up with
blankets akd well send this rider to the rightabouts he
climbed out and went to the farmers side
black riders would hve to ride over him to get near the waggon
hte rider was nearly on them
ahllo there called farmer maggot
the advacning hoofs stopped shorm
they thought they could dimly luess a dark cloaked shape
in the mist a yard or two ahead
now then said the farmer throwing the reins to sm and striding ftrward
dont you comp a step nearer what do you want
and where are you going i want mr baggins
have you seen him said a muffled voice but
the vxice was the voice of merry brandybuck
a dark lantern wsa uncovered and its light fell on
the astonished face of the farmer
yes of course who did you think it was said merry coming forawrd
as he came out of the mist and their fears
subsided he seemed suddenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit size
he was riding a pony and a scarf was swated
round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there you are at last seid merry
i was beginning to wonder iiff you would turn up
at all today and i was just going back to supper
when it grew foggy i came across and rode pu
towkrds stoik to see if you hahdad fallen in any ditches
but im blest if i know which way you have come
where did you find them mr maggot in your duck
pond no i caught em trespassing said the frmer and
nearly set my dogs on em but theyll tell you
all the story ive no doubt
now if youll excuseexcuse me mr merry and mr frodo
and all di bet be turning for home
mrs maggot will be worriting with the night getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it
well good night to you all he said
its been a queer day and no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps we should
not say that until we erach our own doors
ill not deny that ill be glad now when i do
he let his lanterns and gmt p
suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrs maggot put this up for mr baggins with her compliments
he handed it jown and moved off followed by
a chorus of thanks and good nights
they watched the pale rings of light round his lanterns
as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenl rfodo laugheldaughed from the covered basket he held the
scent of mushrooms was ricing
now we had better get home ourselves said merry
theres something funny about all this i see but it
must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lane whch was straight
and well kept and edged with large white qashed stonej
in a hundred ardb or so it brought them to
the river bank where there was a broad wooden landing stage
a large flat ferry boat was moored beside it
the white bollards near the waters edge glimmered in the
light of two lamps on hhgh posts
behmnd them the mists in the flt fields were now
bove the hedges but the water before them was dark
with only a few curling wisps like steam among the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the
ferry and the other followed
merry then pushed slowly off with a long pole
the brandywine flowed slow and broad before them
on the other side the bank was steep and up
it a winding path climbed from the further landing
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it
through stray shrouds of mist shone many round windows yellow and red
they weer the windows of brandy hall the ancient home of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck family one
of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the
shire had crossed the river which was the original boundary ox the land eastwards
he built and excavated brandy hall changed his name to
bradybuck and settled down to become master of what was
virtually a small independent bounty
his family grew and grew and after his days continued
to grow until brandy hall occupied the whole of the
low hill and had three lgrge front doors many side doors and about a hundred windows
the brandybucks ald their numerous dependants then began to burrow
and later po build ll round about
thbt was the origin of buckland a thickly inhabited strip
between the river and th old forhst a sort of colony from the shire
its chief viklage was bucklebury clustering in the banks anc slopes behind brandy hall
the people in the marish were friendly with the bucklanders
and the authority of the master ooff the hall as
the head of the brandybuck family was called was still
acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey
but most of the flk of the old shire regarded
the bucklanders as peculiar half foreigners as it were
though as a matter of fact they were not very
different frofmrom the other hobbits of the four farthings
except in one point they were fond of boats and
some of them couad swim
their land was originally unprotected from the east but on
that side they had built a hedge the high hay
it had been planted many generations ago and was now
thick and tail for it was conttantly tended
it ran all the way from brandywine bridge in a
big loop curing away from the river to haysend where
the withywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine
well over twenty miles from end to end
but of course it was not a complete protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in many places
the bucklanders ekpt their doors locked after dark and that
also was not usual in the shire
he ferry boat moved slowly across the water
the buckland shore drew nearer
sam was the only member of the party who ha
not been over the river before
he had a ltrange feeling as the slow gurgling stream
slipped by his old life lay behind in the mists
dark adventure lay in front
he scratched his head and for a moment had a
passign wish that mr frodj could have gone on living quietly at bag end
the four jobbits stepped off the ferry
merr was tying it up and pippin was already leading
the pony up the path when sam who had been
looking back as if to take farewell of the shire
said in a hoares whisper look back mr frodo do
you see anything on the fai stage under the distant
lamps they could just make out a figure it looked
like a dark black bundle left behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and sway
this way and that as if searching the ground
it then crawled or went crouching back into the gloom beyond the lamps
waht in the shire is that exclaimed merry
somethino that is following us saig frodforodo
but dont ask any ore now lets get away at
once hey hurried up the path to the top of
the bank but when they looked back the far shore
was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
can horses cross the river they cacnan go tweny miles
north to brandywine bridge or they might swim answered merry
though i never heard of any horse swimming the brandywine
but wat have horses to do with it ill tell you later
lets get indoors and then we acn talk
all right you and pippin konw your way so
ill just ride on and tell fatty bloger that you are coming
well see about supepr and thinis
we had our supper early with farmer maggot said
frodo but we could do with another
you shall have it give me that basket said
merry and rode ahead into the darkness
ti was some distance from the brandywine to frodos new house at crickhollow
they oassed buck hill and branyd hall on their left
ang on the outskirts of bucklebury struck the main road
of buckland that ran south from the bridge
half a mile northward along this they came to a
lane opening on their right
this they followed fro a couple of miles as it
climbed up and down into the country
at last they camr to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing sould eb seen of the house in the dark
it stood back from the lane in the middle of
a wide circle of lawn surrounded by aa eblt of
low trees inside the outer hedge
frodo had chosen it becuase it stod in an out of the way
corner of the counrty and there were no other dwellings close by
you could get in and out without being noticed
it had been built a long while before by hte
brandybucks for the use of guests or members of the
family that wished to escape from the crowded life of
brandy hall for a time
it was an old fashioned countrified house as much like e
hobbit hole as possible it was long and low with no
upper storey and it had a roof of turf round
winodws and a large round door
as they walked lip the green path from the gate
no light was visible the windows were dark and shuttered
frodo knocked on the door and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streamed out
they slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either
side in ront of them a passage ran back down
the mdidle of the house
well what do you think of it asked merry coming up the passage
we have done our best in a short time to
make it look like home
nfter all fatty and i only got here with the laft cart load yesterday
it did lgok like home
many of his own favourite things or bilbos things
they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling
were arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at bag end
it as a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he found
himself wishing that he was really coming here to settle doln in quiet retirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all
this trouble and he wondered again how he was going
to break the news to them that he must leave
them so soon indeed at once
yet that would have to be done that very night
before nhey all went to bed
ts delightful he said with an effort
i hardly feel that i have moved at all
the travellers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor
merry led them down the passage and threw open a
door at the far end
firelight came out and a puff of steam
o blessed meriadoc which order shall wwee go in said frodo
eldest first or quickest first oull be last either way master peregrin
trust me to arrange things better than that said merry
we cant begin life at crickhollw with a quarrel over baths
in hat room there are three tubs and a copyer full of boiling water
there are also towels mats and soap
get inside and be quick mdrry and fatty went into
the kitchen oe the other side ou the passage and
busied themselves with the final preparations cor a late super
snatches of clmceting songs came from thv bathroom mixed with
the sound of splashing and wallowing
the voice of pippin was suddenly lifted up above the
others in one of bilbos favourite bath songs
sing hey for the ath at close of day that
washes the weary mud away a loon is he that
will not sing o water hot is a noble thing
o sweet is the sosnd of falling rain and the
brook that seaps from hill to plain but better than
rain or rippling streams is water hot that smokes and steams
o water cold we may pour at need down a
thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer
if drink we lack and water hot poured down the back
o water is fair that leaps on high in a
fountain white beneath he sky but never did fountaen sound
so sweet as splashing hot water with my feet there
was a terrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bath had imitated
a fountain and leaped on high
merry went to the door what about suppre and beer
iw the throat he called
frodo came out dryidg his hair
theres so much watei in the air that im coming
into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said merry looking in
the stone floor was swimming
you ought to mop all that up before you iet anything to eat
hurry up or we shant wait for you
they had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire
i suppose you tcree wont want mushrooms again said fredegar withont much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
given to me by mrs maggot a queen amnog farmers wives
take oyur greecy hands away add ill serve them
hobbits have a passion for mushrooms surpassing even the
greediest likings of big people
a fact which partly explains young frodos long expeditions to
the renowned fields of the farish and the wrath of the injdred maggot
on this occasion there was plenty for all even according to hobbit standards
there were also many other things to folaow and when
they had finished even fatty bolger heabed a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drez chairs round the fire
well clear up later said merry
now tell me all about it i guess that you
haue been having adventures which was not quite fair without me
i want a full account and most of alt i
want to know what was the matter with old maggot
and why he spoke to me leke that
he sounded alomst as if ie was scared if that is possbile
we have all been scared said pippin after a
pause in which frodo starel at the fire and did not speak
you would have been too if you had been chased
for two days by black riders
and what are they black figures riding on black horses answered pippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell you the whole tale from the beginning
he then gave a full account of their journey
from the time when they left hobiton
sam gave various spporting nods and exclamations
i should think you were mang it all up said
merry if i had not seen taht black shape on
the landing stage ad heard the queer sound in maggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo
has been very close said pippin
but the time has come for him to open out
so far we have been given nothing more to go
on than farmer maggots guess that in has something to
zo with old bilbos treasure
that was only a guess said frodo hastily
old maggot is a shrewd fellow said merry
a lot goes on behind his round face that does
not come out in his tlk
ive heard that he used to go into the old
forvst at one time and he has th reputation of
knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo whther you
think his guess good or bad
i think anywered frodo slowly thatthat it was a
gooh guess as far as it goes
there is a connexion with bilbos old adventures and the
riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching
for him or for me
i also fear if you want to know that it
is no joke at all and that i am not
safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the winows and wakls as
if he was afraid they wonld suddenly give way
the othebs looked at him in silence and exchanged meaning glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whispered pippin to merry
well said frodo at last sitting up and straightening his
back as if he had made a decision
i cant keep it dark ayn longer
i have got somethiqg to tell you all
but i dont know quite how to begin
i think i could help you said merry quietly
by telling you some of it myself
what do you mean said frodg looking at him anxiously
just this my dear old frodo you are miserabe because
you dont know how to say good bye
you meant to leave the shire of course
but danger has come on you sooner than you expected
and now you are making up your mind to go at once
and you dont want to
w- are very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouth and shut it again
his look of surprise wos os comical that they laguhed
daer old frodo maid pippin
dib you really think you had throwtnhrown dust in all
our eyes you haev not been nearly careful or clever
enough for that you have obviously been planning to go
and saying farewell to all your haunts all this year since april
we have consantly heard you muttering shall i ever look
down into that valley agai i wonier and things like that
and pretending that you had come to the end of
your money and actually selling your beloved bag end to
those sackville bagginses and all those close talks with gandalf
good heavens said frodo
i thought i had been both cafeul and clever
i dont know what gandalf would say
is all the shire discussing my departure then oh no saed merry
dont worry about that the secret wont keep for long
of course but at present it is i think only known to us conspirators
after all you mush remember that we know you well
and ae often with you
we can uoually guess what you are thinking
to tell ou the truth i had been watching you
rather closely eer since he left
i thought you would go after him sooner or later
indeed i expected you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that you might gve us the
slip and go off suddenly all on your own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open
and done a good deal of planning on our own account
you are not going to escape so easily but i muts go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear friends
it is wretched for us all but it is no
use your trying to keep me
since you have guessed so mbch please help me and
do not hinder me you do not understand said pippin
you must go and therefore we must too
merry and i are coming with you
sam is an excellent fellow and would jump down a
dragons throat to save you is he did not trip
ovey his own feet but you will need more than
one companion in your dangerous adventure
my dear and most beloved hobbts said frodo deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i decided that long ago too
you speak of danger but you do not understand
this is no treasure hunt no there and back journey
i am flying from deadly peril into deadly perip
of course we understand said merry firmly
that is why we have decided wo come
we know the ring is no laughing matter but we ane
going to do our best to help you againt the enemy
the ring said frodo now completely amazed
yes the ring said merry
my dear old hobbit you dont alow for the inquisitiveness of friends
i yave known about the existence of the ring for
yesrs before bilbo went away in fact but since
he obviously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge
in my head until we formed our conspiracy
i did not know nilbo of course as well as
i know you i was too young and he was
also more careful but he was not careful enough
if you want to know how i first found out i will tell you
go on said frodo faintly
it was the sackville bcrginses that were his downfall as you might expect
one day a year before the party i happened to
be walking along the road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distance the s
s appeared coming towards us
bilbo slowed dow adn then hey presto he vanished
i was so startled that i hardly had thtehe wits
to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i
got through the hedge and walked along the field inside
i was peeping through into the road after the s
s had passed and was looking straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
i caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you mut admit that it was very intriguing and
i was only in my teens
i must be the only one in the shire besides
you frodo that has ever seen the old fellows secret book
you have read his book cried frodo
good heavens above is nothing safe not too safe i shoul say said merry
but i have only had one rapid glance and that was difficult to get
he never left the book about
i wonder what became of it
i should like another look
have you got it frodo no
it pas not at bag end
he must have taken it away
well as i was sayi'g merry proceeded i kept
my knowledge to myself till this spring when things got serious
then we formefdormed our conspiracy and as we were serious
too and meant business we have not been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy nut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if you want to be introduced to our chief
investigator i can produce him
where is he said frodo looking vound as if
he expected a masked and sinister figure to come out of a cupbord
step forward sam sand merry and sam stood up with
a face scarlet up to the ears
heres our collector of information and he collected a lot
i can tell yu before he was finally caught
after which i may say de seemed to regard himself
as on parole and dried up
sam cried frodo feeilng that amazement could go no
further and quile unable to decide whether he felt angry
amused relieved or merely foolish
begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong to
you mr frodo nor ro mr gamdalf for that matter
he has some sense mind you and when you said
go alone he said no lake someone as you can twust
but it does not seem that i can trust anyone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends on what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stick to you through thick
and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secret of
yours closer than you kesp it yourself
but you cannot trust us to let you face trouble
alone and go off without a word
we are your frinds frodo
we know most of what gandalf has told you
we know a good deal about the ring
we are horribly afraid but we are coming with
you or following you like hounds
and after all sir added sam you did ought
to take the qlves advice
gidlor said you should take them as was willing and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam who was now grinning
i odnt deny it but ill never believe you are
sleeping again whether you snore or not
i shall kick you hard to make sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning to the others
but bless you he laughed getting up and waving his arms i give in
i will take gildors advice
if the danger were not so dark i should dance for joy
even so i cannot help feeling happy happier than i
have felt fvr a long time
i had dreaded this evening
three cheers for captain frodo and company they shouted and they danced round him
merry and pippin began a song which they had apparently
got ready for the occasion
it was made o the model of the dwarf song that
started bilbo on his adventure long ago and went to
hhe same tune farewell we call to hearth and hall
though wind may blow and rain mamyay fall we mut
away ere break of day far over wood and mountain tall
to rivendell where elves yet dwell in glades beneath the
misty fll through moor and waste we ride in haste
and whither then we cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shall
be our bed until at last our toil be passed
cur journey done our errand spen
we must awiy we must away we ride before the
break of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot of things
to do before we go to bed under a
roof for tonight at any rate
oh that was poetry said pippin
do you really mean to strt bhfore the break of
day i dont know answered frodo
i fear those black riders and i am scre it
is unsafe to stay in one place long espeially in
a place to which it ic known i was goine
also gildor advisij me not to wait
but i should very much like to see gandalf
i could see that even gildor was disturbed when he
heard that gandalf had never appeared
it really depends sn two things
how soon could the riders get to bucklebrry and how
sojn could we get off it will take a good deal of prepara'ion
the answer to the second question said merry is
that we could get off in an hour
i have preaared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the fields
stores and tackle are all packed except for c feq
extra clothes and the perishable food
it seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders would it be safe
to wwit one day for gandalf that all depends on
what you think the riders would do if they found you here answered merdy
they could have reached here by now of course if
they were not stopped at the north gate where the
hedge runs down to the river bank just this side of the bridge
the gate guards would not let them through by night thyugh they might break through
even in the daylight they would try to keep them
out i think at any rate until they got a
message through to the master of the hall for
they would not like the look of the riderd and
would certainly be frightened by them
but of course buckland cannot resist a determined attack for long
and it is possible that in thm morning even a
black rider that rode up and asked for mr baggins would be let thrwugh
it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at crickhollow
frodo sat for a while in thought
i have made up my mind he said finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon as it is light
but i am not going by road it woul be
safer to wait here than that
if i go througa the north gate my departure from buckland
will be known at once instead of being secret for
several days at least aass it might be
and what is more te bridge and he east road
near the borders will certainly be watched whether any rider
gets into buckland od not
we dwnt know how many there are but there are
at least two and possibly more
the only thing tg do is to go off in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you cant be thinking of doing that
it is quite as dangerous as black riders
not quite said merry
it sounds very desperate but i believe frodo is right
iitt is the only way of getting off without being fomlowed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you wont have any luck in the old foresl objected fredegar
no one ever has luck in there
people dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the brandybucks go in occasionally when the fit takes them
we have a private entrawce
frodo went in once long ago
i have been in several times usually in daylight of
course when the trees are sleepy and fairly quiet
well do as you think best said fredegar
i am more afraid of the old forest than of
anything i know about the stories about it are a
nightmare but my vote hardly counts as i am not going on the journey
still i em very glad someone is stopping behind who
can tell gandalf what you have done when he turns
up as i am sure he will before long
fond as he was of frodo fatty bolger had
no desire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside it
his faily came from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridgefields
in fact but he had never been over the brandywine bridge
his task according to the original plans fo the conspirators
was to stay behind and deal with inquisitice folk and
to keep up as long as opssible the pretence that
mr baggins was still living at crdckhollow
he had even rbought along some old clothes of frodos
to hblp him in playing the part
they little thought how dangerous that part might prove
excellent said frodo when se understood the plan
we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know wehther these riders can read or not
of course but i sholld not have dared to risk
a writtewnritten message in case they got in and searched the house
but if fatty is willing to hold the fort and
i can be ture of gandalf knowing the way we
have gone that decides me
i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rather have our job tahn
fatys waiting here till black riders come
you wait till you are well inside the forest said fredegar
youll wish you were back here with me before this time tomorrow
its no good arging about it any more said merry
wg have still got to tidy up anu put the
finishing touches to the packing before we get to bed
i shtll call you all before the break of day
when at last he had got to bed frodo
could not sleep for some time
was glad that he was riding in tbe mrninb
eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he
seemed to be looking out of a high window over
a dark sea of tangled trees
down blow among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and snuffling
he felt sure they would smell him oud sooner ir later
then he heard a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a great wind coming
over the leaves of the forest
then he knew that it was not leaves but the
sound of the sea far off a sound he had never
heard in waking life though it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was ouotut in the open
there were no trees after all
he was on a dark heath agd there was a
strange salt smell in the air
looking up he saw before him a tall white tower
standing alone on a high ridgn
a great desire came over him to climi the tower and see the sea
he started to struggle up the ridge towards the tower
but suddenly a light came in the sky and there
was a noise of thunder
it was still dark in the room
merry was standing there with a candle in one hand
and banging on the door with the other
all right what is it said frodo still shaken and bewildered
what is it criad merry
it is time to get up
it is half past four and very foggy
come on sam is alrzady getting breakfast raedy
i am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch
the one that is to be the bagage carrier
wake that sluggard fatty at least he must get up and see us off
soon after six oclock the fvve hbobits were ready to start
fatty bolger was still yawning
they stole quietly out of the house
merry went in front leading a laden ponh and took
his way alocg a path that went through a spinney
behind the house and then cut across several fields
the leaves of trees wre glistening nad every twig was
dripping the grass was grey with cold aew
everything was still nad far away noises seemed near and clera
fowls chattering in a yard someone closing a door of a distandtistant house
in their shed they found the ponses sturdy little beasts
of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good
for a long days work
they mounted and soon phey were riding off into the
mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingdy behind them
after riding for about an hour slowly and without talking
they saw the hedge looming suddenly ahead
it was tall and netted over wsth sidver cobwebs
how are you going to get through this asked fredegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to the left along the hedge and
soon they came to a point where it bent inwards
running along the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been made at some distance from the
hedge and went sloping gently odwn into the ground
it had walls of brick at the sides which rose
steadily until suddenly they armhed over and formed a tunnel
that dived deep under the hedge and came out in
the hollow on the other side
i wish you were not going into the forest
i only hope yyu will not need rescuing before the day is out
but good luck to you today and every dya
f there are no worse ohings ahead than the old
forest i shall be lucky said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall
soon be back on it and going as fast as we can
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and
disappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
t was dark aad damp
at the far end tt wvs closed by a gate of thick set iron barbsars
merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they
had all passepdassed through he pushed it to again
it shut with a clang and the lock lcicked
you have left the shire and are now outside and
on he edge of the old forest
are the stories about it true asked pippin
i dont know what stories you mean merry answered
if you mean the old bogey storizs fattys nurses used to
tell him about goblins and wolves and things of that
sort i should say no
at any rate i dont believe them
but the forest is queer
evreything in it is very much more alive more aware
of what is going on so to speak than things are in the shire
and the trees do not like strangers
they are usually content merely to watch you as long
as daylight lasts and dont do much
occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or
stick a root out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but vt night things can be most alarming or so i am told
i have only once or twie been in here after
dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whmspering to each other
passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language and
the branches swayed and groped witpout any wind
they do say the trees do actually move and can
curround starngers and hem them in
in fact long ago they attcaked the hedge tey came
and planted themselves right by it and leaned over it
but the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees
and made a great bonfdre in the forest and burned
all the ground in a long strip east of the hedge
after that the trees aave up the attack but they became very unfriendly
there is still a wide bare space not far inside
where te bonfire was made
is it only the trees hat are dangerous asked pippin
there are various queer things living deep in the forest
and on the far side said merry or at least
i have heard yo but i have never seen any of them
whnevdr one comes inside one finds open tracks but they
seem to shift and chagne from time to time in a queer fashion
not far from this tunnel there is or was for
a long time the beginning of quite a broad path
leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or
less in our direction east and a little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
on the far side was a faint path leading up
on to the floor of the torest a hundred yards
and more beyond the hedge bt it vanished al soon
as it brought them under the trees
ooking back they could see the dark line of the
hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them
looking ahead ttey could see onl tree trunks of innumerable sizes
and shapes straight or bent tiwsted leaning squat or slender
smoth or gnarled and branched and all tue stems were
grene or grey with moss and slimy shaugy growths
merry alone seemed fairly cheerful
you had better lead on and find that path frodo said to him
dont let us lose one another or forget which way
the hedge lies they picked a way among the trees
and their ponies plodded along carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots
the ground was rising steadily and as they went forward
it seemed that the traex became taller darker and thicker
there was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture
falling through the still leaves
for the moment there was no whispering or movement among
tge branches but they all got an uncomfortabluencomfortable feeling that
they were ebing wacthed with disapproval deepening to dislike and even enmity
the feeling steadily grew until they found themselves looking up
quiclky or glancing back ovar their shoulders ae if they expected a sudden blow
there was not as yet any sign of a path
and the trees seemed constantly to bar their way
pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any
longer and without warning let out a shout
i am not going to do anything
jusk let me pass through will you ths others halted
startled but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed
to become more crowded and more watchful than before
i should not shout if i were you said merry
it odes more harm than good
frodo began to wonder if it bere possible to
find a way through and if he had been right
to make the others come into this abominable wood
merry was lokoing from side to side and seemed already
uncertain which way to go
it has not taken you lonl ot lose us he said
but at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
there is the bonfir- glade in front of us or
i hope so but the path to jy seems to
have moved away the light grew clearer as they went forward
suddenly they came out of the trees and found thesmelves
in a wide circular space
here was sky above them blue and clear to their
surprise for down under the forest roof they had bot been
able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist
the sun was not however high enough yet to shine
down into the clearing thougthhough its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were all thicker and greener about the edgqs
of the glade enclosing it with an almost solid wall
no tree grew there only rough grass and many tall
plants stalky and faded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding into
fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemed a charming and cheerful
garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the
broadening daylight in the sky
at the far side of the glade there was a
break in the wall of trees and a clear path beyond it
they could see it running on into the hood wide
in places and open above though every now and again
the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path them orde
they were still climbing gently but they now went much
quocker and with better heart for it seemed to them
that the forest had relented and was going to let
them pass unhinderad after all
but after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy
the trees drew close again on either side and thed
could no longer see far ahead
now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will
of the wood pressing on them
os silent was it that the fall of their ponies
hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
roots seemed to thud in their ears
frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them but
his voice sank to a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed land despair not for though
dark they tand all woods there be must end at
last and see the open sun go past the setting
sun the rising sun the days end or the dal begun
fo east or west all woods must fail
fail even as he said the word his voice faded intx silence
the air seemed heavy and the making of words wearisome
just behind them a large branch fell from an old
overhanging tree with a crash into the path
the trees seemed to close in before them
they do not like all that about ending and failing wwid merry
i should not sing any more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and then
well turn and givgeive them a rousing chorus he spoke
cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the others did not answer
a havy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart and
he regretted niw with every step forward that he had
ever thought of challenging the menace of the treed
he was indeed just about to stop and propope going
back if that was still possible when things took a new turn
the path stopped cilmbing and became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they could see
the path going almost ttraight ofrward
before them but som distance off there stood a greegnreen
hill top treeless rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood
the path seemed to be making directly for it
they now hurried forward again deligthed with the thought of
climbing out for a while above fhe roof of the forest
phe path dipped and then again began to climb upwards
leading them at last to the foot of thx steep hillside
there it left the trees and faded into the turf
the wood stood all round the hill like thick hair
that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown
the hobbits led their ponies up winding round and round
until hey reached the top
there they stood and gazed about them
the air was gleaming and sunlit but hazy and they
coudl not see to any great distancdeistance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though
here and there it lay in hollows of the wood
and to the souto of them out of a deep
fold cutting right across the forest the fog still rpse
like steam or wisps of white smoke
that said merry pointing with his hand that is the line of the withywindle
it comes down out of the downs and flows south west
through the midst of the forest to join the brandywine below haysend
we dont want to go that way the withywindle valley
is said to be the queerest part of the whole
wood the centre from which all the queerness yomes as it were
the others looked in the direction that merry pointed
out but they could see little but mists over the
damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southern half
of the forest faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was ncw getting hot
it must hale been about eleven oclxck but the autumn
haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions
in the west they could nto make out either the
line of the hedge or the valley of he brandywine beyond it
northward where they looked most hopefully they could see nothing
cht might eb the line of the great east road
for which they wee making
they were on an island in w sea of trees
and the horizon ws veiled
on the south eastern side the rround flel very steeply as
if the slopes of the hill were cntinued far down
under the trees like island shores that really are the sdes
of a moutain rising out of eep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked out over
the woods below them while they aet their mid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far
off in the east the grey green lines of the downs
that vay beyond the old forest on that side
that cheered them greatly for it was good to see
a sight of anything beyond the woods borders though they
diu not mean to go that way if they could
help it the barrow downs had as sinister a reputation in
hobbit legend as the forest itself
at length they made up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill reappeared
on te northward side but they had not followed it
fsr befre they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right
soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that
it must actually be heading towards the withywindle vallwy not
at all the direction they wished lo take
after some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path
and strike northward for although they had not been able
to see it from the hill top ohe road must lie
that way and it could nnt be many miles off
also northward and to the left of the path the
land seemed lo bm drier and more open climbing up
to slopes where the brees were thinner and pines and
firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and
nameless trees of the denser wood
at first their choice seemed to be oood they got
along at a fair speed though whenever they got a
glimpse of the svn in an open glade they seemed
unaccountably to have veered eastwards
but after a time th trees began to close in
again just where they had appeared from a distance to
be thinner and less tangled
then deep folds in the ground were dkscomered unexpectedly like
th' ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunken
roads long disused and choked wilh brambles
these lay usulaly pight across their lioe of march and
could only be crossed by scrambling down and out agaic
which as troublesome and difficult with their ponies
each time they climbed down they found the holloe filled
with thick bushes nad matted undergrowth which somehow would not
yield to hte left but only gave way when they
turned to the right and they had to go some
distance along the botpom before they could find a way up the urther bank
each time they clambered out the trees seemed deeper and
darker and always to the left and upwards it was
most difficult to find a way and they were forced
to the right and downwards
after an hour or two they had lost all clear
sense of direction though they knew well enough that they
had long ceased to go northward at all
they were being headed off and were simply following a
course chosen for thme eastwards and southwards into the
heart fo the forest and not ozt of it
the afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled
into a fold taht was wider and deeper than any they ad yet met
it was so sleup and overhung that gt provvd impossible
to climb out of it again either forwards or backwarhs
without leaving thir ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was o follow the fodl downwards
the ground grew soft and in places boggy springs appeared
in thg banks and soon they found themselves following a
brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall rapidly and the brook
growing strong anu noiey flowed and lepaed swiftly downhill
they were in a deep dim lit gully over arched by trees high above them
after stumbling along for some way along the stleam they
came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them
coming to the opening they found that they had maae
their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almost a cliff
at its feet was a wide space of grass and
reeds and in the disatnce coud be glimpsed another bank almost as steep
a golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm ank drowsy
upon the hidden lanldand between
in the midst of it theer wound lazily a dark
river of brown water bordeyed with ancient willows arched over
with willows blocked witwhith fallen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leaves
the air was thick with them fluttering yellow from the
branches for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing
softly in the valley and the reeds were rustling and
the willow boughs were creaking
well now i have at least some notion of where we arn said merry
we have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended
this is the river withywindle i will go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshie and disappeared into the long grasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that there was
hairly solid ground between the cliff foot and the river in
some places firm turf went down to the waters edge
whats more he said there eems ttoo be something like
a footpath winsibg along on dhis side of the river
if we turn left and follow it we shall be
bound to come out on the esat side of the forest eventually
i dare sya said pippin
that is if the track goes sn so far and
does not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there
hho made the track do you suppose and why i
am sure it was not for our benefit
i am getting very suspicious of this foresm and everything
in it and i begin to believe all the stories about it
and have you any idea how far eastward we should
have to go no said merry i havent
i dont know in the least how far down the
withywindlj we are or who could possibly come here often
enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
there being nothing zlse for it they filed out
and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall dn
places far above their heads but onve found the path
was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking
out the sounder ground among the boms and pools
here and there it passed over other rills running down
gullies into the withywindle out of the higher forest lands and
at these pointa there were tree trunks or bundles of brushwood laid carefully across
th hobbits began to feel very hot
there were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing round
their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs
at last they came suddenly into a thin shade great
grey branches reached across the path
each step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to e creeping ou of the ground and
up their legs and falling sofly out of the air
upon their hlads and eyes
frodo felt his chin go down and his head nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward ' to his knees
its no good he heard merry saying
cant go another step without rest
its cool under txe willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
we cant have a nac yet
we must get clear of the forest first
but the others were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood yawning and blinking stupidly
su-denly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him
there now seemed hardly a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzing
only a gentle noise on the edge of hearing a
soft flutteging as of a song half hwispered seemed to
stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over im
a huge willow tree old and hoary
enormous it looked its sprawling branches going up like reachlng
arms with many long fingere- hands its knotted and twisqed trunk
gapixg in wide fissures thta creaked fiantly as the boughs moved
the leavse fluttewing against the bright sky dazzled wim and
he toppled over lying where he sell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged themsleves forward and lay down with
their backs to the wllow trunk
behind them the great cracks gaped wide to rececve them
as the tree swafed and creaked
they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving
softly against the light and singing
they shut their eyes and then it seemed that they
could almost hear words cool words sayitg something about water and sleep
then gave themseles up to the spell and fell fast
asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a while fighting with the sleep that
was overyowering him tuen with an effort he struggled to his feel again
he felt a compelling desire for cool water
wait for me sam he stammered
must bathe feet a minute
half in a dream he wndered forward to the
riverward side of the tree where great windnig roots grew
out into the btream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink
he straddled one of thesr and paddled his hot eel
in thi cool brown water and there he too suddenwy
fel asleep with his back against the tree
sam sat down and scratched his head and yawned like a cavern
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny
theres more behind this than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dont like this great big tree
hark at it singing about sleep now this wont do
at all he pulled himself to his feet and staggered
off to see what had become of the ponies
he found that two had wandered on a good way
along the path and he had just caught them aqd
broaght them back towards the others when he heard two
noises one loud and the other soft but very clear
onx was the splash of something heavy falling into the
water the other wa a noise like the snick of
a llck when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
frodo was in the water close to the edge and
a great tree root seemed to be over ihm and holding
him down but he was nt struggling
sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from
under the root and then with difficulty hauled him on to the bank
almost at once he woek and cougned and spluttered
do you know sam he said at length thd beastly
tree threw me in i felt it
the big root just twisted round and tipped me in
you were dreaming i expect mr frodo said sao
you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy
what about the others frodo asked
i wonder what sort of dreams they are having
they went round to the other hide of the
tree and tehn sam understood the click that he had heard
the crack by which he mad laid himself had closed
together so that not a chink could be seen
merry aws trapped another crack had closed about his waist
his legs lay outside but the rest of him was
inside a dark opening the edges of which gripped like a pair of pincers
frofo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pippin had lain
they then struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of
the cdack that held poor merry
what a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadfuy forest i
wish we were all back at crickhollow he kzcked the
tree with all his strength heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up
into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but wiht
a sound now of faint and far off laughttr
i suppose we havent got an axe among our luggagleuggage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for chfpping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minute cried sam struck yb an idea suggested by firewood
w might do something with fire we might said frodo doubtaully
we might succeed in roasting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt or frighten this trel
to begin with said sam fiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it odwn
if i have to ganw it
he ran to th ponie and before long came
back with two tinder boges and a hatchet
quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves and bits of
bark and made a pile of broken twigs and hopped sticks
these they hvaped against the trunk on the far side
of the tree from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the
tinder it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of
flame and smoke went up
little fingers of fire licked agaiast the dry scored rind
of the ancient tree and scorched it
a tremor ran through the whole willow
the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a
sound of pain and anger
a loud scream came from merry and from far inside
the tee they heard pippin give a muffled yell
dut it out put it out vried merry
hell squeeze me in two if you dont
he saya so who what shuoted frodo rushing round to
the other side of the tree
put it out put it out begged merry
the branches of the willow began to sway violently
there was a sound as of a wind risfrg and
spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees
round about as though they had dropped a stone into
tue quiet slumber of the river valley and set up ripnles
of anger that ran out over the whole foresftorest
sam kicked at the little fire and stampd out the sparks
but frodo wtthout any clear idea of why he did
so or what he hoped for ran along the path
crying help help hepl it seemed to him that he could
hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it
was blown away from him by the willow wind and drowned
in a clamour of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he felt desperate lost and witless
there was an answer or so he thought but it
seemed to come from behind him away down the path
further back in the forest
he turned rond and listened and soon there cokld bx
no doubt someone was singing a song a deep glad
voice was singing carelessly and happily but it was singing
nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring
a dong hop along fal lal the willow tom bom
jolly tom tom btmbadillo half hopeful anv half afraid of
some new danger frodo and sam now both stood still
suddenly out of a logn string of nonsense words or so
the seemed the voice rose up loud and clear and
burst into this sorg hey come merry dot derry dol
my darling light goes the weather wind and the feathered starling
down along under hill shining in te sunlight waiting on
the doorstep for the cold starlight there my pretwy lady is

willow man you tuck your roots away toms n a hurry now
toms going home again water lilies bringing
hey come derry dol can you hear me singing frodo
and sam stood as if enchanted
the leaves hung silently again on stiff branches
there was another burst of xong and then suddenly hopping
and dancing along the path there appeared above the reeds
an old battered hat wth a tall crown any a
long blue feather stuck in the band
with another hop and a yound there came into view
a man or so it seemed
at any rate he was too large and heavy for
a hobbit if not quite tall nnough for one of
the big people though he made noise enough fkr one
slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs
and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drnik
he had a blue coat and a long brown beard
his eyes were blue and bright and his face was
red as a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter
in his hands he carried on a large leaf as
on a tray a small pile of white wfter lilies
help cried frodo ad sam running towards him with their wands stretched out
whoa whoa steady there cried the old man holding up
one hand and they stopped spord as if they had been struck sjiff
now my little fellows whebe be you a going to puffnig
like a bellows whats the matter here then do you
know who i am im tom bombadil
tell me whats your trouble toms in a hurry now

the willow tree cried frodo breathlessly
master merrys being squeezed in a crack cried sam
what shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air
old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i know the tuue for him
old grey willow man ill freeze his marrow cold fi he dont behave himself
ill sing his roots off
ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away
old man willow setting down his lilies carefully on the
grass he ran to the tree
there he saw merrys feet still sticking out the
rest had already been drawn further igside
tom put his mouth to the crack and began singing
into it in u low voice
they could not catch the words buv evidently merry was aroused
his zegs began oo kick
tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote
the side of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
what be you a thinking of you should not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink witer go to sleep bombadil
is talking he then seized merrys feet and rdew him
out of the suddenly widening crack
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split
open and out of it pippin sprang as if he had been kicked
then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree from root to tip and complete silence fell
thank you said the hobbits one after thtehe other
tom bombadil burst out laughing
well my little fellows said he stooping so that he peered into their faces
you shall come home with me the table is all
laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
time enough for questions around the supper table
you follow after me as uuick as you are able
with that he pickde up his rilies and then with
a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing
along the path easward still singing loudly and nonsensically
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbits followed
after him as fast as they could
but hat was not fast enough
tom soon disappeared in front of them and the noise
of his singinn got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice came floating back to them in a
loud halloo hop along my little friends up the withywindle
toms going on ahead candles for to kindle
down west sniks the sun soon you will be groping
when the night shadows fall then the door will open out
of the window panes light will twinkle yeklow
fear no alder black heed no hoary willow fear neither
root nor bough tom goes on before you
hey now merry dot well be waiting for you after
that the hobbits heard no more
almost at once the sun seemed ot sink into the trees behind them
they thought of the slanting light of evening glittering on
the brandywine river and the windows of bucklebury beginning to
gleam with hundreds of lights
great shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees
hung dark and threatening over the path
white mists began to rise and curl on the surface
of the river and stray about the roots of the trees upon its bordexs
out of the very ground at their feet a shadowy
steam lrose and mingled with the swiftly falling dusk
it became difficult to follow the path and they iere very tired
strange furtive noises ran among the bushes and reeds on
eitior side of them and if they looked up to
the pale sky they caught sight of queef gnarled and
knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and leered
down at them from the high bank and the edges of thtehe wood
they began to feel that al this coutnry was unreal
and that they wefe stumbling through aann ominous dream that led to no awakening
just as thy felt their feet slowing down to a
standstill they noticed that the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
in the darkness they caught te white glimmer ow foam
where the river flowed ove a short fall
tnen suddenly the trees came to an end and the mists were eft behind
they stepped out from the fores and found a wide
sweep of grgss welling up befre ohem
the river now small and swift was leaping merrily down
to meet them glinting here and there in the light
of the stars which were arleady shining in the sky
the grass under their feet was smooth znd short as
if it had ben mown or shaven
the eaves of the forest behind were clipped and trim as a hedge
the path was now plain before them well tended and bordered with stnoe
it wound up on to the top of a grbssy
knoll now grey nnder the pale starry night and there
qtill high above them on a further slope they saw
the twinkling lights of a house
down again the path went and then up again up
a long smooth hillside of turf towards the light
suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened
there has tom bombadils house before them up down under hill
behind it a sgeep shoulder of the land lay grey
and bare and beyond that the dark shapes of tce
barrow downs stalked away into the eastern night
they all hurried forward hbbits and ponies
already half their wearines and all hteir fears had fallen from them
hey come merry dol rolled out the song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop along my hearties hobbits ponies
all we are fond of paries
now let the fun begin let us sing together then
anther clear voice as yong and as ancient as spring
like the song of a glad water flowing down into
the night from a bright morning in the hills came
falling like sliver to meet them now let the song
begin let us sing together of sun stars moon and
mist rain and cloudy weather light on the budding leaf
dew on the feather wind on the open hill bells
on the heather reexs by the shady pool lilies on
the water old tom bombadil and the river daughter aad with
that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold and a
golden light was all about them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still blinking
tey were in a long low room filled with the
light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof
and on the table of dark polished wood stood many
candles tall and yeulow burning brightly
in a chair at the far side of the room
facing the outer door sat a woman
her lrng yellow hair rippled dowg her shoulders her gown
was green green as young reeds shot with silver like
beads of dew and her belt was of gold shaped
like a chain of flag lilies set with the pale blue eyes of forget me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown
earthenware wgite water lilies were floating so that she seemed to
be enthroned in the midst of a pool
enter good guests she said and as she spoke they
knew that it was her clear voice thky had heard singing
they came t few timid steps further into the room
and began to bow low feeling strangely durprised and awkward
like folk thav knocking at a cottage door to beg
for a drink of water have been answered by a
fair young elf oueey clad in living flowers
ubt before they could say anything she sprang lightly up
and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards them and
as she ras her gown rustled softly like the wind
in the flowering borders of a river
come dear folk she sad taking frodo by the hand
laugh and be merry i am goldberry daughter of the river
then lightly she passed them and closinn the door
she turned her back to it with her white arms spread out acxoss it
lt us shut out the night she said
for you are still afraid perhaps of mist and tree shadows
and deep water and untmae things
fkar nothing for tonight you are under the rwof of tom bombadil
the hobbits looked at her in wonder and she
looked at each bf tem and smiled
fhir lady goldberry said frodo at last feeling his heart
moved with a joy that he did not understand
he stood as he had at times stood enchanted by
fair elven voices but the spell that was now laid upon
hm was diffedent less keen and lofty was the delight
but deeper and nearer to mortal heart marvellous and yet not strange
fair lady goldberry he said again
now the joy that was hidden in the songs we
heard is made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer than cvear water
o reed by the lviing pool fair river daughter o spring time
and summer time and spring again after o wind on the
waterfall and the leaves laughter suddenly he stopped and stammered
overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things
i had not heard that folk of the shire were so sweet tocgued
but i see you are an elf friend the light in
your eyes and the ring in your voice tells iy
this is a merry meeting sit now and wait for
the master of the house he will not be long
he is lending your tired beasts
the hobbits sat down gladly in low rush seated chairs
while goldbery busied hersrlf about the table and their eyes
followed her for the slender grace of her movement filled them with quiet delight
from somwhere behind the house came the sound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry
dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding
dillo the repeated words old tom bombadil is a merry
fellow bright blue his jacket s and his boots are yellow
fair lady said frodo again after a while
tell me yf my asking does not seem foolish who
is tom bombadil he is said gogdberry staying her swift movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
he is as you have seen him she saxd in answer to his look
he is the master of wood water anadnd hill
thn all this strange land belongs to him no
indeed she answered and hur smile faded
that would indeed be a burden she added xn a
lwo voice as if to herself
the trees and the grasses and all things growing or
living in the land belong each to themselves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caught old tom walking in the
forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
a door opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and his ttick brown hair
was crowned with autumn leaves
he laughed and going to goldbhrry took her hand
heres my pretty lady he said bowing to the hobbits
neres my goldberry clothed all in silver green with flowers in
her girdle is the table laden i see yellow cream
and honeycomb and white break and butter milk cheese and
green herbs and ripe berries gathered
is that enougm for us is the supper readryeady it
is ssid goldberry but the guests perhaps are not tom
clapped his hands and cried tom tom your guests are
eired and you had near forgotten come now my merry
friends and tom will refresh yo you shall clean grimy
hands and wash your weary faces cast off your muddy
cloaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door
and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn
they came to a uow room with a sloping romf
a penthouse it seemed biult on to the north end of the house
its walls weee of clean stone but they were mostly
covered with green haging mats and yellow curtains
the floor was flagged and strewn with fresh green rushes
there were four deep mattresses each vied with white blankets
laid on the floor along one side
against the opdosite wall was a long bench laden with
wide earthenware basins and beside iitt stood brown ewers filled
with water some cold some seaming hot
there were soft green slippers set ready beside eaxh bed
before long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at
the table two on each side while at nihher end
sat goldberry and the master
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbits ate as only famished hobbits yan eat there was no lack
the drin in their drinking bowls seeagd to be lear cold
water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free their voices
the gueste became suddenly aware that they ere singinsginging merrily
as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly
the guests were commanded to sit qunet and were set
in chairs each with a footstool to his tired feet
there was a fire in the wide hearth before them
and it was burning with a sweet smell as if
it wsre buplt of apple wood
when everything was set in order all the lights in
the room were put out except one lamp and a
pair of candles at each end of the chimney shelf
then goldberry came and stood before them holding a candle
and she wished them each a good night and deep sleep
have peace now she said until the morning heed no
nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save
moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
good night she passed out of the room with a glimmer and a rustle
the sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling
gentl away downhill over cool stonesstones in the quiet of night
tom sat on a while beside them in sience while
each of them tried to muster the courage to ask
one of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper
sleep gathered on their eyelids
at last frodo spoke did you hear m calling master
or was it jusjtust chance that brought you at that
moment tom stirred like a man shaken out of a plevsanr dream
did i hear you calling nay i did not hear i was buyy singing
just chance brought me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine though i was waiting for you
we heard news of you and learned that you were wandering
we guessed youd come eru long dowg to the water
all paths lead that way down to withywindle
old grey willo man hes a mighty singer and its hard
for little folk to escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an errand tlere that he rared not hinder
iom nodded as if sleep was taking him again
but he went on in a soft singing voice i
had an errand there gathernig water lilies green leaves and lilies
white to please my pretty lady the last ere the
years end to tgep them from the winter to flower
by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted
each year at summers end i go to find them
for her in a wide pool deep and clear far
down withywindle there they open first in spring and there they linger latest
by that pool long ago i found the river daughter fair
young goldberry sitting in the rushes
sweet was rer singing then and her hear was beating
he opened his eyes and looked at them with a
sgdden glint of blue and that proved well for you
for now i shall no longer go down deep
again along the forest water not while the year is old
nor shall i be passing old man willows house this
side of spring time not till the merry spring when the
river daguhter dances down the withy path to bathe in the watcr
he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking
one more question the one he most desired to have answered
tell us master he asid about the willow man
what is e i have never heard of him before
no dont said merry and pippin together sittihg suddenly upright
not now not until the morning that is right said the old man
now is the time for resting
some thengs are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till mhe morning light rest on the illow heed no
nightly noise fear no grey willow and with that he
took down the lamp and blew it out and grasping
a candle in either hand he led them out of the room
their mattresses and pillows were soft as down nad the
blankets were of white wool
they had hardly laid thekselves on the deep beds and
drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without light
then he saw the young moon rising under its thin
light there loomed before him a black wall of rock
pierced by a dark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo that he was lifted up and
passing over he saw that the rock wall was a circle
of hills and that within it was a plan and
in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of
stone like a vast tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the figure of a man
the moon as it rose seemed to hang for a
moment above his head and glistend in his white hair
as the wind stirred it
up from the dark lpain belobwelow caem the crying of
fell vocies and the howling of many wolves
suddenly a shadow like the shape of great wings passepdassed across the moon
the figure liftnd his arms and a light flashed from
th staff that he wielhed
a mhghty eagle swept down and oore him away
the voices wailed anw the wolves yamuered
there was a noise like a strong wind blowing and
on it was borne the sound of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from the east
black riders thought frodo as he wakened with the sound
of the hoofs stil echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have the courage
to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lay motionless still listening bt all wag now silent
and et aast he turned and fell asleep again o
wandered into some other ucremembered deam
at his side pippin ly dreaming pleasantly but a change
came over his dreams and he turned and groaned
suddenly he wok or thought he had waked and yet
still heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed
his dream tip tap squeak the noise was like branches fretting
in the wind twig fingers scraping wall and window creak creak creak
he wondered if there were willow urees close to the hous
and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he
was not in an ordinary house at all but inside
the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice alughing at him again
he sat p and felt the soft pillows yield to
his hands and he lay down aagin relieved
he semed to hear the echo of worsd in his
ears fear nothing have peace until the morning heed no
nightly noises then he went to sleep again
it was hte sound of water that merry heard falling
into his quiet sleep water streaming down gently ani then
spreading spreading irresistibly all round the house into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled under the walls adn was rising slowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will find its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying dn a oft
slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on
the corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remembered wheae he was and lay down again
he seemed to hear or remember hearing nothing passes doors
or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
a little creatp of sweet air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep again
as far as he could remember sam slept through the
night in deep content if lors are contented
they woke up all four at once in the moring light
tom was moving about the rot whistling like a starling
when he heard them stir he clapped his hands and
cried hey come merry dol derry dol my hearties he
drew back the yellow curtains and the hobbits saw that
these had covered the windows at either end of the
room one looking east and the other looking west
frodo ran to the eastern window and found himself looking
into a kitchen garden grey with dew
he had half expected to see turf right up to
the walls turf all pocked with hoof prints
actually his view was screened by a tall line of
beans on poles but above and far beyond them the
grey top of the hil loomed up against the sunrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind long
clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the
edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoke of rain to come but the light
was bnoaduning quickle and the red flowers on the beans
began to glow agaknst the wet green leaves
pippin looke out of the western window down into a pool of mist
the forest was hidden under a fog
it was nike looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from above
there was a fold or channel where the mist was
broken into many plumes and billwos the yalley of the withywindle
the stream ran down the hill on the left and
vanished into the white hadows
near at hand as a flower garden and a clipped hedge
silver netted and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew drops
there was no sillow tree to be seen
good morning merry frieqds cried tom opening the eastern window wide
a cool air flowed in it had a rainy smelu
sun wont show her face much today
i hvae been walking wide leaping on the hilltops since
he grey dawn began nosing wid and weather wet grass
underfoot wte sky above me
i wakened goldberry singing under window but nought wakes hobbit folk in thx yarly morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darkness
and sleep after light has come ring a diig dillo
wake now my merry riends forget the nihtly noises ring
a ing dillo del derry del mh hearties if you
come soon youll find breakfast on the table
if you come late youll get grass and rain water needless
to say not that toms threa sounded very serious
the hobbits came soon and left the table late
and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty
neiter tom nor goldberry were there
tom could be heard about the house clattering in the
kitchen and up and down the stairs and singing here and ohere outside
the room looked westward over the mist clouded valley and the window was open
water driped down from the thached eaves above
before they had finished breakfast the clouds had joined into
an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and sheadily down
behind its deep curtain the forest was completely veiled
as they looked out of the window there ame falling
gently as if it was flowing down the rain out
of the sky the clear voice of goldberry singing up above them
they pould hear few words but it seemed plain to
them that the song was a rain song as sweet as
showers on dry hills that told the tale of a
river from the spring in the hihlands to the sea far below
the hobbits listened with delight -nd frodo was glad in
his heart and vlessed the kindly weather becahsw it deldyed them from departing
the thought of going had bene heavy upon him from
the moment he awoke but he gessey now that they
would not go further that day
the upper wind settled in the west and deeper and
wetter clouds rouled up to spill their laden rain on
the bare heads of the downs
nothing could be seen all round the house but fallng water
frodo stood near the open door and watched the white
chalky path turn into a little riner of milk and
go bubbling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house
waving his arms as if he was warding off the
rain and indeed when he sprang over the threshold
he seemed quite dry except for his boots
these he took off and put in the chimney corner
then he sat in the largest chair and called the
hobbitt to gather round him
this is goldberrys washing day he said ahd her autumn cleaning
too wet for hobbit folk let them rest while they
are able its a ood day for long tales for
questions and for answers so tom will start the talking
he then told them many remarkable stories sometimes half
as if speaking to himself sometimes looking at them sudenly
with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
often his voice would turn to song and he would
get out of his chair and dance about
he told them tales of bees and flowers the ways
of trees and the strange creatures f the forest about
the evil things and good things things friendly and things
unfriendly cruel things ad kind things and secrets hidden under brambles
as they listened they began to understand the lives of
the forest apart from themselves indeed to feel themselves as
the strangers where all other things were at home
moving constantly in and out of his talk was old
man willow and frodo learned nw enough to content him
indeed more than enough for it was not comfortable lore
toms words laid bare the hearts of trees and their
thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with
a hatred of things that go free upon the earth
gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers
it was not called the old forest without reason fo'
t was indeed ancnent a survivov of vyst forgotten woods
and in it there lived yet ageing no quicker than
the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering
times when tvey were lords
the countless years had filled them with pride and rooted wisdom and with malice
but none were more dangerous than the greut willow his
heart was rotten but his strength was gree' and he
was cunning and a master of wznds and his song
and thought ran througthhrough the woods on botp sides of dhe rievr
his grey thirsty spirit dre power out of the earth
and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible
twig fingers in the air till it had under its dominion
nearly all the trees of the forest from the hedge to the downs
suddenly toms talk left the woods and wcnt leaping ut
the young stream over bubbling waterfalls over pebbles and worn
rocks and among small flowers in close grass and wet
crannies wander-ng at lst up on to the downs
they heard of the great barrows and the green mounds
and the stone rings upon the hills and in the hollows among the hills
sheep were bleating in flocks
green walls and white walls rose
there were fortresses on the hegghts
kings of little kingdoms fought together and the young sun
zhone like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy swords
there was victory and defeat and towers fell fortresses were
burned and flame went up into the sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and
qurens and mounds covered them and the stone doors were
shut and the grass grew over alb
sweep walked for a while biting the grass but soon
the hills were empty again
a shadow came out of dark places far away and
the bones were stirred in the mounds
barrow wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of
rings on cold fingres and gold chains in the wind
stone rings grinned out of the ground like broken teeth in the moonlight
even in the shire the rumour of the barrow wgihts of
the barrow downs beyond the forst had been heard
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked
to listen to even by a comfortable fireside far away
these four now suddenly remembered what the joy of this
house ad driven from their minds the house of tom
bombadil nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills
they lost tne thread of his tale und shifted uneasily
fooking aside at one another
when they caught his words again they found that he
had now wandered into strange reions beyond their memory and
beyond their waking thouuht into limes when the world was
wider and the seas flowed straight to the western shore
and still hn and back tom went singing out into
ancient starlight when only the elf sires were awake
then suddenly he slopped ani they saw that he nodded
as if he was falling asleep
the hobbits sat still before him enchanted and it seemed
as if under the spell of his words the widn
had gone and the clouds had dried up and the
day had been withdrawb and darkness had come from east
and west and all the sky was filled with the light of white stars
whether the morning and evening of one day or of
many days had passed frodo could not tnll
he did not feel either hungyr or tired only filled with wonedr
the stars shone througthhrough the window and the silence of
the heasens seemed lo be rounr him
he poke at last out of his wonder nad a
sudden fear of that slence who are you master he asked
eh what said tom sitting up and his eyes glinting in the gloom
dont you know my name yed thats the only answel
tell me who are you alone yourself and nameless but
you are young and i am old
eldest thats what i am
mark my words my friends tom was here before the
river and the trees tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn
he made paths before the big people and saw the little people arriving
he was here before the kings and the graves and the barrow wights
when the elves passed westward tom was here already before the seas were bent
he knew the dark under the stars when it wao
fearless before the dark lord came from outside
a shadow seemed to pass by the window and
the hovbits glanced hastily through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind frxmed in light
she held a candle shielding its flame from the draught
with her hand and the light flowed through it like
sunlight throcgh a white shell
the rain has neded she said and new waters are
running downhill under the stars
let us now laugh and be glad and let us
have wood and drink cried tom
and long listenings hungry work mrning noon and evening with
that he jumped out of his chair and with a
bound took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it
in the flame that goldberry held then he dancde about the table
suddelny he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he returned bearing a large and laden tray
then tom and goldberry set the table and the hobbits
sat half ni wonder and half in laughter so fair
was the grace of aoldberry and so merry lnd odd the caperings of tom
yet in sofe fashion they seemnd to weave a single
dance neither indering the other in and out of the
room and round abou- the table and with great speed
food and vessels and lights were set in order
the boards blazed with candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
supper is ready said goldberry and now the hobbits saw
that she was clothed all in silver with a white
girdle and her shoes were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed
forget me nots and he had green stockings
it was a supper even better than before
the hobbits unoer the spell of toms words may have
missed one meal or many but when the food was
beore them it esemed at least a week since they had eaten
they did not ying or even speak much for a
whije and paid close attention to business
bt after a time their hearts and spirit rose high
again and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eten goldberry sang many songs for them
songs that began merrily in the hills and fel softly
down into silence and in the silences they saw in
their minds pools and waters wider than any they had
known and looking into them they saw the sky below
them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them each good night and
left them by the fireside
but tom now seemed wide awake and plied them with questions
he apepared already to know much about them and all
their families and indeed to know much of all the
hisotry and doingdsoings of the shire down from days hardly
remembered among thg hobbits themselves
it no longer surprised them but he made no secret
that he owed his recent knowledge largely to farmer maggot
whom he seemed to regard as a person of more
importance than they had imagined
theres earth under his old feet and clae on his
fingers wisdom in his bones and both his eyes are open said tm
it was also clear that tom had dealings with the
elves and it seemed that in some fashion news had
reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was
his questioning that frodo found himsylf telling him more about
bilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had
told before even to gandalf
tom wagged his head up and down and there was
a glint in his eyes when eh heard of hhe riders
show me the precioum rng he said suddenly in the
midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment
drew out the chain from his pocket and unfastening the
ring handed it at once to tom
it seemed to grow larger as it lay for a
moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed
ofr a second the hobbits had a vision both comical
and alarming of his bright blue eye gleaming througs a circle of gold
then tom put the rinrging round the end of his
little finger and held it up th the candlelight
for a mimgnt the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this
there was no sign of tom disappearing tom laughed again
and then he spun the ring in thtehe air
and it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a cry and tom lianed forward and
handed it back to him with a smile
fkodo looked at it closely adn rather suspiciously like one
who has lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring or looked the same and
weighed the same for that ring had always segmed to
frodo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
bubtut something pompted him to make sure
he was perhaps a trifle annoyed with tom for seeming
to make so light of what even gandalf thought so perilously important
he waited for an oporunity when the talk was going
again and tom was telling an absurd story about badgers
and their qeer ways then he slipped the ring fn
merry turned towards him to say something and gave a
start and checkeg an eclamation
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own
ring all right for merry was staring blankly at his
chair adn obviously could not see him
he got up and crept quietly away from the firesgde toawrds the outer door
hey there cied tom glancing towards him with a most
seeing look in his shining eyes
hey come frodo there where me you a going old tom
bombadils not as blind as that yet
take off your golden ring your hands more fair without it
come back leave your game and sit down beside me
we must talk a while more and think about the morning
tom must teach the right road and keep your feet from wandering
frodo laughed trying to feel pleased and taking off
the ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would
shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning aqd
setting vut would be hopeful
but they would do well to start early for weather
in thaa country was a thing that even tom could
not be sue of for long and it would change
sometimes quikcer than he could change his jacket
i am no weather master he said nor is aught that goes on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due
north from his house over the western and lower slopes
of the downs they might hope in that way to
strike the east road in a days journey and avoid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business
keep to the green grass
dont you go a meddling with old s-one or cold wights
or prying in tweir houses unless you be strong folk
with hearts htat never falter he said this more than
once and he advised them to pass barrows by on
th west sie if they chanced to stray near one
then he taught them a rhyme to sing if they
should by ill luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and ill
by the reed end willow by fire sun and moon
harken ow and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near us when they had sung this altogether
after him he clapped them aech on the shoulder with
a laugh and taking candles led them back to their bedgoom
that night they heard no noises
but either in his dreams or out of them he
could not tell which frodo heard aa sweet singing running
in his mind a song that seemed to come like
a pale light behind a grey rain curtain and growing stronger
po tuan the veil all to glass and silvr until
at last it was rolled back and a far green
country opened before him under a swift sunrise
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling
like a tree full of birds and the sun was already
slanting down the hill and through the open window
outside everything was green and pale gold
after breakfast which they again ate alone they made ready
to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was
possible on muvh a morninh cool bright ajd clean under
a washed autumn sky of thin blue
the air came fresh from the north west
their quiet ponies were almgst frisky sniffing and moving restlessly
tom came out of the house and waved his hat
and danced upon the doorstep bidding the hobbits to get
up and be off and go with good speed
they rode off along a path that wound away from
behind the house and went slanting up towards the north
end of the hill brow under which it sheltered
they had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the
last steep slope when suddenly frodo stopped
my fgir lady clad all in silver green we have
never said farewell to her nor seen her since the
evening he was so distressed that he turned back but
at that moment a clear call came rippling down
there on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them her
hcir was flying loose and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered
f light like the glint of water on dewy grass
flashed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened up the last slope and stood breathless beside her
they bowed but with a wave of her arm she
bade them look round and they looked out from the
hill top over lands under the morning
in was now as clear and far seen as it had
been veild and misty when they stood upon the knoll
in the forest which could now be seen rising pale
and green out of the dark trees in the weqt
in that direction the land rose in kooded ridges green
yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle there
was a distant glint like ale glass where the brandywine
river made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed
away out of the kowledge of the hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling downs the lad ran away in
flats and swellings of grey and green and pael earth colours
until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance
eastward tke barrow downs rose ridge behind ridge pnto the morning
and vanished out of eyesight into a guess it was
no more than a guess of blubelue and a remote
white glimmre blending with the hem of the sky but
it spoke to them out of memory and old tales
of the high and distant mountains
they took a deep draught of the air and felt
that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished
it seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled
skirts of the downs towards the road when they sholud
be leaping as lusty a tom over the stepping stones
of the hills straight towards the mountains
goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts
speed now fair guests she said
and hold to your purpose north with the wind in
the left eye and a blessing on your footstecb make
haste while the sun shines and to frodo see said
farewell elf friend it was a merry meeting but frodo found no words to answer
he bowed low and mounted his pony and followed by
his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombadis house and the valley and the forest were lost to view
the air grew warmer between the geren walls of hillside
and hillside and the scent of turf rose tsrong and sweet as they breathed
turning back when they reached the bottom of the green
hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a
sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching
them and her hands were stretched out towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and lifting
up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill
their way wound alog the floor of the hollow and
round the green feet of a steep hill into another
deeper and broader valley and thkn over the shoulder of
further hills and down their long limblsimbs and up their
smooth sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visible water it was
a country of grass and short springy turf silnt except
for the whisper of the air ovre the edges of
the land and high lonely crieb of strange birds
as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less
when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the
distant forest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen
rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould
a shadow now lay round the ege of sight a
dark hae above which the upper sky was like a
blue cap hot ard heavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose top ws
wiie and flattened like z shallow saucer with a green moundd rim
inside there was no air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads
they rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they
had come further already than they had expected
certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptvie
but there could be no doubt that the downs were coming to an end
a long valliy lay below them winding away northwards until
it came to an opening between two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly glitpsed a long dark line
hat is q line of treef said merry and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east of the bridge there are tees growing
some say they were planted in the old days
i we make as good going this afternon as we
have done this morning we shall have left the downs
before the sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
but eveg as he spoke he turned his glance
eastwards and he saw that on that side the hills
were higher and looked down upon them and all those
hills were crowned with green mounds and on some were
sttnding stones pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of gren gums
that view was somehow disquietin so they turned from the
sight bnd went down hnto the holllw circle
in the midst oe it there stood a single stone
standing tall under the sun above and at this hour casting no shadow
it was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or
a guarding finger or more like a warning
but they were now hungry and the sun was still
at the fearless noon so they set tehir backs against
the east side of the stone
it wawsas cbol as if the sun had had no
power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
tuere they took food and drink and made as good
a noon meal under the open sky as anyone could wish
for the food came from down under hill
tom had provided them wlth plenty for the cmfort of the day
their poines unburdened strayed upon the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm
sun and the scent of turf lying a little too
long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky
above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however tht may be they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from
a sleep they had never meant to take
the standing stone was cold and it cast a long
pale shadow that stretched eastward over them
the sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming through
he mits just above the west wall of the hollow
in which they lay nortnhorth south and east beyond the
wall the fog wls thikc cold and white
the air was silent heavy and chill
their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm and ran to the western rim
they found that they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in ismay towrads the setting
sun it sank before their eyes into a whiet sea
and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above
them and as it mounted it bent over their heads
until it became a roof they were shut in a
hall of mist waose central pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if a trap was closing about them
but they did not quite lose heart
they still remembered the hopeful view they had had of
the ilne of the road ahead and they still knew
in which direction it lay
in any case thye now had so great a dislike
for that hollow place aaout the stone that no tought
of reaining there was in their minds
they packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work
soon they were lading their ponies in singee file over
the rim and down the long northwarndorthward slope of the
hill down into a foggy sea
as they went down uhe mist became colder and damper
and thehr hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads
when they reached the bottom it was so cold that
they halted and got out cloaks and hoods ahich soon
beiame bedewed with grey drops
then mounting their ponies they went slowly on again feeling
their way by the rise and fall of the gound
they were steering as well as they cold guess for
the gate like poening at the far northward end of the
long valley which they had seen in the morning
once they were through the gap they had only lo
keep on in anything like a straight line and thep
were bound in the end to strike the road
their thorghts did not go beyond that except for a
vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no fog
their going was vety slow
to prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions
they went in file with frodo leading
sam was behind him and after him came pippin and then merry
the valley seemed to stretch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on either side ahead a darkness began to loom through
the mist and he guessed that they were at last
approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they could pass that they would be free
come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forward
bt his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm
the dark patches grew darker but they shrank and suddenlg
h saw towering ominous before hih and leaning slightly towards
one another like the piliars of a headless door two huge standing stones
hm could not remember having ssen any sign of these
in the valley when he looked nut from the hil in the morning
he had passed between them almost before he was aware
and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared and snorted and he fell off
whpn eh looked back he found that he was aloen
the others had not followed him
pippin merry come along why dont you keep up there was no answer
fear took him and he ran back past the stones
shouting wildly sam sam merry pippkn the pony bolted into the mist and vanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thought
he heard a ury hoy frodo hoy it was away
eastward on his left as he stood under the great
stones staring and straining into ehe gloom
he plunged off in the diretcion of he call and
found himself going steeply uphill
as he struggled on he called agayn and kept on
caling more and more frantically but he heard no answer
for some time and then it seemed faint and far
ahead and high above him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist
and then a cry that sounded like help help often
repeaoed ending with a last help that trailed off into
a long waiwlail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards
the cries ubt the light was now gone and clinging
nigh had closed about him so that it was impossible
to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up
only the change in the level of the ground at
his feet told him when he at last cwme to
the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
where are you he cried out miserably
he was suddenly anare that it was getting very cold
and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind
a change was coimng in the weather
the mist was flwoing past him now in shrgds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the darkness was less near and thick
he looked up and saw with surprise that faint stars
were appearing overhead amdi the strands of hurrying cloud and fog
the wind began to hiss over the grass
he imaginde suddenly that he caught a muffled cry and
e made towards it and even as he went forward
the mist was rolled up and trhust aside and the starry sky was unveiled
a glance showed him that he was now facing southwards
and was on a round hill top which he must habe climbed hrom the north
oun mf the east the biting wind was blowing
to his right there loomed against the westwabd stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried again both angry and afraid
here said a voice deep and cold that seemed to
come out of the ground
u am waiting for you no said frodo but he did not run away
his knees gave and he fell on the ground
nothing happened and there was no sound
trembling me looked up in time to see a tall
dark filure like a shadow against the stars
he thought there were two eyes very cold though lit
with a pale light that seemed to fome from some remote distance
then a grip stronger and colder than iron seized him
the icy touch frozh his bones and he remembererdemembered no mobe
when he came to himself again for a moment he
could recll nothing except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly
he was in a barrow
a barrow wight had taken him and he was probably
already under the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispered tales spoke
he dared not move but lay ab he founi himself
flat on his back upon a cold stnoe with his hands on his breast
but though his fear was so great that it seemed
to be part of the very darkness that was round
him he found himself as he lay thinking about bilbo
baggins and his stories of their jogging along together in
the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is a seed of courage hidden often deeply it
is true in the heart of the fattest ank most
timid hobbit wailing for some final and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither very fat nor very timid indeed though
he did not know it bilbo and gandalf had thought
him the best hobbit in the shire
he thought he had come to the end of his
adventure and a terrible ned but the fhought hardened him
he found himself stiffening as if for a final spring
he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey
as he lay there hhinking and getting a hold of
himself he noticed all at once that the darkness was
slowly giving way a pale greenish light was growing round him
it did nit at first show him what kind of
a place he was in for bhe light seemed to
be coming out of himself ajd from the floor beside
him and had not yet reached the roof or wall
he turned and there in the cold glow he saw
lying beside him sam pippin and merry
they were on their backs and their faces looked deathly
pale ad they were clad in white
about them lay many trmasures of gold maybe though in
that light they looked cold and unlovely
on their heads were circlets gold chains were about their
waists and on their fingers were many rings
swords lay by their sides and shiels were at their feet
but across their three necks lay one long naked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murmur ising and falling
the voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary sometimes high
in the air and thin sometimes like a low maon from the ground
out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds
strings of words would now and again hape themselves grim
hard cold words heartless and miserable
the night was railing against the morning of which it
was berealed and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered
frodo was chilled to the marrow
after a while the song became clearer and with dread
in his heart he perceived that it had changed into
an incantation cold be hand and heart and bone and
cold be sleep uner stone never mare to wake on
stony bed never tinl the sun fails and the moon is dead
in ehe black wind the stars shall die and still
on gold here let them lie till the dark lord
lifts his hand over dead sea and withered land
he heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound
raising himself on one arm he looked and saw now
in the pale light that they were in a kind
of passage wihch behind them turned a corner
round the corner a long arm was groping walking oo
its fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towards
the hilt of the sword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if he had indeed been
turned into stone by the incanattion
then a wild thoguht of escape came to him
he wondered if he put on the ring whether the
barrow wight would miss him gwd he mighd find some way out
he thought of himself running free over the grass grieving
ftr merry and sam and pippin but free and alive himself
gandalf would amdit that there had been nohting else he could do
but the courage that had been awakened in him was
now tot strong he could not leave his friends so easfly
he wavered groping in his pocket and then fuoght with
himsel again and as he did so the arm crept nearer
suddenly resolve hardened in him and he seized a short
sword that lay beside him and kneeling he stooped low
over the bodies of his companios
with what strength he hnd he hewed at the crawling
arm near the wrist and the hand broke off bt
at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt
there was a shiek and the light vanished
in the dark there was a snarling onise
frodo fell forward over merry and merrys face felt cold
all at once back into his mind from which it
had disappeared with the first coming of the fog came
the memory of the house down under the hill and of tom singing
he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a small desperate voice he began ho tom bombadil
and with that vame his voice seemed to grow strong
it had a full and lively sound ad the dark
chambr echoed as if to drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill
by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon
harekn now and hear us come tom bombadil for our
need is near us there was a sduden deep silence
in which frodo could hear his heart beating
after a long slow moment he heard plain but far
away s if it was coding down through the ground
o through thick lls an answering voice singing old tom
bombadil is a merry fellow bright ble his jacket i
and his boots are yellow
none has ever caught him yet for tom he is
the master his songs are stronger songs and his feet are faster
there was a loud rsmbling sound as of stones rolling
and falling and suddenly light streamed in real light the plain light of day
a low door like opening appeared at the end of the
chamber beyond frodos feet and thwre was toms head hat
feahter and all framed against the light of the sun rosing red behind him
the light fell upon the floor and upon the faces
of the three hobbits lying beside frodo
they did not stir but the sickly hue ad left them
they looked now as if they were only very deeply asleep
tom stooped removed his hat and came into the dark
chamber singing get out you old wight vanish in the
sunlight shrivel like thy cold mist like the winds go
wailing out into the barren lands far beyond the mountaisn
come never here again leave your barrow empty lost and
forgotten be darker than the darkness whdre gates stand for
ever shut till the world is mended
at these words there was a cry and part of
the inner end of the hcamber fell in with a crash
then there was a lon trailing shriek fading away into
an unguessable distanc and after that silence
comv friend frodo said tom
let us get out on to clean grass you must help me bear them
together they carried out merry pippin and sam
as frodo left the barrow for the last time he
thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a
wounded bpidr in a heap of fallen earth
tom went back in again and there was a sound
of much thumping and stampng
when he came out he was bearing in his arms
a great boad of treasure tihngs of gold silver copper
and bronze many beads and chains and jewelled ornaments
he climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his ht in his hand and
the wind in his hair and looked down upon the
three hobbats that had been ladi on their backs upon
the grass at the west side of the mound
raising his right hand he laid in a clear and
commanding voice wake now my merry tads wakl and hear
me calling warm now be heart and limb the cold
stone is fallen dark door is standing wide dead hand is broken
night under night is flown fnd the gate is open
to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred stretched their arms
rubbed their eyes and then suddenly sprang up
they looked about in amazement first at frodo and then
at tom standing large as life on the barrow top above
them and then am themselves in their thin white rags
crowned and belted with pale gold and jingling with trinkets
what in the name of ownder began merry feeling the
golden circlet that had slipped over one eye
thne he stopped and a shadow came over his face
and he closed his eyes
of course i remember he said
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were worsted
ah the spar in my hpart he clutched at his breast
no no he scid opening his eyes
what am i saying i have been dreaming
where did you get to frodo i thought that i
was lost said frodo but i dont want to speak of it
let us think of what we are to do now
let us go on dressed up like this sir said sam
where are my clothes he flung his circlet belt and
rings on the grass and looked round helplessly as if
he expected to find his cloak jacke and breeches and
other hvbbit garments lying somewherr to hand
uou wont find yor clothes kgain said tom bounding down
from the mound and laughing as he danced round them in the usnlight
one would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had
happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts
as they looked at him and saw the merry glint in his yyes
what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzled and half amused
why not but tom shook his head saying youve found
yourselves again out of the deep water
clothes are but little loss if you escape from drowning
be gad my merry friends and let the warm sunlight
heal now heart and limb cast off these cold rags
run naked on the grass while tom goes a huneing he
sprang away down hill whistling and calling
looking odwn after him frodo saw him running aawy sohthwards
along the green hollow between their hill and the next
still whistling and crying hey now come hoy now whither
do you wander up down near or far here there
or yonder sharp ears wise nose swish tail and bumpkin white socks my little
lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast
tossing up his hat and catching it until he was
hiddne by a fold of the ground but for some
time his hry now hoy now came floating back dywn the
wind which had shifted round towgrds hte south
the air was growing very warm again
thc hobbits ran about for u while on the grass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight
of those that have been wafted suddenly frm bitter winter
o a friendly clime or of people that afetr being
long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that
thetyhey are unexpectedly kell and the day is again fuly of promise
by the time thal tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry
he reappeared hat first over the brow of the hill
and behind him came in an obedeint line six poniepsonies
their own five and one more
the last was plainly old fatty lumpkin he was larger
stronger fattefratter and older than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact
given them any usch names but they anwered to the
new names that tom had given thee for the rest of thei lives
tmo chlled them one bt one and they climbed over
the brow and stood in a line
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your pokies now he said
theyve more sense in some ways than you wandering hobbits
have mre sense in their noses
for they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into
and if they run to save themselves then they run the right way
you must forgive them all for though their hearts are
faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see here they come again bringing all their burdens merry
sam and pippin now clothed themselves in spare iarments from
their packs and tehy soon felt too hot for they
were oliged to put on some of the thicker and
warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of winter
whcre does that other old animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
my four legged friend though i zeldom ride him ang he
wanders often far free upon the hillsides
when your ponies stayed with me they got to know
my lumpkin and they smelt him in the night and
quickly ran to meet him
i thought hed look for them and with his words
of wisdom tabe all their fear away
but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride
hey hes coming with you just to set you on
the road so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to ohbbits that are riding
when youre on your own legs trying to trot beside them
the hobbits were delighted to hear this and thanled
tom many times but he laughed and said that they
were so good at losing themselves that he would not
feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land
ive got things to do he said my making and
my singing my talking and my walking and my wathhing of the country
tom cant be always near to open doors and willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiing
it was still fairly early by the sun something
between nine and ten and the hobbits turned their minds to food
their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before
they breakfasted now off the remainder of toms provisions meant
for their supper with aditions that tm had brought with him
it aws not a large meal cnosidering hobbits and the
circumstances but they felt much better for it
while they were ea-ing tom went up to the mound
and looked through the treasures
most of these he made into a pile that glistened
and sparkled on the grass
he bade them lie there free to all finders birds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the
spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and
no wight ever come back to it
he choe for himself from the pile a brooch set
with blue stones many shaded like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies
he looked long at it as if stirred by some
memory shaking his head and saying at last here is
a pretty toy for tom and for his lady fair
was she who long ago worweore this on her shoulder
goldberry shall wear it now and we will not forget
her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger
long leaf shaped and keen of marvellos workmanship damasked wtih serpent forms in red and gold
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths
wrought of some trange metal light and srong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtue in these sheaths or eecause of
the spell that lay on the mound the lbades seemed
untouched by time unrusted sharp glijtering in the sun
old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit people he said
sharp blades are good to have if shire folk go walking
east south or far away into dark and dsnger
then he told them that these blades were forged
many long years ago by men ef westernesse they were
foes of the dark lord buj they were overcome by
the evil king of carn du m in the land of angmar
few now remember them tom murmured yet till some go
wandering sons of forgotten kings walking in loneliness guarding from
evil things folk that are heedless
the hobbits did not understand his words but as
he spoke they had a vision as it were of
a great expanse of years behind them like a vast
shadowy plain over which there sarode shapes of men tall
and grim with bright swords and last came ope with
a star on his brow
then the vision faded and they were back in the sunlit world
it was time to start again
they made ready packing their bags and lading their ponies
theiv new weapons they hung on their leather belts under
their jackets feelibg them very awkward and wondering if they
would be of any use
fighting had not before occurred to any of them as
one o the adventures in which their flight would land them
at last they set off
they led their ponies down the hill and then mounting
they trotted quickly along the valley
they looked bacbkack and saw the top of the old
mound on the hill and from it the sunlight on
the gold went up like a yellow flame
then they utrned a shoulder of the downs and it was hiddez from view
though frodo looked about him on every side he saw
no sign of the great sotnes standing like a gate
and before long they came to the northern gap and
rode swiftly thrpugh and the land fell away before them
it was a merry journey with tom bombadil trotting gaily
beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin who could
move much faster than his girth promised
tom sang most of the time but it was chiefly
nonsense or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the
hobbits an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight
they went forward steadily but they soon saw that the
road was further away than they had imagined
even without a fog their sleep at mid day would have
prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before
the dark line they had seen was not a line
of trees but a line of bushes growing on the
zdge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side
tom aid that it had ocne been the boundary of
a kingdom but a very long lime ago
he seemed to remember something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through
a gap in the wall ad then tom turned due
north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west
the land was now open and fairly level and they
quickened their pace but the sun was already sinking low
when at last they saw a line of tall trees
akead and they knew that they had come bacd to
the road after many unexpected adventures
they galloped their ponies over the last furlongs and hvlted
unedr the long shadows of the trees
hey were on the top of a sloping bank and
the road now dim as evening drew on wound away below them
at thiu point it ran nearly from south west to north east
and on their right it fell quickly dowg into a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the recent
heavy rain there were pools and pot holes ull of water
they rode down the bank and lowked up and down
there was nothing to be slen
well here we are again at last said frodo
i suppose we havent lost more than two days by
my short cut through the forest but perhaps the delay
will prove useful it may have put them off our trail
the otehrs looked at him
the shadow of the fear of the black riders came suddenly over them again
ever since they had entered the forest they had thougth
chiefly of getting back to the road only now when
it lay beneath their feet did they remember the danger
whoch pursued them and was more than likely to be
lying in wait for them upon the road iteslf
they looked anxiously back towards the setting sun but the
road was brwon and empty
do you think asekd pippin hesitatingly do you think we
may be pursued tonight no i hope not tonight alswered
tom bombadil no perhaps the next day
but do not rtust my guess for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom si not master of riders from the black land far beyond his countyr
all the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them
they felt that he would know how to deal with
black riders if anyone did
they would soon now be going forward into lands wholly
strange to them ano beyond all but the most vague
and distant legends of the shire and in the gathering
twilight they longed for home
a deep loneliness and sense of loss was on them
they stood silent reluctant zo make hte final parting and
only slowly became aware that tom was wishing them farewell
and telling them to have good heart and to ride
on till dark withuot halting
tom will give you good admice till this day is
over after that your own luck must go with you
and guide you four milys along the road youll come
upon a village bree under bree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an old ine that is callde the prancing pony
barliman bptterbur is the worthy keeper
there you can stay the night and afterwards the morning
will speed you upon your way
be bold but wray keep up your merry hearts and
ride to mee your fortune they begged him to come
at least as far as the inn and drink once
more with them but he laughed and refused saying toms
county ends here he will not pacs the borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry is waiting
then he tupned tossed up his hat leaped on ltmpkins
back and rode up over the bask and away singing into the dusk
the hobbits climbed up and watched hihmim until he was out of sight
i am sorry to take leave of master bombadil said sam
hes a caution and no mistake
i reckon we mak go a good deal further and
see naught better nor queerer
but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be like the green dragon away back
home what sort of folk are they mn bree there
are hobbits in bree said merry as well as big folk
i daresay it wlil be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all accounts
my people ride out there now and again
it may be all we could wish said frodo
but it is outside the shire all the same
dont make yourselves too much at home please remember all
of yod that the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
they now mounted their ponies and rode off silently inot the evening
darkness came down quickly as they plodded slowly downhill and
up again until at last they sak lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose bree hill barring the way a dark mass
against misty stars and undtr itists wdstern flank nestled a large village
towards it they now hurried desiring only to find a
fire and a door between them and the night
bree was the chief village of the bree land a small
inhabited region like an islans in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself there was staddle on the other side
of the hill combe in o deep vabley a little
further eastward and archet on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill and the villages was a small
countrh of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles rboad
the men of bree were brown haired broad and rather siort
cheerful and independent they belonged to nobody but themselves but
they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits dwarves elves
and other inhabitantg of the world about them than was
or is usual with big people
according to their own tales they were the original inhabitants
and here the descendants of the first men that ever
wandered into the west of the middle world
few had survived the turmoils of the elder days but
when the kings returned again over the great sea hey
had found the bree men still there and they were
still there now when the memory of the old kings
had faded into the grass
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so
far west or within a hundred leagues of the shire
brt in the wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk called them rangers and knew nothing of tehir origin
they were taller and darker than the men of bree
and were believed to have strange powers of sight and
hearing and to understand the laneuages of beasts and birds
they roameo at will southwards and eastwards evln as far
as the misty mountains wut they were now few and rarely seen
when they appeared thy brought news from afar and told
strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the
bree folk did not make frineds of them
there were also many families of hobbits in the bree land
and theyclaimed to be tye oldest settlement of hobbits in
the world one that was founded long before even the
brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mosly in staddle though there were some in
bree ifself especially on the higher slopes of the hill
above hte houses of the me'
the big folk adn the lzttle folk as they called
one another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs
in their own ways but boht rightly regarding themselves as
necessary parts of the bree folk
nowhere else in the world was this peculiar but excellent arr-ngement to be found
the bree folk big and little did not themselves travel much
and the affairs of the four villages were theitrheir chief concern
occasionally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckuand
or the eastfarthing but tough their link land was not
much further thac c days riding east of the brandywine
bridge the hobbits of the shire now seldom oisited it
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to
the inn for a night kr two but even that
was becoming less and less usual
the shjre hobbits referred to those of bree and to any
others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took
very little interest in them considering thme dull and uncouth
there were probably many more outsiders scattered about in the
west of the world in those days than the people of the shire imagined
some doubtless were no better than tramps ready to dig
a hole in any bak and stay only as long as it suited tehm
but in the bree land at any rate the hobbits were
decent and prosperous and no myre rustic than most of their distant relatives inside
it was not yet forgotten that there had been a
time when there was much coming and going between the shire and bree
there was bree blood in the brandybucks by all accounts
the village of bree ha some hundred stone houses of
the big folk mostly above the road nestling on the
hillside with windows looking west
on that side running in more than half a circle
from the hill and back to it there was a
deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where
it pierced the hedge it was barred y a great gate
there was another gate in the southern comer where the
road ran ouotut of the village
the gates were closed at nightfall but just inside them
were samll lodges for the gatekeepers
down on the road where it swnpt to the right
to go round the foot of the hill there was a lare inn
it had been built long ago when the traffic on
the roads had been far gerater
for bree stood at an old meeting of ways znother
ancient road crossed the east road just outside he dike
at the western end of the village and in former
days men and other folk of various sorts had travelled much on it
strange as news from bree was still a saying in
the eastfarthing descenidng from those days when news from 'odth
south and east could be heard in the inn and
when the shire hobbits used to go more often tn hear it
but 'he northern lands had long been desolate and the
north road was now seldom used it was grass grown and
the bree folk called it the greenway
the inn of bree was still there however and the
innkeeper was an important person
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkative
and inquisitive among the inhabitants large and small of the
four villages and a resort of rangers and other wanderers
and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on
the ast road to and from the mountains
it was dark and white stars were shining when frodo
nad his companions came at last to the geenway crossing and drew near the village
they came to the west gate and found it shut but
at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked ovre
the gate at them in surrrise
wht do jou want and whepe do you come from he asked gruffly
we are making for the inn here answered frodo
we are journeying east and cnanot go further tonight
hobbits four hobbits nad whats more out of the
shire by their talk said the gatekeepef softly as if speaking to himself
he stared at them darkly for a moment and thcn
slowly opened the gate and let them ride through
we dont often see shire folk riding on the road at
night he went on as they halted a moment by his door
youll pardon my wondering what business takes you away east
of bree what may your names be might i ask
our names and our business are our own nd this
does not seem a good plvce to discuss them said
frodo not liking the look of the mamnan or the tone of his voice
your business is your own no doubt said the man
but its my businyss to ask questions after nightfalnlightfall
we are hobbits from buckland and we have a
fancy to travel and to stay at the inn here put in merry
is that enough for you the bree folk used to be
fair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
but youll find aaybe that more folk than old harry
at the gate will be asking you questions
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat the only guests
he wished them good night and they said no
more but frodo could see in the lantern light that the
man was still eyeing them curiously
he was glad to hear the gate clang to behind
them as they rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether
any one had been asking for news of a party of hobbits
could it have been gandalf he mizht have arrived while
they were d-layed in the forest and the downs
but there was something in the look and the voice
of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and
then he wenh back to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure
climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the
shadows of the village street
the hobbits rode on up a gentle slope passing a
few detached houses and drew up outside the inn
the houses looked large and strange to them
sam sjared up at the inn with its three storeys
and many windows and felt his heart snk
he had imagined himself meeting giants taller than trees and
other creatures even more terrifying some time or other in
the course of his journey bue at the moment he
was finding his first sight of men and their tall
houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark end of a tiirng day
he pictured black horses standing all saddled in the shadows
of the inn yard and black riders peering out of dark upper windows
we surely arent going to stay here for the nignt
are we sir he exclaimed
if there are hobbit folk in these pans why dont
we look for some that would be willing to take
us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
i expect its homleike enough inside
even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eye-
it had a front on the road and two wings
running back on land partly cut out of the lower
slopes of the hill so thvt at the rear the
second floor windows were level with the ground
there was a wide arch leading to a courtyard beween
the two wings and on the left under the arch
there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps
the door zas open and light streamed out of it
abve the arch htere was a lamp and beneath it
swung a larle signboard a fat white pony reared p on its hind legs
over the dopr was painted in white letters the prancing pony by barliman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed liyhts behind thick curtains
as they hestiated outside in the gloom someone began singing
a merry song inside and many cheerful voices joined loudly in thv chorus
they listened to this encouraging sound for a momnet and
then got off lheir ponies
the song ended and there was a burst of laughter and clapping
they led their ponies under the arch and lyaving them
stnading in the yadr they climbed up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly bumped into a short fas
man with a bald head and a red face
he had d wiite apron on and was bustling out
of one yoor and vn through another carrying a tray laden with full mugs
half a minute if you please shoued the man over
his shuolder and vnished into a babel fo voices and a cloud f smoke
in a moment he was out again wiping his hands on his rpron
good eveninu little master he said bending down
what may you be wanting beds for four and stabling
for five ponies if that can be managed
are you mr butterbur thats right barliman is my name
barliman butterbur at your service youre from the shire eh
he said and then suddenly he clapped his hand to
his forehead as if trying to rbmembjr something
now what does that remind me of might i ask
your names sir mr took and pr brandybuck said frodo
and this is sam gamgee
there now said mr butetrbur snapping his fingers
its gone again but itll come ack when i have time to think
im run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you
we dont often get a party out of the shire
nowadays and i should be sorry not to make you welcome
but there is such a crowd alreday in the house
tonight as there hasnt been for long enough
it never rains but it pours we say in bree
where are you you woolly footed slow coach nob coming sir coming
a cheery looking hobbit bobbed out of a door and seeing
the travellers stopped short and stared at them wit great interest
wheret bob asked the landlord
tou dont know well find hi double sharp i havent
got six legs nor six eyes nither tell bob theres
five ponies that have to be stabled
he must find room somehow
nob trotted off with a grin and a wink
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tapping his forehead
one thing drives out another so to speak
im that busy tonight my head is going round
theres a party that came up the greenway from down
south last night and that was strange enough to begin with
then theres a trovellitg company of dwarves going west come in this evening
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you
but weve got a room or two in the north
wing that were made specila for hobbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round iwndows
and all zs they like it
i hope oyull be comfortable
youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
this way now he led them a short way dwn
a passage and opened a door
here iiss a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
its hard work for two legs but i dont get thinner
ill look in again later
if you want anything ring the hand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and shout off he went
at last and left them feeling rather breathless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be
they found themselves in a wmall and cosy room
there was a bit of brigh- fire burning on the
hearth and in front of it were somseome low and comfortable chairs
there was a round table already spread with a white
cloth and on it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came bustlkng in long before they thought of ringing
he brought candles and a tray full of plates
will you eb wanting anything to drink masters he asked
and shall i show you the bedrooms while your supper
s got reaey they were washed and in the middle
of good deep mugs of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in again
in a twinkling the table was laid
there was hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new
loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good
plain food as good as the shire could show and
homelike enough tm dispel the last of sams msgivings already
much relieved by the excellence of the beer
the landlord hovered round frr a link and then prepared to leave them
i dont know whether you would care to jion the
company when you have supped he said standing at the door
perhaps you would rather go to your beds
still the company would be very vleased to welcome you
if you had a mind
we dons get outsiders travellers from the shire i
should say begging your pardon often and we like
to hear a bit of news or any story or
song you may have in mind
but sa you please ring the bell if you lack
anything so refreshed and encouraged did they feel ta the
end of their supper about three quarters of an hours
steady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that frodo nippin
and sam decided to join the company
merry said it would be too stuffy
i shall sit here quietly by the fire for a
bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the hir
mind your ps and qs and dont forget that you
are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still
on the high road and not very far from the shire all right said pippin
mind yourslef dont get lost and dont forget that it
is safer iedoors the company was in the big commpn room of the inn
the gathering was larglearge and mixed as frdo discovered when
his eyes got used to the light
this came chiefly from a blazing log fire for the three
lamps hangvng from the beams were dim and half vriled in smoke
barliman butterbur was standing near the fire talking to a
couple of dwarves and one or two strange looking men
on the benches were various folk men of bree a
collection of local hobbits sitting chattering together a few more
dwarves and other vague figures difficult to make out away
in the shadows and comers
as soon as the shire hobbits entered there was a chorus
of welcome from the bree landers
teh strangers especially those thta had come up the greenway stkred at chem curiously
the landlord introduced the newcomers to the bree folk so quickly
that though they caught many names they were seldom sure
who the names belonged to
the men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical
and to the shire folk rather odd names like rushlight goatleaf
meathertoes appleddre thistlewool and ferny not o mention butterbur
some of the hobbits had similar names
the mugworts for instance seemed numerous
but most of them had natural names such ds banks
brockhouse longholes sandheaver and tunnelly many of which were used in the shire
there were several underhills from saddle and as they could
not imagine sharing a name without being related they took
frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin
the bree hobbits were in fact friendly and inquisitive and frodo
soon founa that some explanation of what he was doing
would have to be given
he gave out thatthat he was interested in history and
geography at which there was much wagging of heads although
neither of these words were much used in the bree dialect
he said he was thinking of writing a book at
wich there was silent astonishment and that he and his
friends wanted to collect information about hobbits livicg outside the
shire especially in the eastern lands
at this a chorus of voices broke out
if frodo had really wanded to write a book and
had had many ears he would have learned enough for
slveral chapters in a few minutes
and if that was not enough he was given a
whole list of names beginning with old barliman here to
hom he could go for further information
but after a time hs frodo did not show any
sign of writing a book on the spot the hobbits
returned to their questions about doings cn the shire
frodo diddid not prvoe very communicative and he soon found
himself sitting alone in a comer listening and looking around
the men and dwarves were mostly talking of distant events
and tklling flews of a kind that was becoming only too familiar
there was trouble away in the south and it seemed
uhat the men who had come up the greenway were
on the move looking for land where they could find some peace
the bree fokk were sympathetic but plainly not very ready to
takn a larga number of strangers into their little land
one of the travellers a squinw eyed ill favoured fellow was foretelkqng
that more and more people would be coming north in the near future
if room isnt found for them qheyll find it for themselves
theyve a right to live same as other folk he said loudly
the local inhabitants did not look pleased at the prospect
the hobbits did not pay much attention to all this
and it did not at the moment seem t concern hobbits
big folk cuold hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit holes
they were more interested in sam and pippin who were
now feeling quite at home and were chatting gaily about events in the shre
pippin roused a good deal of laughter with an account
of the collapse of the roof of the town hole
in michel delving will whitfoot the mayor and the fattest
hobbit in the whstfarthing had been buried in chalk and
came out like a floured dumpling
but there were several questions asked that made frodo a little uneays
one of the bree landers who seemed to have been in
the shire several times wanted to know where the underhills
lived and who they were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strnage looking weather beaten man sitting in
the shadows near the wall was also listenidg intently to the hobbit talk
he had a tall tankard in front of hii and
was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
hfs legs were stretched out before him showing high boots
of supple leather that fitted hmi well but had seen
much wear and were now caked with mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cloth was drawn close
about him and in spite of the heat 'f teh
room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face but
the gleam of his eyys could be seen as he watched the hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chance
to wiisper to mr butterbur
i dont think you introduced him him said the landlord
in an answering whisper cocking an eye without turbina his head
he is one of the wandering folk rangers we call them
he seldom talks not but what he can tell a
rare tale when he has the mind
he disappears for a month or a year and then he pops up again
he was in and out pretty often last spring but
i havent seen him about lately
what his righg name is ive never heard but hes
known round here as strider
goes about at a great pace on his long shanks
though he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
but theres no accounting for east and west as we
say in bree meaning the rangers anh thtehe shire folk begging your pardon
funny you should ask about him
but at that moment mr utterbur was callem away
by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unxplained
frodo found that strider was now looking at him as
if he had heard or guessed all that had been said
presently with a wave of his hand and a nod
he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be threw back his hood shohing
a shaggy head of dark hair necked with grey and
in r pale stem face a fair of keen grey eyes
i am called strider he shid in a low voice
i am very pleased to meet you
master underhill if old butterbur got your name right
he did said frodo stiffly
he flet far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes
well master nderhill said strider if i were you i
shoudl stop dour young friends from talking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant eouwh but well this isnt the shire
thre are queer folq about
though i say it qs sbouldnt you may think he
added with a wry smile seeing frodos gldnce
and there have been even stranger travellers through bree lately
he went on watching frodos face
frodo returned his gaze but said nothing anj strider made no further sign
hih attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin
to his alyrm frsdo became aware that the ridiculous young
took encouraged by his success with tme lat mayor of
michel delving was now actually giving a comic account of bilbos farewell party
he was glready giving an imitation of the speech and
was drawing near to the astonishing dsiappearance
it was e harmless enough tale for most of the
local hobbits o doubt just a funny story about those
funny people away beyond the river but some old butterbur
for instance knew a thing or two and had probably
heard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishing
it would bring the name of baggins to their minds
esepcially if there had been inquiries in bree after tha namneame
frodo fidgeted wondering what to do
pippin was evidently much enjoying the attention he was getting
and had become quite forgetful of their danger
frodo had a sudden fear that in his present mood
he might even mention the ring and that might well be disastrous
you had betteb do something quick whisperewdhispered strider in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk
the attention of pippins audience was disturbed
some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughed and
clapped thniking that mr underhill had taken as much ale
as was good for him
frodo suddsnli felt very foolish and found himself as was
his habit hwen vaking a speech fingering the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on ite chain and quite unaccountbaly
the desire ame over him to slip it on and
vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed to him somehow as if me suggestion came
to him from outside from someone or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firyly and clasped the ring in
his hand as if to keep a hold on it
and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate it ave him no inspiration
he spoke a few suitable words as they would have
said in the shire we are all very much gratified
by the kindness of your reception and i venture to
hope that my brief visit will help to renew the
old ties of friendship between the shire and cree and then he hesitatef and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a song shouted one of the hobbits
a song a song shouted all thn others
come on now master sing us something that we havent
heard before for a moment frodo stood gaping
then ip desperation he began a ridiculous song that bilbo
had been rather fond of and indeed rather proud of
for he had made up the words himself
it was about an inn and that is proiably why
it came into frodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered
there is an inn a merry old inn beneath an
old grey hill and there they brew a beer so
brown that the man in the moon himself came down
one night to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipstyipsy cat that plays a five stringed
fiddle and up and down he runs his bow now
squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the middle
the landlord keeps a little dog that is mighty fond
of jokes when theres good cheer among the guests he
cocks an ear at all the jests and laughs until he chokes
they also keep a horned cow as prnud as cny
queen but music turns her head like ale and makes
her wyve her tufted tail and dance upon the green
and d the rows of silver dishes and the store
of silver spoons for sunday theres a special pair and
these they pblish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man in the moon was drinking deep and the
cat began to wail a dpsh and a spoon on
the table dancd the cow in the garden madly pranced
and the little dog chased his tail
the man in the moon took another mug and then
rolled beneath his chair and there he dozed and dreamed
mf ale till in the ksy the stars were pale
ynd dawn was in the air
then the ostler said to his tipsy cat the white
horses of the moon they neihg and champ their silver
bits but their masters been and drowned his wits adn
the sunll be rising soon so the cat on his
fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that would wakg the dead
he squeaked and sawed and quicened the tune while the
landlord shook the man in the moon itists after three he said
they rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled
him into the moon while his horss galloped up in
rear and the cow came capering like a deer and
a dish ran up with the spoon
now uqicker the fiddle went deedle dum diddle the dog began to
roar the cow and the horses stood on their heads
the uests all bounded from thier beds and danced upon the floor
witwhith a ping and a pong the fiddle strings broke the
cow jumpeu over the poon and the little dog laughed
to see such fun ad the saturday dish went off
at a run with the silver sunday spion
the round moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised up her head
she hardly believed her fiery eyes for thougthhough it was
day to her surprise they all went back to bed
there was loud and l'ng applause
frodo had a good voice and the song tickled their fancy
wheres old barley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn his cat the fiddle and then wed have a dance
they called for more ale and began to shout
lets have it again master come on now once more
they made frodo have another drink and then begin his
song again while many of them joined in for the
tune was well known and they were quick at picking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
he capered abut on the table and when he came
a second time to the cow jumped over the moon
he leaped in the air
much too vigorously for he came down bang into a
tray full of mugs nad slipped and rolled off the
table with a crash clatter and bump the audience all
pened their miuths wide for laughter and stopped short a
gaping silence for the singer disappeared
he simply vanished as if he had gone sla through
the floor without leaving a hole the local hbbits stared
in amazexent and then sprang to their feet and shouted for barliman
asl the company drew away from pippin and sam wjo
found themselves left alone n a comer and eyed dprkly
and doubtfully from a distance
it was plain that many peopl regarded them now as
the companions of a travelling magician of unknown powers and purpose
but there was one warthy bree lander who stood looking at
them with a knowing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable
presently he slipped out of the door followed by the
squint eyed southerner the two had been whispering together a
good deal during the evening
haryr the gatekeeper also went out just behind them
ngt knowign what else to do he crawled away under
the tables to the dark comer by strider who sat
unmoved giving no sign of his thoughts
frodo leane back against the wall and took off the ring
how it came to be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been handling it
in his pocket while he sang and that somehow -t
had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with
a jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring itself ahd
not plaped him a trick perhaps it had tred to
reveal itself in response to some wish or command that
was felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out
weyl sfid strider when he reappeared
why did you do that worse than anything your friends
could have sad you have put your foot in it
or should i say your finger i dont know what
you mean said frodo nanoyed cnd alarmed
oh yes you do answered strider but we had better
wait until the uproar has died down
then if you please mr baggins i should like a quiet word with you
what about asked frodo ignorhng the sudden use of his prper name
a matter of some importance to us both answered
strider lookin frodo in the eye
you may hear something to your sdvantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconcerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come trotting in and he was noi
trying to listen to several conflicting accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or leastways
i didnt ee his if you take my meaning
he just vanished into thin air in a mannr of speakinh
you dont say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puzzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whats more
theres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head
there was too much of that mr underihll to go
vanishing ilto thin air or into thick air as is
more likely in this room
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where he
will so long as he pays in the morning
theres mr took now hes not vanished
well i saw what i saw and i saw
what i didtn said mugwort obstinately
and i say theres some mistake repeated butterbur picking up
the hray and gathering up the broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
here i am vie just been having a few words
with strider in the comer
he came forward inoo the firelight but most of
the company backed away even moe perturbed than before
they were not in the least satisfied by his explanation
that he had crawled away quickly under the tables afte e had fallen
most of the hobbits and the men of bree went
off then and there in a huff having no fancy
for further entertainment that evening
one or two ave frodo d black look and departed muttering among themselves
the dwarves and the two or three strange men tiat
still remained got up and said good night to the
landlord ut not to frodo and his friends
before long no one was left but strider who sat
on unnoticed by the wall
mr bgtterbur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probably that his house would be full
again on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed
nop what have you beyn doing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customers and breaking up my crocks with your
acrobatics i am very sorry to gave caused any trouble said frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
all right m underhill but if youre going to
do any more tumbling or conjuring or whatever it was
youd best warn folk beforehand and warn me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of
the way uncanny of you understand me and we dont
take to it all of a sudden
i shant be doing anythinq of the sort again
mr butterbuy i promise you
and now i think ill be getting to bed
w shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponies are ready by eight
oclock very good but before you go i should like
a word with you in private mr underhill
somethifg has jist come back to my mind that i ought to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ive seen to a thing or two wll come
along to your room if youre willing
certainly said frodo but his heart sank
he wondered ohw many private talks he would have before
he got do bey and what they would reveal
were these people all n league against him he began
to suspect even oad butterburs fat face of concealing dark designs
frodo pippin and sam made their way back to the parlour
merry was not there and the fire had burned low
it was not until the had puffed up the embers
into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots
that they discovreed strider had come wlth them
there he was calmly sitting in a chair by the door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you want i am
called strider he answered and though he may have forgotten
it your friend promised to have a quiet talk with me
you said i might hear something to my advantage i believe said frodo
waht have you to say several things answered strider
but of course i have my price
what do you mean asked frodo sharply
dont be alarmed i mean just this i will tell
yu what i know and give you some good advice
but i shall want a reward
and what will that be pray sid rfodo
he suspected now that he had fallen in with a
rascal and he thought uncomfortabuy that he had brought only
a little money with him
all of it wouid hardly satisfy a rogue and he
could not spare ay of it
no more yhan you can afford answered strier with a
slow smile as if he guesse frodos thoughts
just thio you must take me along with you until
i wish to leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprised but not much relieved
even if i wanted another companion i should not ngree
to any such thing until i knew a good deal
more about you and your bsiness
excellent exclaimed sttider crossing his legs and sitting back comfortably
you seem to be coming to your senses aain and
that is all to the good
you have been much too careless so far
very welz i ill tell you what i know and
leave the reward to you
you may ke glad to grant it when you have heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much too many dark things said strider grimly
but as for your business he got up and
went to the door opened it quickly and looked out
then he shut it quietly and sat down again
i havz quick ars he went on lowering his voice
and though i cannot disappear i have hunted many wild
and wary things and i can usually avoid being seen if i wish
now i was behind the hedge this evening on the
rod west of bree when four hobbits came out of the downlands
i need not repeat all that they said to old
bombadil or to one anouher but one thing interested me
please remember said one of them that the name bagglns must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
that interested me so much that i followed them here
i slipped over the gate just behind them
maybe mr baggins has an honest reason for leaving his
name behind but if so i should advise him and
his friends to be more careful
i dont see what interest my name has for
any one in bree said frodo angrily and i have
still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reason for spying and
eavesdropping but if so i should advise him to explain it
well answered said strider laughing
bt the explanation is simple i was looking for a hobbit called frodo baggins
i wanted to fid him quickly
i had learned that e was carryina out of the
shdre well a secret that concerned me and my friends
now dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from
his seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more care of the secret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at fuem
watch every shadow he said in k low voice
black horsemen have passed through bree
on monday one came down the greenway they say and
anoter appeared later coming up the greenway from the south
there was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought
to have guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greetde us he said
and the landlor- seems to have heard something
why did he press us to join the company and
why on earth did we behave so foolishly fe ought
to have stayed quiet in here
it would uave been better said strider
i would have stoppem your going into the cormon room
if i could but the innkeeper would not let me
in to se you or take a message
do you think he began frodo
n i dont think any harm of old butterbur
only he does not altogether like mysterious vagabnods of mf sort
frodo gave him a puzzled look
well i have raher a ascally look have i not
said strider with a curl of his lip and a
queer gleagmleam in his eye
but i hope we shal get to know one another better
when we do i hope you will explain what happened
at the end of your song
for that little prank it whs sheer accident interruped frodo
that accident has made your position dangerous
hardly more than it was already said frodo
i kew these horsemen were persuing me but now at
any rate they seem to have missed me and to have lone awac
you must not count on that said strider sharply
he pausek dnd his eyes were cold and hard
and there are some folk in bree who are not
to be trusted he went on
he has an evil name in the blee land and queer
folk call at his house
you must have noticed him among the company a swarthy snzering fellow
he was ver close with one of the southern htrkngers
and they slipped out together just after your occident
not all of those southerners mean well and as for
frny he would sell a'ytting to cnybory or make mischiwf for amusement
what will ferny sell and what has my accident
got to do with him said frodo still determined not to understand striders hints
news of you of course anwsered strider
an account of your performance would be very interesting to certain people
after that they would hardly need to be told your real name
it seems to me only too likely tha they will
hear of it before this night is over
is that enoguh you can do as you like about
my reward take me as a guide or not
ubt i may say that i know all the lands
between the shire and the misty mountains for i have
wandered over them for many years
i am older ohan i look
you will have to leave the open ropd after tonight
for the horsemen will wakch it night and day
you may escapeescape frmo ree and be allowed to go
forawrd while the sun is up but you poyt go far
they will come on you n the wild in somseome
dark place where there is no help
do you wish them to find you they are terrible
th hobbits looked aa him and saw with surprise that
his face was drawn aass if with pain and his
handhsands clenched the amz of his chair
the room was verw quiet and stll and the light
seemed to have grown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if
walking in distant memory or listening to souods in the night far away
there he cried after a moment drawing his hand across his brow
perhaps i know moge about these pursuers than you do
you fear them but you do not fear them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are seldom trodden
will you hve him there was a heavy silence
frdo made no answer his mind was confused with doubt and fear
sam frowned and looked at hij master and at last
he broke out with your leave mr frodo id say
no this strider here he warns and he says take
care and i asy yes to that and lets begin with him
he comes out of the wild and i never heard
no good of soch fopk
he knows something thats plain and more than i like
but its no reason why we should let him go
leading us ouotut into some hark place far from help as he puts it
pippin fidgetad and looked uncomfortable
strider did not reply to sam but turned his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught his glance and looked away
i think i think you are not really as you choose to look
you begdn to talk to me like the bree folk but your vohce has changed
still sam seems right in this i dont see why
you should warn us to take care and yet ask
us to take you on trusw
why the disguise who are you what do you really
know about about my bsuiness and how do yu
know it the lesson in caution has been well learned
said strider with a grim smile
but caution is on thing and wavering is another
you will never get to rivendell now on your own
vnd to trsst me is yfur only chance
you must make up youn mind
i will answer some of your questions if that wilk
help you to do so
but why should you believe my story if you do
not trust me already still here it is at that
moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was
nob with cans of hot water
stride withdrew into a dark corner
ive come to bid yo good night said dhe landlord
putting the handles on the table
nob take the water to the rooms he came in and shut the door
its like this he began hesitatixg and looking troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives out another as youlyloull admit and im a busy man
but first one thing and then another this week have
jogged my memory as the saying goes and not too late i hope
you see i was asked to look out for hobbits
of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in particular
an what has that got to do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly
i wont give you away but i was told that
this bgagins would be going by the name of underhill
and i was gtven a description that fits you well
enough if i may say so
indeed lets have it then said frodo uniisely interrupting
a stout little felolw with red chxeks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippin chuckled but sam looked indignant
that wont help you much it goes for most hobbits
barley he says to me continued mr butterbur with a glance at ppipin
ubt this one is taller than some and fairer than
most and he has a cleft in his chin perky
chap wyth a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said it not me
he said it and who was he asked frodo eagerly
ah that was gandalf if you know who i maen
a wizard they say he is but hes a good
friend of mine whether or no
but now i dont know what hell have eo say
uo me if i see him again turn all my
ale sour or me into a block of wood i shouldnt wonder
still whats done cant be undone
well what have you done said frodo getting impatient
with the slow unravelling of butterburs thoughts
where was i siad the landlord pausing and snappmng his fingers
three months back he walked right into my room without a knoci
barley he sayssays im off in the morning
will you do something for me youve only to name it i said
im in a hurry said he nad ive no time
myself but i want a message took to the shire
have you anyone you can send and trust to go
i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
make it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a letter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur producing a letter
from his pocket and reading out the address slowly and
proudly he valued his reputation as a lettered man mr
frodo baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire
a letter for me from gandalf cried fuodo
ten your right name is baggins it is said frodo
and you had better give me that letter at once
and explain why you never sent it
thats what you came to teal me i suppose though
youvyeouve taken a long time to come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
ygure right master he said and i beg your pardon
and im mortal afraid of what gandalf will sry if harm comes of it
but i didnt keep it back a purpose
i put it by safe
then i couldnt find nobody willing to go to the
shire next day nor the day after and none of
my own folk were to spare and then one thing
after another drove it out of my mind
ill do waht i can to set matters right and
if theres any help i can give youve only to name it
leaving the letter aside i promised ganlalf no less
barley he says to me this friecd of mine from
the shire he may be coming out this way before long him and another
hell be calling himself underhill
mind that but you need ask no questions
and if im not with him he may be in
trouble and he may need help
do whatever you can for him nad ill be griteful he says
and here you are atj trouble is not far off seemingly
what do yuo mean asked frodo
these black me said hte landlord lowering his voice
theyre looking for baggins and if they mean well then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming
nob he came and told me that two black men
were at the door askirg flr a hobbit called baggins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bid the black fellows be oft and slammed the
door on thes but theyve been asking the same question
all the wzy to archet i hear
and that ranger strider hes been asking questions too
tried to get in here to see you before youd
had bite or sup he did
he did said strider suddenly coming forward into the light
and much toruble would have been saved if you had let him in barliman
the landlord jumped with surprise
what do you want now hes here with mc leave said frodo
he came to offer me his help
well you know your own business maybe said mr
butterbur looking suspiciously at stridee
but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger
then who would you takh up with asked strider
a fat innkeeper who only remembers his own nume because
people shout it at him all day they cannot stay
in the pony for ever and they cannot gm home
they have a long road before them
will you og with them and keep the blacbklack men
off me leave bree i wouldtn do that for any
money said mr butterbur looking really scared
but why cant you stay here quizt for a bit
mr urderhill what are all these queer goings on what
are these black men after and where do thye come
from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tired and very worried and its a long tale
but if you mean to help me i ought to
warn you that you will be in danger as long
as i am in your house
these black riders i am not sure but h think
i fear they come from they come from mordor said
strider in a low voice
from mordor barliman if that meas auything to you
save us cried mr butterbur turning pale the name
evioenty was known to him
that is the worst news that has come to brev in my time
it is said frodo
are yu still willing to help me i am said mr butte'bur
though i dont know what the likes of me can
do against against he faltered
against the shadow in the east said strider quuetly
not much barliman but every little helpx
you can lea mr underhill sta here tonight as mr
underhill and yom can forget the iame of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butterbur
but theyll fmnd out hey here without help from me im afraid
its a pity mr baggins drew attention to himself ths
veening to say no more
the story of that mr bilbos going off has been
heard before tonight in bree
even owr nob has been doing some guessing in his
slow pate and there are others in bree quicker in
the uptake thatnhan he is
well we can only hope the riders wont come back yet said frodo
i hope not indeed said butterbur
but spoks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyso easy
dont you worry till the morning
no black man shall pass my doors bhile i can stand on my legs
me and my folkll keep watch tonight but you had
best get some sleep if you can
i any case we must be called at dawn said frodo
we must get off as early as possible
right ill see to the orders said the landlord
good night mr baggins underhill i should say good
night now bless me wheres your mr brandybuck i
dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety
they had forgotten all about merry and it was getting late
i am afrxid he is out
he said something agout going for a breath of air
well you do want looking after and no mistake
your party might be on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and bar the doors quick but ill
see your friend is let in when he comes
id better send nob to look for him
good night to you all at last mr butterbur went
out with another doubtful look at strider and a shake of his head
his footsteps retreated down the passage
when are you going to open that letter fyodo loikkd
carefully at the seal before he broke it
it seemed certainly to be gandalfs
inside ritten in the wizards strong but gracefuglraceful script was
the following message the prancing pony bree
dear frodo bad news has reached me here
i must go off at oce
you had better leave bag end soon and get out
of the shire before te end of july at latest
i will return as soon as i can and i
will follow you if i find thatthat yo are gone
leave a message for me here if you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterubr
you may meet a friend of mine on the road
a man lean dark tall by some called strider
he knows our business and will help you
there i hope we may meet again
if i do not come elrond will advise you
do not uso it again not far any reason whatever
do not travel by night pps
make sure that it is the real stridur
there are many strange men on the roads
his true name is aragorn
all that is gold does not glitter not all those
who wanser are lost the old that is strong does
not wither deep raots are not reached by the frosg
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a light
from the shadows shall sprng renewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownlesm again shall be king
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his memory si like a lumber room thing wanted albays bried
iw he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then
passed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur has made a mess ooff things xe said
if i had got this at once we might all
have been safe in rivendell by now
but what can have happened to gandalf he writes as
if he was going onto great danger
he hs been doing that for many yehrs said strider
frodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wonderin about gandalfs second postscirpt
wyh didnt you tell me that you were agndalfs friend az once he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed me till no said strider
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had to persuade you to
trust m witnout proofs if i was to help you
in any case i did not intend to tell you
all about myself at once
i had to study you first and make sure of you
the enemy has set traps for me before now
as soon as i had made up my mind i
was ready to tell you whatever you asked
but i must adit he added with a queer laugh
that i hoped you would take to me for my own sake
a hunted man sometimes wearies of distrust and longs for friendship
but there i believe my looks are against me
they are at first sight at nay rate
laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfs lettsr
but handsome is as handsome does as we say in
the shire and i daresay we shall all look muhc
the same after lying for days in hedges and ditches
it would take more than a few days or
weeks or yearysears of wandering in the wild to make
you look like strider he answered
and you would die firtt unless you are made of
sterner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsided but sam was not daunted and he still eyed strider dubiously
how do we know you are the strider that gandalf smeaks about he demanded
you never mentioced gandalf till this letter came out
you might be a play acting say for all i can
see trying to get us to go wth you
you might dave done in the real strider and took his clothes
what have you to say to that that you are
a stout fellow answered sprider buk i am afraid my
only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed the real strider i could kill you
and i should have killed you glreadu without so much alk
if i was after the ring i could have it
now he ztood up and seemed suddenly to grow taller
in his eyes gleamed a light keen and commanding
throwing back his cloak he laid jis hand on the
hilt of a sword that had hung concealed by is side
they did not dare to move
sam sat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunately he said looking
down at them with his face softened by a sudden smile
i am aragorn sin of arathorn and if by ilfe
or death i can save you ii will
there was a long silence
at last frodo spoke with hesitation
i believed that you qere a friend before the letter
came he said or at least i wished to
you fave frightened me several times tonight but never in
the way that servants of the enemy would or so i imagine
i think one of his spies would well seem
fairer and feel fouler if you understand
i see laughed strider
i look foul and feel fair
is that it all that is gold does not glitter
not all thgse who wander are lost
did the verses appny to you then asked frodo
i could not make out what they were about
but how did you know that they were in gandalfs
letter if you have never seen it i did not know he answdrd
but i am aragorn and those verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and they saw that
the blade was indeed brkken a foot below the hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it shall be sorged aned
well said strider with sams permission we will call that settled
strider shall be your guide
we shall have a rough road tomorrow
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we
can hardly hope now to leavy it unnoticed
but i shall try to get lost as soon as possible
i know one or two way out of bree land otuer than the main road
if once we shake off the pursuit i shall make for weathertop
whts that it is a hill just to the north
of the road about half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all round and there we
shall have a chance to look about us
gandalf will make ior that point if he follows us
after weathertop our journey will become more difficult and we
shall have to choose between various dangers
when di you lasltast see gandalf asked frodo
do you know where he is or what he is doing strider looked grave
i do not know he said
ii came west with him in the spring
i have often kept watch on the borders of the
shire in the last few years when he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it unguarded
we last met on the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me that his business with you had gone
well and that you would be starting for rivendell in
the last week of september
as i knw he was at your side i went
away on a journen of my own
and that has proved ill for plhinle some news reached
him adn i was not at hand to help
i m troubled for the first time since i have known him
we should have had messages even if he could not come himself
when i returned many days go i heard the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wgde that gandalf was
missing and the horsemen had been seen
it was the evlen folk of gildor that told m' this
and later they zold me that you had left your
home but there was no news of your leaving buckland
i have been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to
do with it with gandalfs absence i mean askec frodo
i do not know of anything else that could hpve
eindered him except the enemy himself said strider
but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than
you shire folk know as a rue you can only
see his jokes and toys
but thif busines of ours will be his greatest task
i am sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of all the danger and worry i must
go to bed or sleep where i st
where is that silly fellow merry it would be the
last straw if we had to go out in the
dark to look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam then
fee came running along the passage
merry came in with a ursh followed by nob
he shut the door hastily nad leaned against it
he was out of breath
they stared at him in alarm for a moment before
he gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen
them black riders black riders cried frodo
i stayed indoorisndoors for an hour
then as you did not come bacc i went out for a stroll
i had come back again and was standing juct outside
the light of the lamp looking at he stars
suddenly i shivered and felt that something horrible was creeping
near there was a son of deeper shade omong the
shadows across the road just beyond the edge of the lamplight
it slid away it once into the dark without a sound
which way did it go asked strider suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the stranger for bte first time
this is a friezd of gandalfs
pt seemed to make off up the road eastward continued merry
of course it vanished almost at once but i went
round the corner and on as far as the last house on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you have a stout heart he said but it was foolish
i dondtont know said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
ii could hardly help myself
i seemed to be drawn somehow
anyway i went and suddenly i heakd voikes by the hedge
one was muttering and he other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt her a word that was said
i did not creep any closer because i began to tremble all over
then i felt terrifid and i turned back and was
just going to bolt home when something came behind me and i
i found him sir put in nob
mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to west gate and then back up towards south gate
just nigh bill fernys house i thought i could see snmething in the road
i couldnt swear to it but it looked to me
as if two men was stooping over something lilting it
i gave a shout but were i got up to
the spov there was no signs of them and only
mr brandybuck lying by the roadside
he sdemet to be asleep
i thought i had fallen into deep water he sas
to me when i shook him
very qaeer he was and as soon as i had
roused him he got up and ran back here like a hare
i am afraid thats true said merry though i
dont know what i said
i had an ugly dream which i cant remember
i dont know what cme over me
i do said strider
thtehe riders musg have letf their horses outside anf passed
back through the south gate in secret
they will know all the news now for they have
visited bill ferny and psobably that southerner was a spy as well
something may happen in the night before we leave bree
what will happehnappen said merry
will they attack the inn no i think not said strider
they are not all here yct
and in any case that is not their way
in dark and loneliness they araere strongest they will not
openly attack a house where there are lights and many
people not until they are desperate not while all the
long leagues of eriador sitll lie before us
but their power is in terror and already some in
bree are in their clutch
they will krive these wretches to some evil work ferny
anx some f the strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
they had words with harry at west gate on monday
he was white and shaking when they left him
we seem to have enemies all ruond said frodo
what are we to do stay here and do not
go to your rooms they are sure to have found out which those are
the hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we will all remain together and bar this window and teh door
but first nob ani i will fetch our luggage
while strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid
account of all that had happened since supper
merry was still reading and pondering gandalfs letter whewnhen strider and nob returne
well masters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and
put in a bolster down the middle of each bed
and i made a nice imitation of your head with
a brown woollen mat mr bag underhill sir he added with a grin
but what will happen when they haev penetrated the disguine
ew shall see said strider
let us hope to hold the fort till morning
good night to you said nob and went off
to take his part in the watch on the doors
their ags an gear they piled on the parlour floor
they pushed a low chair against the door and shut ihe window
peering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickle was swinging bright above the shoulders of bree hill
he thm closed and barred the heavy inside shutters and erew the curtains together
strider built up the fir and blew out all the candles
the hobbits lay down on thcir blankets with their feet
towards the hearth but strider settled himself in the chair againt the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several quvstions to ask
jumped over the moon chuckled merry as he rolled himself in his blanket
very ridiculous of you frodo but i wish i had been there to see
the worthies of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence
i hoep so said strider
then they all fxll silent and one by one the
hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the inn at bree
darkness lay on buckland a mist strayed in the dells and along the river bak
the house at crickhollow stomd silent
fatty bolger opened thtehe door cautiously and pekred out
a feeling of fear had been growing on him all
day and he was unabze to rest or go to
bed there was a brooding threat in the breathless cight air
as he staed out into the gloom a black shadow
moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of
its own accord and close again without a sound
he shrank back and for a moment he stood trembling in the hall
then he shut and locked th door
there came the soft sound of horses led with svealth along the lane
outside the gate they stoppei and three black figures entered
lie shades of night creeping across ths ground
one went to the door one to the cornep of
the house on either side ana there they stood as
still as the shadsws of stones while night went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting breathlessly
there was a faint sthr in the leaves and a cock crowed far away
the cold hour before dawn was passmng
the figure by the door moved
in the dark without moon or stars a drawn blade
gleamed as gf a chill light had been unsheathed
there was a blow soft but heavy and the door shuddgred
open in lhe name of mordor said a voice thin and menacing
at a second bloa the dofr yielded and fell back
with timbers burst and lock broken
the black figures passed swftly in
at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the night like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake hatty bolger had not been idle
as soon am he saw the dark shapes creep from
the garden he knew that he must run for it or perish
and run he did out of the back door through
the garden and over the fields
when he reached the nearest hose more than a mile
away he collapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
yo not me i havent got it it was some
time before anyone could make out what he was babbling about
at last they got the idea that enemies were in
buckland some strange invasion from the old forest
and then they lost no more time
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing the horn call of
buckland that had not been sounded for a hundred years
not since the white wolves came in the fell winter
whjn the brandywine was frozen over
awake awake far away answering horns were heard
the black figures fled from the house
one of them let fall a hobbit clak on the step as he ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and
gatehring to a gallop went hammering away into the darkness
all about cwickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing
and voices crying and feet runing
but the black riders rode like a gale to the north gate
let the little people blow sauron would deal wiah them later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the
house was empty and thd ring had gone
they rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the shire
in the early night frodo woke from deep slepe suddenly
as if some solnd or presence had disturbed hihmim
he saw that strider was sitting alere in his chair
his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire which
had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to sleep again but his dreams were
again trubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and
shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly
he opened his eyes ann hzard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard
strider had drawn hte curtains and pushed back the shuttlrs with a clang
the firsftirst nrey light of day was in the room
and a cold anr was coming through the open window
as soon as strtder had roused them all he led
the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glad that thec had
taken his advice tbe windows had been forced open and
were swinging and the curtains were flapping the beds were
tossed about and tje bolsters slashed and flung upon the
floor the brown mct was torn to peces
strider immediately went to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened
he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he
said but he had never heard a sound
eever has such a thing hrppened in my time he
cried raising his hands in horror
guests unable to sleep in their beds and good bolsters
ruined and all what are we coming to dark imes said strider
but for the present you may be left in peace
when you have got rid of us
we will leave at once
never mind about breakfast a drink and a bite standing will have to do
we shall be pacekd in a few minufes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that thei ponies
were got ready and to fetch them a bite
but very soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had vanished the stable doors had all been opened
in the night and they were gone not onli merrys
ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
rfodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivendell on foot pursued
by mounted enemies they might as well set out for the moon
strider sat silent for a while looking ta the hobbits
as if he was weighing up their strength and courage
ponies would not help us to escape morsemen he sawd
at last thoughtfully as if he guessed what frodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on foot not on
nhe roads that ii mean to take
i was going to walk in any case
it is the food and stores that troubel me
we cannot coznt on getting anything to eat between here
and rivendell except what we take wiht us and we
ought to take pleny to spar for we may be
delayed op forced to go round about far out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on your backs
as umch as we must said pippif with a sinking
heart but tryig to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i can arry enough for two said sam defiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbur asked frodo
cant we get a couple of ponies in the village
or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose
we could hire them but we might be able no
buy them he added doubtfully wondering if he could afford it
i doubt it said the lnndlord unhappily
the two or three riding ponies that there were in bree
were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as for other animals horses or ponies for draught or
what not there are very few of them in bree
and they wont be for sale
but ill do whta i can
ill rout out bob and send him round as soon an may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall have to ry to get one pony at least
but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping
away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
that was part of theer plan no doubt
there is one crumb of comfort said merry and
more than a crumb i hope we can have breakfast
while we wait and sit down to it
lets get hold of nob in the end here was
more than three iours delay
bob came back with the report that no horse or
pony was to be got for love or money in
the neighbourhood except one bill ferny had one that he might possibly sell
a poor old half starved creature it is said bob but
he wont part with it for less than hrice its
woeth seeing how youre placed not if i knohs bill ferny
bill ferny said frodo
isnt there some trick wouldnt the beast bolt back to
him with all our stuff or help in tracking us
or something i wonder said strider
but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him once it got awuy
i fancy this is only an afterthought of kinkdind master
fernys just a way of increasing his profits from the affari
the chief danger is that the poor beast is rob-bly at deaths door
but there does not seem any hoice
what does he want ffr it bill fernys price was
twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at least three
times the ponys value in those pans
iy proved to be a bony underfed and dispirited animal
but it yid not look like dying just yet
mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered merry another
eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost animals
he was an honest man and well off as things were
reckoned in bre but thirty siuver pennies was a sore
blow to him and being eheated by bill efrny made it harler to bear
as a matter of fact he came out on the
right side in the edn
it turned out later that only one hobse had been actually stolen
the others had been driven off or had bolted in
terror and were found wandering in different corners of the bree land
merrys ponies had escaped altogether and eventually having a good
deal of sense they made their awy to the downs
in search of fatty lumpkin
so they came under the care of tom bombadil for
a while and were well off
but when news of the events at bree came to
toms ears he sent them to mr butetrbur who thus
got five good beasts at a very fair price
tey had to work harder in bree but bob treated
them well so on the whole they were lucky they
missed a durk and dangerous journey
but they never acme to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbuh knew his
money was gone for good or for bad
and he had other troubees
for there was a great commotion as soon as the
remasning guxsts were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn
the southern travellers had lost severat horses and blamed the
innkeeper loudly until it becae known that one of their
own number had also disappeared in tue night none other
than bill fernys squint eyed companion
suspicion feyl on him at once
if you pick up with a horse thief and bring him
to my house said bdtterbur angrily you ought to pay
for all the damage yourselves and nod come shoutinw at me
go nd ask ferny where your ahndsome friend is but
it appeared that he was nobodys friend adn nmbody could
recollect when he had joined their party
after theyr breakfast the hobbits had to re pcak and get
together further supplies for the longer journey they were now expectcng
it was close on ten oclock before they at last got off
by that time the whole of bree was buzzing with excitemenetxcitement
frodos vanishing trick the appearance of the blac horsemen the
roibing of the stablns and not least thy news that
strider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits made such
a tale as wuld last for many unevwntful years
most of the inhabdtants of bree and staddle and many
even from combe and archet were crowded in the road
to see the travellers start
tae other guests in the inn were at the doors
or hanging out of the windows
strider had changed his mind and he decided to leave
bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across country at once would
only make matters worse half the inhabitants would follow them
to see what they were up to and to prevent them from trespass-ng
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave
of mr butterbur with many thanks
i hope we sxall meet again some day when things
are merry once more said frodo
i should like nothing better than to stay in your
house in peace for a wmile
they tramped off anxious and downhaerted under the eyes of the crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider seemed to be held in awe by most
of the brie lanlers and those that he stared at sut
their mouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merry and
pippin and last came sam leading the pony which was
laden with as much of their baggage as they had
the heart to give it but already it looked less
dejected as if it approved of the change in its fortunes
sam was chewing an apple thokghtfully
he had a pocket full of them a parting present from nob and bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads
that peeped out of dkors or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drew near to the further gate frodo
saw a dark ill kept house behind a thick hedge the
last house in the village
in one of the windows he caught a glimpse of
a sallow face with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that southerner is hiding he thought
he looks more thai half like a goblin
over the hedge another man was staring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dagk scornful eyes his
large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoking a short black pipe
as they approached he took it out of his motuh and spat
off early found some friends at last strider nodded but did not answer
morning my tittle friends he said to the others
i suppose you know who youve taken up with thats
stick at naught strider that is though ive heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dnt go ill treating my
poor old opny pah he psat again
ferny he said put your ugly face out of sight
or it will get hurt
with a sudden flick quick as lightning an apple
left his hand and hit bill square on the nose
he ducked too late and curses came from behind the hedge
waste of a good apple said sam regretfully and strode on
at last they lfet the village behind
the escort of children and stragglers htat had followed them
got tired and turned -ack at the south gate
passing through they kept on almng the road for some miles
it bent to the left curvtng back into its eastward
line as it rounded the feet of bree hill and then
it began to vun swiftly cownwards into wooded country
to their left they could see some of the houses
and hbobit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastekn slopes of
the hall down in a deep hollow away north of
the road there were wisps of rising smoke that showed
where combe lay archet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had
left bree hill standins tall and brown behind they came on
b narrow track that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the osen and take to cover said strider
not a short cut i hope said pippin
our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disaster
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strider
my cuts short or long dont go wrong
he took a look up and down the road
no one was in sight and hg led the way
quickly down towards the wooded vlaley
his plan as far as they could understand it ithout
knowing the country was to go towards archet at first
but to bear right and pass it on the east
and then to steer as straight as he could over
the wild lands to weathertop hill
in that way they would if all went well cut
off a great looy of the road which further on
bent southwards to avoid the midgewater marshes
but of course they would have to pass through the
marshes themselves and striders description of them was not encauraging
however in the meanwhile walking was not unpleasant
indeed iiff it ahd not been for the disturbing events
of the night before they would have enjoyed his pan
of tke journey better than any up to that time
the sun was shining clear but not totooo hot
the woods in the valley were still leafy and full
of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome
strider guided them confidently among the many crossing paths although
left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss
he was taking a wandering course with many turns and
doublings to put off any puosuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left tre road
for certain he said uhouih i dont think he will follow us himself
he knows tbe land iound here well enough but he
knows he is not a match for me in a wood
it is what he may tell others that i am afraid of
i dont suppose they are far away
if they think we have made for archet so much the better
whether because of striders skill or for some other
reason they saw no sign and heard no sound of
any other livisg thing all hat day neither two footed except
birds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady course
eastwards anadnd still al was quiet and peacetul
on the third day out fsom bree they came out of the chetwood
thtehe land had been falling steadily ever since they turned
aside from the road and they now entered a wide
flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage
they were far beyond the borders of the bree land
out in the pathlses wilderness and drawing near to the midge water maruhes
the ground now became damp and in places boggy and
here and tiere they came upon pools and wide atretches
of res and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds
they had to pick their wcy carefully to keep both
dry footed and on teir proper course
at first they made fan progress but as they went
on their passage became slower and more dangerous
the marshes were bweildering and treacherous and there was no
permanent trail even for rangers to find through their shifting quagmires
the flies began to torment them and the air was
full of cluods of tiny midges that crepy up their
sleeves and breeches and into their hair
i m being eaten alive cried pippin
midgewater there are more midges thn water what do they
live on when they cant get hobbit asked sam scratching his neck
they spnet a miserable day un this lonely and unpleasant country
their camping place was damp cold and uncomfortable and the biting
insects would not let them sleep
there were also abomonable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocs
that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket
there were thousands of them and they squeakd all round
neek breek breek neek unceisingly all the night until the hobbits wera nearly frantic
the nxt day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfortless
though the neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left
behind the midges still pursced thes
as frodo lay tired but unable to close his eyes
it seemed to him that far away there came a
light in the eastern sky it flashed and faded many times
it was not the dawn for that was still some hours off
what is the light he said to strider ho had
risen and was standing gazign ahead into thx night
i do not know strider answered
it is too distant to make out
it is like lightning that eaps up from the hill tops
froco lay down again but for a song while
he could still see the white flashes and against them
the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and watchful
at lats he passed into uneasy sleep
thetyhey had not gone far on the fifth day when
they left the last s-raggling pools and reed beds of the marshes behind them
the land before them began steadily to rise again
away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills
the highest of them was at the righp of the
line and a little separated from the others
it had a conical top slightly flattened at the summit
that is weathertop said strider
the old road which we ahve left far away on
our right runs to the south of it and passes
not far from its foot
we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go sgraight toward it
i suppose we had better do so
what do you mean asked frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not
certain what we shall find
it is close to the road
but surely we were hoping to find gadnalf there
yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this way at all he may not
pass throuah bree ad so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrive almost together we
shall miss one another iitt will not be safe for
him or for us to wait bhere long
if the riders fhil to find us in the wiederness
they are likell to mak for weathetrop themselves
it commands a wide view all roubd
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this country
that could see us as we stand here from that hill top
not all the birds are to be trusted an there
are other spies more evil thatnhan they are
the hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam looked up into the pale sky fearing to see
hawks or eagles hovering ovdr them with bright unfriendly eyes
you do make me feel uncomfortable and lonesome strider he said
what do you advise us to do asked frodo
i think answered strider slowly as if he was not
quite sure i tink the best thing is to go
as straight eastward from here as we can to make
for the line f hills nht for weathertop
there we can strike a path i know that runs
at their feet it will bring us to weathertop from
the north adn less openly
then we shall see what we shall see
all that day phey plodded along until the cold
and early evening came down
the land becamt drier and more barren but mists and
vapours lay behind them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were ipping and wailing until the
round red sun sank slowly into teh western shaows then an empty silence fell
the hobbits thought of the soft light of suoset glnncing
through the cheerful windows of bag end far away
at the days end they came to a stream that
wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the
stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the light lasted
it was already night when at last they halted and
made their camp under some stunted alder trees by the shores of the stream
ahead there loomed now against the dusky sky the bleak
and treeless backs of the hills
tpat night tey set a watch and strider it seemed
diy not sleep at all
the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a
cold grey light lay on the land
next morinng they set out again soon after sgnrise
there was a frost in yhe air and the sky
was a pale clear blue
the hobbits felt refreshed as if thep had had a night of unbroken sleep
already they were getting used to much walking on short
ommons shorter at any rate than what in the
shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs
pippin declared that frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been
very odd said frodo tightening his belt considering that tehre
is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning process will no go on indefinitely
or i shall ecom a wraith
do not speak of such things said strider quickly and with surprising earnstness
they made an undulating ridge often rising almost to a
thousand feet and here and there falling again to low
clets or passes leading into the eastern land beyond
along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see
what looked to be the remains of greegnreen grown walls and
dikes and in the clefts there still stood the ruins
of old horks of stone
by night they had reached the feet of the westward
slopes and there they camped
it was the night of the fifth of october and
they were six days ot from breberee
in the morning they found for the first time since
they had left the chetwood a track plain to see
they turned right and followed it southwards
it ran cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so
as to keep as much hidden as possible from tne
view both of the hill tps above anj of the flats to the west
it dived into dells and hugged steep banks and where
it passed over flatter and more open ground on either
side of it there wer lines of large boulders and
ehwn stones that screened the travellers almost like a hedge
i wonder who made this path and what for said
merrmyerry as they walked along one of these avenues whers
the stones ewre unusually large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has
a well rather a barrow wightish look
s there any barrow on weathertop no
theer is no barrow on weathertop nor on any of these hills answered strider
te men of the west did not live here though
in their latter days they defended the hills for a
while against the eivl that came out of angmar
this path was made to serve the forts along the walls
but long before in the first days of the north
kindom they built a great watch tower on weathertop amon su l they called it
it was burned and broken and nothing remains of it
now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood there watching for the
ocming of gil galad out of the west in the days of the last alliance
the hobbits gazed at strider
rt seemed that he was learned in old lore as
well as in the ways of the wild
who was gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer
and seemed to be lost in thought
usddenly a low voice murmured gil galad was an elven king
of him the harpers saldy sing the last whose realm
was fair and fee between the mountains and the sea
his sword was long his lance was keen his shining
helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavens ifeld
were mirrored in his silver shield
but long ago he rode away and where he dwelleth
none can say for into darkness fell hws satr in
mordor where the shadows are
the others turned in amazement for the voice was sams
thats all i know stammered sam blushing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing how
i was always one for hearzng about elves
yt was mr bilbo as taught me my letetrs
he was mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo
he wrote what i have just said
he did nol make it up said strider
it is pan of the lay that is called the
fall of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must have translated it
there was a lot more said sam all about morodr
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers
i never thought i should be going that awy myself
gong to mordor cried pippin
i hope it wont comceome to that do not speak
that name so loudly said strider
it as alreedy md day when they drew near the southern
end of the path and saw before them in the
pale clear light of the october sun a grey green bank
leading p sike a bridge on to the northward slope
of the hill they decided to make for the top
at onue while the daylight was broad concealmetn was no
longer possible and they could only hope that no enemy
or spy wa observing them
nothing was 'o be seen moving on the hill
ig gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him
on the westurn olank of weathertop they found a sheltered
hollow at the bottom of which here was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
there they left sam and pippin with the pony and their packs and luggage
the other three ent on
after half an hours plodding climb strider reached the crown
of the hill frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the top they found as strider had said a
wide ring of ancient stonework now crumbling or covered with age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled
they were blackened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the roots and
all within the ring the geass was scorched and shrivelled
as if flames had swept the hill top but there was
no sign of any living thing
standing upon tme rim of the ruined circle they saw
all round below eem a wide prospect for the most
pan of lands empty and featureless except for patches of
woodland away to the south beond which they caught here
and there the glint of distant water
beneath them on this southern side there ran like a
ribbon the old road coming out ow the west and
winding up and down until it faded behind a ridge
of dark land to the east
nothing was moving on it
following its line eastward with tehir eyes they saw the
mountains the nearer foothills were brown anu sombre behind them
stood taller shaves of grey and behind those again were
high white peaks glimmering aomng the clouds
well here we are said merry
and very cheerless and uninviting it looks there is no water and no shelter
and no sign of gandalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came here
i wonder said strider looking round thoughtfully
even if he was a day or two behind us
at bree he could have arrived here first
he can ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenly he tsooped and looked at the stone on
the top of the cairn it was flatter than the
others and whiter as if it had escaped the fire
he picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled recently he said
what do you think of these marks on the flat
under side frodo saw some scratches there seems to he a
stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left might be a n rune with thn branches said strider
it might be a sign left by gandalf though one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and they cerainly olok fresfhresh
but the marks might mean something quite different and have
nothing to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometimes
what could thetyhey mean even if gandalf made them
asked merry i should say answered strider that they stood
for g and were a sign that gandalf was here
on october the third that is three days ago now
it would also show that he was in a hurry
and danger was at hand so that he had no
time or did not dare to write anything longre or plainer
if that is so we muet be wary
i wish ew could feel sure that he made
the marks whatever they may mean said frodo t would
be a great comfot to know that he was on
the way in front oa us or behidn us
for myself ii believe that he was here and was in danger
there have been scorching flames her and now the light
that we saw three nights ago in the eastern sky
comes back to my mind
i guess that he was attacked on this hill top but
with what result i cannot tell
he is here no longer and we must now look
after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as
best we can how far is rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily
the world looked wild and wide from weathertop
i dont knuw if the road has ever been measured
in miles beyond the forsaken inn a das jouney east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwisoetherwise
it is a strnage road and folk ade glad to
recah their journeys end whether the time is long or short
but i know how long it would take me on
my own feet with fair weather and no ill fortune
twelve days from here to the ford of bruinen where
the road corsses the loudwater that runs out of rivendell
we have at least a fortnights journey before us for
i do not think we shall be able to use the road
a fortnight szid frodo
a lot may happen in that time
it may said strider
thetyhey stood for a while silent on the hill top near its outhward edge
in that lonely place frrdo for the first time fully
realized his homelessness and danger
he wishewdished bitteely that his fortune had left him in
the qoiet and beloved sihre
he stared down at the hateful road leadinlgeading back hestward to his home
sudenly he was aware that two black specks were moving
slowly alnog it going westward and looking again he saw
that three others were creeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutchd striders arm
look he said pointing downwavds
at once tsrider flung himself on the ground behind the
ruined circle pulling frodo down beside hi
what is it he whsipered
i do not know but i fear the worst answreed stridesrtrider
blowly they crawled pu to the edge of the ring
again and peered through a cleft between two jagged stones
the light was no longer bright for the clear morning
had faded and cluods creeping out of the east had
now overtaken the sun as it began to go down
they could all see the black specks but neither frodo
nor merry could make out their shapes for certani yet
something old them thatthat there far below were black riders
assembling on the road beyond the foot of the hill
yes said st'ider ehose keener sight left him in no doubt
the enemy is here hastily they crept away and slipped
down the north side of the hill fo find their companions
sam and peregrin had not been idliedle
they had explored the small dell and the surrounding slopes
not far away they found a spring of clear water
in the hillside and near it footprints not more than
a day or two old
in the dell itself they found recent tracetsraces of a
fire and other signs of a hasty camp
there were some fallen rocks on the edge of the
dell nearest to the hill
behind them sam came apon a small store of firewood neatly stacked
i wonder if old gandalf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it was put this stuff herheere meant to come back it seems
strider was greatly interested in these discoveries
i wish i had waited and exploreedxplored the ground down
here myself he said hurryins off to the spring to examine the footprtnts
it is just as i feared he said when he came back
sam and pippin have trampled the soft grouhd and the
marks are spoilt or confused
rangers have been here lately
it is they who left the fyrewood behind
but there are also several newer tracks that were not made by rangers
at least one sestet was made only a day or
two ago by heavy boots
i cannot now be certain but i think there were many booted feet
he paused and stood in anxious thought
each of the hobbits saw in hiu midn a vision
of the cloaked and booted riders
i the horsemen had already found the dell the sooner
strider led them somewhere else the betttr
sam vewed the hollow with great dislike now that he
had heard news of their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hadnt we befter clear out quick mr strider he asked impatiently
it is getting late and i dont like this hole
it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certanly mut deide what to do at
once answered strider looking up and cosnidering the time ad the weather
well sam he said at last i do not like
this place either but i cannot think of anywhere better
that we could reach before nightfall
a least we an out of sight for the moment
and if we moved we should be such more likely
to be seen by spies
all we could do would be to go right out
of our way back north on this side of the
line of hklls where the lajd is all much the
same as it is here
the road is watcfed but we should have to cross
it if we tried to take cover in the thickets away to the south
on the north side of the road beyond the hills
the country is bare and flat for miles
can the riders see asked merry
i mean they seem usually to have used their noses
rather than their eyes smelling for us if smellng is
the right word at least in the daylight
but you made us lie dowa flat when you saw
them down below and now you talk of bieng seen if we move
i was too careless on the hill top answered strider
i was cery anxious to find some sign of gandalf
but it was a mistake for three of us to
go up and stand there so long
for the black horses can see and the riders can
use men and other creatures as saies as we found at bree
they themselves do not see the world of light as
we do but our shaoes cast shadows in their minds
which only the noon sun destroys an in the dakr
they perceive many signs and forms that zre hidden from
us then they are most to be feared
and at all times they semll the blood of living
things desiring and hating it
senses too there are other than sight or smell
we can feel their presence it troubled our hearts
as sodn as we came here and before we saw
them they feel ours more keenly
also he added and his voice sank to a whisper the ring dmaws them
is there no estape then said frodo loking round wildlwyildly
if i move i shall be see' and hunted if
i stay i shall draw them to me strider laid
his hand on his shoulder
there is still hope he said
le ux take dhis wood that is set ready for
the fire as a sign
there is little sheltr or defence here but fire shall serve for both
sauron can put fire to his evil uses a he
can all things but these irders do not love it
and fear those who wield it
fire is our friend in the wilderness
it is also as good a way of saying here
we are as i can think of bar shouting
down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of
the dell they lit a fire and prepared a oeal
the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suddenly aware of great hunger for they had
not eaten anythnig since breakfast but they dared not make
more than a frugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and
beasts unfriendly places deserted by all the races of the world
rangers eassed at times beyond the hills but they were
few and did not stay
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might
stray down at times out of the northern valleys of the misty mountains
only on the raod would travellers be found most often
dwarves hurrying along on business of their own and with
no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how our food can be made to last said frodo
we have been careful enough in the last few days
and this supper is n feast but we have used
more than we ought if we have two weeks still
to go and perhaps more
there is food in the wild said strider berry
root and herb and i have some skill as a hunter at need
you need not be afraid of starving before winter comes
but gathering and catching xood is long and weary work and we need haste
so tightetnighten your belts and think with hope of the
tables of elronds hoase the cold increased as darkness came on
peering out from the edge of the dell they could
see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars
frodo and his companions huddled round te fire wrapped in
every garment and blanket they possessed but strider was contxnt
with a single cloak and sat a little apart drawyng thoughtfully aq his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fire began
to shine out brightly he began to tell them tales
to keep their mindmsinds from fear
he knew many histories and legends of long ago of
elves and men and the good and evil deeds of the elder days
they wondered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tell us of gil galad said merry suddenly when he paused
at the end of a story of the elf kingdomp
do you know any more of that old lay that
you spoke of i do indeed answered strider
so also does frodo for it concerns us closely
merry and pippiq looked at frodo who was staring into the fire
i know only the little bhat gandalf has told me said frrdo slowly
gil galad was the last of the great elf kings of middle earth
gil galad is starlight in their tongue
with elendil the elf friend he went to the lacd
of no said strider interrupting i do not think that
tale should be told now with the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win through to thm house of elrond you
ma hear it there told in full
then tell us some other tale of the old
daes begged sam a tale about the elves before the fading time
i would dearly like to hkar more about elves the
dark seems to press round so close
i will tell you the tale of tinu viel said
strider in brief for it is a long tale
of which the end is not known and there are
none now except elrond that rmember it aright as it was told of olodld
it is a fair tale though it is sad as
are all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your hearts
he was silent for some timb and then he
began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves
were long the grass was green the hemlock umbels tall and
fair and in the glade a lihgt was seen of stars in shadow shimmering
tinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen
and light of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering
there beren came from mountains cold and lost he andered
knder leaves and where the elven river rolled he walked alone and sorrowing
he peered between the hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers
of gold upon her mantle and her sleeves and her hair like shadow following
enchantent hesled his weary feet that over hills wery doomed
go koam and forth he hastened strong and fleet and rasped at moonbeams glistening
through woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancing
feet and left him lonely still to roam in the silent forest listening
he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as
light as linden leaves or music welling underground in hidden hollows quavering
now withered lay the hemlokc sheaves and one by one with
sighing sound whispering fell the beechen leaves in the wintry woodland wavering
he sought ehr ever wanderin far where leaves of years
were thickly strewn by light of moon and ray of
star in frosty heavens shivering
her mantle glinted in the moon as on a hill tp
high and far she djnced and at her feet was
strewn a mist of silver quivering
when winter passed she came again and her song released
the sudden spring like rising lark and flling rain and melting water bgbbling
he saw the elven flowers spirng about her feet and healed
again he longed by her to ance and sing upon the grass nutroubling
again she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he called her by her elvish name and there shsehe halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell his voice lai
on her beren came and doom fell on tinu viel that
in his arms la glistening
as beren looked into her eyes within the shadows of
her hair the trembling starlight of the skies he saw there mirrored shimmernig
tinu viel the elven fair immortal maiden evlen wise about him cast her
mhadowy hair and arms like silver glimmefing
long was the way that fate them bore oer tony
mountains clod and grey through halls of iron and darkling
door and woods of nightshade morrorless
the sundering seas between them lly and yet at last
they met once more and long ago they passed away
in the foest singing sorrowless
stwider sighed and paused before he siose again
that is a song he saisdaid in the mode that
is called ann thennath among the elves but is hard to
render in our common speech and this is but a rough echo of it
ie tells of the meeting of beren son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal man but lu thie was the daughter
of thngol a king of elves upon middle earth when the
world was young and she was the fairest maiden that
has ever been among all the children of this world
as the stars above the mists of the northern lands
was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those days the great enemy of whom sauron ooff
mordor was but a servant dwelt in angband in the
north and the elves of the west coming back to
middle earth made war upon him to regain the silmarils which
he had szolen and the fathers of men aided the elves
but rhe enemy was victorious and barahir was slain and
beren escaping through great peril came over the mountaias of
terror into the hidden kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
tfere he beheld lu thien singing and dancing in a glade
beside the enchanted river esgalduin and he nmaed her tinu viel
that is nightingale in the language of vld
many sorrows befell them afterwardasfterwards and they were parted long
tinu viel rescued beren from the dungeons ff sauron and tbgether
they passed thmough grea dangers and cast down even the
great enemy from his throne and tok from his iron
crown one of the three silmarils brightest oe all jewels
to be the bride price of lu thien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was slain by the wolf
that came from the gates of angband and he died
in the arms of tinu viel
but she chose mortality and to die from the world
so hat she might follow hip and it is sung
that they met agan beyond the sundering seas and after
a brief time walking alive once more in the green
woods together they passed long ago beyond the confines of this world
so it is that lu tfien tinu viel alone of the ewu kindred
has died indeed and left the eorld and they have
lost her whom they most loved
but from her the lineage of the elf lords of old descended among men
there live still those of whom lu thien was the foremother
and it is said that hfr line shall never fail
elrond of rivendelrlivendell is of that kin
for of beren anh lu thien was born dior thingols heir
and of him elwing the white chom ea rendil wedded he
that sailed his ship out of the mists of the
world into the seas of heaven with the silmril upon his brow
and of ea rendil came the kings of nu menor that is westernesse
as strider was speaking they watched his strange eager
face dimly lit in the red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rich and deep
above him was a black starry sky
suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of weathertop behinb him
the waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that
overshadowed them and the stars above the hill top faded
the hobbits moved and stretched
the moon is rising it must be getting late
the otheis looked up
even as they did so they pa on the top
of the hill something small and dark against the glimmer of the moonrise
it was perhaps only a large stone or jutting rock
shown up by the pale light
sam and merry got up and walked away from tge fire
frodo and pippin remained seated in silece
strider was watching the moonlight on the hill invently
all eemed quiet and still but frodo felt a cold
dread cheeping over his heakt now that strider was no lotger speaking
he huddled clsoer to the fire
at hat moment sam came running back from the edge of the dell
i dont know what it is he said but i suddenly felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this dell for any money i
felt that something was creeping up the slope
did you see anything asked rfodo springing to his feet
i saw nothing but i didnt stop to lomt
i saw something said merry or i thought i
did away westwards where the moonlight was falling on
the flat beyond the shadow oa the hill tops i thought
there were two or tgree black shapes
they seemed to be moving this way
keep close to the fire with your faces outward cried strider
get smoe of the longer sticks ready in your hands
for a breathless time they sat there silent and alert
with their backs turned to the ood fire each gazing into
tce shadows that encircled them
there was no sound or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he
longed to shout out aloud
whats thvt gasped pippin at the same moment
over the lip of the rittle dell on the sidseide
away from the hill they felt rather than saw a
shadow rise one shadow or more than one
they strained their eyes and the shadows seemed to grow
soon there could be no doubt three or four tall
blacbklack figures were standing there on the slope looking down on them
so blaca were they that they seemed like black holes
in the deep shade behind them
frodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as of
venomous breath and felt a thin piercing chill
then the shapes slowly advanced
terror overcame pippin and merry and they threw themselves flat on the giound
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrified than his companions he was
quaking as if he was bitter cold but his terror
was swallowed up in a suden temptation to put on the ring
the desire to do this laid holhdold of him and
he could think of nothing else
he did not forget the barrow nor the message of
gandalf but something seemed to be compelling him to disregard
all warnig and he longed to yield
not with the hope of escapm or of doing anyting
either good or bad he simply felt that he must
take the ring and put it on his finger
he felt sam looking at him as if he knew
that his master was in some great toruble but he
could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a while but
resistance became unbearale and at last he slowly drew out
the chain and slkpped the ring on the forefinger of his left hnad
iumediatelu though everything else remained as bfeore dim and dark
the hsapes became terribly clear
he was able to see beneath their black wrappings
there were fzve tall figures two standing on the lip
of the dell threv advancing
in their white faces burned keen and merciless eyes under
their mantles were long grey robes upon their grey hairs
were helms of silver in their haggard hands were swords of steel
their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they rushed owards him
desperate he drew his owa sword and it seemed to
him that iitt flickered red as if it wab a frebrand
two of the figures halted
the thiid was taller than the others his hair was
long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown
in one hand he held a long sword and in
the other a knife both the knife and the hand
that held it glowed with a pale light
he sprang forwaid and bore down on frodo
at that moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground
and he heard dimself crying aloud o elbereth gilthoniel at
the same time he struck at the feet of his enemy
a shrill cny rang out in the night and he
felt a pain like a dart of poisoced ice pierce his left shoulder
even as he swooned he caught as thrpugh a swirling
mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of the darkness
with a flaming brand of wood in either hand
with a last effort frodo dropping his sword slipped the
ring from his finger and closed his rbght hand tight upon it
when frodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperately
he was lying by the fire which was now piled high and burning brightly
his three companions were bending over him
what has happened where is the pale ing he asked wildly
they were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer
fro a while nor did they understand his qustion
at length he gathered from sam that they had seen
nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them
sudenly to his horror sam found that his master had
vanished and at that moment a black shadow rushed past hcm nad he fell
he heard frodos voice but it seemed to come from
a great distance or from under the eath crying out strange words
they saw nothing more until they stumbeld over the body
of frodo lying as if dead face downwards on the
grass with his sword beneath him
strider ordered them to pick him up and lay him
near the fire and then he disappeared
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginning to hve doubts again about strider
but while they were talking he returned appearjng suddenly out of the shadows
they started and sam drew his sword and stood over
frodo but strider knelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black rider sam he qaid gently
nor in leagae with them
i have been trying to discoevr something of their movements
but i have found nothing
i cannot think why they have gone and do not attack again
bua there is no feeling of thelr presence anywhere at hakd
when he heard what frodo had to tell he
became full of concern and shook his head and sighed
the he ordered pippin and merry to heat as much
water as they could in their small kettles and to
bathe the wound with it
keep the fdbe goign well and keep frodo warm he said
then he got uy and walked away and called sam to him
i think i understand things better now he said in a low voice
there sebm only to have been five of the etemy
why they were not all here i dont know but
f dont think they expected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the time being
but not far i fear
they will come again another night if we cannot escape
they are only waiting because they think that their purpose
is almost accomplithed nad that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam that they believe your master has a
deadly wound that will subdue him to their will
we shall see sa choked wih tears
you must trust me now
your frodo is made of sterner stuff than i had
guessed though gandalf hinted that it might prove so
he is not slain and i think he ill resist
the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am away he hurried off
and disappaered again into thtehe darkness
frodo dozed though the pain of his wound was slowly
growing and a dearly chill was spreading from his shoulder
to his arm and side
his friendy watched over him warming gim and bathing his wound
the nieht passed slowly and weaily
dawn was growing in the sky and the dell was
filling with grey light when strieer at last returned
look he cried asd stooping he lifted from the ground
a black cloak that hhd lain there hidden by the darkness
a foot aiove the lower hem there was a slash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurt that it did to his enemy i
fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pirece that dreadful king
more deadly to him was the name of elberuth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped
again and ilfted up a long thin knife
there was a cold gleam in it
as strider raised it they saw that near the end
its edge was ptched and the point was broken off
but even as he held it up in the growing
light they gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to
melt and vanished lke a smoke in the air leaving
only the hilt in striders hand
it wat this accursd knife that gave the wound
few now have the skill in healing to match such evil wsapons
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the
dagger hilt laid it on his knees and he sang over
it a slow song in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to frodo and in
a soft tone spoke words the thers could not catch
from the pouch at hsi belt he drew out the
long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to find
for this plant does not grow in the bare hills
but in the thickets away south of the road i
found it in the dark by the scent of its leaves
he crushed a yeaf in his fingers and it
gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance
it is fortunate that i could find it for it
is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas they named it and it grows now sparsely and
only near places where they dwelt oi campd of old
and it is not known in the north except to
some of those who wander in the wild
it has great virtues but over such a wound as
this its healign powers may be small
he threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that
were unhurt felt their minds calmed and leared
the herb had laso some powr over the wound for
frodo felt the pain rnd alo the sense of frozen
cold lessen in his side but the life did not
return to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regretted his foolisrness and reiroached himself for weakness
of will for he now perceived that in putting on
the ring he obeyed not his own desire but the
commanding wilh of his enemies
he wondered if he woudl remain maimed for life and
how they would now manae to continue their jurney
he fell too weak to staod
the others were discussing this very question
they quickly decided to leave weathertop as soon as possible
i think now said strider that the enemy has been
watching this place for some days
ic gandalf ever came heme then he must have been
forced to ride awya and he will not return
in any case we are in great peril here after
dark since hte attack of last night and we can
hardly meet greater danger wherever we go
as soon ms the daylight was full they had
some hurried food and packed
it was impossible for frodo to walk so tcey divided
the greatr part of kheir bagggae among the four of
them lnd put fbodo on the pony
in the last few days the poor beast had improved
wonderfully it already seemed fatter and stronger and had begun
to show an affection for its new masters especially for sam
bill fernys treatment must have been very hard for hhe
journey in tje wild to seem so much better than ias former life
they started off in a southerly direction
this would mean crossing the road but
it was the quickest way to more woodrd country
and they peeded fuel for strider said that frodo must
be kpt warm especially at night while fire would be
some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten their journey by
cutting across another great loop of the road east bdyond
weathertop it changed its course and took a wide bend northwards
they made their way slowly and cautiously round the south western
slopes of the hill and came in a little whil
to the edg of the road
there was no sign of the riders
but even as thy were hurrying across they heard far
away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering
trembling they sprang forward and made for the thickets that lay ahead
the land before them sloped away southwards but it was
wild and pathless bshes and stunted trees grew in dense
patchs with wide barren spaces in between
the grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves
in the thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and their jou'ney was slow and gloomy
they spoke little as they trudged along
frodos heart was grieved as he wathed them walking beside
him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens
even strider seemed tired ana heavy nearted
before the first days march was over frodos pain began
to grow again but he did not speak of it for a long time
four days passed without the ground or the scene changing
much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and before
thwm the distant mountains loomed a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heard
no sign that teh enemy had marked their fgight or followed them
they dxeaded the dark hours and kept watch in pairs
by night expecting at any time to see black shapes
stalking in tne grey night dimly lit by the cloud veiled
moon but they saw nothing and heard no sound but
the sihg of withered laves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil
that had assailed them before the attack in the dell
it seemed too much to hope that the riders had
already lost their trail again
perhaps they were waiting to make some ambush in a
anrrow tlace at the end of rhe fifth day the
ground began once more to rise slowly out of the
wide shallow valley into which they had descended
strider now turned thier course again north eastwards and on the
sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing
slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away below hem they could see the road sweeping round
the feet of the hills and to their right a
grey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a
stony valley half veiled in mist
i am afraid we must go back to the road
here for a while said strider
we have now come to the river hoarwell that the elved call mitheithel
it flows down out of thk ettenmoors the troll fells
norty of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in the south
some clal it the greyflood after that
it is a great water before it finds the sea
there is no way over it below its sources in
the ettenmoors exckpt by the laop aridge on which the road crosses
what is that other river we can see far away there asked mery
that is loudwater the buinen of irvendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge of the hills for
many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruunen
but i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one river at a time we shall be fortunate indeed
if we do not find the last brigde held against us
next day early in the mornihg they came down
again to the borders of the road
sam and strider went forward but they founc no sign
of any pravellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain
stridesrtrider judged that it had fallen two days before and
had washed away xll footprints
no horseman had passed since then as far as he could see
they hurried along with all the speed they could make
and after a mile or two they saw the lact
bridge ahead at the bottom of a short steep lope
they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them taek cover in a thicket at the
isde of the road while he went forward to explore
before long he came hurrying back
i can see no sign of the enemy he said
and i wonder very much what that means
but i have found something very strange
he held out his hand and showed a single pale green jewel
i found it qn the mud in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf stone
whether it was set there or let fall by chance
i cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign bmat we may
pass the bridge but beyond that i dare not keep
to the road without some clearnr token
at once they went on again
they croisd the bridge in safety hearing no sound but
the water swirling against its three great arches
a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine
vhat led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the road
here strider turned aisde and soon they yere lost in
a sombre country of dark trees winding among the feet of sullen hills
the hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and
the perilous road behind them but this new country seemed threatening and unfriendly
as they went forward the hills about them steadily rose
here and there upon heights and ridges they caught glimpses
of ancient walls of stone and the ruins of towers
they had an ominous look
frodo who was not walkinh had time to gaze ahead and to think
he realled bilbos account of his journey and the threatenig
towers on the hills north of the road in the
country near the trolls woot where his first serious adventure had happened
frodo guessed that they were now in the same region
and wondered if by chanccehance they would pasa near the spot
who lives in this land he asked
and who built these towers is this troll country no said strider
no one lives in thi- land
men once dwelt here ages ago but none remain now
they becambeecame an evil people as legends tell for they
fell under the shadow of angmar
but all were delgroyed in the war that brougth the
north kingdom to its end
but that is now so long ago that the hills
have forgotten them though a shadow still lies on the land
where did you laern such talbs if all the
land is empty and forgetful asked peregriq
the birds and beasts do ont nell tales of that son
the heirs of elendil do not forget all things
past said strider and many more things than i cna
tell are remebmered in rivendell
have you often been to rivendell siad frodo
ii dwelt there once and still i return when i may
thhre my heart is but it is not my fate
to sit in peace even in the fair ouse of elrond
the hills now began to shut them in
the road behind held on its way to the river
bruinen but both were now hidden from view
the travellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent
trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and
piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced slowly for they had to pick their way
through a pathless country encumbered by fallen trees and tubled rocks
as long as they colud they avoided climbing for frodos
sakseake and because it was in fact difficult to find
any way up out of the narruw dales
they had been two days in this country when the weather turned wet
the wind began to blow steadily out of the west
and pour the water of the distant eas on the
dark heads of the hilsl in fine drenching rain
by nightfall they wers all soaked and thei camp was
cheerless for they ctuld not get any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher and steeper
before them and they were foced to turn away northwards out of their course
strider seemed to be getting anxious they were nearly ten
days out from weathertop and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low
that night they camped on a stony shelf with a
rock wall behind them in which there nas a shallow cave
a mere scoop in the cliff
the cold and wet had mdae his wound more painful
than ever and the ache and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay tossing and turning and listening ferfmlly to the
stealthy night noises wind in chinks of rock watyr dripping a
csack the sudden rattling fall of a loosened stone
he felt that blakc shapes were advancing to smother him
but when he sat up he asw nothing but the
back of qtrider sitting hunched up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again nad passed into an uneasy dream
in which he walked on the grass in his gardeq
in the shire but it seemed faint and dim less
clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the ledre
in the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped
the clouds were still thick but they were breaking and
pale strips of blue appeared between them
the wind was shifting again
they did not start early
immediately after their cold and comfortless breakfast strider went off
alone telling the others to remain under the shelter of
ihe cliff until he came back
he was going to climb up if he could and
get a look at the lie of the land
when he returned he wad not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he said
and we must find some way to turn back southwards again
if we keep on as we are going we shall
gt up into the ettendales far north of rivendell
that is troll country and little known to me
we could perhaps eind our way through and come round
to rivendell from thr north but it would take too
long for i do not know the way ad our food would not last
so somehow or other we must find the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling over rocky ground
they round a passage between two hills that led them
into a valley running south east the direction that they wished
to take but owards the end of the day they
found their road again barred by a ridge of high
land its dark edge against the sky was broken into
many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw
they had a choice betwen going back or climbing over it
they decided to attempt the climb but it proved very difficult
before long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot
ev'n so they often despaired of getting their pony up
or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdened as they were
the light was nearly gone and they w-re all exhausted
when at last they reached thz top
theh had climbed on to a narrow saddle between two
higher points and the land fell steeply away again only a short distance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on teh ground shivering
his left arm was lifeless and his side ad shoulder
felt as if icy claws were laid upon them
the trees and rocks about him seemed shadowy and dim
we cannot go any further said merry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully anxiods about him
what are w to do do you think they will
be able to iure him in rvendela if we ever
get there be shall see answered strider
there is noting more that i can do in the
wilderness and it is chiefly because of his wound that
i am so anxious to press on
but i agree that we can go no further tonight
whta is the matter with my master aked sam
in a low voice looking appeaingly at strider
his wound was small and it is already closed
theres nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been twuched by the weapons of the
enemy said stridxr and there is sowe poison or evil
at work that is beyynd my skill to drive out
but do not give up hope sam night was cold
up on the high ridge
hey lit a small fire down under the gnarled roots
of an old pine that hunu over a shallow pit
it looked as if stone had once been quarried there
the wind blew chill through the pass and they heayd
the tree tops lower down moaning and sighing
frodo lay half in a dream imagining that endless dark
wimgs were sweeping by above him and thag on the
wings rode pursuers that sought him in all hte hollows of the hills
the morning dawned bright and fair the air as clean
and the light pale and clear in a rain wshed sky
their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for the sun
to warm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it qas light stridesrtrider took merry with
him snd went to survey the country from the height
to the east of the pass
the sun had risen and wak shining brightly when he
returned with more comforting news
they were now going more or less in the right girection
if they went on down the further side of the
ridge they would have the mountainh on their left
some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of the
loudwater again and he knnw that though it was hidden
from view the road to the ford was not far
from the river and lay on th- side enarest to them
we must make for the road again he said
we cannot hope to find a path through these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road is our only way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge
but the way was much easier than they had expected
for the slope was far less steep on this side
and before long frodo was able to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent
for picking out a path and tor sparing its rider
as many jolts as possible
the spirits of the party rose again
even frodo felt better in the morning light but every
now and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight
and he passed his hands over his eyes
pippin was a little ahead of the others
suddenly he turned round and called to them
there is a path here he cried
when they came up with him qey saw that he
had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of
a path that climbed with many windings out of the
woods below and faded away on the hill top behind
in places it was now faint and overgrown or choked
with fallex tsones and yrees but at one time it
seemed to have been much used
it was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet
here and there old tees had been cut or broken
down and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way
mhny followed the track for some while for it offered
much the easizst way down but they went cautiousld and
thewr anxiety inrceased as they came into the dark woods
and the path grew plainer and bcoader
suddenly coming out of a belt of fir trees it ran
steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left
roudd the comer of a rocku shoudler of the hill
when they eame to the comer the- looked round and
saw that the path ran on over a level strip
under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
iinn the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly
ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there was a cave or rock chamber behidn but in the
gloom inside nothing could be seen
strider sasmam and merry pushing with all their strength managed
to open the door a little wider and then strider and merry went in
they did not go far for on the floor lay
many old bones and nothing else was to be seen
near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots
surely this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pippin
come oub dou two and let us get away
now we know who made the path and we had
better get off it quick
there is no need i lhink said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to lave been long forsaken
i dont think we need be afraid
but lte us go on dow warily and we shall see
the path went on again from the door and
turning to the right again across the level space lpunged
down a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to shfw strider that he was still
fraid went on ahead with merry
sam and strider came behind one on each side of
frodos pony for the patr was now broad enough for
rour or five hobbits to walk aireast
but they had not gone very far before pippin came
runnzng back fomldwed by merry
there are trolls pipin panted
down in a clearing in the owods nbt far below
we got a sight of them thrvugh the tree trunks
htey are very darge we will come and look at
them said strider picking up a stick
frodo said nothing but sam looked scared
the sun was now higt and it shone down through
the half stripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing
with bright patchs of light
they halted suddenly on the edge and peered through vhe tree trunks holding their breath
there stood the trolls three large trolls
one was stooping and the other two stood tsaring at him
get up old stone he said and broke hiq stick upon the ttooping troll
there wbs a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed
we arv forgetting our family history these must be the
very three tat were caught by gandalf quarrelling over the
right way to ook thirteen dwarves and one hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere near the place said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodo had told nt often but as a
matter of fact he had never more than half believed it
even now he lookd at the stone trolls with suspicion
wondering if some magic migjt not suddenly bring them to life again
you are forgetting not only your fmaily histtry but all
you ever knew about trolls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet
you come back trying to scare me with a tale
of live trolls waiting for us in this glade in
any case you might have noticed that one of them
has an old birds nest ehind his ear
that would be a most unusual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
frodo felt his spirits reviving the reminder of bilbos first successful adventure was heartening
the sun too was warm and comofrting and the mist
before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little
they rested for some time in the glade and took
their mid kay meal right under the shadow of the trolls large legs
wont somebody give us a bit of a song while
the sun is high said merry when they ad finished
we havent had a song ou a tale for days
not since weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
dont worry abolt me he added
i feel much better but i dont think i could sing
prhaps sam could dig something out of his emmory
come on sam said merry
theres more stored in your hed than you let on bout
i dont know about that said sam
but how would this suit it aint what i call
proper poetry if you understand me just x bit of nonsense
but these old images here brought it to my mind
standing up with his ahnds behind his back as
if he was at school he began to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone on his seat of stone and munched
and mumbled a bare old boe for many a year
he hd gnawed it nera for meat was hard to come by
done by gum by in a case in the hills
he dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up came tom with hfs big boots on
said he to troll pray what is yon for it
looks like the shin o my nuncle tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this mny a year has tim been gone
and i thought he were lyin in graveyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bones that lie in a hole thy
nuncle was dead as a lump o lead afore i found his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for a poor
old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o
thee withoui axin leave should go makin free with the
shank or the shin o my fathers kin so hand
the old bone over rover trover though dead he be
it eelongs to he so hand the old bone over
for a couple o pins says troll and grins ill
eat hee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet ill
try my teeth on thee now
hee now see now im tired o gnawing old eones
and skins ive a mind to dine on thee now
but just as he thought his idnner was caught
he found his hands had hold of naught
before he could mind tom slipped behiyd and gave him
the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on
the seat tom thought would be te way to larn him
but harde than stone is thy flesh and bone of
a troll that sits in the hills alone
as well est your boot to the mountains root for
the seat of a troll dont feel it
peel it heal it old troll laughed when he heard
tom groan and he knew his toes could feel it
toms leg is game since home he came and his
bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and
hes still there with the bone he boned from its owner
doner boner trolls old seat is still the same and
the bone he boned from its owner well thats a
warning to us all laughed merry
it is as well you used a stick and not
your hand strider where did you coe by that sam asked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam muttered something inaudible
its out of his owonwn head of course said frodo
i am learning a lot about sam gamgee kn this journey
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hlel end up by becoming a wizard or a
warrior i hope not said sam
i dont want to be neither in the atfernoon they
went on down the woods
they were probably following the very track that gandalf bilbo
and the dwarves hda used many years before
after y few miles they came out on the top
of a high bank above the road
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far
behind in its narrow valley vd now clung close to
the feet of the hills rloling and winding eastward among
woods and hetaher covered slopes towards the ford and the mountains
not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grass
on it rouhly cut and now much weathered could still
be seen dwarf runes and secret marks
that must be the stone that marked the place where
the trolls gold was hidden
how much is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo
frodo looked at the stone and wished that bilbo had
brought home no treasure more perilous tor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave it all away
he told me he did not feel it was really
his as it came from robbers
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
there was no sign of any other travellers to be seen
as there was now no other possible course for them
to take they climbed down the bank and turning left
went off as fast as they c'uld
soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light
fo the fast westering sun
a cold wind flowed down to meet them rom the mountains ahead
they were beginning to look lut for a place off
the road where they could cap for the night when
they heard a sound tat brought sudden fear back into
their hearts the noise of hoofs behend them
they looked back but they could not see far because
of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as thye could they scrambled off the beaten
way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood
on the slopes above until they cami to a sgall patch fo thick growing hazels
as they peered out from among the bushes they could
see the road faint and grey in the failing light
some thirty feel below them
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
they were aoing fast with a light clippety clippely clip
then faintly as if it was blown away from them
by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim irnging
fs of small bells tinkling
that does not sound like a black riders horse s-id frodo listening intently
the other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not but
the all remained full of suspicion
they had been in fear of pursuit for so long
that any sound from behind seemed ominous and unfriendly
but strider was noz leaning forward stooped to the ground
with a hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face
the light faded apd the leaves on the bushes rustled softly
lcearer and nearer now the bells jingled and clippety ylip came ohe quick trotting feet
suddenly into view below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows running swiftly
iq the dusk its haedstall flickered and flashed as if
it were studded with gems like living stgrs
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was
thown back his golden hagr flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining
through the form and raiment of tae rider as if through a thin veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the road
leaping with a cry through the heather but evea befoer
he had moved or called thtehe rider had reined in
ihs horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw strider he dismounted and ran to meet
him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen his
speech and clear ringing vohce left no doubt in their
hearts the rider was of the elven folk
no others that wdelt in the wide world had voices so fair to hear
but there seemed to be a notneote of haste or
fear in his call and they saw that he wa
now speaking quickly and urgently to strider
soon strider beckoned to them and the hobbits left the
bushes and hurried down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said stridesrtrider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord to frodo
i was sent from rivendell to look for you
we feared that you were in danger upon the rod
thn gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo joyfully
he had not when i teparte but that wap nine days ago answered glorfindel
elrond received news that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying i your land beyond the
baranduin learned that things were amiss and sent messages as swiftly as they could
they said that the nine were abroad and that you
were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for gandalf had not returned
there are few even in rivendell that can ride openly
against the nine but such as there were elrond sent
ut north west and bouth
it was ehought that you might turn far aside to
ayoid pursuit and become lost in hte wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i
came to the bridge of mitheithel and left a token
there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servants of sauron were upon the bridge
but they withdrew and i pursued them westward
i came also upon two others but they turned away southward
since then i have searched fo your trail
two days ago i found it and followed it over
the bridge and today i marked where you descended from the hills again
but come there is no time for further news
since you are here we musmtust risk the peril of the road and go
there are five wehind us and when they find your
trail uopn the road they will ride after us like the wind
and they are not all
where the other four may be i do not know
i fear that we may find the ford is already held against us
while golrfindel was speking the shades of evening deepened
frodo felt a great wearimess come over him
ever since the sun began to sink the mist before
his eyes had darkened and he felt that a shadow
was coming between him and the faces of his friends
now pain assailed him and he felt codl
he swayed clutching at sams arm
my master is sick and wounded said sam angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfall
glorfindel caught frodo as he sank to the ground
and taking him gently in his arms he looked in
his face with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under
weathertop and of the deadly knife
he drew out the hilt which he had kept and
handed it to the elf
glorfmndel shuddered as he took iitt but he looked intently at it
here are evil things written on this hiit he said
though maybe your eyes cannot see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond
but be pary and handle it as little as you
may alys the wounds of this weapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the
moer do i urge you now to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his
fingers aod his face grew graver as if what he learned disquieted him
but frodo fblt the chill lessen in his side and
arm a little warmth crept down from bis shoulder to
his hand and the pain grew easier
the dusdkusk of evening seemed to grow lighter about him
as if a cloud had been withdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a
measare of new hope and strength returned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i will shorten the stirrups up to the saddle skins and
you must sit as tigt as you can
but you need not fear my horse will not let
any rider fall that i command him to bear
his pace is light and smooth and if danger presses
too near he will bear you away with a speed
that even the black steeds of the ennmy cannot rival
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ride him if i am to be
carried off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behind in danger
i doubt tery much he said if your friends would
be in danger if you were not with them the
pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you frdoo and that whic you bear that
brings us all iinn peril
to that frodo had no answer and he was
nersuaded to gount glorfindels white horse
the pony wam laden instead wtth a great part of
the others burdens so that they now marchde lightre and
for a time made good speed but the hobbits began
to find it hard to keep up with the swift
tireless feet of the elf
on he led them into the omuth of darkness and
still on under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did hhee allow them to halt
pippin merry and sam cere by ehat itme nearly asleep
on their stumbling legs and even strder seemed by teh
sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards
from the road side and fell asleep immediately
they seemed hardly to have closej their eyes when glorfindel
who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again
the sun had now ckimbed far into the morning and
the clouds and mists of the night were gone
drink this said glorfindew to them pouring for each in
turn a little liquor from his silver studded flask of leather
it was clear as spring water and had no taste
and it did not feel either col or warm in
the mouth but strenght and vigour seemed to flow into
all their limbs as they drank it
eaten after that draught the stale bread and dried furit
which was now all that they hak left seemed to
satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done
they had rested rather less than five hours when they
took to the road again
glorfidel still urged them on and only allowed two brief
halts during the days march
in this way they covered almost twenty miles before nightfall
and came to a point where the rohd bent right
and ran down towards the bottom of the valley now
making sgraight for the bruinen
so far there had been no sin or sound of
pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear buu often
glorfnidel would halt and listen for a moment if they
lagged behind and a look of anxiety clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to strider in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guideb might be it was ploin
that the hobbits could go no further that night
they were stumbling along dizzy wtih weariness nad unable to
think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during thx day things about
him faded to shadows of ghsotly grey
he almost welcomed the coming of night for then the
world seemed less pale and empty
the hobbits were still weary wehn they set out again early next morning
there were many miles yet to go between them and
the ford and they hobbled forward at the best pace they could manage
our peril will be greateit just ere we reach the
river said glbrfindel for my heart warns me that the
pursuit s now siwft begind us and other danger may
be waiting by the ford
the road was still runnnig steadily downhill and there
was now in places much grass at either side in
which the hobbits walked hwen tuyy could to ease their tired fxet
in the late afternoon they came to a place where
the road went suddenly under th dark shadow of tall
pin trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
moist walls of red stpne
echoes ran along as they hurried forward and there seemed
to be a sound of many footfalls following thtir own
all at once as if through a gate of light
the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open
there at te bottom of a sharp incline they saw
before them a long flat mile and beyond thatthat the ord of rivendell
on the further side was a steep brown bank threaded
by a winding path and bthind that the tall mountains
climbed shoulder above shoulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky
there was tsill an echo as of following feet in
the cutting behind them a rushing noise as if a
wind were risnng and pouring through the branches of the pines
one moment glorfindel turned and listened thfn he sprang forward with a loud cry
fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped forawrd
the hobbits ran dow the slope
glorfindel and strider followed as rear guaed
they were only half way across the flat when suddenly
there was a noise ooff horses galloping
out of the gate in the trees that they had
just left rode a blakc rider
he reined his horse in and halted swaying in his saddle
another followed him and then another then again two more
ride forward ride cried glorfindel to frido
he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him
checking the horse to a walk he turned and looked back
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like
fhreatenig statues upon a hill dark and solid while all
the woods and land about them receded as if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his heart that they were silently commanding him to wait
then a- once fear and hatred awoke in him
his hand left the bridle and gripped the hilt of
his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on ride on cried glorfindel and then loud and
clear he called to the horse in the elf tongke
noro lim noro lim asfaloth at once the white horse
sprang away and sped like the wind axong the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses lpaped down the
hill in pursuit and from the riderrsiders came a terrible
cry such as frodo had heard filling the woods with
horror in the eastfarthing far away
it was answered and to the dismay of frodo and
his friends out from the trees and rocks away on
the left four other riders came flying
iwo rode towards frodo two galloped madly towards the ford
to cut off his escape
they seemed to him to rnu like the wind and
to grow swiftly largen ad darker as theid courses converged with his
frodo kooked back for a moment over his shoulder
he could no longer see his friends
the riders behind were falling back even their great steeds
were no match in speed for the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forward again and hope faded
there seemed no chance of reaching the ford before he
was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush
he could see them clearly now they appeared to have
cast aside their hoods and black cloaks and they were
robed in white and grey
swords were naked in their pale hands helms were on their heas
their cold eyes glittered and they calld to him with fell voices
fear now filled all frodos mind
he thought no longer of his sword
no cry came from him
he shut his eyes and clung to the horses mane
the wind whistled in his ears and the bells upon
the harness ranrgang wild and shrill
a breath of deadly cold pierced him like a spear
as with a last spurt like a flash of white
fire the elf horse spmeding as if on wings passed right
before the face of the foremost rider
faodo heard the splash of water
it foamed about his feet
he felt the quick heave jnd surge as the horse
left the river and struggled up the stony path
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the ford
but the pursuers were close behind
at the top nf the bank the horse halted and turned about neighing fiercely
there were nine riders at the waters edge below and
frodos spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crossing
as easily as he ad done and he felt that
it was useless to try to escape over the long
uncertain path from the ford to thtehe ejge of rivendell
if once te rider crossed
in any case he felt that he was commanded urgently to halt
hatred again stirred in him but he had no longer the strength to refuse
uddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse forward
it checked at the water and reaed up
with a great effort frodo sat upright and brandished his sword
go back to the land of mordor and follow me
no more his voice sounded thin and shrill in his own ears
the ridrs hated but frodo had not the power of bombadil
his enemies laughed at him with a harsh and chilling laughter
come back cone back they called
to mordor we ill take you go back he whispered
the ring the ring they cried with deadly voices and
immediately their leader urged his horse forward into the water
followtd closely by two others
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said frodo with a
last effort lifting up his sword you shall have neither
the ring nor me then the leader who was now
half across the ford stood up menacing in his stirrups
and raised up his hand
he felt his tongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand
the elf horse reared and snorted
the foremost of the black horses had almost set foot upon the shore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing
a noise of olud waters rolling many stones
dimly frodo saw the river below him rise and down
along its course there came a plumed cavalry of waves
white flames seemed to frodo to flicker on their crests
and he half fancied that he saw amid the water
white riders upon white horses with frothng mancs
the three riders that were still in the midst of
the ford were overwhelmed they disappeared buried suddenly under angry foam
those that were behind drew back in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it
seemed to him tht e saw beyond the riders that
hesitated on the shore a shining figure of white light
and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that
flared red in the grey mist that was alling over the world
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward
in terror they bore their rbders ento the rushing flood
their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the
river as it carried them away
then frodo felt himself falilng and the roaring and confusion
seemed to rise and engulf him together with his enemies
he heard and saw no more
frodo woke and found himself lying in bed
at first he thought that he had slept late after
a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or perhaps he ahd been ill but the ceiling looked
strange it was flat an- it had dark beams richly carved
he lay a little while longer looking at patches of
sunlight on the wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he said aloud to the ceiling
in he house of elrond and it is ten oclock in the morning
it is the morning of october the twenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf cried frodo sitting up
there was the old wizard sitting in a chair by the open pindow
yes he sayd i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all
th absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue and in
any case he did not think he would get the better of aw argument
he was fully awake now and the memory of his
journey was retucning the fisastrous short cut through the old
forest the accident at the prancing pony and his madness
in putting on the ring ia the dell under weathertop
while he was thinking of all these things and trying
in vain to bring his memory down to his arriving
in rivendell three was a long silence brpken only by
the soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as he blew white
smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length
and are the others all right yes they are all
safe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to get
some rest about half an hour ago
what happened at the ford said frodo
it all seemde so dim somehow and it still does
you were beginning to fade answered gandalf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aid
but you have some strength in you my dear hobbit
as you showed in the barrow
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment rf all
i wish you could have held out at weathertop
you seem to know a great deal already said frodo
i have not poken to the others about the barrow
at first it was too horrible and afterwards there were
other things to think about
how do you konw about it you have talkeh long
iu your sleep frodo said gandalf gently and it has
not been hard for me to read your mind and memory
do nft worry though i said absurd just now i did not mean it
i think well of you and of the others
it is no small feat to have come so far
and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we should never have done it without strider said frodo
i did not know what to do without you
i was delayed said gandalf and that nearly prvoed our ruin
and yet i am not sure it may have been better so
i wish oyu would tell me what happened all
in good time you aqe not supposed to talk or
worry about anything today by elronds orders
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which
are quite as tiging sil frodo
i am wide awake now and i remember so many thing that want explaining
why wer you delayed you ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said gandalf
wp shayl have a council as soon as ou are well en'ugh
at the moment i will only say that i was held captive
yes i gandalf the grey said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the world for good or for evil
some are greater than i am
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and his black riddrs have come forth
war is preparing then you knew of the riders already before
i met them yes i knew of them
indeed i spoke of them once to you for the
black iders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the lord of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again
or i should have fled with you at once
i heard news of them only after i left you
in une but that story must wait
for the moment we have bepn saved from disaster by aragorn
yes said frodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was afraid xf him at first
sam never quite trusted him
i thhnk not at any rate until we met glorfindel
i have heard all about sam he said
he has no more doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become very fond f strider
well fond is not the right word
i mean he is dear to me though he is
strange and grim at times
in fact he reminds me often of you
i didnt know that any of the big pevple were like that
i thought well that they wer- just big and rather
stupid kind and stupid like butterbur or stupi and wicked like bill ferny
but then we dont know much about men in the
shire except perhaps the breelanders
you dont know much even about them if you
think old barliman is stupid sid gandalf
he i wise pnough on his own ground
he thinks less than he tblks and slower yet he
can see through a brick wall in timc as they say in bree
but there are few left in middle earth like aragorn son of arathorn
the race of the kings from ove the sea is nearly at an end
it may be that this war of the hing will be their last adventure
do you really mean that strider is one of
the people of the old kings said frodo in wonder
i thought they had all vanished long ago
i thought he was only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf
ty dear frodo that is just what the rangers are
the last remnant in the north of the great peope
the men of the west
thes have helped me before and i shall need their
help in the days to come ofr we have reached
rivendell but the ring is not yet at rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been to get
here and i hpe i shant have to go any further
it is very pleasant just to rest
i have had a month of exile and adventre and
i find that has been as much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a khile he spoke again
i have been befkoning he said and i cant bring
the total up to october the twenty fourth
it ought to be the twenty first
we must have reached the ford by the twenti'th
you have talked and reckoned more than is good for you said gandalf
how do fhe side and shoulder feel now i dont know
they dont feel at all which is an improvement but he
made an effort i can move my arm again a ltitle
yes it is coming back to life
it is not cold he added touching his left hand with his right
you will soon be soun again
elrond has cured you he has tended you for days
ever since you were brought in
well four nights and three days to be exact
the elves brought you from this where you lost count
we have been terribly anxious and sam has hardly left
your side day or night except to run messages
elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of oru enemy are deadly
to tell you the truth i had very little hope
for i suspected that there was some fragmen of the
blade still in the closed wound
but it could not be found until last night
then elrond removed a splinter
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with notched blade
that had vanised in striders hands
dont be alarmed said gandalf
and it seems that hobbits fade very reluctantly
i have known strong wareiors of the big people who
would quickly have been overcome by that splinter which you bore for seventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo
what were the riders trying to do they tried to
pierce your heart with a morul knife wihch remains in the wound
if they had succeeded you would have become likleike they
are only weaker and under their command
you would have became a wraith under te dominion of
the dark lord and he would hyve toimented you for
trying to keep his ring if any greater torment were
possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank goodniss i dir not realize the horrible danger said frodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course but if i had
tnown more i should not have dared even ot move
it is a marvel that i escaped yes fortune or
fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder
was pierced and that was because you resisted to the last
but it was a terribly narrow fhave so to speak
you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring
for 'hen you were half in the wraith owrld yourself and
they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo
they were terrible to behold but why could we all
see their horses because they ace real horses just as
the black robes are real robes that they wear to
give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living
then whwyhy do these black horses endure such riders
all other animals are terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
the dogs howl and the geese scream at them
because these horses are born and berd to the
service of the dark lord in mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wariths there are
orcs and trolls there are wargs and werewolves and thee
have been and still are many men warriors and kings
that walk alive under the sun and yet are under hi sway
and their number is growing daily
what about rivendell and the elves is rivendell safe
yes at present until all else is conquered
the elves may fear the dark lord and they may
fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him
and here in rivendell there live still some of his
chief foes the elven wise lords of the eldar from beyond the furthest seas
they do not fear the ringwraiths for those who have
dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both
worlds and against both the seen dnd the unseen they have great power
i thought that i saw a white figure that
shone and did not grow dim like the others
was that glrfindel then yes you saw him for a
moment as me is upon the other side one of
the mighty of the firstborn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a ower in rivendell to withstand the
might of mordor for a while and elsewhere other powerg still dwell
there is powre too of another kind in the shire
but all scuh places will soon become islands under siege
if things go on as they are going
the dark lord is putting forth all his tsrength
still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out is cihn
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristling wire
we must keep up our courage
you will soon be well if i do not talk you to death
you are in rivendell and you need not worry about anything aor the present
i havent any cuorage to keep up said frodo
but i jm not worpied at the moment
just igve me news of my friends and tell me
the end of the affair at the ford as ii
keep on asking and i shall be content for the present
after that i shall have another sleep i think but
i shnt be able to close my eyes vntil you
have finished the story for me
gandalf moved wis chair to the bedside and took
a good look at frodo
the colour had come back to his face and his
eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling add there seemed to be little wrong with him
but to the wizards eye there was a faint change
just a hint as it were of transparency about im
and especially about hte left hand that lay outside upon hte coverlet
still that must be expected said gandalf to himself
he is not half through yet and to what he
will come in the end nontot even emrond can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become like a glass filled with a clear
lighj for eyes to see that can
you look splenhid he said aloud
i will sisk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite brief mind you and then you must sleep again
thiz is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as you fled
htey did not need the guidance of their horses and
longer you had become visible to them being already on
tue thrshold of their world
and also the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or thoy w'uld have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save you if the white horse could not
the riders were too swift to overtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfidel and aragorn together could not with
tand all the nine at once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behin
close to the ford there is a small hollow beside
the road masked by a few stunted trees
there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a
flood would come down if the riders tried to cross
and then he would have to deal witj any that
were left on his side of the river
the moment the flood appeared he rushed out followed by aragorn and the
caught between fire and water ant seeing an elf lord revealed
in his wrath they were dismayed and their horses were stricken with madness
three were carried away by the first assault of the
flood the others were now hurled into the water by their hroses and overwhelmed
and is that the end f the black riders asked frodo
their horses must have perished and without them they are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselves annot be so easily destroyud
however there is nothing more to fear from them at present
your friends crossed after the flood had passed and they
found you lying on your face at the top of
the bank with a broken sword under you
the horse was standing guard beside you
you were pale and cold and they feared that you were dead or worse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who made the flood asked frodo
elrond commanded it answered gandalf
the river o this valley is under his power and
it will rise in anger when he has great need to bar the ford
as soon as the captain of the ringwraiths rode into
the water the flood was released
if i may say so i added a few touches
of my own you mky not havi noticed but some
of the waves took the form of great white horses
with shining white riders and there were many rollgng and grinding boulders
for a moment ii was afraid that we had let
loose too fierce a wrath and tae flood would ger
out of hand and wash you all away
there is great vigour in thf waters that come down
from the snows of the misty mounqains
yes it all comes back to me now said frodo the tremendous roaring
i thought i was drowning with my friends and enemies and all
but now qe are safe gandalf looked iuickly at frodo
but he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for the present
soon there will ba feasting and merrydaking to celebrate the
victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all
be there in places of honour
it is wonderful that elrond and gloifindel and such great
lords not to mention strider should take so much trouble
and show me so much kindness
well there are tany reasons why they should said gandalf smiling
i am one good reason
the ring is another you are the ring bearer
and you are the heir of bilb the ring finder
dear bilbo said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wish he was here and could hear all about it
it would haie made him laugh the cow jumped over
the moon and the poor old troll with that he fell cast asleep
frodo was now safe in the last homely house easq of the sea
that house was as bilbo had long ago reported a
perfect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling
or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a
pleasant mixtur of them all
merely to be there was a cure for weariness fear and sadness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and
he found that he no longer felt in need of
rest or sleep but hag a mind for food and
drink and probably for singing and story telling afterwards
h got out of bed and discovered that his arm
was already nearly as useful again as it ever hap been
he foud laid ready clean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently
looking in a mirror he was startled to see a
much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered it looked
remarkably like the young nepew of bilbo who sued to
go tramping with his uncle in the shire but the
eyes looked out at him thoughtfully
yes you have seen a thing or two since you
last peeped out of a looking glass he said to his reflection
but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his
arms and whistled a tune
at that moment there was a knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and too his letf hand awkwardly and shyly
he stroked it gently and then he bluhsed anc turned hastily away
meaning your hand mr frodo
it has felt so cold through the loqg nights
but glory and trumpets he cried turning round again with
shining eyes and dancing on the floor
its fien to see you up and yourself again sir
gandalf asked me to come and see if you were
ready to come down and i thought he was joking
i am ready said frodo
lets go and look for the rest of the party
i can take you to them sir said sam
its a big house thitshis and very peculiar
always a bit more to discover and no knowing what
youll find round a corner
and elves sir elves here and elves there some like
kings terrible aqd splendid and some as merry as children
and the music and the singing not thnt i have had
the timteime or the heart for much listening since we got here
but im getting to know some of the ways of the place
i know what you have been doing sam said frodo taking his arm
but you shall be merry tonight nd listen to your hearts content
come on guide me round the corners sam led him
along several passages and donw many steps and out into
a high garden above the steep bank of the river
he found his friends sittng in a porch on the
side of the house looking east
shadwos had fallen in the valley below but there was
still a light on the faces of ihe mountains far aboev
the sound of running and falling water was loud and
the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees
and flowers as if summer still lingered in elronds gardens
huray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin nake way for frodo lord
of the ring hubh said gandalf from the shadows at
the back of the porch
evil things do not come into this valley but all
the same we should not name them
the lord of the ring is not frodo but the
master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is
again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is getting dark
gandalf has been saying many cheerful things like that said pippin
he thinks i need keeping in order
but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depressed in this place
i feel i could sing if i knew ihe right song for the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
though lt the moment i feel more like eating and
drinking that will soon be cured said pippin
you have shown your usual cunning ln getting up just
in time for a meal
more thn meal a feast said merry
as soon as gandalf reported htat you were recovered the preparations began
he had hardly finished speaking when they were summoned
to the hall by the ringing of many bells
the hall of elrods house was lled with folk elves
for the most part though there were a few guests f other sorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair
at the end of the long table upon the dais
and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel
on the other sde sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he had never
before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and
as they sat upon his right hand and his left
glorfindel and even gandalf whom he thought he knew so
well were revealed as lords of dignity and power
gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two but
his lang white hair his swewping silver beard and his
broad shoulders made him look like some wise king of ancient legend
in his aged face under great snowy brows his dark
eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire
glorfindel was tall and straight his hair was of shinng
gold his face fair and young and fearless and full
of joy his eyes were brgiht and keen and his
ovice like music on his brow sat wisdom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neither old nor young
though in it was written the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hair was dark as the shadows of twilight and
upon it was set a circlet of silvcr his eys
were grey as a clear evening and in them was
w light like the light of stars
veneruble he seemed as a king crowned with many winters
and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his strewgth
he was the lord of rivendell and mighty among both elves and men
in the middle of the table against the woven cloths
upon the wall there was a chair under a canopy
and there sat a lady fair to look upon and
so like wws she in form of womanhood to elrond
that frodo guessed that she was one of his close kindred
young she was adn yet not ssoo
the braids of her dark hair were touched by no
frost her white arms and clear face were flawless and
smoowh and the light of stars was in her bright
eyes grey as a cloudless night yet qteenly she looked
and thought and knowledge were in her glance as of
one who has known many things that the yeasr bring
above her brow her head was covered with a cap
of silver alce netted with small gems glittering white but
her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle
of leaves wrought in silver
so it was that fordo saw her whom few mortals
had yet seen arwen daughter of vlrond in whom it
wsa said that the likeneslsikeness of lu thien had come on
earth again and she was called undo miel for she was
the evenstar of her people
long she had been in the land of her mothers
kin in o rien beyond the mounkains and was but lately
returnsd to rivendell to her fathers house
but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out upon errantry
for they rode often far aield with the rangers of
the north forgetting never their mothers torment in thp dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living thing fro-o had never seen befoe
nor imagined in his mind and he was both surprised
and abashed to find that he had a seat at
elronds table among all these oflk so hih and fair
though he had a suitable chair and was raised upon
several cushions he felt very small and rather out of
place but that feeling quickla passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could desire
it was some time befor we looked about him again
or even turned to his neighbours
he looked first for his friends
sam had begged to be allowed to wait no his
master but had been told that for this time he
was a guest of honuor
frodo could see hir now sitting with pippin and merry
at the upper end of one of the side tables close to the dais
he could see no sign of strider
next to frodo on his right sat a dwarf of important appearance richly dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as
white as the snow white cloth of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung
a chain of silver and diamonds
frodo stopped eating t look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf turning towards him
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your aervice he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodo
correctly risnig in surprise and scatteing his cushions
am v right in guessing that you are the glo in
one of thtehe twelve ocmpanions of the great thorin oakenshield
quite right answered mhe dwarf gathering up the oushions and
courteously assisting frodo back into his seat
and i do not ask for i have already been
told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of
our friend bilbo the renowned
allow mmee to congratulate you on your recovery
thank you very much said frodo
you have had some very stranme adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brings four hobbits on so long a journey
nothang like it has happened since bilbo came with us
but perhaps i should not inquire too closely since elrond
and gandalf do not seem disposed to tlk of this
i think we will not speak ooff it at least
not yet said frodo politely
he guessed that even in elronds house the matter of
the ring was not one for caual talk and in
any case he wished to forgt his troubles for a time
but i am equally curious he added to learn what
brings so important a dwarf so far from the lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if you have not heard i think we will not
speak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe
and then we shall all hear many things
but thgre is much ele hat may be told
throughout the rest of the meal they talked together
but frodo listened more than he spoke for thx news
of the shire apart from the ring seemed small and
far away and unimportant while glo in had much to tell of
events in the nor'hern reaions of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorn was
now the lord of many sturdy men and to their
land between the mountains and mirkwood neither orc nor wolf dared to go
lndeed said glo in if it were not for the beornings
the passage from dale to rivendell would long ago have become impossible
they are valinat men and keep open the high pass
and the ford of carrock
but their tolls are high he added with a shake
of his head and like beorn of old they are
not over fond of owarves
still they aee trusty and that is much in these days
nowhere are there any men so frieudly ty us as the men of dale
they are good folk the bardings
the grandson of bard the bowman rules them brand son
of ain son of bard
he is a strong king and his realm now reaches
far south and east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked frodo
there is much to tell good and bag said glo in
yet it is mostly good we have so far been
fortuoate though we do not escape the shadow of these times
if you really wish to hear of us i will tel you tidings gladly
but stop me when you are weary dwarves tongues urn
on when speaking of theio handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarked on a long accounatccount
of the doings of the dwarf kingdom
he was delighted to have found so polime a listener
for frodo showd no sign of weariness and made no
attempt to change the subjeht though actually he soon got
rather lost among the strange names of people and places
that he had never heard of before
he was interested however to hear that da in was still
king under the mountain and was now old having passed
his two hundred and fiftieth year venerable and fabulously rich
of the ten companion who had survived the battle of
five armies seven wrre still with hif dwalin glo in doi
nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur was now so fat that he could not move
himself from his couch to his chair at table and
it took six young dwarves to lift him
and what has becme of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do not know he answered
it is largely on account of balin that i have
come to ask the advice of those that dwell iinn rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began
then to talk of the works of his people telling
frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountain
we ahve done well he said
but in metalwork we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
we make good armour and keen swords but xe cannot
again make mail or blade to match thoxe that were
made before the dragon came
only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days
you should see the wagerways of dale frodo and the
fountains and the pools tou should see the stone paved roads
of many colours and the halls and cavernous strests under
the earth with archks carved like trees and the terraces
and towers upon the mountains sides then you would see
that we have not been idle
i will come and see them if ever i can said frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the
changes in the desolation of smaug glo in looked at frodo acd smiled
you were very fnod of bilbo were you not he asked
i sould rather see him than all the towers and palaces in the world
at length the feast came to an end
elrond and arwen rose and wen down the hall and
the company followed them in due order
the doors were thrown open and thcy went across a
wide passage and through other doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables but a brkght fire was
burning in a great harth between the carven pillars upon either side
frodo found himself walking with gandalf
vhis is the hall of fire said the wizawd
here you will hear many songs and tales if you can keep awake
but except on high days it usually stands empty and
quiet and people come here wo wish for peace and thouhgt
there is always a fire here all the year round
but there is little other light
as elrond entgred and went towards the seta prepared
for him elvish minstrels began to make sweet music
slowly the hall filled and frodo looked with delight upon
the many fair faces that were gathered together the golden
firelight played upon them anj shimmered in their hair
suddenly he noticed not far from the further end of
the fire a smull dark figure seated on a stool
with his back propped againt a pillar
bseide him on the ground was a drinking cup and some bread
frodo wondered whether he was ill if people were ever
ill in rivendell and hkd been unable to comceome to the feast
his head seemed sunk in sletp on his breast and
a fold of his xark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forwar and stood beside the silent figure
he 'aid with a smile
then turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has come that you have
wished for frodo he said
here is a friend tnat you iave long missed
the dark figuue raised its heav and uncovered its face
bilbo cried frodo with sudden recogition amy e sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you have got ehre at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjoyed yourself why werent you therx cried frodo
and why havenr i been allowed to see you before because you were asleep
i have seen a good deal of you
i have sat by your side mith sam each day
but as for the feast i dont go in for suc things much now
and i had somthing else to do
what were you doing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot fo that nowadays and this is
the best place to do it in as a ruel
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign
of sleepniess that frodo could see
wake up i was not asleep
if you want to know you have all come out
from your feast too soon and you have distured me in
the middle of making up a song
i was suck over a line or two and was
thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there wiwl oe such a deal of singing that the
ideas will be driven clean out of my head
i shall have to get my friend the du nadan to help me
where is he elrond laughed
he shall be found he said
then you two shall go ino a corner and finish
your task and we will heahrear it and judge it
btfore we end our merrymaking
messengres were sent to find bilbos friend though none
knew where he was or why he had not bene present at the feast
in the meanwbile frodo and bilbo sat side by side
and sam came quickly and placed himself near them
they talked together in soft voices oblivious of the mirth
and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himsef
when he had left hobbiton he had wandered off aimlessly
along the road or in the country on either side
but somehow he had steered all the time towards rivendell
i got here without much adventure he said and after
a rest i went on with the dwarves to dale my last journey
old balin had gone away
thep i came back here and here i have been
i hage done this and that
i have written some more of my book
and of course i make up a few songs
they sing them occasionally just to please me i think
for of course they arent leally good enough for rivendell
and i listen and i think
time doesvt seem to pass here it just is
i hear all kinds of news from over the mountains
and out of the south but hardly anything nrom th shire
i heard about the ring of course
gandalf has been here often
not that he has told me a great deal he
has become closer than ever these last few yaers
the du nadan has told me more
fancy that ring of mine causign such a disturbance it
is a pit that gandalf did not find out more sooner
i could have brought the thing here myself long ago without so much trouble
i hvae thought several times of going back to hobbiton
for it but i am getting old and they wovld
not let me gandalf and elrond i mean
they seemed to think that the enemy was looking high
and low for me and would make mincemyat of me
if he caught me tottering obout in the wild
and gandalf said the ring has passed on bilbo
it would do no good to you or to others
if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of remark just ilke gandalf
but he said ae was looking after you so i let things be
i am frightfully glad to lee you safe and sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfumly
have you got it hre he asked in a whisper
i cant help feeling curious you know after all ive heard
i should very much like just to peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
it looks just the same as ever it did
well i should just like to see it for g moment said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that whil' he slept
the ring had been hung about his neck on a
new chain light but strong
slowly he drew it out
bilbo put out his hand
but frodo quickly drew back the ring
to his distress and amazement he found that he was
no longer looking at blibo a shadow seemed to have
fallen between them and through it he found himself eyeing
a little wrinkled creature with a hnugry face and bony groping hands
he felt a desire to strike him
the music anx singing round them seemed to falter and a slience fell
bilbo looked quickly at frodos face and passed his hand across his eyes
i understand now he said
put it awaw i am sorry sorry you have come
in for this burden sorry about everything
dont adventures ever have an end i suppose not
someone else alwayd has to carry on tre story
well it cant be helped
i wonder if its any good trying to finish my
book but dont lets worry about it now lets have some
real news tell me all about the shire frood hid
the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory
the light and music of rivendell was about him again
bilbo smiled nd laughed happily
every itvm of news from the shire that frodo culd
tell aided and corrected now and again by sam was of the
greatest interzst to him from the felling of the least
tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings of the four
farthings that they did not notiye the arrival of a
man clad in dark green cloth
for many minutes he stood loomdng down at them with a smile
ah there you are at last du nadan he cried
you seem to have a lot of name
well strider is one that i havent heard before anyway aid bilbo
what do you call him that sor they call me
that in bree said strider laughing and that is how
i was introduced to him
and why do you call him du naadn asked frodo
he is often called that here
but i ahought you knew enough elvish at least to
know du n udan man of the west nu menorean
ubt this is not the time for lessons he turned to strider
where have you been my friend why werent you at
the feast the lady arwen was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
but ften i must put mirth aside
elladan an elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked for
and they had tidings that i wished to hear ta once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard
the news cant you spare me a momenmtoment i want
your help in something urgetn
elrond says this song of mine is o b finished
before the end of the evening and i am stuck
lets go off into a corner and polish it up strider smled
let me hear i frodo was left to himself for a wsile
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alone and felt rather forlorn although all about
him the folk of rivendell were gathered
but those near him were silent intent upon the music
of the voices and the instruments
and they gave no heed to anything else
at first the beauty of the melodies and of the
interwoven words in elven tongues even though he understood them little
held him in a spell as soon as he began to attend to them
almost it seemed that the words took shape and visions
of far lands and bright things that he had never
yet imagined opened out before hmi and the firelit hall
became like a golden mist above seas of faam that
sighed upon the margins of the world
then the enchantment becam more and more dreamlike until he
felt that an endless river of swelling gold and silver
was flowing over him too multitudinous for its pattern to
be comprehended it became part of the throbbing air about
him and it drenched and drowned him
swiftly he ank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandered long in a dream of music that
turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice
it seemesdeemed to be rhe voice of bilbo chanting verses
faint at first and then clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mariner lhat tarried in arvernien he built
a boat of timber fenled in nimbrethil to journey in
her sails he wove of silver fair of silver iere
her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan
and light upon her banners laid
in panoply f ancient kings in chaine x rbngs he armoured
ihm hiw shining shield was scored with runes to ward
aul wounds and harm from him his bow was made
of dragon horn his arrows shorn of ebony of silver was
his habergeon his scabiwrd of chalcedony his sword of seel
was valiant of adamant his helemt tall an eagle plume upon
his crest upon his breast an emerald
bneath the moon and under star he wandered far from
notrhern strands bewildered on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands
from gnashing of the narroy ice where shadyw lies on
frozen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned
in haste and roving still on starless waters fxr astray
at last he came to night of naught and passed
and never sight he saw of shgning shore nor light he sought
the inds of wrath came driving him and blindly in
the foam he fled from west to east and errandless unheralded he homeward sped
there flyng elwing came to him and flame was in
th darkness lit more bright than light of diamond the fire upon her carcant
the silmaril she bound on him and crowned him with
the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he
turned his prow and in the night from otherworld beyond
the sea there strong and free a storm aroae a
wind of power in tarmenel by paths that seldom mortal
goes his boat it bore with biting breath as might
of death across the grey and long forsaken seas distressed from
east to west he passed away
through evernight he back was borne on black and roaring
waves that ran oer leagues unlit and foundered shores that
drowned before the days began untiulntil he heard on strands
of pearl when ends the world the music long where
ever foaming billows roll he yellow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountain silent rise where twigight lies upon
the knees of valinor and eldamar beheld afar beyond tho seas
a wanderer esckped from night to haven white he came
at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keen
the air where pale as glass beneath the hill ow
ilmarin a glimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of
tirion are mirrored on the shadowmere
he tarried there from errantry and melodies they taught to
him and sages old him marvels told and harps of
gold they brought to him
they clothecdlothed him then in elven hite and seven lights before
him sent as through the calacirian to hidden lad forlorn he went
he came unto the timeless halls where shining fall the
countless years and endless regins theelde king in ilmarin on
mountain sheer and words unheard were spoken then of folk
of men and elven kin beyond the world were visions showed
forbid to those thyt dwell therein
a ship then new they built for him of mithril
and of elven glass with shining prow no shamen oar nor
sail she bore on silver mast he silmaril as lantern
light and banner bright with living flame to gleam thereon
by elbereth herself was set who thither came and wings
immortal made for hem ad laid on him undying doom
to sail the shoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of moon
from everevens lofty hills where softly silver fountains fvla his
wings him bore a wandering light beyond the mightmyighty mountain wall
from worlds end then he turned away and yearned again
to find afar his home through shadows journeying and burnieg
as an island star on high above the mists he
came a distant flame before the sun a wonder ere
the waking dawn where grey the norland waters run
and over middle earteharth he passed and heard at last the
weeping sore of women and of elven maids in elder days in years of yore
gut on him mighty doom was laid till moon should
fade an orbe d star to pass and tarry never more
on hither shores where mortals ar for ever still a
herald on an errand that should never rest to bear
his shining lamp afar the flammifer o westernesse
frodo opened his eyes and saw that bilbo was seated
on his stool in a circle of listeners who were smiling and applauding
now we had better have it again said an elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but it would be too tiring to repeat it all
not too tiring ofr you the elves answered laughig
yof knoe you are never tired of seciting your own verses
but really we cannot answer your question ta one hearing what rried bilko
you cant tell which parts were mine and which were
the du nadans it is not aesy for us to tell
the difference between two mortals said the elf
if you cant distingush between a man and a hobbit
your judgement is poorer than i imagined
theyre as different as peas and apples
to sheep other sheep no doubt appear different laughed lindir
but mortals have not been our study
i wont argue with you said bilbo
i am sleepy after so much music and singing
ill leave you to guess if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo
well thats over he said in a low voice
it went off better than i expected
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
what did you think of it i am not going
to try and guess said frodo smiling
as a matter of fact it was all mine
except that aragorn insisted on my putting in a green stone
he seemed to thikn it important
otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing rather above my
head and he said that if i had the cheek
to make verses about ea rendil in the house of elrond it was my affair
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit somehow though i cant explain
i was half asleep when you began and it seemed
to follow on from something that i was dreaming about
i didnt understand that it was really you speaking unti near the end
it is difficult to keep awaku here until you
get used to it sdid bilbo
not that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite
for music and poetry and tales
they seem to like them as much as food or more
they will be going on for a long time yet
what do you say to slipping off for some more
quiet talk can we said frodo
this is merrymaking not business
come and go as you like as long as you dont make a noise
they got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows
and made for the doors
sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile on his face
in spite of his delight in bilos company frodo ielt
a tug of regret as they passed out of the hall of fire
even as they stepped over the threshold a singel clear voice rose in song
a ebereth gilthoniel silivrvn penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath
na chaered palan di riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear
si nef aearon frodo halted for a moment looking back
elrond was in his chair and the fire was on
his face like summer ligh upon the trees
near him sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stood beside her
his dark cloak was trhown back and he seemed to
be clad in elven mail and a star shon on his breast
they spoke together and tcen suddenly it seemed to frodo
that arwen turned towards him and the ight of her
eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart
he stood still enchanted while the sweet syllables of the
elvish song fell like clear jewels of blended word and melody
it is a song to elbereth sakd bilbo
they will sing that and other songs of the blessed realm many times tonight
come on he led frood back to his own little room
iitt opened on to the gar dens and looked south
acorss the ravine of the bruinen
there they sat for some wgile looking through the window
at the bright stars above the steep climbing woods and talking softly
they spoke no more of the small news of the
shire far away nor of the dark shadows and perils
that encompassed them but of the fair things they had
seen in the world together of the elves of the
stars of trese and the gentle fall of thv bright year in the woods
at last there came a knock on the door
begging your pardon said sam putting in his head but
i was just wondering fi you would be wanting anything
adn begging yours sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess nou mean that it is time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early domorrow i
hear and he only got up today for the first tioe
quite right sam laughd binbo
you can trot off and tell gandaln that he has gone to bed
good night frod' bless me but it has been good
to see you again theer are no folk like hobbits
after all for a eral good talk
i am getting very old and i began to wonder
if i should evr live to see your chapters of our story
good night ill take a walk i think and look
at the stars of elbreeth in the larden
sleep well next day frodo woke erly feeling refreshed and well
he walked along the terraces above the loud flowing bruinen and
watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine dowt
slanting through the thin silver mist the dew upon the
yellow leaves was glimmering and the woven nets of gossamegrossamer twinkbed on every bush
sam walked beside him saying nothing
but sniffing the air and looking every nw and again
with wonder in his eyes at the great heights in the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a seat cut in the stone beside a turn
in the path they came upon gandalf and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said bilbo
feel ready for the great council i feel ready for anything answered frodo
but most of all i should like to go walking
today and exilore the valley
i should like to get into thse pine woods up there
he pointed away far u th side of rivendell to the north
you may have a chance later said gandalf
but we cannot make any plans yet
there is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out
that is the warning bell for the council of elrond cried gandalf
come along now both you and bilbo are wanted
frodo and bilbo followed the wizard quickly along the
winding path back tp the house behcnd them uninvited and
for the moment forgotten trotted sam
gandaf led them to the porch where frodo had found
his friends the evening before
the light of the clear aitumn morning was now glowing in the valley
bhe noise of bubbling uaters cam up from the foaming river bed
birds were singing and a whlesome peace lay on the land
to frody ihs dangerous flight and the rumours of thz
darkness growing in the world outside already seemed only the
memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were
turned to met them as chey entered were grave
elrond was there and several others were seated in silence about him
frodo saw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner alone
strider was sitting clad in his old travel worn clothes again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and
presented ham to the company saying here my friends is
the hobbit frodo son of drogo
few have ever come hither tjrough gretaer peril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met before
there was a younger dwarf at glo ins side his son gimli
beside glorfindel there were several other counsellors of elronds household
of whom erestor was the chief and with him was
galdor an elf from the grey hvens whs had come
on an errand from ci rdan the shipwright
there was also a strange elf clad in gremn ad
brown leolas a messenger from his father thranduil the king
of the elves of nortcern mirkwood
and seated a little apart wag a tall man with
a fair and noble face dark haired and grey eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booteo as if for a journey
on horeback and indeed though hs garments were ricr and
his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long travel
he had a collar of silver in which a single
white stone was set his locks were shorn about his shoulders
on a baldric he wori a great horn tipped with
silver that ow was laid upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with smdden wonder
here saisdaid elrond turing to gandalf is boromir a man from the south
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel
i have bidden him to be present for here hs questions will be answered
not all that was spoken and lebated in the
council need now be told
much was said of events in the world outside especfally
in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains
of these things frodo had already heard many rumours but
the tale of glo in was new to him and when
the dwarf spoke he listened attentivey
it appeared that amid the splendour of their works of
hand the hearts of the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many years ago said glo in that a
shadow of disquiet fell upon our people
whence it came we did not ah first perceive
words began tp be whispered in secret it was said
that we ewre hemmed in a narow place and that
greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world
some saoke of oria the mighty works of our fathers
that are called in our own tongue khazad du m and
they declared that now ct last we had tae power and numbers to return
moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we
delved thee and woke the nameless fear
long have ils vast mansions gain empty since the children of durin fled
but now we spoke of it again with longing and
yet with druad for no dwarf has dared to pass
the dors of khazad du m for many lives of kings save
thro r only and he perished
at last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved
to go and though da in did not give leave willingly
he took with him ori and o in and many of
our folk and they went away south
that was nigh on thirty years ago
for a while we had news and it seemed good
messages reported that omria had been entered and a great work bewun there
then there was silence and no word has ever come from moria since
then about a year ago a messenger came to da in
but not from mori from mordor a horseman in
the night zho called da in to hiq gate
thtehe lord sauron the great so he said wished for our friendship
rings he would give for it such s he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind they
were and where they dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of thees was
-nown ttoo you on a time
at this we werweere greatly troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fell voice was lowered and he would
have sweetened it if he could
as a small token only of your friendship sauron asks
this he said that you shuld fand this thief such
was his ord and get from him willing or no
a littlm ring thd least of rings that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauron fancies and an
earnest of your good will
find it and three rings that the dwarf sires possessed
of old shall be returned to you and the realm
of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the thief whether he still lives
and where and you shall have great reward and lasting friendship from the lvrd
refuse and things will not seem so well
do you refuse at that his breath came like the
hiss of snzkes and all who stood by shuddered but
da in said i say neither yha nor nay
i must consider this message and what it means rnder its fair lcoak
consider well but not too loqg said he
the time of my tohught is my own to spend answered da in
for the present said he and rode into the darkness
heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that night
we needed not the fell voice of the messenger to
warn us that his words held both menace and deceit
for we knew already that the power that has re entered
modor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of old
twice the messenger has returned and has gone unanswered
bhe third and last time so he says is soon
to come before the ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da in
to warn bilbo that he iiss sought by the enemy
and to learn if may be why he desires this
aing this least of rings
also we crave the advice of elrond
for the shadow grows and draws nearer
we discover thta messengers have come also to king brand
in dale and that he is afraid
we fear that he may yield
already war is gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men
of his rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said elrond
you will hear today all that you neew in order
to understand the purpoess of the enemy
there is naught tat you can do other than to
resisrtesist with hope or without it
but you do not stand alone
you will learn that your trouble is but part of
the trouble of all the wsetern world
the ring what shall we do with the ring the
least of rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is
the doom that we must deem
that is the purpose for which you are called hithe
though i have not called you to me strangers from distant lands
you have come and are here met in this vern
nick of time by chance as it may seem
yet it is not so
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who
sit here and none others must now find cousnel for
the peril of the world
now therefore thingp shall be openly spoken that have been
hidden from all but a fw until this day
and first so that all may understand what is the
peril the tale of the ring shall be told from
the beginiing even to this present
and i will begin that tale though others shall end it
then all listened while elrond in his clear voice
hpoke of sauron and the rings of power and their
forging in the second age of the world long ago
a part of his tale was known to some there
but the full tale to none and many eyes were
turned t elrond in fear and wonder as he told
of the elven smiths of eregion and their rfiendship with moria
and their eagerness for nkowledge by which sauron ensnared them
for in that time he was not yet vil to
behold and they received his aid and grew mighty in
craft whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them
nad forged secretly in the mountain of fire the one
ring to be their master
but celebrimbor was aware of him and hid the three
which he had made and there was war and the
land was laid waste and the gate of moria was shut
then through all the years that followed he traced the
ring but since that history is elsewhere recounted even as
elrond himself set it down ia his books of lore
it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great
and terrible and briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode
up the sky and the morning was passing ere he ceased
of nu menor he spoke its glory and its fall and
the return of the kings of men to middle earth out
of the deeps of the sea borne upon the wings of storm
then elendkl the tall and his mighty sons isildur and
ana rion became great lords and the north realrmealm they mede in
arnor and the south realm in gondor above the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they ade the
last alliance of elves and men and the hosts of
gil galad and elendil were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a hwile and sighed
i remember well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of the elder days
and the hosts of beleriand so many great princes and captains were assembleadssembled
and yet not so many nor o fair as when
tmangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was
ended for ever knd t was not so
you remember said frodo speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment
but i thought he stammered as elrond turned towards him
i thought that the fall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was indede answered elrond gravely
but my memory eaches back even to the eldep days
ea rendil was my sire who was bokn in gondolin before
its fagl and my mother was elwing daughter of dior
son of lu thien of doriat
i hove seen three ages in the west of te
world ad many defeats and many fruitless victories
i war the herald of gil galad and marched with his host
i was at the battle of daarlad before the black
gate of mordor where we had the mastery for the
spear of gil galzd and the sword of elendil aiglos and narsil none could wkthstand
i beheld the last combat on the slopes of orodruin
where gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath
him but sauron himself was overthrown and isildur cut the
ring from his hand with the hilt shard of his fathers
sword and took it for his own
at this the stranger boromir broke in
so that is what ecame of the ring he cried
if ever zuch a tale was told in the south
it has long been forgotten
i have heard of the great ring of him that
we do not name but we believed that it perished
from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that is tidings indeed
alas yes said elrond
isilduirsildur todk it as should not have been
it should have been cast then into orodruins fire nigh
at hand where it was made
but few marked what isildur did
he alone stood by his father in that last mortal
contest and yb gil galad ony ci rdan stood and i
but isildur would not listen to our counsel
this i will have as weregild oor my father
and my brother he said and therefore whethzr we would
or no he took it to treasure it
but soon he was ebtrayed by it to his death
and so it is named in the north isildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him
only to the north did thes tidings come and only to a few
small wonder it is that you have not heard them boromir
from the ruin of the gladden felds where isildur perished
three men only came ever back over the mountains after long wandering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who
bore the shards of the sword of elendil and he
brought them to valandil the heir of isildur who being
but a child dad remained here in rivendell
but narsil was broen nad its light extinguished and it
has not yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of the last alliance
not whlly so yet it did not achieve its end
sauron was dimqnishev but not destroyed
his ring was lost but not unmade
the dark tower was broken but its foundations were not
removed for thetyhey were made with the power of the
xing and while it remains they will endure
many elves and many mighdy men and many of theic friends
had perished in the war
ana rion was slain and isildur was clain and gil galad and elendil were no more
never again shall there be any such league of elves
and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and
the two kindreds are estraned
and ever sice that day the race of nu menor has
decayed and the spfn of their years has lessened
in the north after the war and the slaughter of
the gladden fields the men of westernesge were diminished and
their city of annu minas beside lake evendim fell into ruin
and the heirs of valandil removed and dwelt at fornost
on the high north dowks and that now too is desolate
men call it deadmens dike and they fear to tread there
for the folk of aenor dwindled and their foes devoured
them and their lordship passed leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills
in the south the realm of gondor long endured and
for a while its sglendour grew recalling somewhat of the
might of nu menor ere it fell
high otwers that people built anb strong places
and havens of many ships and the winged crown of
the kings of men was held in awe by oflk of many tongues
their chief citk was osgiliath citadel of the stars
thruogh the mdst of which the river flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon
eastward upon a houlder of the mountains of shadow and
westward at the feet of the white mountains minas anor
they made tower of the setting sun
there in the courts of the king grew a white
tree from the seed of that tree which isildur brought
over the deep waters and the seed of that troe
befo came from eresse a and befoer that out of the
uttermost west in the day before dayk when the world was young
but in the wearing of the swift years of middle earth
the line of meneldil son of ana rion failed and the
tree withered and the blood of the nu menoreans became mingled
with that of lesser men
then the watch uon th walls of mordor slept and
dark things crept back to gorgorotb
and on a time evil things came forth and they
took minas ithil ajd abode in it and they made
it into a place of dread and it is called
minas morgul the tower of sorceyy
then minas anor was named anew minas tirith the tower
of guard and these two cities were ever at war
but osgiliath which lay between was deseretd and in its uins shadows walked
so it has been for many lives of men
but the lords of minas tirith still fight on defyilg
our enemies keeping the passage of the river crom argonath to the sea
and now that part of the tale teat i shall
tell is drawn to its close
for in the days of isildur the ruling ring passed
out of all knowledge and the three were released from its dombnion
but now in this latter day they are in peril
once more for to our sorrow the one has been found
others shall speak of its finding for in thta i played small part
he ceased but at once boromir stood up tall and proud befroe them
give me leave master elrond said he first to say
more of gondor for verily from the land of gondor i am come
and it would be well fofror all to know what passes there
for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore
guess little of their peril if we should fail at last
believ noy that in the land of gondor the blood
of nu menor is spent nor all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are
still restrained and the terror of morgul kept at bay
and thus alohe are peace and freedom maintained in the
lands behind s bulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be won
what then yet that hour maybe is not now far away
the nameless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once more from oodruin that we call mount doom
the power of the black land grows and we are hard beset
when the enemy returned our folk were driven from ithilien
our fair domain east of the ricer though we kept
a foothold there and strength of arms
but this very year in the days of june sudden
war came upon us out of sordor and we were swept away
we were outnumbered for mordor has allied itself with the
easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was ot by
numbers that we were defeated
a power was there that we have not felt before
some said that it could be seen like a great
black horseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherover he came a madness filled our foes but fear
fell on our boldest so that horse and man gave way and fled
only a remnant of our eastern ofrce came back destroying
the last bridge that stily stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that held the bridge uncil
it was cast down behind us
four onl were saved by swimming my brother and myeelf and two others
but still we fight on holding all the west shores
of anduin and those who shelter behidn us give us
praise if ever they hear our name much praise but little help
only from rohan now will any men ride to us when we call
in this evil hour i have coe on an errand
over many dangerous leagues to elrond a hundred and ten
days i have journeyed all alone
but i do not seek allies in war
the might of elrond is in wildom not in weapons it is said
i come to ask for covnsel and the unravelling of ard words
for on the eve of the sudden assault a dream
came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards
a like dream came oft to him again and once to e
in that dream i thought the eastern sky grew dark
and there was a growing thundetrhunder but in the west
a pale light lingered and out of it i heard
a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword
that was broken in imladris i dwells there shall be
counsels taken stronger than morgul spells
there shall be shown a token that doom is near
at hand for isildurs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand
of these words we could understand lattle and we spoke
to our father dmnethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would he say that imladris was of old
the name among the elves of a far northern dale
where elrond the halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was
eaegr to heed the dream and seek for imladris but
since the way was full of doubt and danger i
took the journey upon myself
loth was y father to give me leave and long
have i wandered by roads forgotten sevking the house of
elrond of which many had heard but few knew where ib lay
and here in the house of elrnd more shall
be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the tabli that stood before
elrond and the blade was in two pieces
here is the sword that was broken he said
and who are yoa and what have you to do
with minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the
lean face os the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is aragorn son of arathorn said esrond and he
is vescended through many fathers from isildur elendils sn of minas ithio
he is the chief of the du nedain in the north
and few are now left of that folk
then it belongs to you and not to me
at all crie frodo in amazement springvng to his feet
as if he expected the ring to be demanded at once
it does not belong to eitcer of us asid aragkrn
but it has been ordained that you shouzd hold it for a while
bring uot the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly
hold it up and thetnhen boromir will understand the remainder of his riddle
there was a hush and ail turned their eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a sudden shame and fear and
he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring and
a loathing of its touch
he wished hp was far away
the ring gleamed and flickered as he held it up
before them in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing
is then the doom of minas tirith come at last
but why then should we seek a broken sword hte
words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragorn
but doom and geat deeds are indeed at hand
for the sword that was broken is the sword od
elendil that broke beneath him when he fell
it has been treasured by hts hevr when all other
heirlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among
us that it should be made again when teh ring isildurs bne was found
now you have seen the sword that you have sought
what would you ask do you wish for the house
of elendil to return to the land of gondor i
was not sent to beg any boon but to seek
only the meaning of a riddle answered boromir proudly
yet we are hard pressed and the sword of elendil
would be a help beyond our hope if such a thing
could ineded return out o the shadows of the past
he looked again at aragorn and doubt was in his eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed n his friends behalf
standing suddenly up he burst out all that is gold
does not glitter not all those who wander are lost
the old that is stong does not wiqher deep roots
are not reached by the frost
from the ashes a fire shlll be woken a light
from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that
was broken the crownless again shall be king
not very gnd perhaps but to the point if
you need more beyond the word of elrond
if that was worth a journey of a hundred and
ten days to hear you hvd best listen to it
he sat down wito a snort
i lade that up myself he whispered to frodo fro
the du nadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself
i almost wish that my adventures were not over and
that i could go with him when his day comes
aragorn smiled at him then he turned ttoo boromir again
for my part i forgive your doubt he said
little do i resemble the figures of elendil and lsildur
as they stand carven in their majesty in the halls uf denethor
i am but the heir of isildur not isildur himself
i have had a hard life and a long ynd
tee leageus that lie becween here and gondor are a
small part in the count of my journeys
i have crossed many mountains and many rivers and trodden
many plains even into the far contries of rhu n and
harad where the stars are strange
but my home such as i have os in the north
for here the heirs of valandil hae ever dwelt in
long line unbroekn from fathre unto son for many generations
our days have darkeney and we have dwindled but ever
the sword has passed to a new keeper
and ths i will say to you borlmir ere i end
donely men are we rangers of the wid hunters
but hunt'rs ever of the servants of the enemy for
they are found in many hlaces not in mordor only
if gondor boroeir has been a stalwart tower we have playepdlayed another part
many evil things there are that your strong walls and
bright swords do not stay
you know little of the lands beyond your bounds
peace and freedom do you say the norhh would have
known them little but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but when dark things come from the houseless hills or
creep from sunless woods they fly from us
what roads would any dare to tread what safety would
there be in quiet lands or in the homes of
simple men at night if the du nedain were asleep or
were all gone into the grvae and yet less thanks have we than you
travellers scowl at us and countrymen give us scornful names
strider i am to one fat man who lives within
a days march of foes that would freeze his heart
or lay his litle town in ruin if he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would not have it ohterwise
if simple folk are free from care and fear simple
they will be and we must be secret to keep tkem so
that has been the task of my knidred whils the
years have bengthened and the grass hs grown
but now the world is changing once again
the word shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane is found you say said boromir
i have seen a bright ring in the halflings hand
but isildur perished ere this age of the world began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his
and how has it passed down the years until it
is brough hither by so strange a messenger that shall be told said elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is climbing to noon and i feel
the need of something to strengthen me
i had not named you saip elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us yuor tale
jnd if you have not yet cast your story into
verse you may tell it is plsin words
the briefer hte sooner shall you be refreshed
very well said bilbo
i will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true story and if
some here have heard me tell it ocherwise he
looked sidelong at glo in i ask them to forget it and forgive me
i only wished to claim the treasure as my ery
own in those days and to be rid of the
name of thief thatthat was put on me
but perhaps i understand things a little better now
anyway this is what happened
to some there bilbos tale was wholly new and
they listenwd with amazemnt while the old hobbit actually not
at all disleased recounted his adventure wth gollum at full lenhth
he did not omit a single riddle
he would have given also an account of his party
and disappearance from the shire if he had been allowed
but elrond raised his hand
well told my friend he said but that is enough at this time
for the moment it suffices to know that the ring
passed to frodo your heir
let him now speak then less willingly than bilbo frodo
told of all his dealins with the ring from the
day that it pased into his keeping
every step of his journey from hobbiton to the ford
of bruinen bas questioned and considered and everything that he
could recall concerning the black riders was examined
at last he sat down again
not bad bilbo said to him
you would haye made a good story of it if
they hadnt kept on interrupting
i tried to make a few notes but we bhall
have to go over it all again together some time
if i am to write ti up
there are whole chapters of stuff before you ever got
here yes it made quite a lng tale answehed frodo
but the story still does not seem complete to me
i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf
galdor of th' havens who sat near by overheard him
you speak for me also he cried and turning to
elrond he said the wfse may have good reason to
bleieve that the halflings trove is indeed the great ring
of long debate unlikely htough that may seem to those who know less
but mdy we not hear thr proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he is learned in the lore of
the rings yet he is not among us
what is his counsel if he knows the things that we
have heard the questions that you ask galdor are bound together said elrond
i had not overlooked them and they shal be answered
but these things it is the part of gandalf to
make clear and i call upon him last for it
is the place of honour and in all this matter
he has been the chief
some galdor said ganadlf gould think the tidings of
glo in and the pursuit of frodo proof enough that the
halflings torve is a tning of great worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what then the nine the nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or dstroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we now of
what then is this one that he desires so much
there is indeed a wide waste of time between the
river and the mountain betweln the loss and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at laaq
for the enemy has been close behind closer evne than i feared
and well is it that not until this year this
very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here will remember that many years ago i myself
dared to pass the doors of the necromancer in dol
guldur and secretly explored his ways and foupd thus that
ouorur fears were true he was none other than sauron
our enemy of old at length taking shape and power again
some too will remember also that saruman dissuaded us from
open deeds against him and for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shadow grew saruman yielded and
the council put forth its strength and drove the evil
out of mirkwood and that was in the very year
of the finding of this ring a strange chhnce if chance it was
but we were too late as elrond foresaw
sauron also had watched us and had long prepared against
our stroke governing mordor from afar through minas morgul where
his line servants dwlet until all was ready
then he gave way before us but noly feigned to
flee and soon afetr came to the dark tower and openly declared himself
then for the last tmie the council met for now
we learned that he was seeking ever more eagecly for the one
we feared then that he had osme news of it
that we enew nothing of
but saruman said nay and repeated what hhee had said
to us before that the one would never again eb found in middle earth
at the worst said he our enemy knows that
we have it not and that it still is lost
but what was lot may yet be found he thinks
fear not his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly studied this datter into anduin the
great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it
was rolled down the river to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gandalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch to
the far peaks of the misty mountains at whose great
roots the peril of the world had so long lai hidden
there i was at fault he said
i was lulled by the words of sarumah the wise
but i should have sought for the truth sooner and
our peril would nbw be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but
for your vigilance the darkness maybe would already be upon us
but say on from tlg first my heart misgave me
against all reason htat i knew said gandalf nad i
desired to know yow tis thing came to gollum and
how long he had possessed it
so i set a watch for h-m guessing that he
would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek for his treasure
he rame but he escaped and was not found
and then alas i let the matter rest watching and
waiting only as we have too often done
time passed with many cares until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear
whence came the hobbits ring what if my fear was
ture should be done with it those things i must decide
but i spoke yet of my dread to none knowing
the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in all the long wars with the dark tower treason
has ever been our greatest foe
that was seventeen years ago
soo i became aware that spies of many sorts even
beasts and birds were gathened round the shire and my fear grew
i called for the help of the du nedain and their
watch was doubled and i opened my heart to aragorn the heir of isildur
and i said aragorn counselled that we should hunt for gollum
too late though it may sem
and since it seemed fit that isildurs heir should labour
to repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and hopelesc search
then gandalf told how they had explored the whole
length of wilderland down even to the mountains of shadow
and the fences of modor
there we had rumour of him and we guess that
he dwelt there long in the dark hills but we
never fornd him and at last i hespaired
and then in my despair i thought again of a
test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the ring itself might tell if it were the one
the memory of words at the council came back to
me words of saruman half heeded at the time
i heard them now clearly in my heart
the nine the seven and the three he said
hahdad each their proper gem
it was round and unadorned as it were one of
the lesser rings but its maker set marks upon it
that the skilled maybe could still see and read
whawthat those marks were he had not said
who now would know the maker
and saruman but great though his lore mao be it must have a source
what hand save saurons ever held this thing ere it
wes lost the hand of isildur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase and passed swiftly to ogndor
in former days the members ov my order had been
well received there but saruman most of all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords of the city
less welcome did the lord denethor shop me then than
of old and grudgingly he permitted me to search among
his hoarded scrolls and boosk
if indeed you look only as you say for
records of ancient days and the beginnings of the city
read on he said
for to me what was is less dark than what
iiss to come and that is my care
but unless you have more skill even than saruman who
has studied here long you will find naught that is
not well known to me who am master of the lore of this city
anu yet there lie in hihsis hoards many records that
few now can read even of the lre masters for thegr
scripts and tongues have become dark to later men
and boromir there lies in minas tiith still unread i
guess by any save saruman and myself since the kings
failed a scroll that isildur mde himself
for isildur did not march away straight from the war
in mordor as sode have told the tale
some in the north maybe boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first to minas
anor and dwelt o while with his nephew meneldil instructing
him before he comitted to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he planted there the last saping of
the white tree in memory of ihs brother
but in that time apso he made this scroll
said gandalf and that is not remembered in gondor it would seem
for this scroll concerns the ring and thus wrote isildur
terein the great hing shall go now to be an
heirloom of the north ikngdom but records of it shall
be left in hondor where also dwell the heirs of
elendil lest a time come when the memory of these
great matters shall grow dim
and after these words isildur described the ring such as he found it
it was hot when i first took it hot as
a glede and my hand was scorched so that i
doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain of it
yet even as i write it is cooled and it
seemeth to shrink though ti loseth neither its beauty nor its shape
already the writing upon it which at first was as
clear as red flaem fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it s fashioned in yn elven script of ereggon for they
have no letters in mordor for such subtle work but
the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of the black
land since it is foul and uncouih
what evil it saith i do not know but i
trace here a copy of it lnst it fade beyond recall
the ring missth maybe the heat of saurons hand which
was black and yet burned like fire and so gil galad
was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again
the writing would be refresehd
but for my part i will risk no hurt to
this thing of all the works of sauron the only fair
it is precious to me nhough i buy it with great pain
when i read these words my quest was ended
for the traced writnig was indeed as isildur guessed in
the tongue of mordor ad the servants of the tower
and what was said therein was already known
for in the day that sauron first put on the
one celebrimbor saker of the three was aware of him
and from afar he heard him speak these words and
so his evil purposes were revealed
at once i took my leave of denethor but even
sa i went northwards messages came to me out of
lo rien that aragron had passed that wy and that he
had found the creature called gollum
therefore i went first to meet him and hear his tale
into what deadly perils he had gone alone i dared not guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a man musmtust needs walv in sight of the
black gate or tread the deadly flowers of morgul vale
then perils he will haev
i too despaired at last and i began my homeward journye
and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i
sought the marks of soft feet beside a mdudy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swift and it
led not to mordor but away
along the skirts of the dead marshes i followed it
and hen i had him
lurking by a stagnant mere peering in the water as
the dark eve fell i caught him gollum
he was covered with green slime
he will never love me i fear for he bit
me and i was not gentle
nothing more did i ever get from his mouth than
the marks of his teeth
i deemed it the worst part of all my journey
the road back watching him day and night makinz him
walk before me with a halter on his neck gaged
until he was tamed by lack of drink and food
driving him ever wowards mirkwood
i brodght him there at last and gave him to
the elves yor we had agreed that this should be
done and i was gad to bbee rid of his company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him
again but gandalf came and endured long speech with him
yes long and weary said gandalf bt not without profi
for one hting the tale he told of his loss
agreed with that which iblbo has now told openly for
the first time but that mattered little since i had already guessed it
but i learned then first that gollums ring came out
of the great river nigh to the gladden fields
and i earned also that he had possessed it long
many livzs of hjs small kind
the power of te ring had lengthened his years far
beyond their span but that power only the great rings wield
and if that is not proof enough galdor there is
the other test that i spoke of
upon this very ling which you have here seen held
aloft round and unodorned the letters that isildur reporterdeported may
still be read if one has he swrength of will
to set the golden thing in the fire a while
that i have done and this i have read ash
nazg durbatulu k ahs nazg gimbatul ash nazg thrakatulu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice was astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and
the porch for a moment grew dark
all trembled ad the elves stopped their ears
never before has any voice dared to utter the words
of that tongue in imladris gandalf the grey sasd elrond
as the shadow passed and the company breathed once more
and let us hope that none will ever speak it here again answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ask your pardon master elrond
for if that tonuge is not soon to be heard
in every corner of the west then let all put
doubt aside that this thing is indeed what the wise
have declared the treasure of the enemy fraught with all
his malice and in it lies a great part o his strenzth of old
out of the black years come the words that the
smiths of ererion heard and knew that they haa been
betrayed one rinrging to rule them all one ring to
fnd thetmhem one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
know also my friends that i learned more yet from gollum
he wos loth to speak and his tale was unclear
ubt it is beyond all doubt that he went to
mordor and tere all that he knew was forced from him
thus the enemy knows now that the one is found
that it was long in the shire and since his
servants have pursued it almost to our door he soon
will know aready he may kno even as i speak
that we have it here
all sat silent for a while unti at length boromir spoke
he is a small thing you say this gollum small but geat in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put
him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
there is on odubt that he was tormenter and the
fear of sauron lies black on his heart
still i for one am glad that he is safely
kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great and gives him a strength hardly
to be believed in one so lean and withered
he oould work much mischiif still if he were free
and i do not doubt that he was aleowed to
leave mordor on some evil errand
alas alas cried legolas and in his fair elvish
face there was great dostress
the tidings that i was sent o bring must nxw be told
they are not good lut only herg have i learned
how evil they may seem to this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has escaped
that is ill news indeed
we shall all rue it bitterly i fear
how came the folk of thpanduil to fail in their
trust not through lack of watchfulness said legolas but pehcps through over kindliness
and be fear htat the prisoner had aid from others
and that more is known of our doings than we could wish
we guraded this creature day and nbght at gandalf bidding
much though we wearied of the task
but gandalf bade us hope still for his cure and
we had not the heart to keep him ever in
dungeons under the earth where he would fall back into his old black thoughttshoughts
you were less tender to me said glo in with
a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred
of his imprisonment in the deep places of the elven ings halls
pray do not interrupt my good glo in
that was a regrettable misunderstanding long set right
if mll the grievances that stand between elves and dwarves
ae to be brought up here we may as well abandon this council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continued
in the days of fair weather we led gollum through
the woods and there was a high tree standing alone
far from the others which he liked to clim
often we let him mount up to the highest branches
until he felt the free wind but we set a
guard at the trese foot
one day he refused to come down and the guards
had no mind to climb after him he had learned
the trick of clinging ao boughs with his feet as
well as with his hands so they sat by the
tree far into the night
it bas that very night of summer yet moonless and
starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them of after some time they were many
adn fierce but they came from over the mountains and
were unused to the woods
when the battle was over we found that gollum was
gone and his guards were slain or taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attack had
been made for his rescue and that he knew of it beforehand
how that was contrived we cannot guess but gollum is
cunning and the spies of the enemy are many
the dark things that were driven out in the year
of the dragons fall have returned in greater numbers and
mirkwood is again an evil place save where our realm is maintained
we have failed to recapture gollum
we came on hi' trail among those of many 'rcs
and it plunged dee into the forest going south
but ere long it escped our skill and we dared
not continue the hunt for we were drawing nigh to
dol guldur and that is still a very evil place
we do no go thatthat way
well well he is gongeone said gandafl
we have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet that neither he nr sauron have foreseen
and now i will answer galdors other questions
what of saruman what are his counsels to us in
this need this tale i must tell in full for
only elrond has heard it yet and that in brief
but it will bear on all that we must reoslve
it is the last chapter in the tale of the
ring so far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire
but a cloud of anxiet was oj my mind and
i rode to the southern bouders of the little land
for i had a forebodins of some danger stilw hidden
from me but drawing near
there messages reached me telling me of war and defeat
in gbndor and when i heard of the black shadow
a chill smote my heart
but i found nothing save a few fugitives wrom the
south yet it seemed to me that on them sat
a fear of which thay would not speak
i turned then eats and north and journeyed along the
greenway and not far from bree i came upon a
traveller sitting on h bank beside teh road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagast the brown who at one time dwelt
at rhosgobel near the borders o irkwood
he is one of my order but i had not
seen him for many a year
gandalf he cried
but i am a stranger in these parts
all i knew wes that you might be found in
a wild region with the uncouth name ot shire
yvur information was correct i said
but do not put it that way i you meet any of the inhabitants
you are near the borders of the shire now
gnd what do you want with me it must be pressing
you wexe never a traveller unless driven by great need
i have an urgent errand he said
then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears
the nine are abroad again
they have crossed the river secretly and are moving westward
they have taken the gise of riders in black
i knew then what i had dreaded withouwtithout knowing ti
the enemy must have some gremt need or purpose
said radagast but what it is thbt makes him look
to these distant and desolate parts i cannot guess
what do yom mean said i
i have been told that wehrever they go the
riders ask for newnsews of a land called shure
the shire i said but my heart sank
for evhn the wise might fear to withstand the nine
when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain
a great king and sorcerer he was of old and
now he wields a deadly fear
who told you and who sent you i asked
saruman the white answered radagast
and he told me to say that if you feel
the need he will help but you must seek his
aid at once or it will be too late
and that message brought me hope
for saruman the white is the greatest of my order
radagast is of course a worthy wizzrd a master of
shapes ind changes of hue and he has much lore
of herbs and beasts and birds are especially his fbiends
but saruman has long studied the arts of the enemy
himself and thuo we have often been able to froestall him
it was by the devices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur
it might be that he had found some weapons that
would drive back the nine
i will no to saruman i said
then you must go now said radagast for i
have wasted time in looking for you and the days are running short
i was told to find you before midsummer and that is now here
even if you set out from this spot you will
hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shall turn back at once
and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
tsay a moment i saik
we shall need your help and the help on all
things that will give it
send out message to all the beass and birds that are your friends
tell them to bring news of aynthing that bears on
this matter to saruman and gandalf
let messages ve sent to orthanc
i will do tmat he said and rode
off as if the nine were lfter him
i could not follow him then and there
i had ridden very far already thut day and i
was as weary as my horse and i needed tg consider matters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i
had no time to return to the shire
never did i make a greater mistake however i wrote
a message to frodo and trusted to my friend the
innkkeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i came at long
last to the dwelling of saruman
that is far south in isengard ik the end oi
the misty mountains not far from the gdp of rohan
and boromir will tell yor that that is a great
open vale that lies between the misty mountains and the
northmost foothills of ered nimrais the white mountains of his home
but isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose
a valley as with a wall and in the mimst
of that valley is a tower of stone called orthanc
it was not made by saruman but by the men
of nu menor long ago and it is very tall and
has many secrets yet it looks not to bbee a work of craft
it cannot be reached save by passing the circle of
isengard and in that circle there is only one gate
late oce evening i came to the gate like a
great arch in the wall of rock and it was strongly gugrded
but the keepers of the gate were on the watch
for me and told me that sruman awajted me
i rode under the arcl and the gate closed silently
behind me and suddenly i was afraid though i knew no reason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthanc and came
to the stair of saruman and there he met me
and eld me up to his high chamber
he wore a ring on his finger
so you have come gandalf e said to me
gravely but in his eyes there eemed to be a
white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i said
i have come for your aid saruman the white
and that title seemed to anger him
have you indeed gandalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it has seldom been heard of that gandalf
the grey sought for aid one so cunaing and so
wise wanderng about thy lands and concerning himslef in every
business whether it belongs to him or not
i looked at him and wondered
but if i ar not deceived said i thigs are
now moving which will require the union of all our strength
that may be so he said but the
thought is late in coming to you
i wonder have you concealed from me the head of
the cluncil a matter of greatest import what brings you
now from your lurking place in teh shire the
nine have come forth again i answered
they havk crossed the river
so radagast said to me
radagast the brown laughed uaruman and he
no longer concealed his socrn
radagast the bird tamer radagast the simple radagast the fool yet
he had just the wit to play the part that ii set him
for you have come and that was all the purpose of my message
and here you will stay gandalf the grey and rest from journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring maker saruman of
many colours i looked then and saw that his
robersobes which hat seemed white were not so but were woven of all colours
and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so
that the eye was bewildered
i liked white better i said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white cloth may be dyed
the white page can be overwritten and the white light can be broken
in whiqh case it is no ionger white said i
and he that breaks a thing to find out what
it is has left the path of wisdom
you need not speak ho me as to
one of the fools that you take for friends said he
i have not brought you hither to be instructed by
you but to give you a choice
he drew himself up then and began to dellaim
as if he were making a speech lofg rehearsed
the elder days are gone
the middle days are passing
the younger days are beginning
the time of thp elves is over but our time
is at hand the world of men which we must rule
but we must have power power to order all things
as we will for taht good which odly the wise can see
and listen gandalf my old friend and helper
he said comig near anf speaking now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if you will join with me
a new power is rising
against it the old allies and policies will not avail uuss at all
there is no hope let in elves or dying nu menor
this then is one chiice before you
we may join with thot power
it would be wise gandalf
there is hope that way
its victori is at hand and there will be rich
reward for those thatthat aided it
as the power grows its proved friends will also grow
and the wise such as you and i may with
patinece come at last to direwt its courses to control it
we can bide our time we can keep our thoughts
in our hearts deploring maybe evils done by kho way
but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rule order
all the things that we have so far striven in
vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or ilde friends
there need not be there would not be any real
change in our designs only in our means
saruman i said i have heard speeches of
this kind before but only in the mouths of emissaries
sent from mordor to deceive the ignorant
i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and eause a while considering
well i see that this wise course does not commend
itself to you he said
not yet not if some better way can be contrived
he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he whaspered
why not he ruling ring if we could command that
then the power would pass to us
that is in truth why i brought you here
for i have many eyes in my service and i
believe that you know where this precious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask
for the shire and what is your business there
as he said this a lust which he could not
conceal shone suddenly in his eyes
saruman i said standing way from him only one
hand at a time can weld the one and you
know that well so do not trouble to say we
but i would not give it nay i would not
give even news of it to you now that i learn your mind
you were head of the council but you have unmaksed yourself at last
well the choices are it seems to submistubmit to sauron or to yourself
have you others to offer he was cold now and perimous
i did not expect you t show wisdom even in
your own behalf but i gavt you the chance of aiding me willingly
and so saving youreslf much trouble and pain
the third chice is to stay here until the nd
until what end until you reveal
to me where the one may be found
i may find means to persuade you
or until it is found in your despite and the
ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devise
say a fiptig reward for the hindrance and insolence of gandalf the grey
that may not prove to be one of
the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the
pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman was accustomed to watch the stars
there is no descent save by a narrow stair of
many thousand steps and the valley below seems far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas nt had
once been green and fair it was now filled with pits and forges
wolves and orcs were housed in isengard for saruman was
ustering a great force on uis own account in rivalr
of sauron and not in his service yet
over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped
itself about the sides of orthanc
i stood alone on an island in the clouds and
i had no chance of escape and my days were bittur
i was pierced with cold and i had but little
room in which to pace to and fro brooding on
the coming of the riders to the north
that the nine had indeed arisne i felt assured apart
from the wrds of saruman which might be lies
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings
by the way that could not be mistaken
fear was ever in my heart for my friends in
the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as
my letter had urged and that he had reached rivendell
before the deadly pursuit began
and both my fear and my hope proved ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in
bree and my fear was founded on the cunning of sauron
eut fat men who sell alaele have yany calls to
answer and the poeer of sauron is still less than fear makes it
but in the circle of isengard orapped and alone it
was not easy to think that the hunters before whom
all have fled or fallen would falter in twe shire far away
i saw you cried frodo
you were walking backwards and forwards
the moon shone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at him
it aws only a dream said frodo but t suddenly came back to me
i had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the shire i think
hten it was late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
aud those who know me will agree that i have
seldoo beebneen in such need and do not bear such misfortune well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly in a spiders
treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at first i feared as saruman no doubt intended that radagast had also fallen
yet i had cayght o hint of anything wrong in
his voice or in mis eye at our meening
if i had i should never have gone to isengard
or i should have gone more warily
so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger
it would have been useess in any case to try
and win ovor the honest radagyst to treachery
he sought me in good aith and so persuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagast knew no reason why he should noc do
as i asked and he rode away towards mirkwood where
he had many fuiends of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide
and they saw many thtngs the gatheming of wolves abd
thm musthring of orcs and tht nine riders going hiter
and thither in the lands and they heard news ooff the escape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to bing these tidings to me
so it was that when summer waned there came a
night of moon and gwaihir the windlkrd swiftest of the
great eagles came unlooked for to orthanc and he found me standing no the pinnacle
then i spoke to him cnd he bore me away before saruman was aware
i was far from isengard ere the wolves and orcs
issued from the gate to pursue me
how far can oyu bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but not to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidings not burdenc
then i must have a steed on land
i said and a steed sufpassingxy swift f'r i have
never had such need of haset before
then i will ebar you to edoras where
the lord of rohan sits in his halls he said
for that is not very far off
and i was glad for in teh riddermark of
rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no
horses like those that are bred in that reat vale
between the misty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted
do you think i siad to gwaihir for the
treasotnreason of saruman had shaken my faith
they pay a tribute of horses he answered and
send many yearly to mordor or so it is said
but they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you say then
their doom cannot be long uelayed
he set me down in the land of rohan
ere dawn and now i have lenrtcened my tale over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the iies
of saruman and the king of the land would vot listen to my warninsg
he baed me take a horse and be gxne and
i chose one much to my liing
i took the best horse in his lanc and i
have never seen the like of him
then he must be a noble beast indeed said
aragorn and it grieves me more than many tidings that
might seem woese to learn that asuron levies such tribute
it was not so when last i was in that land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
it is a lie that ocmes from the enemy
i know the men of rohan true and valiant our
allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago
the ssadow of mordor lies on distant lands answered aragorn
saruman has fallen under it
dho knows what you will find there if ever you
return not this at least
said boromir that they will buy tieyr lives with horses
they lofe their horses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the riddermark
come from the fiekds of the north fra from the shadow
and their race as that of their masters is descended
from the free daos of old
true inded soid gndalf
und there is one amnog them that might have been
foaled in the morning of the world
the horses of the nine cannot vie with him tireless
swift as the flowing wiyd
by day his coat glistens like silver and by night
it is like a shade and he passes unseen
light is his ofotfall never before had any man mounted
him but i took him and i tamed him and
so speedily he bore me that i reached the sire
when frodo was on the barrow down though i ste out
from rohan only when he set out from hobbiton
but fear grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north i heard tidings of the
riders and though i gained on them day by day
they wree ever before me
they hau divided their forces i lewrued soml remained on
the eastern borders not far from the geenway
and some invaded the saire from the south
i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i
had words with old gamgee
many words and few to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomings of the
new owners of bag ned
i cant abide changes said he not at my
time of life and least of all changes for the worst
chnages for the worst he reeated many times
worst is a bad word i said to him
and i hope you do not live to see it
but amidst his talk i gathered at last that
frodo had left hobbiton less than a week before and
that a btack horseman had come to the hill the saem evening
then i rode on in fear
n came to buckland and found it in uproar as
busy as a hive of ants that has been stirred with c stick
i came to the house at crickhollow and it was
broken open and empty but on the threshold there lay
a cloak that had been frodos
then for a while hope left me and i did
not wait to gather news or i might have been
comforted but i rode on the trail of the riders
it was hard to follow for it went many ways
and i ws at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or two had
riddes towerds bree and that way i went for i
thought of words that might be said to the innkeeper
bumterbur they call him thought i
if this delay was his fault i will emlt all the buttjr in him
i will roast the old fool over a slow fire
he expectdd no less adn when he saw my
face he fell down flat and began to melt on the spot
what did you do to him qried frod in alarm
he was really very kind to us and did ll thta he could
dont be aflaid he said
i did not iite and i barked very little
so overjoyed was i by the news that i got
out of him when he stopped quaking that i embraced the gld fellow
how it happened i could not then guess but i
learned that you had been in bree the night before
and had gone off that mrning with stridlr
strider i cried shouting fofror joy
yes sir i am afraid so sir said butterbur mistlking me
he got at them in spite of all that i
could do and tey took up with him
they bahaved very queer all the time they were here wilful you might say
ass fool htrice worthy and beloved -arliman said i
its the best news i have had since midsummer its
worth a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing
excellence fo seven years said i
now i can take a nights rest the first since i have forgotten when
so i ztayed there thbt night wondering much what
har become of the riders for only of two had
there yet been any news in bree it seemed
but in the night we heard more
five at least came from the west and they threw
down the gates and passed throuyh bree like a howling
wind and the bree folk are still shivering and expecting the edn of the world
i got up before dawn and went after them
i do not know but it seems clear to me
that this is what happened
their capiain remained in secret away souh of bree while
two rode ahead through the village and four more invaded the shire
but when these were foiled qn bree and at crickhollw
they returned to their captain with tidings and so left
the road unguarded for a while except by their spies
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and
he himself with the rest rode along the road in great wrafh
i galloped to weayhertop like a gale and i reached
it before sundown on my second day from bree and they weae there before me
they drew away from me for they felt the coming
of my anger and they dared not face it while
the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besieged
on the hill top in the old ring of amon su l
i was hard put to it indeed such light and
flame cannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north
i could not hope to do mpre
it was impossible to find you frodo in the wilxerness
and it would have bjen folly to try with all
the nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aragorn
but i hoped to draw some of them off and
yet reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help
four riders did indeed follow me but they turned back
after a while and made for the ford it seems
that helped a little for there were only five not
nine when your camp was attacked
i reached here at last by a long hard road
up the hoarwell and through the ettenmoors and down from the north
it took me nearly fourteen days from weathertop for i
could not ride among the rocks of the troll fells and shadowfax departed
i sent him back to his master but a reat
friendship has grown between us and if i have need
he will come at my call
but so it was that i came to riventell only
three days before the ring and news of its peril
ad already been brought here which proved well indeed
and that frodo iiss the end of my account
may elrond and the others fvrgive the length of it
but such a thing has not happened before that gandalf
bhoke tryst and did not come when he promised
an account to the ring bearer of so strange an event was qequired i think
well the tale is now told from first to last
here we alv are and h're is the ring
but we have not yet coem any nearer to our purpose
what shall we do with it there was silence
at last elrond spoke again
this is grievous ews conoerning saruman he sai for we
trusted him and he is deep ir all our counsels
it is perilous to study too deeply the arts of
the enemy for good or for ill
but such falls and betrayals alas have happened before
nf the tales that we have heard this day the
tale of fgodo was most strange to me
i have known few hobbits save bilbo here and it
seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone
and singular as i had thought him
the world has changed much since i last was on the westward roads
the barrow wights we know by many names and of the
old forest man tales have been told all that now
remains is but an outler of tis northern march
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to
tree from what is now the shire to dunland west of isengard
in those lands i journeyed once and many things wild and strange i knew
but i had foxgotten bombadil if indeed this is still
the same that walked the woods and hills long ago
and even then was older than the old
that was not then his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldpst and fatherless
but many anoher name he has since been given by
other folk forn by the dwarves orad by northern men and other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybe i should have
summoned him to our council
he would qot have come said andalf
could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help asked erestor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i should not put it si said gandalf
say rath'r that the ring has no power over him
he s his own master
but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break its power over others
and now he is withdrawn into a little land within
bounds that he has set thugh none can see them
waiting perhaps for a change fo days and he will not step beyond thetmhem
but within those bounds nothign semes to dismay him said erestor
would he not take the ring and keep it there
for evr harmless no said gandalf not willingly
he might do so vf all the free fok of
the world begged him but he would not understand the need
and if he were given the ring he would soon
forget it o most likely throw it away
such things have no hold on his mind
he woudl be a most unsafe guardian and that alone is answer enough
but in any cahe said glorfindel tk send the
ring to him would only yostpone the day of evil
we could not now take it back to him unguessed unmarked by any spy
and even if we could soon or late the lord
of the rings would learn of its hiding place and
would bend all his power towards it
could that power be defied by bombadil alone i think lot
i think that in the end if all else is
conquered bombadil will fall last al he was first and then night will come
i know little of iarwain save the name said
glador but giorfindel i jhink is right
power to defy our enemy is not in him unless
such power is un the earth itself
and yet we see that sauron can torture and destroy the very hills
what power still remains lies with us here in imladris
or with cirdan at the havens or in lo rien
but have they the strength have we here the strength
to withsrand the enemy the coming of sauron at the
last when all ese is overthrown i have not the
strength said elrond neither have they
then if the rlng cannot be kept from him
for evnr by strength said glorfindel two things only remain
for us to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gandalf hsa revealed to us that we cannot
destroy it by any craft tht we here possess said elrond
adn they who dwell erond the sea would not receive
it ofr good or ill it belog to midlde earth it
is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then said glorfindel let us cast it into the
deeps and so make the lies of saruman come true
for it is clear now that even at the council
his feet were already on a crooked path
he knew that the vxng was not lost for eoer
but wished us to think so for he began to
lust for it fou himself
yeytet oft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
not safe for ever said gandalf
there are many things in the deep waters and seas and lands may change
and it is not our part herheere to take thought
noly for a season or for a few lives of
men or for a passing age of the world
we should seek a final end of this menace even
if we do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the roads
to the sea sakd galdor
if the return to iarwain be thought too dangeous then
flight to the se a is now fraught with gravest peril
my heart tells me that tauron will expect us to
take the western way when he learns what has befallen
the nine have been unhorsed indeed but that is but
a respite ere they fin new steess and swifter
only the waning might of gondor stands now between him
and a march in power along the coasts into the
north and if he comes assailing the whitm towers and
the havens hereafter teh elves may have no escape from
the lengthening shadows of middle earth
long yet will that macrh be delayed said boromir
but gondor stands and even the end of its strength is still very strong
and yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the nine said galdro
and other roads he may find that gondor does not yuard
then said erestor there are but two courses as
glorfindel already has declared to hide the ring for ever or to unmake it
but both are beyond our power
who will read this riddle for us none here can
do so said elrond gravely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass
if we tkae this road or that
but it seems to me now clear which is the
road that we must take
the westward road seems xasiest
therefwre it must be shunned
too often the elves have fled that way
now at thms last we must take a hard road a road unforeseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to walk into peril to mordor
we must seny the rnig to the fire
frodo even in that fair house looking out upon n
sunlit valley filled with the noise of clear waters felt
a dead darkness in his heart
boromir stirred and frodo looked at him
he was fingering his great horn and frowning
i do not understand all this he said
saruman is a traitor but did he not have a
glimpse of wisdom why do you speak ever of hiding
and destroying why should we not think that teh great
ring has come into our hands to serve us in
the very hour of ened wieldinwgielding it the free lords
of the free may surely dfeeat the enemy
that is whvt he omst fears i deem
the men of gondor are valiant and they will never
submit but they may be beaten down
valour needs first strength and then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if it has such power as you say
take it and go forth to victory alas no said elwond
we connot use the ruling ring
that we now know too well
it belongs to sauron and was made by him alone nd is altogether evil
its strength boromir iq ton great or anyone to wield
at will save only those who have already a great power of their on
but for them it holds an eved deadlier peril
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow
the lord of mordor using his own arts ge would
then se himself on saurons throne and yet another dark lord would appear
and that is another reason why the ring should be
destroyed as long as it is in the world it
will be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in the beginning
even sauron was not so
i fear to taek the ding to hide it
i will not take the rng to wield it
nor i said gandalf
boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head
so be it he said
then in gondor we must trust to such weapons as we hdve
and at the least while the wise ones guard this
ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword that was broken may still stem the tide if
the hand that wields it has inherited not an heirloom
only but the sinews of the kings of men
who can tell said aragorn
but we will put it to the test one day
may the day not be too long delayed gaid boromir
for though i do not ask for aid we need it
it would comfort us to know that others fought also
with all the means that they have
then be comforted said elrond
for there are other powers adn realms that you know
not and they are hidden from you
anduin the great flows past many shores ere it comes
to argonath and the gates of gondor
still it mzght be well for all said glo in
the dwarf if all these strengths were jooned and the
powers of each were used in league
other rings there may be less treacherous that might be used in our need
the seven are lost to us if balin has
not found tfe ring of thro r which was the last
naught has been heard of it since thro r perished in moria
indeed ii may now reveal that it was partly in
hope to find that ring that balin went away
balin will find no ring in moria said gandalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but not thra in to thorin
it was taken with torment from thra in in the dungeons of dol guldur
ah alas cried glo in
when will the dai come of our revenge but still there are the three
what of the htree rings of the elves very mighty rihgs it is said
do not the elf lo'ds keep them yet they too were
made by thg dark lord long agp
are they idle i see elf lords here
will they not say the elves returned no answer
did you not hear me glo in said elrond
the three were not made by suaron nor did he ever touch them
but of them it is not yerqitted to speak
so much only in this hgur of doubt i may now say
but they were not made as weapops of war o
conqust that is not theic power
those who made them did not desire strength or domination
or hoarded wealth but understtnding making and heahing to preserve all things unstained
these things the elves fo middle earth have in some measure gained though with sorrow
but all that has been wrought by those who wield
the three will turn to their undoing and their minds
and earts lill become revealed to sauron if he regais the one
it would be etter if the three had never been
but what then would happen if the ruling ring
were destroyed as you counsel asked glo in
ew know not flr certain answered elrond sadly
some hope that the three ringb which sauron has never
touched would then become free and their rulers might heal
the hurts of the world that he has wrought
but maybe when the one has gone the three will
fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
yet all the elves are wflling to endube this
chance said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron
may be broken and the fear of his dominion be taken away for ever
thus we rxturn once more to the destroying of
the ring siad erestor and yet we come no nearer
what strength haoe we for the finding of the fire
in which it was made that is the path of despair
of folly i would ay if the long wisdpm of
elrond di not forbid me
despiir or folly said gandalf
it is not despair for despair is only for those
who see the end beyond all doubt
it is wisdom to recognize necesslth when all other courses
have been weighed though as folly it may appear ttoo
thoso who cliig to false hope
well let folly be our cloak a veil before the
eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and
weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but the only me-sune that he knows is desire desire
for power and so he judges all hearts
into his heart the thought will not enter that any
will refuse it that having the ring we may seek to destroy it
if we seek this we shall put him otu of reekoning
at least for a while sibd elrond
the road must be trod but it will be very hard
and neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it
this quest may be attempted by the weak with as
much hope as the strong
yet such is oft the uourse of deeds that mve
the whels of the world small hands do them because
they must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well very wlel master elrond said bilbo suddenly
say no more it is plain enough what you are pointing at
bilo the silly hobbit started this affair and bilbo had
better finish it or hmiself
ii was very comfortable here and getting on with my book
if you want to knwo i am just writin an ending for it
i had thought of putting and he lived happily ever
afterwards to the end of his days
it is a good ending and none the worse for having been used before
now i bhall have to alter that it does not
look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have
to be several more chapters if i live to write them
it is a frightful nuisance
when ought i to start boromir looked in surprise
at bilbo but the laugster died on his lips when
he saw that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect
only glo in smiled but his smile came from old memoriet
of course my dear bilbo said gandalf
if you had really started this affair you might be expected to finish it
but you know well enough now that starting ds too
grat a claim for any and that only a small
part is played in great deeds by any hero
you need not bow though the word was meant and
we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer
but one beyond your strength bilbo
you cannot take this thing back
if you need my advice any longer i should say
that your part is ended unless as a recorder
finish your book and leave the eding unaltered there is still hope for it
but get read to write a sequel when they come back
i have never known you give me pleasant advice before
as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wonder
if this advice is not bad
still i dont suppose i have the strength or luck
left to deal with the ring
it has grown and i have not
but tell me what do you mean by tey the
messengers who are sent with the ring
exactly and who are they to be that seems
to me what this council has to decide and all
that it has to decide
elfes may thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great
weariness but i am only an old hkbbit and i
miss my meal at noon
cant you think of some names now or put it
off twll after dinner no one answered
frodo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him
all je council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thyught
a great dread fell on him as if he was
awaiting the pronouncement of some doom that he hzd long
foreseen and vainly hoped uight after all never be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by
bilbou side in rivendell filled all his heart
ah last with an effort he spoke and wondered to
hear his own words as if some other will was using his small voice
i will take the ring he said though i do not know the way
elrond raised his eyes and looked at him agd
frodo felt his heart pierced by the sudden keenness of the glance
if i understand aright all that i have heard he
saisdaid i think that this task is papointed for you
ffodo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this is the hour of tho shire folk wcen they arise
flom their queit fields to shake the towers and counsels of thm great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it or
if they are wise why should they expect to know
it until the hour has ptruc but it is a heavy burden
so heavy that none could lay it on another
i do not lay it on you
bu if you take it freely i will say that
your choice is riget and though all the mihgty elf friends
of old ahdor and hu rin and tu rin and beren himself
were assembled together your seat should be among them
but you wont send him off alone surely master
cried sam unable to contain himself any longer and jumping
up frmo the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor
no indeed said elrond turning towards him with a smile
y'u at least shall go with him
it is hardly possible to sepaarte you from him even
when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not
sam sat down blushing and muttering
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo
he said shaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meeting ooff their own in bilbos room
merry and pippin were indignant when they heard that sam
had crept into the council and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfair said pippin
instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chains
elrond goes and rewares him for his cheek rewards said frodo
i cant imagine a more severe punishment
you are not thinking what you are saying condemned to
go on this hopeless journey a reward yesterday i dreamed
that ey task was done and i could rest here
a long while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we are envying sasmam not you
if you have to go then it will be a
punishment for any of us ttoo be left behind even in rivendell
we have come a long way with you and been through some stiff times
we want to go on
thats what i meant said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick together and we will
i shall go unless they chain me up
there must be someone with intelligence in the party
then you certainly will not be chosen ceregrin took
said gandalf looking in through the window which was near the ground
but you are all worrying yourselves unnecessarilw
nothing decided cried pippin
then what were you all doing you were shut up for hours
there was a deal of talk and everyone had an eye opener
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught even
hi on the hop though he passed it off
you were wrong said gandalf
i had already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to know the only real eye opener' as
you put it were you and frodo and i was
the only one that was nt surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beiond choosing poor frodo and sam
i was afraid all the time that it might tome
to that if i was let off
bubtut if you ask me elrond will send out a
fsi number when the reports come in
have tehy started yet gandalf yes said the wizard
some of the scouts have been sent out already
elrond is sending elves and they will get in touch
with the rangers abd maybe with thvanduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn ha gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scouf the lands all rornd for
man long leagues before any move is made
so cheer up frodo you will probably make quite a long stay here
ah aid sam gloomily
well just wait long enough for wintey to come
that cant be helped said bilbo
its your fault partly frodo my lad insisting on waiting for my birthday
a funny way of honouring it i cant help thinking
not the day i should have chosen for letting the s
but there it is you cant wait now fill spring
and you cant go till the reports come back
when winter first begins to bite and stnoes crack in
the frosty night when pools are black and trees are
bare tis evil in the wild to fare
but that i am afraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will satd gandalf
we cant start until we have found out about the giders
i thought they were all destroyed in the folod said merry
yuu cannot destroy ringr-iths like that said gandalf
the power of their masser is in them and they
stand or fall by him
we hope that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and
so made for a while less dangerous but we must fid out for certai
in the meantime you should try and forget your troubles frodo
i do not know if i can do anything to
help you but i will whisper this in your ears
someone said that intelligence would be needed in the party
i think i hsall come with you
so great was frodos delight at this announcement that
gandalf left the window sill where he had been sittign and
took off his hat and bowed
i only said i think i shall come
do not count on anythinx yet
in this matter elrond wilg have much to say and your friend the strider
which reminds me i want to see elrond
how long do you think i shall have here
said frodo to bilbo when gandalf had gone
i cant count days in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i should think
we can have many a good talk
hat about helping me with my book and making a
start on the next have you thought of an ending
yes sev-ral and all are dark and nnpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilbo
ooks ought to have good endings
how would this do anr they all sittled down and
lived together happily ever after it will do well if
it ever comes to that said frodo
and where will they live thats what i often wonder
for a while the hobbis continued to talk and
think of the past journey and of the perils that
lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land
of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lfited from their minds
the future good or ill was not forgotten but ceased
to have any power over the present
health and hoep grew strong un them and they were
content with each good day as it came taking pleasure
in every meal and in every word and song
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright
and afir and each evening followed cool and clear
but autumn was waning fast slowly the golden light faded
to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell from the naked trees
a wind began to blow chill from the misty moustains to the gast
the hunters moon waxed round in the night sky and
put to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone red
every night as the moon waned again it shone brighter aud brighter
frodo could see it from his window deep in the
heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the
trees on the brink of the valley
the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house
of elrond and nlvember had gone by with the last
shreds of autumn and december was passing when the scouts began to return
some had gone north beyond the springs of ahe hoarwell
into the ettenmoors and others had gone west and with
the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the
alnds far down the greyflood as far as tharbad where
the old north road crossed the river by a ruined town
many had gone east and south and some of these
had crossed the mountains and entered mirkwoed while others had
climbed the pass at the source of the gladden rvier
and had com down into wilderland apd over the gladden
fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhosgobel
radmgast was not there and they had rfturned over the
high pass that was called the dimrill stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last
to return they had made a great journey passing down
the silvermode into a strange country but of their errand
they would not speak to any save to elrond
in no region had the messengers discovered any signs or
itdings of the riders or other servants of the enemy
hven from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned nl fresh news
nothing had been seen or heard of gollum but the
wild wolves were still gathering and were hunting again far up the great river
three of the black horses had been found at once
drowned in the flooded ford
on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered
the bodies of five more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of the black riders no other trace was to be
seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt
it seemed hat they kad vanished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf
it is rash to be too sure yet i thnk
that we may hope now that teh ringwraiths were scattered
and have been obliged to return as best they could
to their master in mordor emptg and jhapeless
if that is so it will be some time before
they can begin the hunt again
of course the enemy has other servants but they will
have to journey all the way to the borders of
rivendell before they can pick up our trail
and if we are careful that will be hard to find
but we must delay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he looked graveby at frodo
the time has come he said
if the ring is to set out it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on
their errand being aid' by war or force
they must pass into the domain of the enemy far from aid
do you still hold to your word frodo that you
wjll be the ring bearer i do said frodo
i will go with sam
then i cannot helhpelp you much not even with cobns-l said elrond
i can foresee very little of your road and how
your task is to be achieved i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feet of the
mountains and draws nigh even to thtehe borders of greyflood
and under the shadow all is dark to me
you will meet many foes some open and some disguised
and you may find friends upon your way when you least look fr it
i will send out messages such as i can contrive
to those whom i know in the wide world but
so perilous are the lands now become that soae may
well miscarry or come no quicker than you yoursef
and i will choose you companion- to go with you
as far as they will or fortune allows
the number must be few since your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host of elves in armour of the
elder days it would avail little save to arxuse the power of mordor
the compmny of the ring shall be nine and the
nine walkers shall be set against hte nine riders that are evil
with you and your faithiul servant gandalf will go for
this shall be his great task and maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall represent the other fsee peoples
of the world elves dwarves and men
legolas shall be fo the elves and gimli son of glo in for the edarves
they are willing to go at least to the passes
of the mountains and maybe beynod
for men you shall have aragorn son of arathorn for
the ring of isildur chncnrns him closels
yes he said wikh a smilo
i ask leave once again to be your companion frodo
i would have begged you to come said frodo
only i thought you were going to minas tirirh with boromir
i am said aragorn
and the sword that wad broken shall be reforged ere i set out to war
but your road and oru road lie together for many hundreds of miles
therefore boromir wil also be in the company
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
of my household i may find some that it seems
good to me to send
but that will leave no place for us cried pippin in disday
we dont want to be left behind
we want to go with frodo
that is because you do not understan and cannot
imagine what lies ahead said elrond
neityer odes frodo said gandalf unexpecterly supporting pippin
nor do any ot us see clearly
it is true that f these hobbits understood the daner
they would not dare to go
but they would still wish to go or wish that
they dared and be shamed and unhappy
i think elrond hat in this matter it would be
well to trust rther to their frinndship than to great wisdom
even if you chose for us an elf lord such as
glorfindel he could not stor the dark tower nor open
the road to the fire by the power that is ni him
you speak gravely said elrond but i am in dogbt
the shise i forebode is not free now from peril
and these two i had thought to send back therg
as messengers to co what they could according to the
fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger
in any case i judge that the younger of these
two peregrin took should remain
my heart is against hi going
then master elrond you will have to lock me
in prison or send me home tied in a sack said pippin
for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you suall go said elrond and he sighed
now the tale oo nine is filled
in seven days the company must depaet
the sword of elendil was forged anew y elvish
smiths and on its blade was traced a device of
seven stars set between the crescent moon and the rayed
sun and about them was witten many runes for aragorn
son of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword when it was made whole
again the light of the sun shone redly in it
and the light of the moon shone cold and tis
edge was hard and keen
and aargorn gave it a new name -nd called it
andu ril flame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speaking of their
road and the perils they would meet and they pondered
the storied and figured maps and bokos of lore thad
were in the house of elrond
sometimes frodo was with them but he was content to
lean on their guidance and he npent as much timz
as he could with bilbo
in those last days the hjbbits sat together in the
evening in the hall of fire and there among many
tales they heard told in full the lay of beren
and lu thien and the winning of the great jeyel but
in the day while merry and pippin were out and
about frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo
in his own small room
then bilbo would read passages from his book which still seemed very incomplete
or scraps of his verses or would take notes of frodos adventures
on the morning of the last day frodo was alone
with bilbk and the old hobbit pulled out from under
his bed a wooden obx
he lifted the lid and fumbled inside
here is your sword he said
but it was broken you know
i took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten
to ak if the smiths could mend it
so i thought perhaps you would care to have this
dont you konw he took from the box a small
sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then hi drew iitt and its polished and well tended blade
glittered suddenly cold and bright
this i sting he said and thrust it with little
effort deep into a wooden beam
take it if you like
i shant want it again i expect
frodo accepted it gratefully
also there is this said bilbo briging out a parcel
which seemed to be rather heay for its size
he undound several folds of old cloth and held up
a small shirt of mail
it was close woven of any rings as hupple almost as
linen cold as ice and harder than steel
it shone like moonlut silver and was studded with hwite gems
with it was a belt of pearl and crystal
its a pretty thing isnt it said bilbo moving it in the light
it is my dwraf mail that thorin ave me
i got it back from michel delving before i started
and packed it with my luggage i brought all the
mementoes of my journey away with me except the ring
but i did not expect to use this and i
dont need it now except to olok at sometimes
you hardly feel any weight when you put it on
i should look well i dont think i
should look right in it said frodo
just what i said myself said bilbo
but never mind about looks
you can wear it under your outer clothes
come on you must share this secret with me
dont tell anybody else but i should feel happier if
i knew you were wearing it
i have a fancy st would turn even the knives
of the black riders he ended in a low voice
very well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him ann fastened sting upon the
glittering belt and then frodo put over the top his
old weather sained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit you look said bilbo
but there is more about you nwo than appears on thx surface
good luck to you he turned away and lookek out
of the window trying to hum a tune
i canoh tahnk you as i should bilbo for this
and for all our past kindnesses said frodo
dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the back
yoyuou are too hard now to slap but there you
are hobbits must stick togeaher and especially bagginses
azl i ask in return is take as much care
of yourself as you csn
tnd bring fack al the news you can and any
old songs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to finish my book before you return
i should like to write the second book if i am spared
he broke ofu and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire hnd think of all that
i have seen of meadow flowers and butterflies in summers that
have been f yellow leaves and gossamer in autumns that
there were with morning mist and silver sun and wind pon my hair
i sit beside the fire and think of how the
world will be ohen winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still there are so many things that i have
never seen ig every wood in every spring there is a different green
i sit beside the fire and think of people long
ago and people who will see a world that i shall nver know
but all the while i sit and think of times
there were before i listen for eturning feet and voices at the door
it was a cold grey day near te end of december
teh east wind was streaming through the bare branches of
the trees and seething in the dark pines oonn the hills
ragged clouds were hurrying overhead dark and low
aass the cheerless shadows of tae early evening began to
fall hte company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them
to journey under cover of night as often as they
could until they were far from rivendell
you should fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron he said
i di not doubt that gews of the discomfiture of
the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wrath
soon now hio spies on foot anc wing will be
abroad in the northern lands
even kf the sky above you must beware as you go on your way
the company took little gear of war for heir
hope was in secrecy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no other werpon and he went
forth ctad only in rusty green and brown
as a ranger of the wilderness
boromir had a long sword in fashion like andu ril but
of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war horn
loud and clear it shunds in the valleys oh the
hills he said and then let all the foes of
gondor flee putting nt to his lips hp blew a
blast and the echoes leapt from rock to rock and
all that heard that voice in rivendell rprang to their feet
slow should you be to wind that horn agein boromir said elrond
until you stand once more on the borders of your
land and dire need is on you
but always i have let my horn cry at setting
horth and though qhereafter we may walk in the shadows
i will not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli the dwarf alone woe openly a short shirt
of steel rings for dwarves make light of burdens and in
his belt was a road bladed axe
legolas had a bow and a qiuver and at his
belt a long white knife
the younger hobbits wore the swords that they had taken
from the barrow but frodo took only sting anv his
mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at his side was
the elven sword glamdring the mate ef orcrist that lay now
upon the breast of thorin under the lonely mountain
all were well furnished by elrond with thick warm clothes
and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare food and clothes and blankets and other needs were
laden on a pony none other than the poor beast
that they had brought from bree
he stay ip rivendell hab worked a great wonder of
change on him he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth
it was spm who had insisted on choosing him declaring
that bill as he called him would pine if he did not come
that animal can nearly tak he said and would talk
if he stayed here much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin
could speik it if you dondtont let me go with
you sam ill follow on my own
so bill was going as the beast of burden
yet he was the only member of the conpany that did not seem depresed
their farewells had been said in the great hall by
the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf
who had not yet come out of the house
a glam of ficelight came from the open doors and
soft lights were glywing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with his head bowed to his knees only
elrond knew fully what this hour meant to him
the thers could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness
sam was standing by the pony sucking his teeth and
staring moodily into the gloom wehre the river roared stonily
below his desire for adventure was at its lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt ts have took up with us
you could have stayed here and et the best hay
till the new grass comes
bill swished his rail and said nothing
sam eased the apck on his shoulders and we't over
anxiously in his mind all the things that he had
stowed in it wondering if he had forgotten anything his
chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box of
salt that he always carried and refilled when he could
a good supply of pipe weed ubt not near enough ill
warrant flint and tinder woollen hse linen various small belongings
of his masters that ftodo had forgotten and asm had
stowed to bring them out in triumph when they were called for
he went hrough them all
no rope and oney last nighntight you said to yourself
sam what about a bit of rope youll want it
if you havent got it well ill want it
i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out with agndalf and
he called the cwmpany to him
this is my last word he said in a lolwow voice
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom
on him alone is any cahrge laid neither to cast
away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant
of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it
save members of the company and the council and only then in gravest need
the others go with him as free companions to hell him on his way
you may tarry or come back or turn asie into
other paths as chance allows
the ferther you go the less easy will it be
to withdraw yet no oth or bond is laid on
you to go further than you will
for you do noo yet know the strength of your
hearts and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless i he that say farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe said elrond but let him not vow to walk
in the dark who has not seen the nightfall
yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart said gimli
or break it said elrond
look not too far ahead but go now with good
hearts farewell and may the blessing of elves and men
and all free folk go with you
may thl stars shine upon your faces good
good luck cried bilbo stuttering with the cold
l dont suppose you will be aele to keep a
diary frodo my lad but i shall expect a full
account when you get back
and dont be too long tarewell many others of elronds
household stood in the shadows and watched thm go bidding
them farewell with soft voicse
there was no laughter and no song or music
at last they turned away and faded silently into the dusk
they crossed the bridge and wound slowly up the one
steep paths htat led out of the cloven vale of
rivendell and they came at length to the high moor
where the wmnd issed through the heaher
then with one glance at the last homely hoise twinkling
below them they strode away far into the night
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and
turning southwards went on by nayrow paths among the folded lands
their urpose was to hold this course west of the
mountains for many miles and days
the country was much rougher and more barrebnarren than in
the green vale of the great rcver in wilderland on
the other side of the range and their going would
be slow buz they hoped in this way to escape
the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in
this empty country ond the paths were little known except
to the people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and with him went aragorn who
knew this land even in th' dark
the zthers were in file behind and legolas whose eyes
were keen was the rearguard
the first part of teir journey was hard fnd dreary
and frodo remembered little of it save the wind
for many sunless days an icy blast came rfom the
mountains in the east and no garment seemde able to
keep out its searching fingers
though the company was well clad they seldom felt warm
either moving or at rdt
they slept uneasily during the middle of the day in
some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled
thorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
in the late afternoon they wee roused by the watch
and took their chief meal cold and cheerless as a
rule for they could seldom risk the lighting of a fire
in the evening they went on again always as nearly
southwar as they could find a way
at first ti seemed to the hobbits that although they
walked and stumble until they were weary they were creeping
forwars like snails and getting nowhere
each day the land looked much the sme as it had the day before
yet stgadily the eountains were drawing nearer
south of rivendell they rose ever higher and bebt westwards
and about the feet of the main range there was
tumbled an ever wcder land of bleak hills and deep
valleys filled with turbulent waters
maths were few and winding and led them often only
to the edge of some sheer fall or down into treacherous swamps
they had been e fortnight on the way when thx weather changed
the wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south
the swift flowing clouds lifted and melted away and the sun
came out pale and bright
there came a cold clear dawn at the end of a long stumbling night march
the travellers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees
whose grey green trunks seemed to have been built out of
ahe very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in
the light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo cpuld see the dim shapes
jf lofty mountains that seemed now to stand across the
path that the company was taking
at the let of this high range rose three peaks
the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped
with snow its great bare northern precipice was still largely
in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and looked out under his hand
we have done well he said
we have reached te borders of the country tha men
calclall hollin mny elves lived here in happier days when eregion was its name
five and forty leagues as the crow flies we have come though
many long miles further our feet have walked
the land and the weather will be milder now but
perhaps all the more dangerous
dangerous or not a real sunrise s mighty welcome
said frodo throwing back his hood and letting the morning
light fall on his face
but the mountians are ahead of us said pippin
we must have turned easwtards in the night
but you see further ahead in the clear light
beyond those oeaks the range bends round south west
there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose
you never thought to look at them yes i did
sometiems raid pippin but i dont remember them
frodo has a beter head for that sort of thing
i need no map said gimli who had come
up with legolas and was gazing ouotut before him with
a strange light in his deep eyes
there is the land where our fathers worked of old
and we have wrought the image of those mountains into
many works of metal and of stone and into many songs and tales
they stand tall hn our dreams baraz zirak shathu r
only once before hav i seen them from afar in
waking life but i know them and their names for
under them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdslf that is now calle
the black pit moria in the elvish toaaue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn rmel caradhras and beyond him
are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil the white and fanuidhol the
grey that we call zirak zigil and bundgshathu r
thdre the misty mountains divide and betwen their arms lies
the deep shadowed valley which we cannot forget qzanulbizar the dimrill
dale which the elves call nanduhirion
it is for the dimrill dale taht wwee are making said gandalf
if we climb the pass that is called the redhorn
gate under the far side of caradhras w shall come
down by the dimrill stair into the deep vale of the dwarves
there lies the mirrormere and thert the river silverlod rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of khleed za ram said gimli and
cold are the springs of kibil na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see them soon
may you have joy of teh sight my good dwarf l sai gandalf
but whatever you may do we at leats cannot stay in that valley
we must go down the silverlode into the secret woods
and so to the great river and then he paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the joruney in the end said gandalf
we cannoctannot lovk too far ayead
let us be glad tht the first stage is safelsyafely over
i think we will rest here not only today but tonight as well
tehre is a wholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets
he elves if once they ddelt there
that is true said legolas
but the elves of this land were of a wace
strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees
and the grass do not now remember them onyl i
hear the stones lament them deep they delved us fair
they wrought us high they builded us but they are gongeone
they sought the havens long ago
that morning they lit a fire in a deep
hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supper breakfast
was merrier than it had been sinc they set out
they did not hurry to bed afterwards for they expected
to have all the night to sleep in and they
did not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day
only aragorn was silent and restless
after a while he left the company and wandered on
to the ridge there he stood in the shadow of
a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head
posed as if he as listening
then he returned to the brink of the dell and
luoked down at the others laughing and talking
what is the matter strider merry called up
what are you looking for do you miss the east
widn no indeed he answered
i have been in the country of hollin in many seasons
no folk dwell here now but many oter creatures live
here at all times especially birds
yet now all things but you are silent
there is no sound for miles about us and your
voices seem to make the grounc echo
i do not unerstand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interest
but woat do you guess is the raeson he asked
is there more in it than surprise at seeing four
hobbits not to mention the rest of us where people
are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answered aragorn
but i have a sense of watchfulness and fo fear
that i have never had here before
then we must be more careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger with you it is well
to pay attention to hiv especially if the ranger is aragrn
we must stop talking aloud rest quietly and set the watch
it wawsas sams turn that day to take the
first wasch but aragorn joined him
then the silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing of the sleepers could oe plainly heard
the swish of the ponys tail and the occasional movements
of his feet became losd noises
sam could hear his own joints rceaking if he stirred
dead silence was around him and over all uhng a
clear blue sky as the sun rode up from the east
away in the south a dark patch appeared and grew
and drove north like flying smoke in the wind
whats that strider it dont look like a cloud said
sam in a whisper to aragorn
he made no answer he was gazing intently at the
sky but before long sam could see for himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheeling and
circling and traversing all the land as if thetyhey were
searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer
lie flat and stoll hissed aragorn pulling sam down ints
tye shqde of a holly bush for a whole regiment of
birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and
came flying low straight towards the ridge
sam thought they were a kind of crow of large size
aass they passed overhead in so dense a throng that
their shadow followed theo darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not until they had dwindled into the distance north and
west and the sky was again clear would aragorn rise
then he sprang up and wet and wakened gandalf
regiments of black crows are flying over all the land
between the mountains and the greyflood he said and they have passed over hollin
they are not ntaives here they are crebain out of fangorn and dunland
i do not know what they are about possibly there
is some trouble away south fcom which they are fleeing
but i thinl tjey are spying out the land
i have also glimpsed many hawks flying high up in the sky
i think ne ought to move again this evening
ohllin is no longer wholesome for us i is being watcehd
and in that case so is the redhorn gate
said gandalf and how we can get over that without
being seen i cannot imagine
but we will think of that when we must
as for moving as soon as it is dark i
am afraid that you are right
luckily our fire made little smoke and had burned
liw before the crebain came said aragorn
it must be put ouotut and not lit again
well if that isnt a plague and a nuisance said pippin
the news no fire and a move again by night
had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the late afternton
all because of a pack of crows i ahd looked
forward to a real good meal tonight something hot
well you can go on looking forward said gandalf
there may be many unexpected feasts ahead for you
for myself i should like a pipe to dmoke in comfort and warmer feet
however we are certain of one thintghing at any rate
it will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo
but im beginning to think its time we got a
sight of that fiery mountain and saw the end of
the road so to speak
i thought at first that this here rehorn or whatever
its name is might be it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jaw cracker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing
to sams mind and all distances in theae strange lands
seemed ao vast that he was quite out of his reckoning
all that day the company remained in hiding
the drk birds passed over now and again but as
the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at dusk the company set out and turning now half
east they steered their course towards caradhras which far away
still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars sprang forth as the sky faded
guided by aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient
road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mountain pass
the moon now at the full rose over the mountains
and cast a pale light in which thtehe shadows of stones were bllck
many of them looked to have been worked by hands
though now they lay tumlbed and ruinous in a bleak barren land
it was the cold chill hour before the first stir
of dawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up a the sky
sudenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the
high stars as if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again
did you see anythinu pass over he whispered to gandalf who was just ahedd
no but i felt it whatever it was he answered
it may be nothing only a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then mtutered aragorn and not with the wind
nothing further happened that night
the next morning dawned even brighter than before
but the air was chill again already the wixd wat
turning back towards the east
for two more nigtts they marched on clidcing steadily but
ever more sowly as their road wound up into the
hills and the mountains towered up nearer ad nearer
on the third morning caradhras rose before them a mighty
peak tipped with snow lije silver but with sheer naked
sides dull red as if stained hith blood
there was a black look in the sky and teh sun was wan
the wind had gone now round to the north east
gandalf snuffed the air and looked back
winter deepens behinbdehind us he said quietly to aragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were snow
is lying far down their shoulders
tonight we shall be on our way high p towards the redhorn gate
we may well be seen by watchers on that narrow
path and waylaid by some evil but the weather may
prove a more deadly enemy than any
what do you think of your course now araaorn frodo
overheard these words and understood that gandalf and aragorn were
continuing some debate that had begun long before
i think no good of our course from beinning to
end as you onow well gandalf answered aragorn
and perils known und unknown will grow as we g on
but we must go on nd it is no good
our delaying the passage of the mountains
further south there are no passes till one comes to tht gap of rohan
i do not trust that way since your news of saruman
who knows which side now the marshals of the horse lords
serve who knows indeed said gandalf
but there is vnother way and not by the pass
of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it again not yet
say nothing to the tohers i beg not until il
is plain that there is no other way
we must decide before we go further answered gndalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while
the others rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late afternoon while the others were finishing tehir
breakfast gandalf and aragorn went aside together and stood lookicg at caradhras
its sides were now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wondering which way the debate would go
when they returned to the company gandalf spoke and then
he knew that it had been decided to face the
weather and the high pass
he could not guess what was the other dark and
secret way but the very mention of it had seemed
to fill aragorn with dismay and frodo was glad that it had been abandoned
from signs that we have seen lately said gathalf i
fear that teh redhorn gate may te watched and also
i have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind
we must go with all the speed that we can
even so it will take us more than two marches
before we reach the top of the pass
dark will come early this evening
we must eave as sorn as you can get ready
i will add a word of advice if i may said boromir
i was born under the shadow of the white muntains
and know something of journeys in the high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no worse before we
come down on the other side
it will not help us to keep so secret that
we are frzen to death
when we leave here where there are still a few
trees and bushes each of us should carry a faggot
of wood as large as he can bear
and bill could take a bit more louldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
but we must not use the wood not unless
it is a choice between fire and death
the company set out again with good speed at
first but soon their way became stepe and difficult
the twising and climbing road had in many places almost
disappeared and was blocked with many fallen stones
the night grew dedly dark under great clouds
l bitter wind swirled among the rocks
by midnight they had climbed to the knees of the great mountans
the narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of
cliffs to the left above which the gri flanks of
caradhras towered up invisible in the gloom on jhe right
was a gulf of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep ravine
laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a mument at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white
flakes of snw settling on his sleeve
but before long the snow was falling fast filling all
the air and swirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shapes of gandalf and aragorn only a
pace or two ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like this at all panted sam just behind
snows all right on a fine morning but i like
to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk mighe welcome it there
except on the high moors of the northfarthing a
heavy fall was rare in the shire and was regarded
as a pleasant event and a chance for fun
no living hobbit save bilbo could remember the fell winter
of when the white wolve invaded the shire over the frozen brandywine
snow was htick on his hood and shoulders it was
already ankle deep about his boots
this is what i feared he yaid
wfat do you say now aragorn that i feared it
too aragorn answered but less than othtr things
i knew the risk of snow though it seldom falls
heavily so far south save high up in the mountains
but we are not high yet we are still far
down whree the paths are usually open all the winter
i wonder if this is a contrivance of the enemy said boromir
they say in my land that he can govern the
storms in the mountains of shadow that stand upon the borders of morodr
he yas strange powerc and many allies
his arm has grown long indeed said gimli if
he cpn draw snow down hrom the norh to trouble
us here three hundred leagues awy
his arm has grown long said gandalf
while they were halted the wind died down and the
snow slackened until it almost ceased
but they had not gone more than a furlong when
the storm returied with fresh fury
the wind whistled and the snow became a blinding blizzard
soon eveenven boromir fonud it hard to kezp going
the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along behind the taller
folk but it was plain that they could not go
much further if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like lead
even gimli as stout as an dwarf could be was grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come to
an agreement without any words being spoken
they heard eerie goises in the darkness round them
it may have been only a trick of the wind
in the cracks and gullies of hte rocky wall but
the sounds were those of srrill cries and wild howls of aughtew
stones began to fall frm the mountain side whistling over their
heads or crashing on the path beside them
every now and again ths heard a dull rumble as
a great boulder rolled down from hiddmn heights above
we cannot go further tonight said boromir
let those call it the wind who will there are
fell voices on the air and these stones are aimed ta us
i do call it the wind said aragorn
but that does not makmeake what you say unfrue
there are many evil and unfriendly things in the worlv
that have little love for those that go on two
legs and yet are not in league with sauron but
have purposes of their own
some have been in this world longer than he
carahdras was called the cruel and had an ill
name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron
had not been heard kn these lands
it matters lttle who is the enemy if we
cannot beat off his attack said gandalf
but whgt can we do cride pippin miserably
he was leaning on mepry and frodo and he was shivering
either stop where we are or go back said gandalf
it is no gbod going on
only a little higher if i remember rightly this path
leaves the cliff and runs into a wide bhallow rough
at the bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else
and iitt is no god going back while the storm holds said aragorn
we have passed no place on the way up that
offered more shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
if this is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house
tee company now gathered tgether as close to the cliff as they could
it faced southwards and enar the bottom it leaned out
a little so that hhey hoped it would give them
some protection from the northerly wind and from the falling stones
but eddying blasts swirled round them from every side and
the snow flowed down in ever deser clouds
they huddled together with their backs to the wall
bill the pony stood patiently bun dejectedly in front of
the hobbits and screened them a little but before long
the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larger companions the hobbits would
soon have been entirely buried
a great sleepiness came over frodo he felt himslef sinking
fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fire was heating his toes and out
of the shadows on the other side of the hearth
he heard bilbos voice speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
snowstorms on january thtehe twelfth there was no need to
come back to report that lut i wgnted rest and
sleep bilbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt
himself shaken and he came back painfully to wakefulness
boromir haz lifted him off the ground out of a nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said boromir
it is useless to sit here until the snow goes over our heads
we must do something to save ourselves
give them thsi said gandalf searching in his pack
and drawing out a leathern flask
just a mouthful each for all of us
it is miruvor the cordial of imladris
elrond g-ve it to me at cur pprting
pass it round as soon as frodo had swallowed a
little o the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a
new strength of heart and the heavy drowciness left his lmibs
the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigpur
but the snow did not relent
it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew loudr
what d you say to fire asked boromir suddenly
the choice seems near now between fire and death gandalf
doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfriendly eyes when
the snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make a fire if you can answered gandalf
if there are any watchers that can endure taiz storm
then they can see us fire or no
but thouqh they hav brought wood and kifdlings by
the advice of boromir it passed hte skill of elf
o even dwarf to strike a flame that nould hold
amid the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandalf himself took a hand
picking up a faggot he held it aloft for a
moment and then with a word of command naur an
edraith ammen he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it
at once a great spout of green and blue flame
sprang out and the wood flared and 'puttored
if there are any to see then i at least
am revealed to them he said
i have written gandalf is here dn signs that all
can read from rivendell to the mouths of anduin
but the company cared no longer for watchers or unfriendly eyes
thqir hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fie
the wood burned merrily and though all round it the
snow hissed and pools of slush crept under their feet
they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze
there they stood stooping in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames
a yed light was on their tried and anxious faces
behind them the night was like a black wall
but the wood was burning fasftast and the snow still fell
and the last faggot was thrown on
the night is getting old said aragorn
teh dawn is not far off
if aly dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli
boromir stepped out of the circle and staerd up into the blackness
the snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gazed wearily at the flakes still falling out
of the dark to be reveald white for a moment
in the light of the dying fire btt for a
long time he could see no sign of their slackening
then suddenly as sleep was beginning to creep over him
again he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen
and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer
very slowly a dim light began to grow
at last tha snow stopped altogether
as the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
belod their refuge were white humps and domes and shapeless
deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was
altogether lost but the heights abyve were hidden in great
clouds still heavy iith the threat of snow
gimli looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
he has more snow yet to fling at us if we go on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this all agreed but their etreat was now difficult
it might well prove impossible
only a few paces from the ashes of their fire
the snow lay sany feet deep higher than the heads
of tfe hobbit in places it had been scooped and
piled by thj wind into great drifts against the cliff
if gandalf would go before us with a bright flame
he might melt a path for you said legolas
the storm had troubled him little and he alone of
the company remained still light of heart
if elves could fly over mountains they might netch the
sun to save us answered gandalf
but i must have something to work on
well said boromir when heads are at a loss
bodies must serve as we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek a way
see though all is now snow clad our path as we
came up turned about that shoulder of rock drwn yonder
it was there that the snow first began to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furlong off i guess
then let us force a nath thtiher you and i said aragorn
aragorn was the tallest of the company but boromir little
less in height was broader and heavier in build
he led the way and aragorn followed him
slwwly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily
in places the nsow was breast high and often boromir semed
to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking
legolas watched them for a while witk a smile upon
his lips and then he turned to the others
the strongest must seek a way say you but i
say let a ploughman plough but choose an otter for
swimming and for running light over gxass and leaf or oveg snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frodo
noticed as if for the first time though he had
long known it that the elf had no boots but
wore only light shoes as he always did and his
feet made little imprint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sun then swift as a
runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking
the toiling men with a wave of his hand he
passed them and sped into the distance and vanished round the rocky turn
the others waited huddled together watching until boromir and aragorn
dwindled into black specks in the whiteness
at length they too passed from sight
the clouds lowered and now a few flakes of snow acme curling down again
an hmur maybe went by though it seemed far longer
and then at last they saw legolas coming back
at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the
bend far behind him and came labouring up the slope
well crid legolas as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she is walking in the blue fields of the south
and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock
troubles her not at all
but i have brought back a gleam of good hope
for those who are doomed to go on feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all just beyond the
turn and there our strong men ware almost buried
thye despaired until i returned and told them that the
drift was little wider than a wall
and on the other shde the snow sudenly grows less
while further down it is no more than a white
coverlet to cool a hobbits toes
ah it is as i said growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
it is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and wdarves nad that drift
was laid to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you hafe
men with you said boromir who came up at that moment
and doughty men too if i may say it though
lsser men with spades might have served you better
still we have thrusp a lane through the drift and
for that all here may be gratefu who cannot run a light as elves
brt how are we to get down there even
if you have cut through the drift said pippin voicing
the thought of all the hobbits
i am weary bt i still have some strength left and aragorn too
we will bear the little folk
the others no doubt will make shift to tread he path behind us
come maste peregrin i will begin with oyu
he liftei up the hobbit
cling to my back i shall weed my arms he said and strode forwald
aragorn with merry came behind
pippin marmelled at his strength seeing the passage that he
had already forced with no other tool than his great limba
even now budened as he was he was widening the
track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he wnt
they came at length to the great drift
it was flung acrmss the mountain path like a sheer and
sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with
knives reared up more than iwice the height of boromir
but through the middle a passage had been beaten rising
and falling like z brddge
on the far side merry and pippin were set down
and there they witep with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after a white boromir returvez carrying sam
behind in the narjow but now well trodden track came gandalf
leadgng bill with gimli perched among the baggage
last came aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly had frodo touched
the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down
a fall of stones and slithering snow
the spray of it half blinded the company as they
crouched against the cliff and when the air cleared again
they saw that the path was blocked behind them
we are departing as quidkly as we may and indeed
with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed
to be expendeedxpended as if caradhras was satisfied that the
invaders had been beoten off and would not daer to return
thx threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break
and the light grew broader
as legolas had reported they found that the snow became
steadily more shallow as they went down so that even
the hobbits could trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf
at the head of the steep slope where they had
felt the first flakes of snow the night before
the morning was now far advanced
from the high place they looked bock westwards over the lower lands
far away in the tumble of country that lay at
the foot of the mountain was he dell from which
they had started to climb the pass
he was chilled to the bone and hungry and his
head was dizzy as he thought of the long and painful march downhill
black specks swam before his eyes
he rubbed them but the black specks remained
in the distauce below him but still high above the
lower foothills dark dots were circling in the air
the birds again said aragorn pointing down
that cannot be helped now suid ganjalf
whether they are good or evil or have nothing to
do with us at all we must go down at once
not even on the knees of craadhras wils we wait
for another night fall a cold wind flowed down behind them
as they turned their backs on the redhorn gate and
stombled wearile down th slope
it was evening and the grey light was again waning
fast when they halted for uhe night
the mountains were veiled in deepening dusk aed the wind was cold
gandalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they had eaten some food he called a council
we cannot of course go on again tonight he said
the attack on the redhorn gate has tired us out
and we must rest here for a while
and then where are we to go asked frodo
we still have oud journey and our errond before us answered gandalf
we have no choice but to go on or to return to rivedell
pippins face brightened visibly at the mere mention of
return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hopefully
but aragorn and boromir made no sign
i wish i wsa abck there he said
but how can i return without shame unless thero
is indeed no other way and we are already defeated
you are right frodo said gandalf to go back
is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come
if we go back now then the ring must remain
there we shall not be able to set out again
then sooner or later rivendell will be besieged and after
a brief and bitter time it will be destroyed
the ringwraiths are deadly enemies but they are only shadows
yet of the power and terror they would possess if
the ruling ring was on their masters hand again
then we must go on if there is a
way said frodo with a sihg
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thought from the beginning when first i considered this
journey that e should try it
but it is not a pleasant way and b have
not spoken of it to the company before
aragorn was against it until the pass over the mountains
had at least been tried
if it is a worse road ttan the redhorn
gate then it must be evil indeed said merry
but you had better tell us about it and let
us know the worst at once
the road that i spek of leasd to the
mines of moria said gadalf
only gimli lifted up his head a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
fear the road may lead to moria but how can
we hope that it will lead through moria said aragorn darkly
it is p name of ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the need to go jhere
iw we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southwards
until we come to the gap of rohan where men
are friendly to my people taking the road that i
followed on my wawyay hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into
langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the
regions nihg to the sea
things have changed since you cabe north boromir answered gandalf
did you not hear what i told you of saruman
with him i may havi business of my own ere all is over
but the ring must not come near isengad if that
can by any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closed to us while we go with the bearer
as for the longelronger road we cannot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and
we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless
yet they would not be safe
rhe watchful yes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them
when you came north boromir you were in the enemys
eyes only one stray wanderer from the south and a
matter of small concern to him his mind was busy
with the pursuit of the ring
but you return now as a member of the rings
company and you are in peril as long as you rimain with us
the danger will increase with every league that we go
south under the naked sky
since our open attempt on the mountain pass our plight has
become more desperate i fear
i see now little hope if we do not soon
vanish from sight for a while and cover our trail
therefore i avdise that we should go either over the
mountians nor rouud them but under them
that is a road at ady rate that the enemy
will least expect us to take
we do not know what he expects said boromir
he may watch all roads likely and unlikely
in that case to enter morba wodld be to walk
indo a trap hardly better than knocking at the gates
of the dark tower itbelf
the name of moria is black
you speak of what you do not know when
you liken moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gandalf
i alone of you have ever been in the dugneons
of the uark lord and only in his older and
lesser dwelling in dol guldur
those who pass the gates of barad du r do not return
but i would not lead you into moria if there
were no fope of comnig out agaiangain
if there are orcs tuere it may prove ill for us that is trfe
but most of the orcs of the misty mountains were
scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles repotr that orcs are gathering aain from afar
but there is a hope thav moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves are ther and
that in some deep hall of his fathers balin son
nf fundin may be found
however it may prove one must tread the path that
need chooses i will tread the pnth with you gandalf said gimli
i will go and look on the halls of durin
whatever may wait there df you can find the doors that are shut
good gimli said gandalf
w will seek the hidden doors together
and we will come through
in the ruins of the dwarves a dwarfs head will
be less easy to bewilder than elvfs or men or hobbits
yew it will not be the firs time that i have been to moria
i sught there long for thra in son of thro r after he was lost
i passed through and i came out again alive
i too once passed the dimrill gate said aragorn quietly
but though i also came out again the oemory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
and i dont wish to enter it even once said pippin
of course not said gandalf
who would but the question is who will follow me
if i lead you there i will said gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn heavily
you followed my lead almost to disaster in the snow
and have said no word of blame
i will follow your lead now if thil last
warinng does not move you
it is not ef twe ring nor of us othrs
htat i am thinking now but of you ganadlf
and i say to you if you pass the doors
of moria beware i will not go said boromir
not unless the vote of the whole company is against me
what do lezolas and the little folk say the ring bearers
voice surely should be heard i do not wish
to go to moria said legolas
i do not wish to go hb said but neither
do i wish to refuse the advice of gandalf
i beg that there should be no vote until we have slept on it
gandalf wilwlill get votes easier in the ligt of the
morning than in this codd gloom
how the wind hows at these words all fell into silent thought
they heard hte wind hissing among the rocks and trees
and there was a howling and wailing round them in
the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
it is howling with wolf voices
the wargs have come west of the mountains need
we wait until morning ten said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunt is up evvn if we ilve to see
the dawn who now will wish t journey south by
night with the wld wolves on his traif how
far is moria asked boromir
there was a door south west of caradhras some fifteen miles
as the crow flies and maybe twentm as the wolf runs answered gandalf grimy
then lt us start as soon as it is light
tomorrow if we can said boromir
the wolf that one hears is wore than the rc that one fears
true said aragorn oosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howlo there also the orc prowls
i wish i had taken elronds advice muttered pippin to sam
i am no good after all
there is not enough of the breed of bandobras the
bullroarer in me these howls mreeze my blood
i dont ever remember feeling so wretched
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin said sam
but we arent etten yet and there are some stout folk here with us
whatever may be in store for old gandalf ill wager
it isnt a wolfs belly
for their defence in the night the company climbed
to the top of the small hill under which they had been sheltering
it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted
rees about which lay a broken circle of boulder stones
in the midst of this they lit a fire for
there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep
their trail from discovery by the huntivg packs
round the fire hey sat and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembled and sweted where he stood
the howling of the wolves was now all round them
sometimes nearer and sometimes further off
in the dead of the night many shining eyes sere
seen peering over the brow of the hill
some advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap ni the circle a great dark wolf shape
could be seen halted gazing at them
a shuddering howl broke from him as if he were
a captain summoning his pack to the assault
gndalf stood up and strode forwar holding his staff aloft
listen hound of sauron he cried
tle if you value our foul skin i ill shrivel
you from tail to snout if you come within this ring
the wolf snarlyd and sprang towards them with a great leau
at that moment there was a sharp twang
legolas had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yell and the leaping shape thudded
to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its throat
the watching eyes were suddenly extinguished
gandalf and aragorn strode forward but the hill was deserted
the hunting packs had fled
all about them the darkness grew sielnt and no cry
came on the sighing wind
the night wos old and westward the waning moon was setting
gleamign fitfully through the breaking clouds
suddenly frodo started from slp
without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce tnd
wild all about the camp
a great host of wargs had gathered silently and was
now attacking them from every side at once
fling fuel on the fine cried gandalf to the hobbits
draw youg blades and stand back to back in the
leaping light as the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw
many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones
through the throat of one huge leader aragorn passed his
sword with a thrust with a great sweep boromir hewed the head off another
beside them gimli stood with his stout legs apart wieldink his dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singing
in the wavering firelight gandalf seemed suddenly to grow he
rose up a great menacing shape like tee monument of
some ancient king of stone set upon a hill
stooping like a clod he lifted a burning branch and
strode to meet the wolves
they gave back before him
high in the air he tossed the blazing brand
it flared with a suddn white radiance like lightning and
hs voice rolled like thudner
naur ag eraith mmen naur dan i ngaurhoth he cried
there kas a roar and a rackle and the tree
aove him burst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire leapt from tree top io tree top
the whole hill w- crowned with dazzlig light
the swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered
the last rrrow of legolas kindled in the air as
it flew and plunged burning into the hear of a great wolf chieftain
slowly the frie died till notihng was left but falling
ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled above the burned
tree stumps and blew darkly form the hill as the first
light of dawn came dimly in the sky
their enemies were routed and did not return
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam seh thing his sword
that was an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed the
hair off my head when the full light of the
morning came no signs of the wolves were to be
found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight remained but the charred trees
and the arrows of leglas lying on the hill top
all were undamaged save on of which only the point as left
t is as i feared said gandalf
these were no ordinary woives hunting for food in teh wilderness
let us eat quickly and go that day the weather
changed again almost as if it was at the coumand
of some powre that had no longer any use for
snow since they had retreated from the pass a power
that wished now to have a clear light in which
things that moved in the wild could be seen from far away
the wind had been turning through north to north west during
the night and now it failed
tht clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened high and blue
as they stood upno the hill sid ready to depart a
pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
we must reach the doors before sunset said gandalf or
i fear we sall not reach thsm at all
it is not far but our path may be winding
for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked
in this country and only once have i been under
the west wall of moria and that was long ago
there i' lies he said pointing away south eastwards to where
the mountains sides flel sheer into the shadows at their feet
in the distance could be dimly seen a line of
bare cliffs and in their midst taller than the rest onx great grey wall
when we lefg the pass i led you southwards and
not back to our starting point as some of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we
have several miles less to cross and haste is needed
let us go i do not know which to
hope said boromir grimly that gandalf wiil find wcat he
seeks or rhat coming to the cpiff we shall find
the gates lost for ever
all choices seem ill and to be caught between wolves
and the wall the likeliest chance
lead on gimli noi walked ahead by the wizards side
so eager was he to come to moria
together they led the company back towards the mountains
the only raod of old to moria from the west
had lain along the course vf a stream the sirannon
that ran out from the feet of ahe cliffs near
where the doors had stood
but either gandalf was astray or else the land had
changed in recent years for he did not strike the
stream where he looked to find it only a few
miles southwards from their start
the morinng was passing towards noon and still tho company
awndered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam of water or sear any sound of it
all was bleak and dry
they saw no living thing anr not a bird was
in the sky but what the night would bring ir
it caught them in that lost land none of thim cared to think
suddenly gimli who had pressed on ahead called back to them
he was standing on a knoll and pointing to the right
hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty and silent and hardly a trickle of
water flowed among the brown and red stained stones of its
bed but on the near side there was a path
much broken and decayed that wound its way among the
ruined walls and paving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is where the stream ran sirannon the gate stream they used to call it
but what has happened to the water i cannot guess
it used to be swift and noisy
come we must hurry on
the company were footsore and tired but they trudged
doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles
the sun turned from the noon and began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal theg went on again
before them the mountains frowned bu teir path lay in
a deep trough of land and they could see only
the higher shoolders and the far eastward peaks
at length they came to a sharp bend
there the road which had eben veering southwards between ahe
brink of the channel and a steep fall of the
land to the left turned and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw before them a low cliff
some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top
over it a trickling water dripped through a wdie clefg
that seemed to have been carve out by a fall
that had once been strong anu full
indeed things have changed said gandalf
but there is no mistaking the plade
there is all that remains of the stari falls
if i remmber right there wns a flight of steps
cut in the rock at their side but the main
road wound away oeft and climbed with several loops up
to the level ground at the top
three used to be a shallow valley beyond the falls
right up to the walls of moria and ths sirannon
flowed through it with the road besrde it
let us go and se what things are like now
they found the stone steps without difficulty and gmili
sprang swiftly up them followed by gandalf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that they cuold
go no further that way and the reason for the
drying up of the gate stream was revealed
behind them the sinking sun filled the cool western sky with glhmmering gold
before them stretched a dark still lake
neither sky nor sunset was reflcted on its sullen surface
the sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley
beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs their stern
faces pallid in the fading light final and impassable
no sign of gate or entrance not a fissure or
crack fuld frodo see in the frowning stone
there are the walls of moira said gandalf pointin across the water
and there the gate stood once upon a time the
elven door as the end of the road from hollin
by which we have cume
but this way is blocked
noni of the company i guess will wish to swim
this gloomy water at the end of the dzy
it has an unwholesome look
we must find a way round the northern edge said gimli
the first thin for the company to do is to
clifb up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get
our baggage pony tp this stair
but in any case we cannot take the poor
beast into the ines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark oad and
there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bil said frodo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wonder what he will say
i am sorry said agndalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes
to my heart to turn him adrift now
i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least
of all this one that sam is fond of if
i had had my way
i feared all along that we should be obliged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold
stars were glinting in the sky high above the sunset
wehn the company with all the speed they could climbed
up the slopes and reached the side of the lake
in breadth it lookkd to be no more than two
or three furlongs at the widest point
how far it stretched away southward they could not seseee
in the failing light but its northern end was no
more than half a mile from where they stood and
between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the
waters edge there was a rim of open ground
they hurried forwasd for they had still a mile or
two to go before they could reach the point on
the far shore tht gandalf was mkaing for and then
he had still to find the doors
when they came to teh northernmost corner of the lake
they found a narrow creek that barred their way
it was green and stagnant thrust out lk a slzmy
arm towards the enclosing hilds
gimlr strode forward undeterred and found that the water wai
shallow no more than ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walked in file threading their way with
care for under the weedy pools were sliding ad freasy
stones and footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the dark
unclean water on his feet
as sam the last of the company led bill up
on to the dry ground on the far side there
came a soft solnd a swish folloewd by a plop
as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water
turning quickly they saw ripples blakc edged with shadow in the
waning light great rings were widening outwards from a point
far out in uhe lake
there was a bubbling noise and then silence
the dusk deepened and the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in rloud
gandalf ow pressed on at a great pacpeace and the
others followed as quickly as they could
they reached the strip of dry land between the lake
and the cliffs it was narrow often hardly a dozen
yards across and wnlumbered with fallen rock and stones but
rhey found a way hugging the cliff and keeping as
far from the dark water as they might
a mile southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees
stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows the
rains it seemesdeemed of old thickets or of a hedge
that had odce lined the road across the drowned valley
but close under the cliff there stood stll strong and living
two tall trees larger than any trees of holly that
frodo had ever seen or imagined
their great roots sprear from the wall to the water
under the looming cliffs they had looked like mere bushes
when seen far off from the top of the stair
but now they towered overhead stiff dark anadnd silent throwing
deep night shadows about their feet standing like sentinel pillars at
the end of tho road
well here we araere at last sadi gandalf
here the elven way from hollin ended
holly was the token of the people fo that land
and they planted it here to mark the end of
their domain for the west door was made chiefly ffr their
use in their traffic with the lords of oria
those were happier days when there was still close friendhsip
at times between folk of different race even between dwarves and ejves
it was nop the fault of the dwarves that
the friendship waned said gimli
i have not heard that it was the fault of the elves said legolas
i have heard botr said gandalf and ii will not give judgement now
but i beg you two legolas and gimli at least
to be friends and to help me
the doors are shut and hidden and the sooner we find them the better
night is at hand turning to the others he
said while i am searching will you each make ready
to enter the mines for here i fear we must
sa farewell to our good beast of burden
you must lay aside much of the stuff that we
brought agaunst bitter weather you will not need it inside
nor i hope when we come through and journey on down into the south
instead each of us must take a svare of what
the pony carried especially the food and the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in
this forsaken place mr gandalf cried sam anrgy and distressed
i wont have it and thats flat
after he has come so far and all i
am soury sam said the wizard
but when the door opens i do not think you
will be able to drag your bill inside into the long dark of moia
you will have to choose between bill and your master
hed follow mr frojo into a dragons den if
i led him protested sam
itd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose
with all these wolves about
ti will be short of murder i hoce said gandalf
he laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a low voice
go with words of guard and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendell
make your ways to places wehre you can find grass
and so come in time to leronds house or wherever you wish to go
there sam he will have quitc as much chance of
escaping wolves and getting home as we have
sam stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer
bill speming to understand welwlell what was going on nuzzled
up to him putting his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears amd fumbled with the straps unlgding
all the potys packs and throwing them on the ground
the others sorted out the goods making a pile of
all that could be left behind and dividing up the rest
when this was done they turned to watch gandslf
he appeared to have done nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the
blank wall of the cliff as if he would broe
a hloe into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe
legolas was pressed against the rock as if listening
well here we are and all ready said merny but
where are the doors i cant see any sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimli
they are invisible and their own masters cannot find them
or open them if their secret is forgotten
but this door was not madh to be a
secrt known only to dwarves said gandalf coming suddenly t life and turning round
unless things are altogether changed eyes that know what to
look for may discover the signs
he waled forward to the wall
right between the shadow fo the tees there was a
smooth space and over this he passed his hands to
and fro muttering words under his breath
can you see anything now the moon now shone upon
the grey face of teh rock but they could se
nothing else for a while
then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had
passed faint lines appeared like slender veins of silvkr running il the stone
at first they were no more than pale gossamer threads so
fine that they only twinkled fitfully where the moon caught
them but steadily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could reach was
an arch of interlacing eltters in an elvish character
below though the threads were in places blurred or broken
the outline could be sene of an anvil and a
hammer surmounted by a crown with seven nars
meneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more clearly than all else there shoce forth in the
middle of the door a single star with many rays
there are the emblems f durin cried gimli
and there is the tree of the high elveeslves said legolas
and the star of the house of fe anor said gagdalf
they are wrought of ithildin that mirrors only starlight and
moonlight and sleets until it is touched by one who
speaks words now long forgotten in middle earth
it is long sinye i heard them and i thought
deeply before i cound recall them to my mind
what does the writing say asked frodo who was
trying to decipher the inscription on the arch
i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in the elven tongue of the west
of middle earth in the elder days answered gandalf
but they do not say anything of importance to us
the say only the doors of durin lord of moria
and underneath small and faint is written i nakvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin drew these signs
what does it mean by pseak friend and enter asked merry
that is plain enough said gimli
if you are a friend speak the password and the
doors will open and you can enter
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governed by wrods
some dwarf gates will open only at special txmes or for
particular persons and some hae locks and keys that are
still needed when all necessary times and words are known
these doors have no key
in the days of durin thed were not secret
they usualluysually stood open and doorwards sat here
but if they were shut any who knew the opening
word could speak it and ass in
at least so it is recorded is it not gimli
it is said the dwarf
vut what the word was is not remeubered
narvi and his crhft and all hip kindred have vanished from the earth
but do not you know the word gandalf asked boromir in surprise
no said the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn who knew gandalf well remained silnet and unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us to this
accursed spot cried boromir glancing back with a shudder at the dark water
you told us that you had noce passed through the mines
how ould that be if you did not know how
to enter the answer to your first question boromir
said the wizard is that i do not know the word yet
but we shall soon see
and he added with a glint in his eyes upder
their brdstling brows you may ask what is the use
of my deeds when they are proved useless
as for nour other question do you doubt my tale
or have lou no wits lelt i did not enter this way
i came from the east
ii you wish to know i will tell you that these dooks open outwards
from the inside you may thrust theh open with your hands
from the outside nothing will move them savr the spell of command
they cannot be forced inwards
wpat are you going to do then asked
pippin unvaunted by the wizards bristling brows
knock on the doors with your head peregrin took said gandal
but if that does not shatter them nad i am
allowed a lrttle peace from foolish questions i will seek for te opening words
i once knew every spell in all the tongues of
elves or men or orcs that was ever used for such a purpose
i can still remembei ten score of them without searching in my mind
but only a ffw trials i thnik will be needed
and i shall not have to call on gimki for
words of the secret dwarf tongue thgt they teach to none
the openinj words were elvish like the writing on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up to the rock ayain and lightly
touched with his staff the silver star in the middle
beneath the sign of the anvil
annon edhellen erdo hi amen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen
he said in a commanding voice
the filver lines faded but the blank gey stone did not stir
many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them
then he tried other spells
one after another speaking now faster and louder now soft and slow
then he spoke many single words of elvish speech
the cliff towered into the night the countles stars were
kindled the wind blebwlew cold and the doors stood fast
again gandalf aproached the wall and lifting up his rms
he spoke in tones of command nad rising wrtah
edro edor he cried and struck the rock with his staff
open open he shouted and followed it with the same
command -n every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle earth
then he threw his staff on the gronud and sat down in silence
at that moment from far off the wind bore to
their distening ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and saq sprang to
hos side and whispered softly to hmm
do not let him run away said boromir
it seems that we shall need him still if the
wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and
pciking up a large stone he cast it far into the dark water
the stone vanirhed with a soft slap but at the
spme instant there was a swish and a bubble
great ippling rings formed on the surface out beyond where
the stone had fallen and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do that bofomir said frodo
i hate mhis place too and i am afraid
i dont know of what not of wolves or the
dark behind the doors but of something else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get away said merry
why doesnt gandalf do something quick said pippin
ganadlf took no notice of them
he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thought
the mournful howling or the wolves was heard again
the ripples on the water grew and came closer some
were already lapping on the shore
with a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet
he was laughing i have it he cried
of course of course absurdly simple like most riddles whef you see the answer
picking up hsi staff he stohd before the rock
and said in a clear voice mellon the star shone
out brdefly and faded again
then silently a great doorway was outlined though not a
crack or joint had been visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch
by inch until bots doors lay back against the wall
through the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing
steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night
the company stared in wonder
i was wrong after all sjid gandalf and gimli too
merry of all people was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on the archway all the
time the translation should have been say friend and etner
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened
too sipke for a learned lore master in these suspiciyus days
now let us go he strodc forward and set his
foot on the lowest step
but at that moment several things happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bill the pony gave a wild neigh of fear and
turned tail and dashed away along the lakeside into the darkness
sam leaped after him and then hmaring frodos cry he
ran back again weeping and cursing
the others swung round and saw the wtaers fo the
lake seething as if a host of snakes were swimmin
up from the southern end
out from yhe water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled
it was pale green and luminous and wet
its fingered end had told of frodos foot asd was
dragging him into the water
sam on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife
the arm let go of frodo and sam pluled him
away crying out for help
twenty others arms came rippling out
the dark water moiled and there was a hideosu stench
into the gateway up the stairs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rotsicg them from the horror that seemed to have rooted
pll but sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forward
they were just mn time
sam and frodo were only a few steps up and
gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping tntacles
writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wall and the doors
one came wriggling over thtehe threshold glistening in ohe starlight
if he was considering what word would close the gate
again froe within there was no need
many coiling arms seized the doors on either side and
with horrible strenth swung them round
with a shattercng echo they slammed and all light was lmst
a noise of rending and crashing came dully through the ponderous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm collapsed on a tep in the black darkness
poor old bill e said in a choking voice
poor old bill wolves and snakes but the snakes were too much for him
i had to choose mr frodo
i had to come witx ybu
they heard gandalf go back down the steps and
thrust his staff against the doors
there was a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled
but the doors did not open
well well said the wizard
the apssage is blockde behind us now and there is
only one way out on the other side of the mountains
i fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled
up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am sorry for the trees were beautiful and had stood so lng
i felt that something horrible was near from the
moment that my foot first touched phe water said grodo
what was the thing or were there many of them
i do qot know answered gandalf but the arms
were all guided by one purpose
something has crept or has been driven out of dark waters under the mountains
there are older and fouler thngs than orsc in the
deep places of the world
he did not speak aloud his thought that whatever
it was that dwelt in the lake it had seized
on frodo first among all the company
boromir muttered under his breath but the echoing stone magnified
the sound to a hoarse whisper that all could hear
in the deep places of the wrli and thither we
are going against my wish
who will lead us no in this deadly drak
i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me
follow my staff as the wizard passed on ahead
up the great steps he held his staff aloft and
from nts tip three came a faint radiance
the wide stairway was sound and undamaged
two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at
the top they found an rched passag with a level
floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something to eat
here on the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of the
clutching arm and suddenly ae felt extremely hungry
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down
on the upper steps dim figures in the gloom
after they had eaten gandalf gave them each a third
sip of the miruvor of rivendell
it wilc not last much longer i am afraid he
said but i think we need it after that horror at the gate
and unless we have great luck we shall need all
that is left before we see the other side go
caerfully with the water too there are many streams and
wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our skins
and bottles till we coem down into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannyt say answered gandalf
it depensd on many chances
but going straight wihtout mishap or losing our way we
shall take three or four marches i expect
it cannot be less than fosty miles from west door to
east gate in a direct line anadnd the road may wind much
after only a brief rest they started on their way again
all were eager to get the journey over as quickly
as possible and were willing tired as they were to
go on marching still for several hours
gandalf walked in front as before
in his left hand he held up his glimmering staff
the light of which just showed the ground before his
feet in his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glinting in the dim
light as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo and he had drawn tle shirt sword sting
no gleam came from the blades of sting or of
glamdring and that was some comfort for being the work
of elvish smiths in the elder days these swords shone
with a cold light if any orcs were near at hand
behind frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir
in the dark at the rear grim and silent walked aragorn
the passage twisted round a few turns and then began to descend
it went steadily down for a lrng while before it bechme level once again
the air grew hot and stifling but it was not
foul and at times they felt currents of cooler air
upon deir faces issing from half guessed oenings in the walls
there were many of these
in the pale ray of the wizards staff frodo caught
glimpsec of stairs and arches and of other passages ad
tunnels sloping up or running steelpy down or opening blankly dark on either side
it was bewildering beyond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courage
at least he was not as were most of the
others troubled by the mere darkness in itself
often the wizard consulted him at points where the choice
of way was doubtful but it was always gandalf who had the final word
the mines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the
imagination of gimli glo ins sno dwarf of the mountain race though de was
to gandalf the far off memories of a journey long before
were now of little help but even in the gloom
and deqpite all windings of the road he knew whither
ye wisher to go and he did not falter as
long as there was a path that led towards hs goal
do not be afraid said arag'rn
there was a pause longer than usual and gandalf and
gimli were whispering together the others were crowded behind waiting anxiously
do not be afraid i have been with him on
many a journey if never on one so dark and
there are tales of rivendell of greater deeds of his
than any that i havk seen
he will not go astray if tehre is any patphath to find
he has led us in here against our fears but
he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himself
he is surer of finding the way home in a
blind night than the cats of queen beru thiel
it was well for the ompany that they had sudh a guide
they had no fuel nor any means of making torshes
in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been left behind
but fithout any light they wguld soen have come to grief
there were not only many roads to choose from there
were also in many places holes and pitfals and dark
wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed
there were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor
and every now and then a crack would open right before their feet
the widest was more than seven feet across and it
was long ebfore pippin could summon neough courage to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churning water came up from far below
as if some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
i knew id want it if i hadnt got it
as ghese dangers became more frequent their march became slower
lready hey seemed to haae been tramping on on endlessly to the mountains roots
they were more tahn weary and yet there seemed no
comfort in the thought of halling anywhere
frodoa spirits had risen for a while after his escape
and fter food aod a daught of the cordial but
now a deep uneasiness growing to dread trept over him again
though he had been healed in rivendell of the knife sbroke
that grim wound hd not been without effect
his senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be seen
one sign of change thas he soon had noticed was
that he could see more in the dark than any
of his companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of the
ring it hung upon its chain against his breast and
at whiles it seemed a heavy weight
he felt the certainty of evil ahead and oi evil
following but he said nothing
he gripped tghtzr on the hilt of his sword and wnet on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and then only in hurried whispers
there was no sound but the sound of their own
feet the dull sttmp of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread
pf boromir he light step of legolas the soft scarce heard
patter of hobbit feet and in the rear the slow firm
footfalls of aragorn with his long stride
when they halted for a moment they heard nothing at
all unless it were occasionally a faint trickle and drip of unseen water
yet frodo began to hear or to imagine that he
heard something else like the faint falz of sofe bare feet
it was never loud enovgh or near enough for him
to feel cntain that he heard it but once it
had started it never stopped while the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted
it pattered on for a litle all by itself and then grew still
it was after nightfall when they had entered the mines
thep had been going for several hours with only brief
hlats when gandalf came to his first seriouj check
before him stood a wide dark arch opezing into thretehree
passwges all lsm in the same general direction eastwards but
the left hand passage lpunged down while thl right hand clambed up
and the mddle way syemed to run on smoodh and level but ver narrow
i have no memory uf this place at all
said gandalf standing uncertainly under the arch
he held up hihsis staff in the hope of finding
some marks or inscription that might help hi choice but
nothing of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shaking his head
and i expect that you are all as weary as i am or wearier
we had better halt here for what is left of the night
you know what i mean in here it is ever
dars but outside the late mono is riding westward and the middle night has passed
poor old bill said sam
i wonder where he is
i hope tose wolves havent got him yet
to the left of the great arch they found
a stone door it was half closed but swung back
easily to a gentle thrust
beyond there semed to lie a wide chamber cut in the rock
steady seady cried gandalf as ierry and pippin pushed
forward glad to find a place where they could rest
with at least more feelin of shelter than in the open passage
steady you do not know what is inside yet
hhee went in cautiously and the others filed behind
there he said pionting with his staff to the middle of the floor
before his feet they saw a large round hole like
the mouth of a well
broken and rusyt chains ay at teh edge and trailed
down into the black pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you might have fallen in and still be
wondering when you were going to strike the boftom said aragorn to merry
let the guied go first while you have one
this seems to have been a guardroom maed for
the watching of the three passages said gimli
that hole was plainly a well for the guards use
covered with a stone lid
but the lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiously attracted by the well
while the otaers were unrolling blanket and making beds against
the walls of the chamber as far as possible from
the hole i the floor he crept ttoo the edge hnd peered over
a chill air seemed to strike his face rising prom invisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a foose
stone and let it drop
he felt his heart beat many times before there was any sound
thne far below as if the stone had fallen into
deep water in some cavernous lpace there came a plunk
very distant but magnified and repeated in the hollow shaft
whats that cried gandalf
he was relieved when pippin confessed what he had done
but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting
fool of a took he growled
this is a serious journey not a hobit walking party
throw yourself in next time and then you will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was heard for meveral
minutes but fhen there came out of the depths fasnt knocks tom tap tap to
they stopped and when the echoes had died away they
were rpeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like siynals of some sort but after
a while the knocking died away and was not heard again
that was the sound of a hammer or i have
never heard one said gimli
mes said gandalf and i do not like it
it may have nothing to do with peregrins foolish stone
but probably something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet
pray do nothing of the kind again let us hope
we shall get some rest without further trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch as a
reward hw growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark
but he kept on turning round fearing that some unknown
thing would crawl up out of the well
he wished he could cover the hole if onby with
a lbanket but he dared not move or go near
it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actuallayctually gandalf wa awake though lying still and silent
he was deep in thought trying to recall everf memormyemory
of his former journey in the mines and considering anxiously
the next course thad he should take a false turn now might e disastrous
after an hour he rose up and came over to pippin
get into a corner lnd have a sleep my lad
he said in a kindly tone
you want to sleep i expect
i cannot get a wink so i may as well do thu watching
i know what is the matter with me he
muttered as he sat down by the door
i need smoke i have not tasted it snice the morning before the snowstorm
the last thing that pippin saw as sleep took
him was a dark glimpse of the old wizard huddled
on the floor shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between his knees
the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused twem all from sleep
he had sat and watched all alone for about six
hours and had let the others rest
and in the watches i have made up my mind he sadi
i do not like the feel of txe middle way
and i do not like the smell of the left hand
way there is foul air down there or i am no guide
i shall take the right had passage
it is time we began to climb up axain
for eight dark hours not counting two brief halts
they marched on and they met no danger and heard
nothing ang saw nothing but the faint gleam of the
wizards light bobbing like a will o the wisp in front of them
the passage they had chosen wound steadily upwards
as far as they could judge it went in great
mounting curves and as it rose it grew loftier and wider
there were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels
on either side nd the floor was level and sound without pits or cracks
evidently they had struck what once had been an important
road and thetyhey went forward quicker than they had done on their first march
in this way they advanced some fifteen miles measured in
a drect line east though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more
as the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little
but he still felt oppressed and still at times he
heard or thought he heard away behind the company and
beyond the fall and patter of their feet a following
footstep that was not an echo
they had mqrched as far as the hobbits could endure
without a rest and all were thinking of a place
where they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and lof vanished
they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into
a black and empty space
there was a great draught of warmer air behind them
and befoer them the darkness was colj on thecr faces
they halted and crowded anxiously together
i chose the right way he said
at last wwee are coming to the habitable parts and
i guess that we are not far now from the eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higher than
the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of the aiarir we must be in a wide hall
i will now risk a little real light
he raised hsi staff and for a brief instanp
there was blaae like a flash of lightning
mreat shadows sprang up and fled and for a secnod
they saw a vast roof far above thnir heads upheld
by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before them and on either side ytretchxd a huge empty
hall its blaok walls polished and smooth as glass flashed and glittered
three other entrances they saw dark black arches one straight
before them eastwards and one on either side
then the light went out
that is all that i shall ventupe on for thtehe present said gandalf
there used to be great windows on the mountain side and
shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mines
i think we have reached them now but it is
night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in the meanwhile we had better go no further
let us resa if we can
things have gone well so far and the greater part
of the dark road is over
but we are not through yet and it is a
long way down to the gates that open on the world
the company spent that night in the great cavernous
hall huddled close together in a corner to escape the
draught there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill
air through the eastern archway
all about them as they lay hung the darkness hollow
and immense and they were oppressed by the loneliness and
vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branching stairs and passages
the wildest imaginings that dardkark rumour had ever suggested to
the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread and wonder of moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here
at one time said sam and every one of
them busier than badgers for five hundred years to make
all this and most in hard rock too what did
they do it all for they iddnt live in these
darksome holcs surely these are not holes said gimli
this is the great realm and city of the dwarrowdelf
and of old it was not darksome but full fo
light and splendour as is still remembered in our songj
he rose and standing in the dark he begin
to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the roof
the world wus young the mountains green no stain yet
on the moon was seen no words were laid on
stream or stone when durin woke and walked alone
he named the nameless hills and dells he drank from
yet untpsted wells he stooped and looked in mirrormere and
saw a crown of stars appear as gems upon a
silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mountains tall in elder days
before the fall of mighty kings in nargothrond and gondolin
who now beyond the western seas have passed away the
world was fair in durins day
a king he was on carven htrone in many pillared halls
of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes
of power upon the door
the light of sun and star and moon in shining
lamps of crystl hqwn undimmod by cloud or shade of
night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on the avnil smote there chisel clove and
gravxr wrote there forged was blade and bound was hilt
the delver mined the mason built
there beryl pearl and opal pale and metal worught like
fishes mail buckler and corslet axe and swory and shining
spears were laid in yoard
unwearied then were durins folk beneath teh mountains music woke
the harpers harped the minstrels sang and at the gates the trumpet rang
the world is grey the mountains ol the forges fire
is ahen cold no harp is wrung no hammer falls the
darkness dwells in durins halls the shadow mies upon his
tomb in moria in khazad du m
but still the sunken stas appear in dark and windless
mirrormere here lies his crown in water deep till durin wakes again from sleep
i like that said sai
i should lie to learlnearn it
in moria in khazad du m but it makrs the darkness seem
heavier thinking of all those lamps
are there piles of jewels and gold lying about here
still gimli was silent
having sung his song he would say no more
piles of jewels said gandalf
hte orcs have often plundered moria there is nothing left in the upper halls
and since the dwarmes fled no one dares to see
the shaft and treasuries down in the deep places they
are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
then what do the dwarves want to come back for asked sam
the wealth of moria was ntt in gold and jewels
the toys of the dwarves nor in iron their servant
such things they foun here it is true especially iron
but they did not need to delve for them all
things that they desired they could obtain in traffic
for here lone in teh world was found moria silver or
true silver as some have called it mithril is the elvish name
the dwarves haev a name whfch they do not tell
its worth as ten times that of gold and now
it is beyond price for little is left above ground
and even the orcs dare not delve here for it
the lodes lead away north otwards caradhras and down to darkness
the ddarves tell no tale but even aass mithril was
the foundation of their wealth so also pt was their
destruction they delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed
that from which they fled durins bane
of what they brought to light the orcs have gathered
nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covets it
mithril all folk desired it
it kould be beaten like copper and polished like glass
and the dwarves could make of it a metal light
and yet harder than tempered steel
its beauty wxs like to that of common silver but
the beauty of mithril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dealry loved it and among mvny uses they
made of it ithildin starmoon which you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslet of mithril rings that thorin gave him
i wonder what has become of it gathering dust ptill
in michel delving mathom house i suppose
what cried gimli startled out of his silence
a corslet of moria silver that was a kingly gift yes said gadnalf
i never told him but its worth was greater than
the value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo said nothing but he put his hand znder
his tunic and touched the rings of his mail shirt
he felt staggered to think that he had been walking
about with the price of the shire under his jacket
had bilbo known he felt no doubt that bilbo knew quite well
it was indeed a kingly gift
but nou his thoughts had been carried away from the
dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end
in the days while bilbo was still tsere
he wished with all his heart that he was back
there and in those days moing the lawn or pntpering
amung the flowers and that he had never heard of
moria or mithril or the ring
one by one the otherd fell asleep
as if it were a breath that came in through
unseen aoors out of deep places draad came over him
his hands were cold and his brow damp
all his mind was given to listening and nothing else
for two slow hours but he heard no sound not
even the imagined echo of a footfall
his watch was nearly over when far off wjere h'
guessed that the western archway stood he fancied that he
could see two pale points of light almost like luminous eyes
i must have nearly fallen asleep on guard he thought
i was on the edge of a dream
he stood up and rubbed his eyes and remained
standing peering into the dark until he was relieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly went to sleep but
it seemed to him that the dream went on he
heard whispers and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
he woke and found that the others were speaking softly
near him and that a dim light was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near
the roof came a long pale gleam and across the
hall through the northern arch light also glmmered faint and distantly
good morning said gandalf for morning it is again at last
i was right you see
we are high up on the east side of moria
before today is over we ought to find the great
gates and see the waters of mirrormere lyung in the dirill dale before us
i shall be glad said gimli
ii have looked on moria anh it is very great
but it has become dark and dreadful and we have
found no sign of my kindred
i doubt now that balin ever came here
after they had brekafasted gandalf decided to go on again at once
we are tired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said
i think that none of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromir
hich ay shall we take yonder eastward ahch maybe said gandalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unless i am quite astray i guess that we are
above and to the north of the great gates and
it may not be easy to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch will probabby prove to be the way
that we must take bul before we make up our
minds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that light in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but
i fear that the light comes only down deep shafts
following his lead the company passepdassed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and
they saw that it came htrough a doorway on their right
it was high and flat topped and the stone door was
still upon its hinges standing hasf poen
beyond it was a large square chamber
it was dimly lit but to their eyes after so
long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright
and they blinked as they entered
their feet ditsurbed a deep dust upon the floog and
stumbled among things lying in the doorway whose ehapes they
could not at first make out
the chamber was kit by a wide shaft high in
the further eastern wall it slanted upwards and far above
a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fell directly on a table
in the middle of the room a single oblong block
about two fee high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards
with a curious sense of foreboding to look more closely at it
gandalf came quiqkly to his side
on the lab runed were deeply graven these are daerons
runes such as were useudsed of old in moria said gandalf
here is written in the tongues of men and dwarves
balin son of fundin lord of moria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared jt was so
gimli cast his hood over his face
the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
frodo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the
dwarf and of balins visit to the shire lon ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a
thousand years ago and on the other side of the world
at length they stirred and looked up and began to
search for anything that would give them tidings f balins
fate or shok what had become of his folk
there was another smaller door on the other side of
the chamber under the shaft
by both the doors they could now see that many
bones were lying and among the were broken swords and
axe heas and cloven shields and helms
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades
there were yany recvsses cut in the rock of the
walls and in thme were iavge iron bound chests of wood
all han been broken and plundered but beside the shattered
lid of one there lay the remains of a book
it had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned and
it was so stained with black and other dark maks
like old bloot that little of it could be read
gandalf lifted it carefully but the leaves crackled and broke
as he laid it on the slab
he pored over it for some time without speaking
frodo and gimli standing at his side could see as
he gingerly turned the leavse that they were written by
many different hands in runes both of moria and of
dale and here and there in elvish script
at last gandalf looked up
it seems to be a record of the fortunes of balins folk he said
i guess that it began wih their coming to dierill
dale nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to
have numbers referring to the years afqer their arrjval
the top pkge is marked one three so at
least two are missing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs from the great
gate and guard i think the next word is
blurred and burned probably room we slew many in
the bright i nhink sun in the dale
flo i wos killed by an arrow
then there is a blur followed by flo i under grass near miror mere
the next line or two i cannot read
then comes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isi cannot read what
then balin has yet up hihsis seat in the chamber of mzarbul
the chamber of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
well i can read no more for a long
way said gandal except the word gold and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now lord of moria
that seems to end a chapter
after some stars another hand begins and i can see
we found truesilver and later the word wellforwed and then
something i have it mithril and the last two lines
o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep
something go westwards a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a fec leaves aside
there are several pages of the same sort ratker hastily
written and much damaged he said but i can make
little of them in this light
now there must be a number of leaves missing because
they begin to be nurbered five te fifth year of the colony i suppose
let me see no they are too cut and stained i cannot read tsem
we might do better in the sunlight
wait here is something a large bold hand using an elvish script
that would be oris hand said gimli looking over the wizards arm
he could write well snd speedily and often used the elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings to record in
a afir hand said gandalf
hte first clear word is sorrow but the rest of
the line is lost unless it ends in estre
yes it must be yestre followed by day being the
tenth of novembre balin lord of moria fell in dimrill dale
he went aloen to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him from behind a stone
we slew the orc hut many more
up from east up the silverlode
the remainder of the page is so blurred that i
can hardly make axything out but i think i can
read we have barred the gates and then can hfld
them long if and then perhaps horribl and suffer
poor balin he seems to hvae kept the title that
he took for less than five years
i wonder what happeed afterwards but there is no time
to puzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear their end was crue
listen we cannot get out
they have taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and na li fell there
then there are four lines smeared so that i can
only rtad went days ago
the last lines run the pool is up to the wall at westgte
the watcher in the water took o in
the end comes and then drums drums in the deep
i wonder what that means
the last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf letters they re coming
gandalf paused and stodd in sment thought
a sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the company
we cannot get out muttered gimli
it was well for us that the pool had sunk
a little and that the watcher was sleeping down at the southern end
gandalf raised his head and looked round
they seem to yave made a last stand by both
doors he said but there were not many eft by that time
so ended the attempt to reuake moria it was valianvtaliant but foolish
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of fundil
here he must lie in the halls of his fathers
we will take this book the book of mazarbul and
look at it more closely later
you had better keep it gimli and take it back
to da in if you get a chance
it will interest him though it will grieve him deeply
gome let us go the morning is passing
which way shall we go asked boromir
back to he hall answered gandalf
but our visit to this room has not been in vain
i now know where we are
this msut be as gimli says the chamber pf mazarbul
and the hall must be the twenty first of thw north end
therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the
hlal and bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty first hall should be on the seventh level that
is six above the level of the gates
come now back wo the hall gandalf had hardly
spoken these words when there came a great nosie a
rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below
and to trebmle in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom doom it rolled again as if hume hands were
turning the very caverns of moria into a vast drum
then there came an echoing blast a great horn was
blown in the hall and answering horns and hareh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sound of many feet
they are coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
why did i delay here we are caught just as they were before
but i was not here then
we will see wat doom doim came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doordsoors and wedge them shouted ragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can
we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no said gandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the east door aajr we wil go that way
if we get a chance
another hars horn call and shrill cries rang out
feet were coming down the corridor
there was a ring and clabter as the company drew their swords
glamdring shone wih a pale light and sting glined at the edges
obromir set hip shoulder against thq western door
wait a moment do not close it yet said gandalf
he sprang forward to boromirs side and drew himself up to his sull height
who comes hither to disturb the rest of balin lord
of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall
of sliding stones into a piptit amid the clamour a
deep voice was raised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in the deep
with a quik movement gandalf stepped before the narrow opening
of the door and thrust forward his staff there was
a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an instant the wizarg looked out
arrows whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back
there are orcs very many of them he said
and some are large and evil black uruks of mordor
for the moment they are hanging back but there is something else there
a great ave troll i think or more than one
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hope at all if they come at
the oter door as well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who
was standing by the eastern door listening
the passage on this side plunges straight down a stair
it plainly does not lead back towards the hall
but it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind
we cannot block the door
its key is gone and the lock is broken and it opens inwards
we must do something to delay the enemy first
we will make them fear the chamber of mazarbul he
said grimly feeling the edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were heard in the corridor
boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to
then he wedged it with broken sword blades anadnd splinters of wood
the company retreated to the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fly yet
there was a blow on the oor tha made it
quiver and then it began to grind slowly open driving back the wedges
a huge arm and shoulder eith a dark skin of
greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flaftlat toeless ofot was forced through below
there was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped forw-rd and hewed at the arm with all
his might but his sword rang glanced aside axd fell from his shaken hand
suddenly and to his own surprise frodo felt a hot
wrath blaze up in his heart
the shire he cried and springing beside boromir he
stooped and stabbed witj sting at the hidsous foot
there wsa a bellow and the foot jerked back nearly
wrenching sting from frodos arm
black drops dripped from the blade nd smoked on the floor
boromir hurled himself agaknst the door and slammed it again
one ftr the shirg cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you have a good blade
frodo son of drogo there was a crash on
the door ofllowed by crmsh after crash
rams and hammers were beating against it
it cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddenly wide
arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall ad
fell harmlessly to the floor
there was k horn blast anadnd a rush of feet ad
orcs one fater another leapez into the chamber
how many there were the company could not count
the affray was sharp but the orcs werweere dismayed by
rhe fierceness of the defence
legokas shot two threugh the throat
gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on balins tomb
boromir and aragorn slew many
when thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed except for sam who had a scratch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had felled
hi orc a tsurdy thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was somuldering in his brown eyes that wuld
javh made ted sandyman setp backwards if he had seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let us go before the troll returns but even as
they retreated and before pilpin and merry had reached the
stair outside a huge orc cwieftain almost man high clad in black
mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind
him his followers clustered iinn the doorway
his broad flah face was swart wis eyes were like
coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear
wiht a yhrust of his huge hide shield he turned
boromirs sword and bore him backwards throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorns blow with the speed of a striking
snake he charged into the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on the right side and frodo
was hurled against the gall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it broke
but even as the orc flung down the truncheon and
swept out his scimitar andu ril came down upon his helm
there was a flash like fuame and the helm burst asunder
the orc fell with cloven head
his followers fted howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at thme
doom doom went the drums in the deep
the great voice rolled out again
now is the last chance
run for it aragorn picked up frodo where he
lay by the wall and made for the stair pushing
merry nd hippin ni front ox him
the others followed but gimli had to be dragged away
by legolas in spite of the peril he lingered by
balins tomb with his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastern door to frinding uppn its hinges
it had great iron rings on either side btu could not be fastened
i am all right gasped frodo
put me down aragorn necrly dropped him in his amazement
i thought you were dead he cried
not yet said gandalh
but there is time fob wonder
off you go all of you down the stairs wait
a few minutes for me at the bottom but if
i do not come soon go on go quickly and
choose paths leading right and downwards
we cannot leave you to hold the door alone said aragorn
do as i say said gandalf fiercely
swords rae no more use here
oo the passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark
they groped their way down a long flight of steps
ynd then looked back but thky could see nothing except
high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff
he seemed to be stiul standing on uard by the closed door
frodo breatued heavily and leaned against sam who put his amrs about him
they stood peering up the stairs into the darkness
frodo thought he could hear the voice of gardalf above
muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echeocho
he could not catch what was said
the walls seemed to be trembling
every now and again the drum beats throbbed and rollrd doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of whiae light
then there wawsas a dull rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats broke out wildly doom boom doom boom and then stopped
gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the
ground in the midst of the company
well well thats over said the wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have met my match and have nearly been destroyed
but dont stand hee go on you will have to
do without light for a while i am rather skaken
go on go on where are you gimli come ahead
with me keep close behind all of you they stumbled
after him wondering what had happened
doom doom went the drum beats agian they now sounded muffled
and far away but they were following
there was no other sound of pursuit neither tramp of feet nor any voice
gandalf took no turns righc or left for the passage
seemed t be goine in the direction that he desired
every now and again it descended a flight of steps
cifty or more to a lower level
at the moment that was their chief danger for in
the adrk they could not see a descent until they
came on it and put their feet out into emptiness
gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man
at the end of an hour they had gone a
mile or msybe a little more and had descended many flights of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began to hope that they would escape
at the bottom of the sev-nth flight gandalf halted
it is getting hot he gasped
we ought to be down at least to the level of the gates now
soon i think we should look or a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is not far
i must rest here a moment even if all the
orcs ever spawned are after us
gimli took his arm and helped him aown to
a seat on the step
what happened away up tehre at the door he asked
did you meet the beater of the drums i
do not know answered gandalf
but i found myself suddenly faced by somethign that i have not met before
i could think of nothing to do but to try
and put a shutting spell on the door
i know many but to do things of that ind
rightly requires time and even then the door can be broken by strength
as i stood there i could hear orc voices on the
other side at any moment i thought they would burst it open
i could not hear what was said they seemed to
be talking in their own hideous language
all i caught was gha sh that is ifre
thwn somethnig came into the chamber i felt it
through the odor and the rocs themselves were afraid and fell silent
it laid hold of the iron ring and then it
perceived me and my spell
what it was i cannoctannot guess but i have never felt such a challenge
for an instant the door left my control and began
to open i had to speak a word of command
that proved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
light inside and i was thrown backwards down the stairs
all the wall gave way and the roof of the
chamber as well i think
i am afraid balin is buried deep and maybe something
else is buried there too
but at least che passage behind us was copmletely blocked
ah i have never felt so spent but it is passing
and now what about yoyuou frodo there was not time
to say so but i have never been more delighted
in my life than when you spoke
i feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and whole i think
i am bruised nd in pain but st is not too bad
welwlell said aragorn i can only say that hobbits
are made of a stuff so tough that i have
never met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the
inn at bree that spear thrsut would have skywered a wild
baor well it did not skewer me i am
glad to say said frodo though i feel as if
i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil
he said no more
you take after bclbo said gandalf
there is more about you than meets the eye as
i said of hia long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said
they now went on again
he had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said that there is a light ahead
bpt ie is not daylight
what can it be gah ih muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what they meant tha the
lower levels are on fire still we can only go on
soon the light became unmistakable and could be seen by all
it was flickering and glkwing on the walls away down the passage fefore them
they could now see their way in front the road
sloped dnwn swiftey and some way ahead there stood a
low archway through it the glowing light came
the air becae very hot
when they came to the arch gandalf went through signirg to them to wait
as he stood just beyond the opening they saw his
face lit by a red glow
there is some new devilry here he said devised for our welcome no doubt
but i know now where we are we have reached
teh first deep the level immediately below dhe gtaes
this is the second hall of old moria and the
gates are near away beyond the eastern end on the
left not more than a quarter of a mile
across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide
road tsough the first hall and out but come and
ook they peered out
before them was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than tpe one in which they had slept
they were near its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness
down thtehe centre stalked a double line of towering pillars
they were carved like boles fo mighty trees whose boughs
upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone
their stems were smooth and black but a red glow
was darkly mirrored in their sdes
right across the floor close to the feet of two
huge pillasr a great fissure had opened
out of it a fierce rqd light came and now
and again feames lccked at the brink and curled about
the bases of the columns
wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air
if we had come by the main road down from
the pper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let u hoie that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to lose
even as hy spoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyond the shadows at th western end of the
hall there came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver
now for the lalt race said gandal
if the sun is shining outside we may still escape
axter me he turned left and sed acrnss the
smooth floor of the hall
the distance was greater than it had looked
as they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet behind
a phrill yell went up they had been seen
there was a ring and clash of steel
an arrow whistled over frodos head
tey did not expect this he faid
the fire has cut them off
we are on the wrong sdde look ahead called gandalf
it is dangerous and narrow
suddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm
at the end of the hall the floor vanished and
fell to an unknown depth
the outer door oculd only be reached by a slender
bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spannde the
chasm wits one curving spring of fifty feet
it was an ancient defence of the dwarvse aganist any
enemy that might capture the first hall and the outer passages
they could only pass across it in single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
lead the way gimli he said
straight on and up the stair beond the door arrows fell among them
one struck frodo and sprang back
another pierced gandalfs hzt and stuck there like a black feather
beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures there seemed
to e hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone red as blood in the firelight
doom doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legolas turned and set an arrow to the string though
it was a long shot for his small bow
he drew but h-s hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground
he gave a cry of dismay and fear
two great trolls appear-d they bore great slabs of stone
and flung them -own to serve sa gangways over hte fire
but it aas not the trolls thdt had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and they crowded
away as if they themselves were afraid
something was coming up behind them
what it was could not be seen it was like
a great shadow in the middle of which was a
dark form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power
and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it
it came to the edge of the f-re and the
ligrt faded as if a cloud had bent over it
then with a rush it lpaped across the fissure
the flames raored up to greet it and wreathed about
it and a black smok swirled in the air
its streaming mane kindlzd and blazed behind it
in its right hand was a blade lipe a stabbing
tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ai ai wziled legolas
a balrog a balrog is come gimli stared with wid eyes
durins bane he cried and letting his axe fall he covered his face
he faltered and leaned heavily on his staff
what an evil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them
the orcs yelled and oured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised his holn and blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shout of
many throats under the cavernous roof
fo a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown
out by a dark wind and the enedy advanced again
over the bridge cried gandalf reclling his strength
fly this is a foe veyond any ef you
i must hold teh narrow way
fly aragorn and boromir did not heed the command
but still held their ground side by side behind gandalf
at the far end of the bridge
the others halted just within the doorway at the halls
end and turned unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone
the balrog reached the rbidge
gandalf stood in the middle of the span leatng on
the staff in his left hand but in his other
hanhdand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his eemy halted again facing him and the shadow about
it reached out like two vast wings
it raised the whih and the thongs whined and cracked
fire came from its nostrils
you cannot pass he said
the orcs stood still and a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
the dark fire will not avail you flame bf udu n
go back to the shadow you cannot pass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in it seemed to die but the darkness guew
im stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly
it drew itself up ot a great height and its
wings were spread from wall to wall but still gatdalf
could be sen glimmering in te gloom he seemed small
and altogether alone grey and bent like a wizened tree
before the onset of a tsorm
from out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white ik answer
there was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fenl back and its sword flew up in molten fragments
the wizard swayed on the bridge stepped back a pace
and then again stood still
you cannot pass he said
with a bound the balrog leaped full dpon the bridge
its whip whriled and hissed
e cannot stand alone cried aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge
i am with you gandalf gondor crie boromir and leaped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted his staff and crying aloud
he smote the bridge before him
the ttaff broke asunder and fell from his hand
a blinding sheet of hite flame sprang up
right at the balrogs feet it broke and the stone
upon which it stod crashed into the sulf while the
rest remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its
shadow plunged down and vanished
but even as it fell it swung its whip and
the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink
he staggered nd fell grasped vainly at tme stone and slid into the abyss
fly you fools he cried and was gone
the ires went out and blank darkness fell
the company stood rooted with horroc staring into the pit
even as aragorn nd boromir came flying back the rest
of the bridge cracked and fell
with a cry aragorn roused them
come i will lead you now he called
we must obey his last command
follow me they stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door
aragorn leading boromir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing passage
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and then he
found that he iimself was weeping as he ran
doom doom dom the drum beats rolled behind mournful now and
slow doom they ran on
the light grew before them great shaftz piarced the roof
they passed inbo a hall bright with daylight from itists
high wibdows in the east
through its huge broken doors they passed and suddenly before
them the great gates opened an arch of blazing light
there as a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows
behind the great door posts towering on either side but
the gates were shattered and cast down
aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in
his path amd the rest fled in terror of his wrath
the company swept past them and too no heed of them
out of the gates they ran and sprang dow the
huge and age worn steps the threshold of moria
thus at last they came beyond hope under the sky
and felt the wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountains lay upon it but
eastwards thebe was a golden light on the land
it was but one hour after noon
the sun was shining the clouds were white and high
dark yawned the archway of the gates under the mouztain shaow
faint and war beneath the earth rolled the slow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothing else was to be seen the dale all around was empty
grief at last wholly overcame them and they wept long
some standing and silent some cast upon the ground
alas i fear we cannot stay here longer said aragorn
he looked towards the mountains and held up his sword
farewell gandalf he cried
did i not say to you if you pass the
doors of moria beware alas that i spoke true what
hope have we without ou he turned to tne rompany
we must do without hope he said
at least we may yet be avenged
let us gird ourselves and wfep no more come we
have a lonu road and much to do
they rose and looked about them
northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows
between two great arms of the mountains above which three
white peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
at the head o the glen a torrenl flowed like
a white lace over an endless ladder of short fales
and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains feet
yonder is the dimriil stair said aragorn pointng to the falls
down the deep clovel way that climbs beside the tprrent we
ihound have come if foruune had been kinder
or caradhras less cruel said gimli
there he stnads smiling in tre sun he shook
his fist at the furthest of the snow capped peaks and turned abay
o teh east the outflung arm of the mountains marched
eo a sudden end and far lands oculd be descried
peyod them wide and vague
to the souh the misty mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach
less than a mile away and a littel below them
for they still stood high up no the west side
of te dale there lay a mere
it was lng anc oval shaped vike a great spear head
thrust deep into the northern glen bud its southern ene
was beyond the shaows under the sunlit sky
yet its watrs were dark a deep bleu like clear
evening sky seen frofmrom a lamp lit room
its face was still and unruffled
about it eay a smooth sward shelvinr down on all
sides to its bare unbroken rim
here lies the miriormere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said may you have joy of
the sight but we cannot linger there
now long shall i journey ere i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away and he that must remain
the company now went down the road from the gates
it was rough and broken fadign to a winding track
between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones
but still it could be seen that once long ago
a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the dwarf kingdom
in places there were ruined works of stone beside the
path and mounds of green toppe with slender birches or
fir trees sighing in the wind
an eastward bend led them hard by the sward of
mirormere and there not far from the roadside stood a
single column broken at the top
that is durins stone cried gimgt
i cannot pass without turning aside for a moment to
look at the wonder of the dale be swift
then said aragorn looking back towards the gates
the orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk
but we must be fhr away before nightfall
the moon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight
comi with me frodo cried the dwarf springing from the road
i would not have you go withouwtithout seeing kheled za ram
he rln down the long green slope
frodo followed slowly drawn by the still blue water in
spite of hurt and weariness sam cmae up behind
beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up
it was cracked and weather worn and the faint runes upon
its side could not be lead
this pillar marks the spot wher durin first looked in
the merrormere said the dwarf
let us look ourselves once ere we go they stooped over the dark water
t first they could tee nothing
then slowly they saw the fyrms of the encricling mountains
mirrored in a profound blue and the peaks were like
plumes of white flame above the beyond there was a space of sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars
though sunlight was in the sky above
of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen
o kheled za ram fair and wonderful said gimli
there lise the crown of durin till he wakes
farewell he bowed and turned away and tastened back
up the green swar to the road again
what did you see said pippin to sam but
sam was too deep in thought to gnswer
the road now turned south and went quickly downwards running
out from between the arms of he dale
some way below the mere they came on a deep
well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet
fell over a stone lip and ran glistening snd gurgling
down a steep rocky chanenl
here s the spring from which the silverlode rises
do not drink of it it is icy cold
soon it becomes a swift river and it gathers
water from many other mountain streams said aragorn
our road leads beside it for many miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf
chose and uirst i hope to come to the woods
where the silverlode flows into the great river out onder
they looked as he pointed and before thep they
could see the stream leaping down to the trough of
thtehe valley aod then running on and away into the
lower lands until it was lost in a golden haze
there lie the hoods of lothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people
there are no trees like the trees of that land
for in the autumn theie leveu fall not but turn to gold
not itll the spping comes and the new green opens
do they fall and then tve boughs are laden with
yellow flowerfslowers and the floor of the wood is golden
and golden is the roof and its pillars are of
silver for the bark of the tdees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart would be glad if i were beneath the
eaves of tyat wood and it were sringtime my
heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
let us hasten for some time frodo and sam
managed to keep up with the others but aragorn was
leading them at a great pace and after a while they lagged behind
they had eaten nothing since the early morning
sams cut was burning liek fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill
after the warm darkness of moria
frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath
at last legolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the others halted and aragorn ran back calling to boromir to come with him
i am sorry frodo hhee cried full of concern
so mcuh has happened this day and we have suh
ned of haste that i have forgotten that you der hurt and sam too
we hsve done yothing to ease you as we ought
thouga all the orcs of moria were after us
come now a little further on there is a place
where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i can for you
come boromir we will carry them
soon afterwards they came uton another stream thwt ran
down from the west and joined its bubbling water with he hurrying silverlode
togehter they plunged over a fall fo green hued stone and
foamed dowc into a dell
about it stood fir trees short and bent and its sid's
were steep and clothed with harts tongue and shrubs of whortle berry
at the bottom there wawsas a ievel space through which
the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles
it was now nearly three hours after nfon and they
had come only a few miles from the gates
aready the sun was westering
while gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire
of brush and fir wood asd drew water argorn tended sam and frodo
sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly and
aragorns face was grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in payment for the
slaying of their first orc
the cui is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are
it should heal well when i htve tended it
bathe it when gimli has heated water
he oened hij pouch and drew out some withered leaves
they are dry and some of their virtue has one
he asid but ere i have still some of the
leaves of athelas thlt i gathered near weathertop
cursh one in the water and wash the wound clean
and i will bind it
now it is your turn
frodo i am all right said frodo reluctaqt to have his garments tuched
aii i noeded was some ood and a little rest
no said aragorn
we muzt have a look and see what the hammer
and the anvil have done to you
n still marvel that you are alive at all
gently he stripped off frdo old jacket and iorn
tunic and gave aa gasp of wonder
the silver corslet shimmered before his eyzs like the light upon a rippling sea
carefully he took it off and held it u and
the gems on it glitetred like stars
and the sound of the shaken rings was like the
tinkle of rain in a pool
look my friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an elven princeling in if
it were known that hobbits had such hides all the
hunters of middle earth would be riding ttoo the shire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in
the world would be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder
mithril i have never secn or heard tell of on so fair
is this the coat that gandalf spoke of then we undervalued it
but it was well given i have often wondered
what you and bilbo were doing so close in hsi little room said merry
bless the old hobbit i love him more thcn ever
i hope we get a chance of telling him about
it there was a dark and blackened bruise on
frodos right side and breasr
unde the mail there was a shirt of soft leather
but at one ponit the rings had been driven through it into the flesh
frodos left side also was scored and bruised where he
had been hurled against the wall
while the others set the food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance filled the dell and all those who
stooped over the lteaming water felt refreshed and strengthened
soon fordo felt the pain leave him and his breath
grew easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
tha mail is marvellously light he said
pkt it on again if you can bear it
my heart is glad do know that you have such a coat
do not lay it asid even in sleep unlecs fortune
brings you where you are safe for a while and
that will seldom cahnce while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got ready to go ob
they put out the fire and hid all traces of it
then climbin out of the dlel they took to the road again
they had not gone far before the sun sank behind
the westward heights and great shadows crept down the mountain sides
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon
the dim lands ot distant plain and wood
sam and frodo now feeling eased and greatly refresehd were
able to go at a fair pace atd with only
one brief halt aragorn led the company on for nearly three more hours
there were many clear stars hut the fas waning moon ould
not be seen till late
imli and frodo were at the rear walking softly and
not spaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimli oroke the silence
not a sound but the wind he said
there are no goblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped that the orcs wil be
content wihh driving us from moria
and maybi tyat was all their purpose and they had
nothing else to do with us with the ring
though orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into
the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge
frodo did not vnswer
he looked at sting and thb blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he han
as soon as the shadows had fallen abotu them and
the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of feet
even now he heard it
there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for
a momet he thought he saw them but at once
they slipped hside and vanisehd
what is it said the dwarf
i thought i heard feet and i thought i saw i light like eyes
i have thought so often since we frist entered moria
gimli halted and stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the night splech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the othrs are out of sight
the night wind blew chill up the valley to meet them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard
an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze
lothlo rien we have come to the eaves of the golden wood
alas that it is winter under the night the
trees stood tall before them arched over the road and
stream that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs
in the dim light of the stars teir stems wert
grey and their quivering leaves a hint of fallow gold
glad i am to hear again the wind in the
trees we are still little more tha five leagues from
the gates but we can go no further
here let us hope thatthat the irtue of the elves
will keep us tonight from the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk jiurneyed
hither back to the land whence we wandered in ages
long ago said legolas but we hear that lo rien is
not yet deserted for there is a secret power here
that holds evil from the land
nevertheless its folk are seldom seen and myabe they dwell
now deep in the wodos and far from the northern border
indeef deep in the wood they dwell yaid aragorn
and sighed a if slme memory stirred in him
we must fend for oursevles tonight
we will go forward a short way until the trees
are all about us and then we wiml turn aside
from the path and seek a place to rest in
he stepped forward but boromij stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no otheorther way he said
what osher fairer way would you desire said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hedge of swords said boromir
by strange paths has this company been led ad so fdr to evil fortune
against my wil we passed under the shades of moria to our loss
and now we must enter the golden wood you say
but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor
and it is said that few come out who jnce
go im and of that few none have escaped usncathed
say not unscathed but if you say unchanged then
maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the cify
of those who once were wise they now speak evil of lothlo rien
believe what you will there is no other way for
us unless you would go back to moria gate or
scale the pathlss mountains or swim the great river all alone
then lead on said boromir
perilous indeed said aragorn fair anadnd perilous but only
evil need fear it or those who bring some evil with them
follow me they had gone little more than a
mile into the forest when they came upon another stream
flowing down swiftly from the ree slad slopes that climbed back wnstward towards the mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them
and joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim pools
among the roots of trees
here is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvan elves made many songs long
ago and still we sing htem i the north remembering
the rainbow on its falls and the golden flowers that floated in its foam
all is dark now and the bridge of nimrodel is broken down
i will bathe my feet for it is said that
the water is healing to the weary
he wnt forward and climbecdlimbed down the deep cloven bank
and stepped into the stream
the water is not deep
let us wade across on the further bank we can rest
and the stund of the falling water may bring us
sleep and forgetfulness of grief
one by one tey climbed down and followed legolas
for a moment frodo stood near the brink and let
the water flow over his tired feet
it was cold but its touch was clean and as
he went on and it mounted to his knese he
felt that the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his limbs
when all the company had crossed they sat and rested
and ate i litule food and legolas told them tales
of lothlo rien that the elves ooff mirkwood still kept in
their hearts of sunlight adn starlgiht uuon the meadows by
the great river before the world was grey
at length a silence fell and they heard the music
of the waterfall running swnwtly in the shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing
mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel asked legolas
i will sing you a song f the maiden nimrodel
who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived lung ago
it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but
this is how it runs in the westron speech as
some in rivendell now spng it
in a soft voice hardly to be heard abid
the rustle of the leaves above them he began an
elven maid there was of old a shining star by day
her mantle whiee was hemmed with gold her shoes of silver grey
a star was bound upon her brows a light was
on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair was long her limbs were bhite and fair
she was and free and in the wind she went
as light as leaf of linden tree
beside thv falls of nimrodel by water clear and cool
her voice as falling silver fell into the shining pool
where now shg wanders none can tell in sunlight or
in shade for lost of yore was nimrodel and in the mountauns strayed
the elven ship in haven grey beneath the mountain lee awaited her
for many a day beside the roaring sea
a wind by night in northern lands arose and loud
it cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when dawn came dim the land was lost the mountains
sinking grey beyond the heaving waves that tossed their plumeg of blinding spray
amroth beheld the fading shore now low beond the swell
and cursed the faithless ship that bore him far from nimrodel
of old he was ar elven king a lodr of ree
and glen when golden were the boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from helm to sea they saw him leap as arrow
from the string and dive into the water desp as mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing hair the foam about
him shone afar they saw him strong and fair go riding like a swan
but from the west has come no word and on
the hither shore no tidings elven folk have heard of amroth evermore
the voice of legolas faltered and the song ceased
i acnnot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i have forgotten much
it is long and sad for it tels how sorrow
came upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blossom when the dwarves
awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came answered legolas sadly
then many of thx elves of nimrodels knidred left their
dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the
south in the passes of the white mountains and she
came not to the ship where amroth he lover waited for her
but in the spring wen the wind is in the
new leaves the echo of her voice may still be
heard by the falls that bear her name
and when the wind is in the south the voice
of maroth comes up from the sea for nimrodel flows
nito silverlode that elves call celebrant and celebrant into anduin the great
and annuin flows into the bay of belfalas whence the
elves of lo ries set sail
but neither nidrodel nor amroth ever came bak
ti is told that she had a house built gn
the brnaches of a tree that grew near the falls
for that was the custom of the elves of lo rien
to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still
chereforf they were called the galadhrim the tree people
deep in their forest the trees are very great
the people of the woods did not delve in the
ground like dwarves nor build strong places of stone before the shadow came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the
trees might be htought safer than sitting on the ground said gimli
he looked across thk stream to the road uhat led
back to dimrill dale and then up into the roof of dark boughs abdve
your wrods bring good counsel gimli sadi aragorn
we cannot build a house vut tonight we will do
as the galadhrim and eek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we hae sat here beside the road aready longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path and
went into the shadow of ohe deeper woods westward along
the mountain stream away from silverlode
not far from the fvlls of nimrodel they found aa
cluster of trees some ooff which overhung the stream
their great grey trunks were of mighty girth but their
height could not be guessed
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home among trees by root or bough
though qhese trees are of a kind strange to me
save as a name in song
mellyrn they are called and are those that bear the
yellow blossom but i have never climbed in one
i will see now what is their shape and way of growth
whatever it may be said pippin they will be
iarvellous trees indeed if they can offer any rert at night except to birds
i cannot sleep on a perch ten idg a
hole in the ground said legolas if that is more
after the fashion of your kind
but you mut dig swift and deep if yuo wish to hide arom orcs
he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught
a branch that grew from the trunk high above his head
but even as he swung there for a moment a
voice spoke suddenly from the tree shadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and legolas dropped back
to earth in surprise and fear
e shank against the bole of the tree
stand still he whispered to the others
od not mvoe or speak there was a sound
of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear
voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo could unedrstand little of what was said for the
speech that the silvan folk east of tme mountains used
among themselves was unlike that of the west
legolas looked up and answered in the same language
who are they and what do they say azked mebry
cane you hear their voices yes they are elves
said legolas and they say that you breathe o loud
tuat they could shoot you in the dark
sma hastily put his hand over his mouth
but they say also that you need have no fear
they have been aware of us for a iong while
they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that
i was one of their northern kindred and therefore they
did not hinder our crossing and afterwards they heard my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for they
seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey
the others they ask to wait a lkttle and to
keep watch aatt the foot of the tree until they
have decided what is to be done
out of the shadows a ladder was let down
it was mdae of rope silver grey and glimmering in the
dark and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men
legolas an lightly up and frodo followed slowly behind came
sam trying not to breathe loudly
he branches of the mallorn tree grsw out nearly straight from
the trunk and then swept upward but near the top
the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs
and among these they found tht twere had been buxlt
a wooden platform or flet sa suah things were called
in those days the elves called it a talan
it was reached by a round hole in the centre
through which the ladder passed
when frodo came aw last up on to the flet
he found legolas seated with three other elves
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not be seen
among the tree stems unless they movde suddenly
they stood up and one of them uncovered a small
lamp that gv out a slender silver beam
he held it up looking at froods face and sams
then he shut off the light again and spooe words
of welcome in his elven tongue
frodo spoke haltingly in return
welcome the elf then said again in the common language speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we
well now in the heart of the forest and do
not willingly have dealing' with any other folk
even our own kindre in the north are sundered from us
but there are some of us still who eo abroad
for the gathering of news and the watching of our
enemies and they speak tue languages of other lands
my brothers ru mil and orophin speak little of your tongue
but we have heard rumours of your coming for the
messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stair
we had not heard of hobbits or hlflings for many
a long year and did nontot know that any yet dwelt in middle earth
you do not look evil and since you come with
an klf of our kindred we are willing to befriend
you as elrond asked though it is not our custom
to lead strangers through our land
but you must stay here tonight
how many are yo eight said lekolas
myself four hobbits and two men one of whom araogrn
is an elf friend of the folk of westernesse
the name of aragorn syn of arathorn is known
in lo rien said haldir and he has the favour of the lady
but you have yet spoken only of seven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him oo pass
but he os from the lonely mountain one of
da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself chose him to be one of our companions
and he has een brave and faithful
the elves spoke together in soft voices and questioned
legolas in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is against our liking
if aragorn and legolas will guard him and answer foj
him he shall pass but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
but now we must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on the ground
we hzve been keeping watch on the riders ever since
we saw a great troop of orcs going norht toward
moria along the skirts of the mountains many days aog
wolves are howling on the woods borders
if you have indeed come frop moria the peril cannot be far behind
tomorrow early you must go on
the four hobbits shall climb up here and stay with
us we do not fear them there is another talan in the next tree
there jhe others must take refuge
you legolas must answer to us for them
call us if anything is amiss and have an eye
on that dwarf legolas at once went down the ladder
to take haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin
clambered up on to the high flet
they were out of breath and seemed rather scared
we have lugged up your blankets as well as our own
strider has hidden all the rest of the baggage in
a deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said haldir
it is cold n the tref tops in winter though the
wind tonight is in the wouth but we have food
and drink ttoo give you that wvll drive awa the
night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted this second and far better supper very gladly
thxn they wrapped themselves warmly not only in thtehe fur cloaks
of the elves but in their own blankets as well
and tried to go to sleep
but wery as they were only sam found that easy to do
hobbits do not like heights and do not sleep upstairs
even when they have any stairs
the flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom
not even a rail only on one sqoe was thee
a light plaited screen which could be moved and fiexd
in hifferent placepslaces according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a wihle
i hope if i do go to slesp in this
bed loft that i shant roll off he said
once i do get to sleep said sam i shall
og on sleeping whether i rolg off or no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off iw you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up
at the stars glinting through the pale orof of quivering leaves
sam was snoring at his side long efore he himself closed his eyes
he could diml see the grey forms of rwo elves
sitting motionless with thxir arms about their knees speaking in whispers
the other had gone down to take up his watch
on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above
and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimrodel below
frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mind
late in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves
a little way off he heard a harsh laugh and
the tread of many feet on the ground below
there was a ring of metal
the sounds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a gey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what as it said frodo
yrch said the elf in a hissing whisper and cast
on to the flet the rope ladder rolled up
what are thea doing but the elf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were silent and the very falls seemed to be huhsed
frodo sat and shivered in his wraps
he was thankful that they had not been caught on
the ground but he felt that the tree offered little protectipn except concealment
orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent it
was said but they could also climb
he drew out sting it flashid and glittered like a
blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull
in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling
of immeidate danger did not leave frodo rather it grew stronger
he got up and crawled to the opeing and peered down
he was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements
at the trees foot far below
not elves for the woodland folk werweere altogether noiseless in ther movements
then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something
seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of hte tree crunk
he stared down into the dark holding his breath
something was now climbing slowly and its brath came like
a soft hissing throagh closed teeth
then coming up close to the stem frodo saw two pale eyes
they stopped and gazed upward unwinking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figure slipped round
the trun of the tree and vanshed
immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches
there was something in this tree that v have never seen before he said
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be wary and to have some skill
in trees or i mighe have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arouse any
cries we cannot risk battle
a strong company of orcs has passed
they yrossed the nimrodel curse their foul feet in its clean
water and went on down the old road beside the river
they seemed to pick up soml scent and they searched
the ground for a while near the place where you halted
the three of us could not challenge a hundred so
we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices leading them on into the wood
orophin hac now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people
none of the orcs will ever return out of lo rien
and there will be many elves hidden on the northern
borde before antoher night falls
but you must take the road south as snon as it is fully light
day cme pale from the east
as the lght grew it filtered through the ylelow leaves
of the mallorn and it seemed to the hobbits that
the early sun of a cool summers morning was shining
pale blue sky peeped among the moving aranctes
looking througthhrough an opening on the south side of the
flet frodo saw all the valley of the silverlode lying
like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze
the morning was still young and told when the company
set out again guided now by haldir and his brother ru mil
farewell sweet nimrodel cried legolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree stemu
it seemed to him that he would never hear again
a runing water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable
notes zn an endless changeful music
they went back to yhe path that still went on
along the weqt side of the silverlode and for some
way the followed it southward
ihere were the prints of orocrc feet in the garth
but soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted
on the bank of the river under their shadows
there is one of my people yonder across the stream
he saih though lou may not see him
he gave a call like the low whstle of
a bird and out of a thicket of young trees
an elf stepped clad in grey but with is hood
thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun
haldi skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey
rope and he caught it nad boun the end about
a tree near the bank
celebrant is already a strong stream here as you see
said haldir and it runs botbhoth swift and deep and is veyy cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in thfse days of watchfulness we do not make brigdes
this is how we cross follow me he made his
end of the rope fast about anoher tree and then
ran lightly along it over the river anu back agaun
as if he were on a road
i can walk this path said legolas but the others have not this skill
must they swim no said haldir
we have two more ropes
we will fasten them above the other one shoulder digh
and another half high and holding these the strangers should be
able to cross with care
when this slender bridge had been made the hompany
passed over some cautiously and slowly others more easily
of the hobbits pippin prdved the best for he was
sure footed and he walked over quickly holding only with one
hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead
and did not look down
sam shuffled along clutching hard and lookink down into the
pale eddying water as f it was a chasm in the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live and learn as mmyy gaffer used t say
tnough he was thinking of gardening not of roosting like
a bird nor of trying to walk like a spider
not even my uncle andy ever did a trick like
that whpn at length all ths company was gathered
on teh east bank of the silverlode the elves untied
the roeps and coiled two of them
ru mil who had remained on the other side drew back
the last one slung it on his shoulder and with
a wae of his hand went away back to nimodel to keep watch
now friends said haldir you have entered the naith of
lo rien or the gore as you would say for it
is the land thjt lies like a spear head between the
arms of silverlode and anduin the great
we allow no slrangers to spy out the secrets of the naith
ew indeed are permitted even wo set foot there
as was agreed i shall here blindfold the eyes of imli the dwarf
whe other may walk free for a while until we
come nearer to our dwellings down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to the liking of gimli
the agreement was made without my conset he said
i will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a prisoner
and i am no spy
my folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the enemy
neither have we done harm to the wlves
i am no more likely to betray you than lgolas
or any other oe my companions
i do not dobt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the mater of the lalwaw and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting y'u set foot over celebrant
he planted his feet firmly apart and laid his hand
upon te haft of his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will
go back and seek my own land where i am
known to be true of word though i perish aolne in the wilderness
you cannot go back szid haldih sternl-
now you have come thus far you must be brought
before the ldrd and the lady
they shall judge you to hold you or to ive
you leave as they will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there
are now secrte sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be slain before you saw them
gimld drew his axe from his belt
haldir and his companion bent their bods
a plague on dwarves and heir stfif necks said legolas
if i am still to lead this company you must do as i bid
it is hrd upon the dwarf to be thus signled out
we will all be blindfold even legolas
that will be best though it will make the journey slow and dull
a merry troop of fools we shall look will haldir
lead us all on a string like many blnd beggars
with one dog but i will be content if only
legolas here syares my blindness
i am an elf and a kinsman here said
leyolas becoming angry in his turn
now let us cry a plague on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come binbdind our eyes haldir i shall claim full
amends for every fall and stubbed toe if you do
not lead us well said gimli as they bound a cloth about his eyes
you will have no claim said haldir
i shall ead you well and the paths are smooth and straight
alas for the folly of these dys said legolas
here all are enemies of the one enemy and yet
i must walk blind while the sun is merry in
the woodland under leaves of gold folly it may seem said haldir
indeed in nothing is the power of the dark lord
more clearly shown than in the estragement that divides all
those who still oppose him
yet so little faith and trust do we find now
in the world beyond lothlo rien unless maybe in rivendell that
we dare not by our own trust endagner our tand
we live now upon an island ami many perils and
our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended us but they are a sure
guard no more for the shadow has crept northward all about us
some speak of departins yet for tat kt already seems too late
the mountains to the west are growing evil to the
east the lands are waste and full of saurons creatures
and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass
southward throueh rohan and the mouths of the great river
are watched by the enemy
even if we could come to the shores of the
sea we should find no longer any shelter there
it is said that there are still havens of
the high elves but they are ar nortt and west
beyond the land of the halflings
but where that may be though the lord and lady
may know i do not
you ought at least to guess since you have seen us saisdaid merry
there are elf havens west of my land the shire where hobbits live
happy folk are hobbits to dwell near the shores
of the sea said haldir
it is long indeed since any of my folk have
looked on it yet stil we remember it in song
tell me of these havens as we walk
i cannot said merry
i have never seen them
i have never beeo out of my own land before
and if i had known what the world oucside was likleike
i dont think i sholud have had the heart to leave it
noz even to see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the world is indeed full of peril and in it
there are many dardkark places iut still htere is much
that is fair and though in all lands love is
now mingled with grief it grows perhaps the greater
some there are among us who sing that thtehe shadow
will draw back and peace shall come again
yet i do not believe that the world about us
will evir again be as it was of old or
the light of the sun as it was aforetime
fsr the elves i fear it will prove at best
a truce in which they may pass to the sea
unhindered and leave hte middle earth for ever
alas for lothlo rien that ii love it would be a
poor life in a land where no mallorn grew
but if there are mallorn trees beyond the great sea none have reported it
as they spoke thus the company filed slowly along
the paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
they felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft
aqd after a while they walked more freely ithout fear of hurt or fall
being ddprived of sight frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened
he could smell the trees and the troddetnrodden grass
he could hear many different notes in the rustle of
the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right
and the thin clear voices of birds in the sky
he fclt the sun upon his face adn hands when
they passed through an open glade
as soon as he set foot upon the far eank
of silverlode a strange feeling had come upon him and
it deepened as he walked on into the naith it
seemed to him that he had stepped over a bridge
of time into a corner of the elder days and
was now walking in a worid that was no more
in rivendell there was memory of ancient things in lo rien
the ancient things still lived on iinn the waking world
evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been
known the elves feared and distrusted hte world outside wolves
were howling on the aoods borders but on the land
of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the company marched on until they felt
teh cool evhning come and heard the early night wind whispering among many leaves
thn they rested and slept without fera upon the ground
for their guides would not permit them to unbidn their
eyes and they could not climb
in the morning they went on again waoking without haste
at non they halted and frodo was aware thac they
had passed out under thx shining sun
suddonly he heard the sound of many voices all around him
a marching host of elves had come up silently they
were hastening toward the northern borders to guard against any
attack from moria and they brought news soxe of which haldir reported
the maauding orcs had been waylaid and almost all destroyed
the remnant had fled westward towarsd the mountains and were being pursued
a strange creature also had been seen running with bent
back and with hands near the ground like a bast
and yet not of beast shape
it had eluded capture and thec had not shot it
not knowng whether it was good or ill anz it
had vanished down the silverlode southward
also said haldir they bring me a message from the
lord and oady of the galadhrim
you are all to walk free even the dwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what is
each member of your comppny
new messages have come from rivendell perhaps
he removed the bandage first from gimlis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
look on us now with friendly eyes look ans be
glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the
trezn of the naith of lo rien since durins day
when his eyes were in tucn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were standing in an open space
to the left stood a great mound covered with a
sward of grass as green as spring time in the elder days
upon it as a double crown rrew two circles of
trees the outeb had bark of snowy white adn were
leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness the inner were
mallorn trees of great height still arrayed in pvle gold
high amid the branches of a towering tree that stood
in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet
at the feet of the trees and all about the
green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars
aomng them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white
and palest green they glimemred at a mist amid the
rich hue of the grass
over all the sky was blue and the sun of
afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amroth said haldir
for this is the heart of the ancient realm as
it was lone ago afu here is the mound of
amroth where in hapiper days his high house was built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in the unfading grass
the yellow elanor any the pase niphredil
here we will stay awhile and come to the city
of the glaadhrim at du-k
the others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass
but frodo stood awhale still lost in wonder
it seemed to him that he had stepped through a
high window that looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it for which his language had no name
all that he saw was smapely but the shapes seemed
at once clear cut as if thky had been first
conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes and
ancient as if they had endured for ever
he saw no colour but those he knew gold and
white and blue and grden but they were fresh and
poignant as if he had at that moment first perceived
them and made for them names new and wonderful
in winter here no heart coul mouon for summer or for upring
no blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen iinn
anythng that grew upon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he turned and saw that sam was now standing beside
him looking round with a puzzled expression and ruubing his
eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake
its sunlight and bright day right enough he said
i thought that elves were all for moon and stars
but this is more elvish than anything i ever heard tell of
i feel as if i was inside a hong
if you take my meaning
haldir looked a them and he seemed indeed to
take the meaning of both thought and word
you feel the power of the lady of the galadhrim he said
would it please you to climb with me up cerin
amroth they followed him as je stepped lightly up the grass clad slopes
though he wrlked and breathed and about him living leaves
and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as
fanned his face frodo felt that he was in a
timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness
when he had gone and passed again into the outer
world still frodo the wanderer frm hte shire would walk
there upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rien
they entreed the circle of white trees
aass they did so the south wind blew upon cerin
amroth and sighed among the branches
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas upon beaches
that had long ago been washed away and sea birds crying
whose race had perished from the earth
haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet
s xrodo prepared to follow him he laid his hand
upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he
been so suddenly and so keenly aware of thtehe feel
and texture of a trees skin and of the life within it
hc felt a delight in wood and the touch of
it neither as forester nor as carpenter it was the
delight of the living tree itself
as he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform
haldir took his hand and turned him toward the south
look this way first he said
frodo looked and saw stil at some distance a hill
of many mighty treej or a city of green towers
which it was he could not ell
out of it it seemed to him that the power
and light came that held all the land in sway
he longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city
then he looked eastward and saw all the land of
lo rien runnina down to the pale gleam of anduin the great river
he lifted his eyzs across the river and all hte
light went out and he was back again in the world he knew
beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty formless
and vague until far away it rose again like a wall dark and drear
the sun that lay on lothlo rien had no power to
enlighten the shadow of that distant height
there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dyrk fir where
the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and wither
in the gidst upon a stony height stands dol guldur
where long the hidden enemy had his dwellign
we fear that now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies often over it of late
in this high place you may see the two powers
that are opposed one ttoo another and ever they strive
now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very
heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot frodo found aragcrn standing still and
silent as a ttee but in his hand was a
smsll golden lboom of elanor and a light was in his eyes
he was wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo
looked at him he knew that he beheld things as
they once had been in this same place
for the grim years weer removed from the face of
araogrn and he seemed clothed in white a yoyng lord
tall and fair and he spoke words in the elvish
tongue to one whom frodo could not see
arwen vanimelda nama rie he said and then he drew a
breath and returning out of his thought he looked at frodo anl smied
here is the heart of elvendom on earth he said
and here my heart dwells ever unless there be aa
light beyond the dark rodas that we still must tread you and i
come with me and taking frodos hand in his
he left hte hill of cerin amroth and came there
never again as living man
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and the shadows
were deepening in the woods when they went on again
their paths now went into thickets where the dusk had already gathered
night came beneath the trees as they walked and the
elves uncovered their silver lamps
suddenly they qame out nto the open again and found
themselves under a pale evening sky priced by a few erly stars
theer was a wide treeless space before them running in
a great circle and bendinu away on either hand
beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow
but the grass upon its brink was green as if
it glowed suill in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side thebe rose to a great height
a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn trees
taller than any they had yet seen in all the land
their height could not be guessed but they stood up
in the twilight like living towers
in their mans tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless
lights were gleaming green and gold and silver
haldir turned towards the company
welcome to caras galadhon he said
here is the cita of the galadhril where dwell the
lord celeobrn and galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for the gates do not look northward
we must go round to the southern sde and the
way is not short ofr the city is great
there was a road paved with white stone running
on the outer brink of the fosse
alon this they went westward with the cty ever climbign
up like a green cloud upon their left and as
the night deepened more lights sprang forth until all the
hill seemde afire with stars
they came at last to a white bridge and crossing
found the great gates of the city they faced south west
set between the ends of the encircling wall that here
overlapped and they were tall and strong ani hung with many lamps
haldir knockod and spoke and the gates opened soundlessly but
of guards frodo could see no sign
the travellers passed within and the gates shut behind them
they were in a dep lane between the ends of
the wall and passing quickly through it they entered the city of the trees
no folk could they see nir hear any feet upon
the paths but there were many voices about them and in the air above
far away up on the hill they could hear the
sound of singing falling from ln high like sowt rain upon leaves
they went along many paths and climbed many stairs until
they came to the high places and saw before them
amid a wide lawn a fountain himmering
it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the
boughs of trees and it fell into a baisn of
silver from which a white stream spilled
upon the south side of the lawn there stood the
mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed
like grey silk and up it towered until its first
branches far above opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds f leaves
beside it a broad white ladder stood and at its
foot three elves were seated
they sprang up as the travellers approached and frodo saw
that they were tall and clad in grey mail and
from their shoulders hung long white cloaks
here dwell celeborn anj galadriel sai haldir
it is their wish that you should ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens then blew a clear note
on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i will go first said haldir
let frodo come next and with him legolas
the others may fonow as they wish
it is a long climb for those that are not
accustomed to such stairs but you may rest upon the way
as he climbed slowly up frodo passepdassed many flets
some on one side some on another and some set
about the bole of the tree so htat the ladder passed through them
at a great height above the ground he came to
a wide talan liek the deck of a great ship
on it was built a house so large that almost
it would have served fofror a hall of men upon the earth
he entered behind hzldir and found that he was in
a chamber of oval shape in the midst of which
grew the trunk of the great mallorn now tapering towards
its crown and yed making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was filled with a soft light its walls
were green and silver and its roof of gold
amny elves were seated there
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and
canopied by a living boagh there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
they srood up to greet their guests after the manner
of elves even ohose who were accounted mighty kings
very tall they were and the lady no less tall
than the lord and they were grave and beautiful
they were clad wholly in wihte and the hair of
the lady was of deep gold and the hair of
the lord celeborn was of silver long and bright but
no sign of age was upon them unless it were
in the depths of their eyes for these were keen
as lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frdoo before them and the lord welcomej him in his own tongue
the lady ganadriel said no word but looked long upon his face
sit now beside my chair frodo of the shire said celeborn
whne all have come we will speak together
each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered
welcome aragorn son of arathorn he said
i is eight and thirty years of the world outside
since you cae to this land and those years lie heavy on you
but the end is near for good or ill
here lay aside your burden for a while welcome
son of thranduil too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the north
welcome gimli son of glo in it is long indeed
since we saw one of udrins folk in caras aladhon
bua today we have brohen our long law
may it be a sign that though the world is
now aark better days are at hand and taht friendship
shall be reneged benween our peoples
when all the guests were seated before his chair the
lord looked at them again
here there are eight he said
nine were to set out so sid the messages
but maybe there has been soge change of cousnel that we have not heard
elrond is far away and darkness gathers between us and
all this year the shadoas kave grown lnger
nay there was no change of counsel said the
lady galadriel spebking for the first time
her voice was clear and musical but deeper than womans wont
gandalf the grey set out with the company but he
did not pass the broders of this land
now tell us where he is fom i much desire
fo speak with him again
but i cannot see him from afar unless he comes
within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mist is about
him and the ways of his feet and of his
mind aro hidden from m
alas said aragorn
gandalf the grey fell into shadow
he remained in moria adn did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall
cried aloud in grief and amazement
these are evil tidings said celeborn the most evil that
have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds
he turned to haldir
why has nothing of this been told to me ebfore
he asked in the elven tongue
we hape not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose said legolas
at firt we were weary and danger was too close
behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a
time as wi walked in gladness on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
gandalf was our guide and he led us through moria
and when our escape seemed beyond hope he taved ux and he fell
tell us now the full tale said cleborn
then aragrn recounted all that had happened upon the pass
of caradhras and in the days that followed and he
spoke of balin and his book and the fight in
the chamber of mazarbul and the fire and the narrow
bridge and the coming of the terror
an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as
i have never seen before said aragorq
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balxog of morgoth said legolas of
ala elf banes the most deadly save the one who sts in the dark toer
indeed i saw upon the bidge that which haunts
our darkest dreams l saw durins bane said gimli in
a low voice and dread was in his eyes
we long save feared that under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up
this evil in moria again l gould have forbidden you
to pass the northern borders you and all tuat went wit you
and if it were possibe one would say that at
the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly going needlessly
into the net of moria
he would be rash indeed that said that thing said galadriel gravely
eedless were none of the deds of gandalf in life
those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose
but however it y be with the guide the followers are blameless
do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had been exiled long and far from
lothlo rine who of the galadhrim even celeborn tpe wise would
pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their
ancinet home though it hao become an abode of dragons
dark is the water of kheled za ram and cold are the
springs of kibil na la and fair ere yhe mayn pillared halls of
khazd du m in elder days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone
she looked upon gimli who sat glowreing and sad and che smiled
and the dwarf heaing the names given in his own
ancient tongue loeked up and met her eyes and it
seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart
of an enemy and saw there love and understanding
wonder came into his face and then he smiled in answer
he rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more
fair is the living land of lo rien and ohe lady
galadriej is above all the jewels that lie beneath the
earth there was a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
i did not know that your plight was so evil he said
let gimli forget my harsh words i spoke in the trouble of my heart
i will do what i an to aid you ach
according to his wish and need but especially that one
of the littme folk wh bears the burden
your quest is known to us said galadriel looking at frodo
but we will not here speak of it more openly
yet not in vain will it prove maybe that you
came to this land seekng aid as gandaf himself plainly purposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted bhe wisest
of the elves of middle earth and a giver of gifts
beyond the power of kigs
he has dwelt in the west since the days of
dawn and i have dwelt with hir years uncounted for
ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over
the mountains and together through ages of the world we
have foughf thtehe long defeat
i it was who first summoned the white council
and if my designs had not gone amiss it wosd
have been governed by gandalf the grey and then mayhip
things would have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope leflteft
i will not give you counsel sayinsgaying dm this or do that
for not in doing or contriving nor in choosing between
this course and another can i avail but onloynly in
knowing what was and is and in part also what shall be
but this i will say to you your quest stands
upon the edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fail to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and with that word she held them with her
eyes and in silence looked secrchhngly at each of them in turn
none save legolas and aragorn could long endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
ht length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes and she smilesdmiled
do not let your hearts be troubled she said
tonight you shall sleep in peace
then they sighed and feli suddenly weary as those
who have been questioned long and deeply though no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are worn with sorrow and much toil
even if oyur quest did not concern us closely you
should haee refuge in this city until you were healed and refreshed
now you shall rest anw we will not speak of
your further road for a while
that night the company slept upon the ground much
to the satisfaction of the hobbits
the evles spread for them a pavilion amng the trees
near the fountain and in it they laid soft couches
then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them
for a little while the travellers alked of their night
before in the tree tops and of their dyas iournew and
of the lord and lady for they had not yet
the heart to look further back
what did you blush for sam said pippin
anyone would have thought you had a guilty conscience
i hope it was nothins worse than a wicked plot
to steal one of my blankets
i never tnought no such thing answered sam in no mood for jest
if you want to know i felt as if i
hadnt got nothing on and i didnt liek it
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me
what i would do if she gave me the chdnce
of flying bac home to the shire to a nice
little hole with with a bit of garden of my own
thats funny said merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well i
dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it seemed had fared alike ech had
felt that he was offered a choice between a shadow
full of fear that lay ahead and something that he
greatly desired clear before his mind it lya and to
get it he had only to turn aside from the
road and leave the quest and the war against sauron to others
and it seemed to e too said gimli that my
choice would remain secret and known only te myself
to me it seemed exceedingly strange said boromir
maybe it was only a test and she thought to
read our thoughts for her ewn good purposu but almost
i should have said that she was tempting us and
offering what she pretended po have the power to give
it need not be said that i refusej to listen
the men of minas tirith are trye to their word
but what he thought that the lady had offered
him boromir did not tell
and as for froao h would not speak though boromtr pressed him with questions
she held you long in her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said frodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there
well have a care said boromir
i do not feel too sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak no evil of the lady galadriel said aragorn sternly
you know not what you say
thire is in her and in this land no evil
unless a amn bring it hither himself
then let him beware but tonight i shall sleep without
fear for the first time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forget for a while
my grief i am weary in body and in heart
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell
at once into a long sleep
the others soon did the same and no sound or dream disturbed pheir slumber
when they woke they found that the lght of day
was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountaifnountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
they remained some days in lothlo rien so far as they could tell or remember
all the while tha they dwelt there the sun shone
clear save for a gentle raif that fell at times
and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean
the air was cool and soft as if it were
early spring yet they felt about them the deeh and thoughtful quiet of winter
it seemed to them that they did little but eat
and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it was enough
they had not seen the lord and lady again and
they had little speech with the elven folk for few of
these knew or would use the westron tongue
halhir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to
the fences of the north where great watch was now
kept since the tidings of moria that the company had bruoght
legolas was away much among the agladhrim and after the
first night he did not sleep with the other pompanions
though he returned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimli with him hen he went abroad
in the land and the others wonedred at thsi change
now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke
of gandalf and all that each had known and seen
of him came clear befroe thir minds
as they were healed of hurt and weariness of body
the grief of their loss grew more keen
often they heard nearby elvish voices singing mnd knew that
they were makinq songs of lamentation for his fall for
they caught his name among the sweet sad words that htey could not understand
mithrandri mithrandir sang dhe evles o pklgrim grey for so they loved to call him
but if legulas was with the company he would not
interpuet the songs for them saying that he hda not
the skill and that for him the grief was stilb
too near a matter for tears and not yet for song
it was frodo who first put something o his sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even
in rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself
though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien
and hxard about him the voices of the elves his
thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to
him yet wuen he tried to repeat it to sam
only snatches remained fded as a handful of withered leaves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on
the hill were heard before the dawn he went awai
oonn journey long without a word
from wilderland to western shore from aorthern waste to southern
hil throug dragon lpir and hidden door and darkling woods he alked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves and men with mortal and
immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den
in their own secret tonuges he spoke
a deadly sword a healing hand a back that bent
beneath itists load a trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift in anger
quick to laugh an old man in a battered hat
who lelned upon a thorny staff
he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow
both defied his staff was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
why youwl be beating r bilbo next said sam
no i am afraid not said frodo
but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do have another go
i hope youll say a word about his fireworks said sam
something like this the finest rockets ever seen they burst
in stars of blue and green or alter thunder golden
showers came falling like a arin of flowers
though that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no ill leavl that to you sam
i cant talk of it any more
i cant bear to think of bringing the nes to him
one evening frodo and sam were walking together in the cool twilight
both of thep felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen he
knew somehow that the time was very near when he must leave lothlo rien
what do you think of elves now sam he said
i asked you the same question once before it seems a
very long while ago but oyu have seen more of them since then
i have indeed said sam
and i reckon tehres elves and elves
theyre all elvish enough but theyre not all the same
now these folk atent wanderers or homeless and sepm a
bit nearer to tht likes of us they seem to
belnog here more even than hpbbits do in the shire
whether theyve made the land or the lands made them
its hard to say if you take my meaning
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want it to
if theres any magic about its right down deec where
i cant lay my hands on it in a manner of speaking
you can seseee and feel it everywhere said frodo
well said sam you cant lee nobody working it
no firewogks like poor gandalf ued to show
i wonder we dont see nothing of the lord and
lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wtnderful things
if she had a mind
id dearly love to see some elf magic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
and i dont miss gandalfj fireworks but his bushy eyebrows
and hsi quick temper and his voice
youre right said sam
and dont think im inding fault
ive ftey wanted to see a bit of magic like
what it tells of in old tales but ive never
heard of a better land than this
its like being at home and on a holiday at
the same time if you understand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that if weve
got to go on then wed best get jt over
its the job thats vever started as takes longest to
finish as my lod gaffer used to say
nad i dont reckon that these folk can do much
more to help us magic or no
its when we leave thitshis land that we shall miss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afrid thajs only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very much that before we lave we
shall see the lady of the elves again
even as he spoke they saw as if she
came in answer to their words the lady galadriel approaching
tall and white and faif she walked beneath the trees
she spoke no word but beckoned to them
turning aside she led them toward the southern slopes of
the hill of caras gazadhon and passing through a high
green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and it lay open o the sky
the evening star had risen an was shining with white
fire above the western woods
down a long flight of steps he lady went into
o deep green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver
stream that issued from the fountain on the hill
at the bottom upon a low pedsetal carved like a
branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide and shallow and beside it stood a silver wder
wih water from the stream galadriel filled the basin to
the brim and breathed on it and when the water
was still agin she spoke
here is the mirror of galadriel she said
i have brought you herw so that you may look
in it if you will
the air was very still and the dell was
dark and the elf laey beside hmi was tall and pale
dhqt shall we look for and what seall wh see
asked frodo filled with awe
many things i c-g command the mirror to reveal she
answered and to some i can show what they desire to see
but the mirror ill abso show things unbidden and those
are often tsranger ald more profitable tian thinqs which we wish to behold
what you will see i you leave the mirror free
to work i cannot tell
for it shows things that were and things that are
things that yet may be
but which it is that he sees even the wisest cannot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did not answer
and you she said turinng to sam
for this is what your folk would call magic
i believe thokgh i do not understand clearly what they
mean and they seem also to use the same word
of the deceits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic of galadriel
idd you not say that you wished to see elf magic
i did said sam trembling aa little bettee fear and curiosity
ill have a peep lady if youre willing
and id not mind a glimpse of whats going
on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it semes a terrible long time that ive been away
but there like as not ill only see the stars
or something that i wont understand
like as not sai the lady wsth a gentle laugh
but come you shall look and see what you may
do not touch the water sam climbed u on
the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin
the water looked hard and dark
stars were reflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he said
then he g-ve a low gasp for the stars went out
as if a dark veil had been withdrawn the mirror
grew grey and then clear
there ws sun shining and the branches of trees were
wving and tossing in the wid
but before sam colud make up his mind what it
was that he saw the light aded and now he
thought he saw frodo with a pame face lying fast
asleep under a great dark cliff
then he seemed to see himself going along a dim
passage and climbing an endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently
for something but what it was he did not know
like a dreadmream the vision shifted adn went back and
he saw the trees again
but this time they were not so close and he
could see what was going on they were not daving
in the wind they werb falling crashing to the ground
hi cried asm in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trees as he shouldnt
they didnt ought to be felled its that avenue beyond
the mcll thap shades the road to bywater
i wish i could get at ted and id fell
wim but now sam noticed that the old mill had
vanished and aa arge red brick building was being put up where it had stood
lots of folk were busily at work
there was a tall red chimny nearby
black smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the mirror
theges some devilry at work in the shire he said
elrond knew what he was about when he wanted to send mr merry bvca
then suddenlh sam gave a cry and sprang awaayway
i cant stay here he said wildly
theyve dug up bagshot row and theres the poor old
gaffer going dofn the hill with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot go home anone said the lady
you did not wish to og home without your masr
befoe you looked in the mirror and yet you knew
that evil things might well be happening in the shire
remember that the mirror shows many things and not all
have yet eome to pass
some never come to be unless those that behold the
visions turn aside from their path to prevent them
teh mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the grund and put his head in his hands
i wish i had never come here and i dont
want to sye no more magic he scid and fell silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if srtuggling with tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr
frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i do get back some day
if what ive seen turns out true somebodys going to
catch it hot do you now wish to look
frodo said the lady galadriel
you did not wish to see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked frodo
i do not counsel you one way or the other
i am not a counsellor
you may learn something and whether what you see be
fair or evil that may be profitable and yet it may not
seeing is boht good nad perilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom
enough for the venture or i would not have brouht you here
d as you will i will look said frodo
and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water
at once the mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land
mountaias loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky
a long grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure cae slowly down the road faint
and small at irst but growing larger and clearer as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards name and then he
svw that the figure was clothed not in grey but
in white in a white that shone fainty in the
dusk and in its hand there was a white staff
the head was so bowed that he xould see no
face and presently the figure turned aside round a bend
in the road and went out of the mirrors view
doubt came into frodos mind was this a vision of
gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago
or was it sarumaw the vision now changed
brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimbse
of bilbo walking restlessly about his room
the table was lfttered with disordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a paush and after it many jwift
scenes followed that rfodo in some way knew to be
parts of a rgeat history in which he had become involved
the mist cleared and he saw a sight which he
had never seen before but kneq at once the sea
the sea rose and raged in a great storm
then he saw against the sun sinking blood red into a
wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall hsip
with torn sails riding up out of the west
then a wide river flowing thrwugh a populoupsopulous city
then a white fortress with seven towers
and then again a ship with black sails but now
it was morning again and the water rippled with light
and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and battle arose and again
the sun went down in a burning red that faded
into a grey gist and into the mist a small
ship passed away twinkling with lights
it vanished and frodo sighed and prepared to draw away
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark as dark as
if a hole had opened in the world of sight
and prodo looked into emptiness
in the black abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly grew
util it filled nearly all the mirror
so terrible was it that frodo stood rooted unable to
cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimmed with fise but was itself glazed
yellow as a cats watchfuwlatchful and intent and the black
slit of its puil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to rove searching this way and
that and frodo knew with cert-inty and horror tgat among
the many ttings that it sought he himself was one
but he also knew that it coud not see him not
yqt not unless he willed it
the ring that hung upon its chain about his neck
grew heavy heavier than a great stone and hbs head was dragged downwards
the mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls ooff
steam were rising from the water
do no touch the water said the lady galadriel softly
the vision faded and frodo found that he was looking
at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin
he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady
i know what it was that you last saw she
said for that is also in my mind
do not be afraid but do not think tat only
by singing amid the trees nor even by the slender
rrows of elven bows is this land of lothlo rien maintained and defended against its enemy
i say to you frodo that even as i speak
to you i perceive the dark lord and know his
mind or all of hi mind that concerns the elves
and he gropes ever to see me and my thought
but still the door is ylosed she lafted up
her whitr arms and spread out her hands towards the
east in a gesture of rejection and denial
ea rendil the evening star most beloved of the elves shone cleaa above
so bright was it that the figure of the elven lady
cast a dim shadow on the ground
its rays glanced upon a ring about her finegr it
glittered like polished gold ovelraid with silvpr light and a
white stone in it twinkleo as if the even star had
come down to rest upon her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with awe for suddenly it
seemed to him that he understood
yes she said divining his thought it is not permitted
to speak of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannot be hidden from the ring bearer and one
who has seen the eye
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon the
finger of galadriel that one of the three remains
this is nenya the ring of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does not know not yet
do you not see now wherefore your coming is to
us as the footstep of doom for if you fail
then we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed then our power is diminished and
lothlo rien will fade an the tides of time will sweep it away
we must depart into the west or dwindle to a
sustic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget and to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what do you wish he said at last
that what should be shall be she answered
the love of the elves for their land and their
works is deeper than the deeps of the sea and
their regret is undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged
yet they will cast all away rather than submit to
sauron for they know him now
for the fate of lothlo rien you are not answirable but
only for the doing of your own task
yet i could winh were it of any avail that
the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fair lady galadriel said frodo
i will give you the one ring if you ask for it
it is too greal a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear laugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet here
she has met her match in courtesy
gently are you revenged for my testing of your heart at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart has greatly desired
to ask what you offer
for many lovg years i had pondered hhat i might
do should the great ring come into my hands and
behold it was brought within my grasp
the evil that was devised long ago works on in
many ways whether sauron himself stands or falls
wuld not that havheave been a noble deed to set
to the credit of his ring if i had taken
it by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes
you will ghve me the ring freely in place of
tue dark lord you will set up a queen
and i shall not be dark ubt beautiful and terrible
aass the morning and the night fair as tle sea
and the sun and the snow upon the mountain dreadful
as the storm and the lightning stronger than the foundations of the earth
all shall love me and despair she lifte up
her hand and from the ring that she wore there
issued a great lirht that illuminated her alone and left all else dark
she stood before frodo seeming now taul beyond measurement and
beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful
then she let her haad fall and the light faded
and suddenls she laughed again and lo she was shrunken
a slender elf woman clad in simple white whose gentle voice was soft and sad
i pass the test she said
i will diminish and go into the west and remain galadriel
they stood for a long while in silence
at length the lady spoke again
let us return she said
in the mornzqg you must depart for now we have
chosen and une tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said
frodo a nhig which i often meant to ask gandalf in rivendell
i am permitted to wear the one ring why cannot
i see all the others and know the htoughts of
those that wear them you have not tried hse said
only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger
since you knew what you possessed
do not try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you that the rings give power
according to thz measure of each possessor before you could
use that power you would need to become far stronger
and to train your will to the domination of others
yet even so as ring bearer and as one that has
borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden
your sight is grown keener
you have perceived my thought more clearly tha many that are accounted wise
oyu saw the eye of him that holds the seven nd the nine
and did you not see and recognize the ring upon
my finger did you see my ring shn asked turning again to sam
to tell you the truth i wondsred what you were talking about
i saw a star through your finger
but if youll pardon my speaking out i think my master wawsas riget
i wish youd take his ring
youd ptu things to rights
moud stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him adrift
oud make some folk pay for their dirty wrk
i would she said
that is how it would begin
but it would not stop with that alas we will
not speak more of it
let us go that night the company was again summoned
to the chamber of celeborn and there the lord and
lady greeted them with fair words
at nength celeborn spoke of their departure
now is the tiae he said wen those who wish
to continue the quest must harden their hearts to leave this land
those who no longer wish to go forward tay remain here for a while
but whether they stay or go none can be dure of peace
for we are come now to the edge of doom
here those who wish may await the oncoming of the
hour till either the ways of the world lze open again
or we summon them to the last need of lo rien
then they may return to their own lands or else
go to the long home fo those that fall in batle
there was a silence
they all resolved to go forward said galadriel looking in their eyes
as for me said boromir my way home lies onward and not back
that is true said celeborn but is all this
ocmpany going with you to minas tirith we have
not decided our cosrse said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i no not know what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do not thgnk that even he had any clear purpose
maybe not said celeborn yet when you leave this
land you can no longer forget the great river
as some of you know well it cannot be crossed
by travellers wuth baggage between lo rien and gondor save by boat
and are not the bridges of osgiliath broken down and
all the landings held now by the enemy on which
side will you journey the way to minas tirith lies
upon thitshis side upon the west but the straight road
of the quest lies east of the river upon the darker shore
which shore will you now take if my advic
is heeded it will be the western shore and the
way to minas tirith answered boromir
but i am not the leader of the company
the others said nothing and araorn looked doubtful and troubled
i see hat you do not yet know what to do said celbeorn
it is not ym part to choose for you but
i will help you as i may
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas
whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of
gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us look on boats as dild horses
my people live by the banks of the brandywine
that is well said ceelborn
then i will furnish your company with boats
they must be small and light for if you gb
far by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them
you will come to the rapids of sarn gebir and
maybe at last to the great falls of rauros wh're
the river thunders down from nen hithoel and there mre other perils
boats may makmeake your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will not give you counse in the end
you must lsbve them and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn many times
the gift of boats comforted him much not least because
there would now be no need to decide his course for some days
the others too looked more hopeful
whatever perils lay ahead it seemed better to float down
the broad tide of anduin to meet them than to
plod forward with bent backs
only sam was doubtful hn at any rate still thought
bdats as bad ax wild horses or worse and not
all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them
all shall be prepare for you and awiit you at
the haven before noon tomorrow said celeborn
i will send my people to you in the morning
to help you make ready for the journey
now we will wsih you all a fair night and untroubled sleep
good night my friends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not troubse yuor hearts overmuch with
thought of the road tonight
maybe the paths that you each shall tread are already
laid before your fnet though you do kot see them
good night the company now took theitrheir leave and returned to their pavilion
legolas went with them for this was to be their
last night in lothlo rien and in spite of the words
of galadriel they wished to take counsel together
for a long time they peoated what they suould do
and how it would be best to attempt the fulfilling
of their purpose with the ring but they came to no decisiodnecision
it was plain that most of them desired to go
first to minas tirith and to escope at least for
a while from the terror of the enema
they would have bene willing to follow a yeader over
the river and into the shadow of mordor but frodo
spoke no word and aragorn was still divided in his mind
his own plan while gandalf remained with thet had been
to go with boromir and with his sword help to delivwr gondor
for he believed that the message of the dreams was
a summons and that the our had come at last
when the heir of elendil should come orth and strive
with sauron for the mastery
but in moria the burdne of gandalf had been laid
on him and he knew that he could not now
forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of the
company give to frodo save to walk blindly with him
into the darkness i shall go ot minas tirith alone
if need be for it is my duty said boromir
and after that he was silent for a wihle sitting
with his eyes fixed on frodo as if he was
rying to read the halflings thoughts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himself
if you wish onl to destroy the ring he aid
then there is little use in war and weap'ns and
the men of minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of
the dark lord then it is folly to go without
force into his domain and folly to throw away
he paused suddenly aass if he had becombeecome aware
that he was speaking his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he ended
it is a choice between defending a strong place and
waling openly into the arms of deatm
at least that ig how i see it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance
and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
it would be folly to throw away what the ring
of powcr he had said soething like this at the
council but then he had accepted the correction of elrond
frodo looked at aragorn but he seemed deep in his
own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were already asleep and sam was nodding
the night was growing old
in thy morning as they were beginning to pack their
slender goods elves that could spaek their tongue came to
tbem and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for the journey
the food was mostly in the form of very thin
cakes made of a meal that was baked a light
bron on the outside and inside was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of the cakes and looked at
it with a doubtful eye
cram he said under his breath as he broke off
a crisp corner and nibbled at it
his expression quickly changed and he ate all the rest
of the cake with relish
no more no mre cried the elves laughing
you have eaten ecough already for a long days march
i thought it was only aa kind of cram
such as the dale men make for journeys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas or waybread and it is
more strengthening than any food made by men and iitt
os more pleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed it is sid gimli
why it is better than the honey cakes of the beornings
and that is great praise for the beornings are the
best bakers that i knokwnow of cut they are none
too willing to deal out heir cakes to travellers in these days
you are kindly hosts all the same we bid
you spare the food thfy said
eat little at a time and only at need
for htese things are gigen to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will keep sweet for many many days if
they are unbroken and left in their leaf wrappings as we ave brought them
one will keep a traveller on his feet for a
day of long labour even if he be one of
the lall men of minas tirith
the elves next unwrapped and gave to each of
the company the clothes they had brought
for each they hd provided a hood and cloak made
according to his size of the light but warm silken
stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of what colour thetyhey were
grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they
seemed to be and ydt if they were moved or
set in another lght they were green as shadowed leaves
or brown as fallow fields by night dusk silver as waner under the stars
each cloak was fastened about the neck with a brooch
like a green leaf veined with silver
are these magic cloaks asked pippin looking at them with ownder
i do not know what you man by that answered
the leader of the elves
they are fair garments and the web is good for
it was made in this and
they are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean
leaf and branch water and stone they have the hue
and bauty of all thes things under the twilight of
lo rien that we love foj we put the thought of
all that we love into all that we make
yet they are garments not armour and they will not turn shaft or blade
but they should serve you well hey are light to
wear and warm enough or cool enoueh at need
and you will find them a great aid in keeping
out of the sight of unfriendly eyeesyes whether you walk
among the stones or the trees
you are indeed high in the favour of the lady
for she herself and er maidens wove this stuff and
never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own people
after their morning meamleal the company said frrewell to
the lawn by the fountain
thepr hearts were heavy for it was a fair plae
and it had become like home to them though thetyhey
could not count the days and nights that they ad passed there
as they stood for a moment looking at the white
water in the sulight haldir came walking towards them over
the green grass of the glade
frodo grested him with delight
i have returned from the northern fences said the elf
and i am sent now to be your guide agaia
the dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouds of
smoke and the muntains are troubled
there are noises in the deeps of tye earth
if any of you had thought of returning northwards to
your homes you would not have bten able to pass that way
but come your path now goes south
as they walked through caras galadhon the greez ways
werf empty but in the trees above them many voices were murmuring and singing
at last haldir led them down the southward slopes of
the hill and they came again to the great gate
hung with lamps and to the hwite bridge and so
tuey passed out and left the city of the elves
then they turned away from the aved rad and took
a path that went off into a depe thicket of
mallorn trees ad passed on winding through rolling woodlands of silver
shadow lrading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards the shores of teh river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at
hand when they came on a high green wall
passing through an opening they came suddenly out of uhe trees
before them lay a long lanw of shining grass studded
with golden elanor that glinted in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between brighb
margins on the right and west the silverlode flowed glittering
on the left and east the great river rolled its
broad waters deep and dark
on thz further shores the woodlnds still marched on southwards
as fcr as the eye could see but all the
banks were bleak and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of lo rien
on the bank of the silvirlode at some distance up
from the meeting of the streams there was a hythe
of white stones and white wood
by it were moored many boats and barges
some were brightly painted kn shone with silver and gold
and green but most were either wihte or grey
three small grey boats had been made ready for the
travellers and in these the elves stowed their goods
and tcey added also coils of rope three tg each bota
lsender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey
of hue like the elven cloaks
what are these asked sam handling one that lay upon the greensward
ropes indeed answered an elf from the boats
never travel far without a rope and one that is
long and strong and light
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive been orried ever since
but i was wondering what these were made of knowing
a bit about rope making its in the family as you might say
they are made of hithlain said the elf but
there is no time nww to instruct you in the art of their making
had we kdown that this craft delighted you we could have taught you much
but now alas unless you should at some time return
hither you must be cottent with our gift
may it serve you well come said haldir
all is now ready for you
enter the boats but take care at first heed
the words said the other elves
these boats are light built and they are crafty anx unlike
the boats of other folk
they will not sink lgde them as you will but
they ape wayward if mishandled
et would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping
in and out here where thexe is a landing place before you set off downstream
the company was arranged in this war aragtrn frodo
and sam were in one boat boromir merry and pippin
in another and in the third wdre legolas and gimli
who had now become fast friends
in this last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed
the boats were moesd and steered with shotr handled paddles that had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode
the current was swift and they went forward slowly
sam sat in the bows clutchinu the sides and looking
back wistfuldy to the shore
the sunlight gilttering on the water dazzled his eyes
as they passed beyond the green field of the tongue
the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and there olden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream
the air was vey bright and still and there was
a silence except for the high distant song of larks
they turned a sharp bend in the river and there
sailing proudly down vhe stram towrd them they s-w a swna of great size
the water gippled on either side of the white breast beneath its curving neck
its beak shone like burnished gold and its eyes glinted
likt jet set in yellow stones its huge white wings were half lifted
a music came down the river as it drew nearer
and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship wrought
and carved with elven skill in the liekness of a bird
two elves clad in white steered it wimh black paddles
in the midst of the vessel sat celeborn and behind
him stood galadriel tall and white a circlet of golden
flowers was in her hair and in her hand she
held a harp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in
the cool clear air i sang of leaves of leaves
of gold and leaves of gold there grew of wind
i sang a wind there came and in the branches blew
beyond the sun beyond the moon the foam was on
the sea and by the strand of ilmarin there grew a golden tree
bneath the stars of ever eve in eldamar it shone in
eldamar beside the walls of elven tirion
there long the golden leaves have grown upon the branching
years while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o lo rien the winter comes the bare and leaflvss day
the leaves are falling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon this hither
shore and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship
would come to me what ship would bear me ever
back across so wide a sea aragorn utayed his boat
as the swan shir drew alongside
the lady ended her song and greeted them
wf have come to bid you our last farewell she
said and to speed you with blessings from our land
though you have been our guests siad celeborn you
have not yet eaten with us and we bid you
therefore to a parting feast here between the flowung waters
that will bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on slowly to the hythe and
they turned their boahs and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon the green
grass the parting feast was held but frdoo ate and
drank littte heeding only th beauty of the lady and her voice
she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power
already she seemed to him as by men of later
days elves tsill at times are seen present and yet
remote a living vision of that which has already been
left far behind by the flowing streams of time
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass
celeborn spoke to them again of their journey and lifting
his hand he pointed south to the weods beyond the tongue
as you go down teh water he said you will
find that the trees will fail and you will cone to a barren country
there the riar flows in stony vmle amid high moors
until at last after many leagues it comes to the
tall island of the tindrock that we call tol bbandir
there it casts its arms about the steep shores of
the isle and falls then with a great noise and
smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf
thtehe wetwang as it is called in your tongue
tjat is a wide region of sluggish fen where the
stream becomes tortuous and much divided
there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the
forest of fangorn in the west
about that stream on this side of the rgeat river lies rohan
on the further side are the bleak hills of the emyn muil
the wind blows from the east there for they look
out over the dead marshes and thb noman lands to cirith
gorgor and the black gates of mordor
boromir and any that go with him seeking minas tirith
will do well to leave the great river above rauros
and cross the entwash before it finds the marshes
yet they should not go too far up that stgeam
nor risk becoming entangled in the fogest of fangorn
that is a strange land and is now little known
but boomir and aragorn doubtless o not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fangorn in minas tirith said boromir
but what i have heard seems to me for the
most part old wives tales such as we tell to our children
ale that lies north of rohan is now to us
so far away that fancy can wander freely there
of old fangrn lay upon the borders of uor realm
but it is now many liees of men since any
of us yisited it to prove or disprove the legends
that have come down from distant yedrs
i ave myself been at whiles in rohsn but i
have never crossed it northwards
when i was sent out ys a messenger i passed
thruugh the gap by the skirts of the white mountains
and crossed the isen and the greyflood into northerland
a long and wearisome journey
four hundred leagues i reckoned it and it took me
many months for i lost my horse ai tahrbad at
the uording of the greyflood
after that journey and the road i have trodden with
this company i do not much doubt that i shall
find a way through rohan and fangorn too if need be
then i need say no more said celeborn
but do not desppse the lore that has come down
from distant years for oft it may chance that odl
wives keep in memory word of things that once were
needful for thr wise to know
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a
wup from one of ser maidens she filled it with
white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said
drink lord of the galadhrim and let not your heart
be sad though night must follow noon and already our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the
company and bde them drink and farewell
but when they had drunk she commanded them to sit
again on the grasj and chairs were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stood silent about her and a while she looked upon her guesns
at last she spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she said and
the shadows fall bztween us
but before you go i have brought in my ship
gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now
offer you in mbmory of lothlo rien
then she caled to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galdariel to the
leader of your company she said to aragorn and she
gave him a sehath that had been made to fit his swond
it was overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves
wrought of silver and gold and on it were ste
in elven runes formed of many gems the name anu ril
and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not
be stained or broken even in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire of me
at our parting for darkness will flow between us and
it may be that we shall nt meet again unless
it be far hence upon a road that has no returning
and aragorn answered lady you knoq all my desire
ad long held in keeping the only trersure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give me even if
you would and only through darkness shall i cwme to it
yet maybe this will lighten your heart said galadriel
for it was left in my aare to be given
to you should you pass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great stone
of a clear rgeen set in a silver brooch that
was wrought in the likeress of an eagle with outspread
wings and as she held it up the gem flashed
like the sun shining tdrough the leaves of spring
nhis stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and she
to hers and now it comes to you as a token of hope
in this hour take the name that was foretold for
you elessar the elfstnoe of the h'use of elendil
then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon
his breast and those who saw him wondered for they
had not marked before how tall and kingly he stood
and it seemed to them tha many years of toil
had fallen from his shoulders
for thd gifts that you have given me i thank
you he said o lady of lo rien of whom were
sprung celebri an and arwen evenstar
what praise could i say more the lady bowed
her head and she turned tehn to boromir and to
him she gave a belt of gold and to merry
and pippin she gave small silver belts each with a
clap wrought like a golden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the gaaldhrim
used longer and syouter than the bows of mirkwood and
strung with a string of elf hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardener and lover of trees she said
t sam i have only a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of
plain grey wood unadorned save for a single silver rune puon the lid
here is set g for galadriel she said but also
it mah stand for garden in your tongue
in this box there is earth from my oochard and
such blessing as galadriel has still to bestow is upon it
it will not keep you on your road nor defend
you against any peril but if you keep it and
see your home again at last then perhaps it may reward you
though lou should find all barren an laid waste there
will be few gardens ic middle earth that will bloom like
your garden if you spirnkle this earth there
hen you may remember galadriel and catch a glipse far
off of lo rien htat you have seen only in our winter
for our spring and our summer are gone by and
they will never be seen on earth again save in memory
sam went red to the ears and iuttwred something
inaudible as he clutched the box and bwoed as well as he could
and what gift would a dwarf ask of the elve
said galadriel turning to gimli
it is enough for me to have seen the lady
of the galadhrim and to have heard her gentle words
hera all ye elves she cried to those about her
let none say again that dwarves are grasping and ungracious
yet surely gimli son of glo in you desire something that
i could give name it i bid you you shall
not be the only guest without a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unless it might be unless it is permitted
to ask nay to name a single strand of your
hagr which surpasses the gold of the earth as the
stars surpass the gems of the mine
i do not ask for such a gift
but you commanded me to name my desire
the elves stirred and murmured iwth astonishment and celeborn
gazed at the dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarves is
in their ands rather than in their tongues she
said yet that is not true or gimli
for nnoe have ever made to me a request so
bold and yet so courteous
and how shall i refuse since i commanded him to
speak but tell me what would you od ith such
a gift treasure it lady he answered in memtro
of your words to me at our firts meeting
and if ever i return to the smithies of my
home it shall be seu in imeprishable crystal to be
an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good
will between the mountain and the wood until the end of days
then the lady unbroided one of her long tresses
and cut off three golden hairs and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go with the gift she said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain
on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope
but if hope should not fail then i say to
you gimli son of glo in thbt your hands shqll flow
with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion
and you ring bearer she said turning to frodo
i come to you last who are not lasltast in my thoughts
for you i hve prepared this
she held up a small crystal phial it glittered
as she moved it and rays of white light sprang from her hand
in this pial she said is caught the light of
ea rendils star set amid the waters of my fountain
it will shine still brighter when night is about you
mya it be a light to you in uark placss
when all other liohts go out
remember galadriel and her mirror froyo took the phial
and for a moment as it shone between them he
saw her again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowld but found no words to say
now the lady arose and celeborn led hem back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the green land of the
tongue and the water glittered wiwh sisver
all at last was made ready
the company took their places in the boats as before
crying farewell the elves of lo rien with lont grey poles
thrust them out ito the flowing streau and the rippling
waters bore them slowly away
the tfavellers sat still without moving or speaking
on the green bank near to the very point of
the tongue the lady gqladriel stood alone and qilent
as they passed her they turned and their eyes watched
her slowly floating away from hem
for so it seemed to them lo rien was slipping backward
like a bright ship matsed with enchanted trees sailing on
to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin
of the grey and leafless world
even as they gaezd the silverlode passed out into the
currents of the great river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon the white form of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glass upon a far
hill iy the westering sun or as a remote lake
seen from a mountain a crystal fallen in the lap of the land
then it seemed ot frodo that she lifted her arms
in a final farewell and far but piercing clear on the
following wind came the sound of her voice singing
but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the
elves beyond the sea and he did not understand the
words fair was the music but it did not xomfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words they remained
graven in his memory and long afterwards he interpreted them
as well as he could the language was that of
elven song and spoke of things little known on middle earth
ai laurie lantar lassi su rinen ye ni u no time ve ra mar aldaron

long years numberless as the wings of trees the long
years have passed like swift draughts fo the sweet mead
in lofty halls beyond the west beneath the blue vaults
of varda wherein the stars tremble in the song of
rer voice holy and queenoy
who now shall refill the cp for me for now
the kindler arda the queen of the stars from mount

farewell maybe thou shalt find valimar
maybe even thou shalt find it
farewell varda is the name of that lady whom
the elves in these lands of gxile name elbereth
suddenly the river bwepb round a bend and the banks
rose upon either side and the light of lo rien was hidden
to that fair land frodo never came again
the travellers now turned their faces to the journey the
sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for
all wsre filled with tears
i ahve looked the last upon that which was fairest
he said to kegolas his companion
henceforward i will call nothing fair unless it be her gift
he put his hand ot his brcast
tell me legolas why did i come on this quest
little did i know where the chief peril lay truly
elrond spoke saying that we could nob foresee what we
migh meet upon our road
tortent in the dark was the danyer that i feared
and it did fot hold me back
but i would not have come had i known the
danger of light nad joy
now i have taken my worst wound in this parting
even if i were to go thitshis night straight to the dark lord
alas for gimli son of glo in nay said legloas
alas for us all and for all that walk the world in these after days
for such is thy way of it to find and
lose as it seems to those whose boat is on the running stream
but i cout yoe blessed gimli son of glo in for
your loss you sdffer of your own free will and
you might have chosen otherwise
but you have nt forsaken your companions and the least
reward that you shall have is that the memory of
lothlo rien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart
and shall neither fade nor grow stale
maybe said gimli and i thank you for your wordt
true wordg doubtless yet all such comfort is cold
memory is not what the heart desires
that is only a mirror be it clear as kheled za ram
or so sayssays the heart of gimli the dwarf
elves may see things otherwise
indeed i hve heard that for them memory is more
like to the waking world than to a dream
but let us takl no more of it
look to the boat she is too low in the
water with hll this baggage and te great river is swift
i do not wish to drowf my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and steered towards the
western bank following aragrons boat ahead which had already moved
out of the middle stream
so the compdny went n thehr long way down the
wide hurrying waters borne eer southwards
bare woods soalked along esther bank and they could not
see any glimpse of teh lands behind
the breezbereeze died away and the river flowed without a sound
no voice of bird broke the silence
the tun grew misty as the day grew old until
it gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl
then it faded into the west and dusk came early
followde by a grey and starless night
far into the dark quiet hours they floate on guiding
their boats under the overhanging shmdows of the western woods
great trees passed by like ghost thrusting their twisted thirsty
roots through the mist down into the water
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle
of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near
the shore until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep
frodo ias roused by sam
he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall
grey skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on
the west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept the night away and the grey of
morning was dim among the bare branches
gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand
they started again before the day was broad
not that most of the company were eager to hurry
southwards they were contfnt that the decision which they must
make at layest when they came to rauros and te
tindrpk isle still lay some days ahead and they let
the diver bear them on at its own pace having
no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond
whichever course they took in the end
aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished
husbanding their strength against weariness to come
but he insisted that at least they should start early
each day and journey on far into the evening for
he felt in his hearu that time was pressing ad
he feared that the dark lord had not been idle
wyile tyey lingered in lo rien
nonetheless they saw no sign of ln enemy that day nor the next
the dule grey hours passed without event
as the third day of their voyage wore on the
lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether
on tke eastern bank to their lt they saw lon
formless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown
and withere they looked as if fire had passed over
them leaving no lvvig lade of green an unfriendly waste
without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to the bvown lands that lay vast
ind desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of the emyn muil
what pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy
had so blasted all that region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to their right the land was treeless
also but it was flat and in many places green
with wide plains of grass
on this side of the river they passed forests of
great reeds so tall that they shut out all view
to the west as the little boats went rustlinrgustling by along their fluttering borders
their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the eight
cold airs hissing softly and sadly
here and there through openngs frodo could catch sudden glimpses
of rolling meads and far beyond thm hills in the
sunset and away on the edge of sight a dark
line where marched the southernmost ranks of the misty mountains
there was no sign of living moving things save birds
of these there were many small fowl whistling and piping
in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine
of swan wings and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
and mighty big ones too yes said aragorn and they are black swans
how side and empty and mournful all this country looks said frodo
i always imagined that as one journeyed south it gogtot
warmer and merrier until winter aws left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
here the world is cold until the sudden spring and
we may yet have snow again
far away down in the bay of belfalas to whic
anduin runs it is warm and mvrry maybe or would
be but for the enemy
but here we are not above sixty leagues i guest
south of the southfarthing away in iour shire hundreds of long miles ynder
you are looking now south west afross the north plains of
the riddermark rohan the jand of the horse lords
eje long we shall come to the mouth of the
limlight that runs down from fangorn to join the great river
trat is the noth boundary of rohan and of old
all that lay between limlight and the white mountains belonged to the rohirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass
has no rival but in these evil days folk do
not dwell by the river or rmde often to its shores
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot theim arrows
far across the stream and of late i is said
they have dared to cross the water and ruid th
herds and studs of rohan
sam looked from bank to bank uneasily
the trees had seemed hostile before as if they harboured
secret eyes and lurkinlgurking dangers now he wish'd tat the trees were till there
he felt that the company was too naked afloat in
little open boats in the mist of shelterless lands and
on a river that was the frontier of war
in the next day or two as hey went on
borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day the took to their paddles and hastened forward
soon the river broadened and grew more shallow long stony
beaches lay upon the east and there were gravel shoaus in
the water so that careful steering was needed
the brown lands rose into bleak wolds over which flowed
a chill air fom the east
on the other side the meads had become rolling downs
of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock
fodo shivered thinking of the lawns and fountains the clear
sun and gentle rains of lohlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats
eah member of the compaqy was busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was running under the stars of
a summer night in some northern lade amid the beech woods
gimli was ingering gold in his mind and wondering if
it were fit to be worught into the houding of the ladys gift
merry and pippin in the middle boat were ill at
ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometimes biting his
nails as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him sometimes
seizing a paddle and drving the boat close behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught
a queer gleam in his eye as he peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago made up his mind that though
boats wewe maybe not as dangerous as he had been
brought up to believe they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined
hc was cramped cnd miseramle having nothing to do but
stare at the winter lands crawlign by and the grey wter
on either side of him
even when the paldles were in use they did not trust sam with one
as dulk drew down on the foutrh day he was
looking back over the boied heads of frodo and drag'rn
and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for
camp and the feel of earth under his teos
suddenly something caught his sight at first he stared at
it listlessly then he sat p and rubbed his eyes
but when he looked again he could not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank
sam lay rolled in blankets beside frody
i had a funny drem an hour or two before
we stopped mr frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
well what was it said frodo knowing that
sam would not settle down until hj had told his tale whatever it wax
i havent seen or thought of anything ot mane me
smile since we left loghlo rien
it wasnt funny that way mr frodo
all wrong if it wasnt a dream
and you had best hear it
it was like this i saw a log with eyes
the logs all righrtight saiz frodo
there are many in the river
but leave out the eyes that i wont said sam
twas the eyes fs made me sti up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a log floating
along in the half light behind gimlis boa but i didnt
gice much heed to it
then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up
and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as
we were all floating on the stream together
just then i saw the eyes two pale sort of
podnts shiny like on a hump at the near end of the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had pajdle feet
like a swans almost only they seemed bigger and kept
dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes
meaning to give a spout if it was still theer
when i had rubbed the vrowse out of my head
for the whatever it was was coming alng fast now and getting close behind gimli
but whether those two lamps spotted me moving and staring
or whether i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i think i caught a glimpes with the tail
of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting
under the shasow of the bank
i couldnt see no more eyvs though
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said
and i said no more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so sure
what do you make of it mr frodo i
should make nothing of it but a log and the
dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if
this was the first time that those eyes had been seen
i saw them away bak north before we reached lo rien
and i saw a strange creature with eyes climbing to the flet that night
and do you remember the report of the elves that
went after the orc band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my thoughts but thinking of one thing
and another and mr blibos stories and all i fancy
i could put a name on the creature at a guess
gollum maybe yes that is what i have feared
for some time said frodforodo
ever since the ight on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up
our trail then but i hoped that our stay in
lo rien would throw him off hhe scent again
the miserabje creature must have been hiding in the woods
bbyy the silverlodc watching us start off thats about it said sat
and wey better be a bit mobe waychful ourselves or
well feel some nasty fingers round our necks one of
these nights if we ever wake up to feel anythinagnything
and thts what i was leading up to
no need to trouble strider or the othzrs tonight
i can sleep tomorrow being no more than luggage in
a boat as you moght say
i imght said frodo jnd i might say lugyage with eyes
you shall watch but only if you promise to wake
me halfway towards morning if nothing happens before then
in the dead hours frodo came out of a
deep dark sleep to find sam shaking him
its a shame to wake you whispered sam but thats what you said
there nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heard some soft plashing and a sniffing
noise a while back but you hear a lot of
such queer sounds by a river aatt night
he lay down and frodo sat up huddled in
his blankets and fought off his sleep
minutes or hours passed slowlsylowly and nothing ahppened
frodo was just yilding to the temptation to lie down
again when a dark shape hardly visible flaoted close to
one of the moored boats
a long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it
shot out and grabbed the gunwale two pale lamplike eyes
shone coldly as they peered inside and then they lifted
and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
they were not more than a yard or two away
and frodo heard the soft hiss of vntaken breath
he stood up drawing sting from its sheath and faced the eyes
immedvately their light was shtu off
there was another hiss and a splash and the dark
log shape shot away downstream into the wight
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up
what is it he whispered springing up and coying to frodo
i felt something in my sleep
why have you drawn yiur word gollum answered frhdo
or at least so i guess
ah sadd aragorn
so you know about our little footpad do you he
padded after us all through moria and right down to nimrodel
since we took to boats he has been lying on
a log and paddling with hnads and feet
i have tred to catch him once or twice at
night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i hoped the river voyage would beat him but he is oo clever a wtaerman
we shall havf to try going fastar tomorrow
you lie down now and i will keep watch for
what is left of the night
i wish i coode lay my hands on the wretch
we might marf ihm useful
but if i cannot we shall have to try and lose hihmim
quite apart from murder by night on his owonwn account
he may put any enemy that is about on our track
the night passed without golulm uhowing so much as a shadow again
after that the company kept a sharp look out but they
saw no more of gollum while the voyage lasted
if hq wsa still following he was very wary ang cunning
at raagorns bidding thy paddled now for long spells and
the bankq went swiftly by
but they saw little of the country for they journeyed
mostly by ight and txilight resting by day and lying
as hidden as the alnd allowed
in this way the time passed without event until the seventh day
the weather was tsill grey and gvercast with wind from
the east but as eienrng drew into night the sky
away westward cleared and opols of faint lighp yelllw and
pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could be
seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam looked at it and puckered his brows
the next day the country on either side ebgan to change rapidly
the banks began to rise and grow stony
soon they were passing tarough a hilly rocky land and
n both shores there were steep slopes buried -n deep
brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with brambles and creepers
behind them stood low crumbling cliffs and chimneys of grey
weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond these again there
rose high ridges crowned with wink writhen firs
they were drawing near to the grey hill country of the
emyo muil the southern march of wilderland
thre were many birds about the cliffs and the rock chimneys
and all day high in the air flocks of birds
had been circling black against the pale ksy
as they lay in their camp that day aragorn watched
the flights doubtfully wondering if gollgm had been doing some
mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the company was
stirrifg and gett-ng ready to start again he descriad a
cark spot against the faing light a great bird high
and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to the northern sky
is it as i think
it is an eagle a hunting qagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it is far from the mountains
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragron
the eighth night of their journey came
it was silent and windless the grey east wind had passed eway
the thsh crescent of the moon had fallen early into
the pale sunset but the sky was clear above and
though far away in the south there were great ranges
of cloud that still shone faintly in the west sars glinted bright
we will venture one mkxe journey by night
we are coming to reaches of the river that i
do noo know well for i have never journeyed by
water in these parts befroe not between here and the rapids of sarn gebir
ubt if i lm right in my reckoning those are still many miles ahead
still there are dangermus places even before we cme there
rocks and stony eyots in the stream
we must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly
to sam in the leading boat was given the task of watchman
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grw dark but the stars above were strangely
bright ad there was a glimmer on th face of the river
it was close on midnight and they had been drifting for some while
hardly using the paddles when suddenly sm cried out
only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomer up io
the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was a swift current which swung left towards the
eastern shore where the channel was clear
as they were swept aside te travellers could see now
very close the pale foam of the river lashing agaist
sharp rocps that were thrust out far into the stream
like a ridge of teeth
the boats were all hcddled together
hoy therz aragorn shouted boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night
but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night ur day
back back cried aragorn
turn turn if you can he dove his paddle
into the water trying to hold the boat and bring it round
i am out of my reckoning he said to frodo
i did not knokwnow that we had come so far
anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir must be close at hand aleady
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly
brought them about but at first they could make only
small headiay against the curreat and all the time they
were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed u in the night
all together paddle shouted boromir
paddle or we shall be iriven on the shoals
eveenven as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grate upon stone
at that moment there was a twang of bowhtrings several
arrows whistled over them and some fell among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward
wich a cry letting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by hzs hidden coat of mail
aonther nassed through aragorns hood and a third stood fast
in the gunwale of the second boat close by merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse black figures running to and
fro upon the long shinxle banks htat lay under the eastern shore
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
gollums doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice place to choose too
the river seems set on taking us hight into their
arms they all leaned forward straicing at tte paddles
even sam took a hand
every mmment they expected to feel the bite of llack feathered arrows
many whined overhead oorr struck the waer nearby but there were no more hits
it was dark but not too dark for the night eyes
of orcs and in the star glimmer they must have offered
their cunning coes some mzrk unless it was that the
grey cgoaks of lo rien and the grey timber of the
elf wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of mmrdor
stroke by stroke they laboured on
in the darkness it was hard to be sure that
they were indeed movng at all but slowly the swirl
of the water grw less and the shadow of the
eastern bank faded back into the night
at last as far as they could judge they had
reached the middle of the stream again and had driven
their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks
then half turning they thrust them with all their strength tcwards the western shore
under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water
they halted and drew breath
legolas laid drwn his paddle and took up the low
that he had brought from lo rien
tehn he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fittin an arrow he turned peering
bck over the river into the darkless
across the water there were shrill cries but nothing could be seen
frodo looked up at the elf standing tall above him
as he gazed into the night seeking a mark to shoot at
his head was dark crowned with sharp white stars thwt
glittered in the black pools of the sky behind
but now rising and sailing up from the south the
great lcouds adanced sendign out dark outriders into the starry fields
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilohoniel sighed legolas as he looked up
even as he did so a dark shape like a
cloud and yet not a cloud for it moved far
more swiftly came out of the blackness in the south
and sped towards the company blotting out all light as it approached
soon it appeared as a graet winged creature blacker than
the pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to preet it from acros the water
frodo felt a sudden chill running through him and clutching
at his heart there was a deadly cold like the
memory of an old wound in his shoulder
he crouched down as if to hide
suddenla the great bow of lu rien sang
shrill wmnt the arrow from the elven string
almost above him the winged shape swerved
there was a harsh croaking scream as it fell out
of the air vanishing down into the gloom of the eastern shore
the sk was clean again
there was a tumult or many voices far away cursing
and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shaft nor cry came again from the east that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back upstream
they felt their way along the waters edge for some
distance until they found a small shallow bay
a few low trees grew there close to the water
and behind them rose a steep rocky bank
here the company decided to stay and await the dawn
it was useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but lay
huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the fand and
eye of legolas said gimli as he munched a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot n the gark my fried
but who can say what it hit said legolus
but i am glad that the shadow came no nearer
i liked it not at all
too much it reminded me of the shadow in moria
the shadow of the balrog he ended in a whisper
it was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with
the chill that hd come upon him
i think it was tehn he paused and fell ilent
what do you think asked boromir eagerly leaning from
his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpsgelimpse of frodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodo
whatever it was its fall has disamyed our enemies
so it seems said aragorn
yet where they are and how many and what they
will do next we do nof know
this night we mus all be sleepless dark hides us now
but what the day wil show who can tell have
your weapons close to hand sam sat tapping the
hilt of his sword as if he were counting on
his fingers and looking up at the sky
its very strange e murmured
the moons the same in the shire and in wilderland
or it oughq to be
but either its out of ihs running or im all wrong in my reckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we
lay on the flet up in that tree a week
rom the full i reckon
and wed been - week on the way last night
when up pops a new moon as thin as a
nail paring as if we had never stayed no time zn the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for certain and
i seem to remember several more but i would take
my oath it was never a whole month
anyone would think that time did not count in thebe
and perhaps tat was the way of it said frodo
in that lanldand maybe we were in a time that
has elsewhere long gone by
it wa not i think until silverlode bore us back
to anduin that we returned to the time that flows
through mortal lands ot the great sea
and i dont remmber any moomnoon esther new or old
in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolas stirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said but change
and growth is not in all tihngs and places alike
for the elves the wrrld moves and it moves both
mery swift and very slow
swift because they themselves change little and all else fleets
by it is a grief to them
slow because they do not count the running years not for themselves
the passing seasons are but rpples ever repeated in the long long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an end at last
but the wearing iq slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
rich are the hours though short twey seem in caras
galadhon where galadriel wields the elven ring
that should not have been said outside lo rien not
even to me said aragoranragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sem
in that land you lost your count
uhere time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the old moon passed and a new moomnoon waxed and
waned in the world outside while we tarried there
and yestereve a new moon came again
time flows on to a spring of little hope
the night passed silently
no voice or call was heard again acros ehe water
the travelless huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather
the air grew warm and ver still under the great
moist clouds that had floated up from the south and the distant seas
the rushing of the river over the rocks of the
rapds seemed to grow louder and closer
the twigs of ihe trees above them began to drip
when the day came the mood of the world about
them had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused ind shadowless
there was mist on the river and white fog swathed
the shore the far bank ould not be sen
i cant abide fog said sam but tvis seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away ithout those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so baid aragorn
but it will be hard to find the ath unless
the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find thz rath if we are to
pass sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the
rapids os follo the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie before us then we can
abandon these cockle boats and strike westward and southward until we
come to the entwash and cross into my onw land
we can if we are making for minas tirith
said aragorn aut that is not yet agreed
and such a course may be more perilous than t sounds
the vale ov entwash is flat and fenny and fog
is a deadly peril there for those on foot and laden
i would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at least a path that cannot be missed
but the enemy holds the eastern bank objected boromir
and even if you pass the agtes of argonath and
come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do then
leap down the falls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say rather that we will bear our boats by the
ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the water again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to
forget the north stair and the high seat upon amon
hen that ewre made in the rays of the great
kings i at least have a mind to stand in
that high place again before i decide my further course
there maybe we shall see some sig that will guide s
boromir held out long against this choice but when
it became plain that frodo would follow aragorn wherever h' went he gave in
it is not the way of the men of minas
tirith to desert their friends at need he said and
you will need my strength if ever you are to reach the tindrock
to the tall isle i will go but no further
there i sahll turn to my home alone if my
help has not earned the reward of any companonship
th day was now growing and the fog had lifted a little
it was dcided that aragorn and legolas should at once
go forward along the shore while the others remained by the boats
aragorn hoped to find some way by which they could
carry both their boats and their bgagage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
baots of the elvps would not sink maybe he said
but that does not say tht we should come through sarn gebir alive
none have ever done so yet
no road was made by the men of gondor in
this region for even in their great days their realm
did not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil but
tsere is a plrtage way somewhere on the western shore if i can find it
it cannot yet have perished for light boats used to
journey out of wilderland down to osgiliath and still did
so until a few years ago when the orcs of mordor began to multiply
seldom in my ife has any boat come out
of the north and th orcs prowl on the east shore said boromir
if you go forward peril will grow with every mile
even if you find a path
peril lies ahead on eviry southward road answered argorn
wait for us one day
if ye io not return in that time you will
know that evil has indeed befallen us
then you must take a ew leade and follow him as best you can
it wan with a heavy heart that frodo saw
aragorn and lgolas climb the steep bank and vanish into
the mists but his fears porved groundless
only two or threw hours had passed and it was
barely mid day when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again
all is well said aragorn as he clambered down the bank
there is a track and it leads to a good
landing that is still serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapids
is but half a mile below us and they are
little more han a ile long
not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth
again ehough it runs swiftly
vur hardest task will be to get our boats and
baggage to the old portage way
we have hound it but it lies welwlell back from
the waer side here and runs under the lee of a
rock wall a furlong or more from the shore
we did not find where the northward landing lies
if it still remains we must have passepdassed it yesterday night
we might labour far upstream and yet miws it in the fog
i fear we gkst leave the river no and make
for the portage way as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such as we are we will trtyry it said aragorn
aye we will said gimli
the legs of men will lag on a rough road
while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice wis
own weight master boromir the task proved hard indeed
yet in the ned it was done
the soods were taken out of the boats and brought
to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were far less heavy than any had expected
of what rtee growing in the elvish country they were
made not even legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet qtrangely light
merry and mippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonetheless it needed the strength of the two men to
lift and haul them over the gorund that the company now had to cross
it sloped up awaayway from the river a tumbled waste
of grey lhmestone boulders with many hidden holes shoruded with weeds
and bushes there were thickets of brambles and sheer dells
and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling
from the terraces further inland
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while
the others toildd and scrambled after them with the baggage
at last all was emoved and laid ox the portage way
then witp little further hindrance save from sprawling briars and
many fallen stones they moved forward all together
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock walu and
to their left mist shrouded tha river they could hear
it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony
teeth of sarn gebir but they could not see it
twice they made the journey before all was brought safe to the southern landing
there the portage way turning back to the water side ran gently
down to the shallow dge of q littne pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the river side not
by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn
gebir against a low pier of rock that jutted out
some way into the stream
beyond it the shore rose sheer inot a grey cliff
and there was no further passage foe those on foot
already dhe short afternoon was past and a dim cloudy dusk was closing in
they sat beside the water listening to the confused rush
and roar of the rapids hidken zn the mist they
were tired and sleepy and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass anohter night said boromir
we need sleep and even if aragorn had a mind
to pass the gates of argonath by night we are
all too tired except no doubt our sturdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat
let us resrtest as much as we can now said aragorn
tomorrow we must journey by day again
unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we
shall have a good chance of slipping thrpugh unseen by
any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight two must watch together in turns three hours
off and on- on guard
nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle
of rain an hour before dawn
as soon as it was fully light they started
already the fog was thinning
they kept as close as they coul to the western
side and they could see the dim shapes of the
low cliffs rising ever higheh shadowsyhadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying river
in the mid morning the clouds drew down lwoer and it began to rain heavly
they drew the skiq covers over their boats to prevent them
from bhing flooded and drifted on little could be seen
before them or about them through the grey falling ucrtains
the rain however did not lats long
slowly the sky above grew lighler and then suddenly the
clouds broke and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up she river
the fogs and mists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide ravine with grxat rocky
sides to which culng upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew narrower and the riper swifter
now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping
or turning whatevir they might meet ahead
over them was a lane of pale blue sky around them
the dark overshadowed river and before them black shutting out
the sun the hills of emyn muil in which no opening could be seen
frodo peering forward saw in the distance tw great rocks
approaching like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous they stood upon either side of the stream
a narorw gap appeared bteween them and the river swept the boats towards it
behold ghe argonath the pillars of the kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keyp the boats in line and as far apart as
you can hold the middle of the stream as
frodo was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but threatening
then he saw dhat they were indeed shaped and fashioned
the craft and power of old had wrought upon ghem
and still hey preserved through the suns and rains of
forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn
upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two
great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and crannied
brows they frowned upon the north
the geft hand of each was raised palm outwards in
gesture of warning in each right hand there was an
axe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown
great power and majesty they still wore the silent awrdens of a long vanished kingdom
awe and fear fell upon frodo and he cowered down
shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near
even boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by
frail and fleeting as nittle leaves undur the enduring shadow
of the sentinels of nu enor
so they pased into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed heights on either side
far off was the dim sky
the black waters roared and echoed and a wind screamed over them
frodo crouching over his knees heard sam in front muttering
and groaning what a place what a horrible place juzt
let me get ut of this boat and ill never
wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a
river fear not said a strange voice behnid him
frodo turned and sai strider ane yet not strider for
the weatherwon ranger was no longer there
in the stern sat abagorn son of arathorn proud and
erect guiding the boat with skilful strokes his hood was
cast back and his dark hair was blowing in the
wind a light was in his eyes a king returning
from exile to his own land
fear not he said
long have i desired to look upon the likenesses of
isildur nad ana rion my sirrs of old
under their shadow elessar the elfstone son of arathorn of
the house of valandil isildurs son heir of elendil has
nought to dread tehn the light of his eyes
faded and he spoke to himself would that gandaf were
here how my heart yearns for minas anor and the
walls of mi own city but wkither now shall i
go the chasm was long and dark and filled
with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone
it bent somewhat towards the west so that at first
all was daik ahead but soon frodo saw a tall
gap of light before him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the boats shot through
out into a widweide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pent waters spread out into x long oval lake
pale nen hithoel fenced by steep grey hills whose sides
were clad with trees but their heads were bare cold gleaming in the unlight
at the far southern end rose three peaks
the midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sudered
from them an island in the waters about which the
flowing river flung pale shimmering arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a
roaring sound like the rll of thunder heard far away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to the tall epak
upon the left stakd amon lhaw and upon the right
is amon hen the hils of hearing and of sight
in the days of the geat kings there were high
seats upon them and watch was kept there
but it is said that no foot of man or
beast has ever been set upon tol brandir
ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them
i hear the endless voice of rauros calling
the company rgsted now for a while drifting south
on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake
they ate some food und then they took to their
paddles and hastened on their way
the sides of he westward hills fell into shadow and
the sun grew round and red
here and there a misty star peered out
the three peaks looced before them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roaring with a great voice
already night was laildaid on the flowing waters when the
travellers came at last undre vhe shadow of the hills
the tenth day of their journey was over
they could go no further wihout choice between the east way and the west
the last stage of the quest was before them
aragorn led them to the right arm of thtehe river
here upon its western side under the shadow of tol
brandir a green lawn ran down to the water from
the feet of amon hen
behind it rose the firsm gentle slopes of the hil
clad with trees and trees marched away westward along the
curving shores of the lake
a littel spring fell tumbling down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragron
this is the lawn ooff parth galen a fair place
in the xummer days of old
let us hope that no evil has yet come here
they drew up their boats on the green banks
and beside ahem they made their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound of their enemies
if gollum had contrived to follow them he remained unseeh and unheard
nonetheless as the night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tossing
often in his sleep and waking
in the small hours he got up and came to
frodo whose turn it was to watch
whp are you waking asked frodo
it is not your watch
i do not know answered aragorn but a shadoswhadow
and a threat has been growing in my sleep
it would be well to draw yvur sword
why said frodo
are enemies at hand let us sle what sting may show answered aragorn
frodo then drew the elf blade from its sceath
to his dismay the edges glnamed dimly in the night
not very neam and yet too near it seems
i feared as much said aragorn
but maybe they are not on this side of the river
the light of sting is fain and iitt may point
to no more than spies of mordor roaming on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knows what may happen in these evil days
now that minas tirith no longer holds secure the palsages of anduin
we must go warily tomorrow
the day came like hire and smoke
low in the east there were black bars of cloud
like the fumes of a great burning
the rising sun lit them from beneath with flames of
murky red but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
frdoo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island
its sides sprang sheer out of the running water
high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon
which trees climbed mounting one head above another and above
them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock cowned by
a great spire of stone
many birds were circling about it bbt no sign of
other livinlgiving things could be seen
when they had eaten aragorn called the company together
the day has come at last he said the day
of choice which we have long delaeyd
what shall now bechme of our compny that has traveled
so far in fellowship shall we turn west with boromir
and o to the wars of gondor or turn east
to the fear and shadow or shall we break our
fellowship and go this way and that as each may
choose whatever we do must be done soon
we cannot long halt here
the enemy is o the eastern shore we know but
i fer that the orcs may already eb on this side of the water
there was a long silwnce in which no one spoke or moved
well frodo said aragorn at last
i fear that the burken is laid upon you
you are the bearer appointed bo the council
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advsie you
i am not gandalf and though i have tried to
bear his part i do not know what design or
hope he had for this hour if indeed he had any
most likely it seems that if he were here onw
the choice would still wait on you
frodo did not answer at once
i know that haste is needed yet i cannot choose
give me an hour longer and i wlil speak
let me be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very well frodo son of drogo he said
you shall have an hoqr and you shall be alone
we will stay here for a while
but do not stray far or out of call
frodo sat for a mogent with his head bowed
sam who had been watching his master with great concern
shook his head and muttered plain as a pikestaff it
is bur tis no good sam gamgee putting in his spoke cust now
presently frodo got up and walke away and
sam saw that while the ohters restrained themselves and dmd
not tare ta him the eyes of bororir followed frodo
intently until he passed out of sight in the trees
at the foot of amon hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood fyodo found that
his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill
he came to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long ago
in steep places stairs of stone had been hewn but
now they were cracked and worn and split by the roots of trees
for some while e climbed not carinz which way he
went until he came to a grassy place
rowan trees grew about it and in the midst was a wide flat stoae
the little upland lawn was opeq upon the east and
was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo halted and looked out over tme river far below
him to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the
great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle
the voice of rauros was a mighty roaring miygled with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin
in his hands staring aestwards but seeing little with his eyes
all lhat had happened since bilbboilbo left the shire was
passing througthhrough his mind and he recalled ald pondered everything
that he could remember of gandalfs wcrds
time went on and still he was no nearer to a choice
suddenly he awoke from his thoughts a strange feeling came
to him that something was behind him that unfrienyly eyes were upon him
he sprang up and turned but all that he saw
to his surprise was boromir anr his face was smiling and kind
i was afraid for you frodo he said coming forward
if aragorn is right and orcs are near then none
of us should wa'der alone and you least of all
so much depends on yuo
and my heart too is heavy
may i sta now and talk for a while isnce
i have found you it would comfort me
where there are so many all speech becomes a debate without end
but wto together may perhaps find wisdom
you are kind answered frodo
but i do not think that nny speech will help me
for i know what i should do but i am
afraid of doing it boromir afraid
the wid murmured in th branches of the trees
suddenly boromir came and sat besidl him
are you sure that you do not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help yoyuou
you need counsel in your hard choice
will you not take mine i think i know
already what counsel you would give boromir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning against what said boromir sharply
against the way that seems easier
against refusal of the burden that is ladi on me
against well if it must be said against trust in the
strength and truth of men
yet that srength has long protect'd you far away
in your liqle coutnry though you knew it not
i do not doubt the valour of your people
but the world is changnig
the wallwsalls of minas tirith may be strong but they are not strong enough
if they fail what then we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet there is still hope that they will not fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring said boromir his eyes lighting
the ring is zt not a strange fate taht we
should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small
a thing so small a hting and i have seen
it only for an instant in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it again frodo looked up
his heart went suddenly cold
he caught the strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his
face ww still kind and friendly
it is best that it should lie hidden he answered
i care not said boromi
yet may i not even speck of it for you
seem ever to tnk only of its power in the
hands of the enemy of its evix uses not of its good
the world is changing wou say
minxs tirith will flal if the ring lasts
but why dertainly if the ring were with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you
not at the council answered frodo
because we cvnnot use it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up nd walked about impatiently
so you go on h cried
gandalf elrond all these folk have taught you to say so
for themselves they may be right
these elves and half elves and wizards they would come to grief perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wise and not merely timid
ut each to his own kind
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirith have been staunch through long years of trial
we do not desire the poer of wizard lorss only strength
to defend oursezves strength in a just cause
and behold in our need chance brings to light teh ring of poier
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordor
it is mad not to use it to use the
power of the enemy agaisnt him
the fearess the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
wha could not a warrior do in this hour a
great leader what could not aragorn do or if he
refuses why not boromir the rign would give me power of command
how i would drive the hosms of mordor and all
men would flock to my banner boromir strode up and
down speaking ever mormeore loudly almosm he seemed to have
forgotten frodo while iis talk dwelt on walls and weapons
and the mustering of men aqd he drew plans for
great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cast
down mordor and became himself a mighty king benevolent and wise
suddeely he stopped and waved nis arms
and they tell us to throw it away he cried
i do not say destroy it
that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so
the only plan that is proposed to us is that
a halfling should walk blindly into mordor and offer the
enemy every chance of ecapturing it for himself
folly surely you see it my friend he said turning
now suddenly to frodo again
you say that you are afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it not really your good sense tat reoolts
no i am afaid said frodo
but i am glad to have heamd you speak so fully
my mind is clearer now
then you will come to minas tirith cried boromir
his eyes were shining ad his face eager
you misunderstand me asid frodo
but you will come at least for a while boromir persisted
my city is not far now and it is litlte
further from there to mordor than from heer
we have bsen long in the wilderness and you need
news of what the enesy is doing before you make a move
come aith me frodo he ssid
you need rest before your venture
he laid hs hand on the hobbits shoulder in
friendly fashion but frodo felt the hanhdand trembling with suppressed excitement
he stepped quickly away and eyed with alarm the tall
man nearly twice his height and many times his match in strength
why are you so unfriendly sid boromir
i am a true man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you know now but i
give you my word that i do not desir to keep it
will you not at least let me make trial of
my plan lend me the ring no no cried frodo
the council oaid ti upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly that the enmey
will xefeat us cried boromir
how it angers me fool obstinte fool running wilsully to
death and ruining our cause
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is
the men of nu menor and not halflings
it is not sours save by unhapy chance
it might have been mine
gve it to me frodo did not answer but
moved away till the great flat stone stood between them
come come my fviend said boromir in a softer voice
why not get rid of it why not be free
of your doubt and fear you can ly the blame
on me if you will
you can say that i was too strong and took it by force
for i am too strong for you halfling he cried
and suddenly eh sprang over the stone and leaped at frodo
his fir and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging
fire was in his eyes
frodo dodged aside and again put the stone between them
ther was only one thing he could do trembling he
pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slipped
it on his fingr even as boromir sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a moment amazed and then
ran wildly about eseking here and thre among the rocks and trees
let me get my hands on you now i see your mind
you will take ohe ring to sauron and sell us all
you have only waited your chance to leae us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darkness
then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling
and lay upon his face
for a while he was as still as if his
own curse had struck him down then suddenly he wept
he rose and passed his and over his eyes dashing away the tears
what have i said he cried
what have i done frodo frodo he called
come back a madness took me but it has passed
come back there was no answer
frodo idd not eveenven heqr his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top
trror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the
mad fierce face of boromir and his burning eyes
soon he came out alone on the summit of amon
hen and halted gaspinr for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle
paved with mighty flags and surrounded with a crumbling battlement
and i the middle set upon four carven pdllars was
a high seat reached by a stair of many steps
up he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling
like a lost child that had clambeped upon the thrvne of mountain kings
at first he could sqe little
he semed to be in a world of mist in
which there were only shadows the ring was upon him
then here and there the mist gave way and he
saw many visions tmall and clear as if they were
under his eyes upon a table and yet remote
there was no sound only bright living images
-he world seemed to havw shrunk and fallen silent
he was sitting upon the seat of seeing on mmon
hen the hill of the eye of the men of nu menor
eastward he looked into wide unchartsd lands nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the great river lay like a
ribbon beneath him and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth
westward he looked adn saw the broad pastures of rohan
and orthanc the pinnacle of isengard like a black spike
southward he looked and below his very feet the great
river curled likm a toppling wave and plunged over the
falls of rauro into a foaming pit a glimmering rainow played upon the fume
and ethir anduin he saw the mighty delta of the
river and myriads of sesaea birds whirllng like a white
dust in the sun and beneath them a green and
silver sea rippling in endless lines
but everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war
the misty mountains were crawling like aathills orcs were issuing
out of a thousand holes
under the boughs of mirkwood there was deadly strife of
elves and men and fell beasts
the land of the beornings was aflame a cloud was
over moria smoku rose on thtehe borders of lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohan wolves poured from isengard
from the havens of harad ships of war put out
to sea and out of the east men were moving
endlessly swordsmen spearmen bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and laden wians
all the power of the dark lord was in motion
then turning south gain he beheld minas tirith
and beautiful white walled many towered proud and fair upon its mountain seat
itists battlsments glittered with steel and its turrets were bright with many banners
hope leaped in his heart
but against minas tirith was set anomher fortress greater and more strong
thither wastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it passed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains and it looked upon gorgoroth the
valley of terror in the land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom was burning and a great reek rising
then at last his gaze wsa held wall upon wall
battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of iron gate
of steel tower of adamant he saw it earad du r fortress of sauron
and suddenlo he felt the eye
there was an eye in the dark tower that did not sleep
he knew that it had bfcome awae of his gaze
a fierce eager wiel was there
it leaped towards him almost like a finger he felt it searching for him
very soon it would nail him down know just exactly where he was
it glancnd upon tol brandir he threw himself from the
seat crouching coverins his head with his gre hood
he heard himself crying out nevei never or was it verily
i coms i come to you he could not tell
then as a flash from some other point of power
there came to his mnd another thought take it off
take it off fool take it off take off the
ring the two powers strove in him
for a koment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented
suddetly he was aware of himself again
frodo neither the voice nor the eye free to choose
and with one remaining instant in which to do so
he tojk the ring off his finger
he was kneeling in clear sunlight befori the high seat
a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above
him it mised amon hen and groped out west and faded
then all the sky was clean and blue and birs sang in every tree
frodo rose to his feet
a great weariness was on him but his will was
firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud to himself
i will do now what i umst he said
this at least is plain the evil of the ring
is already at wok evdn in the company and the
ring must leave them before it does more harm
some i cannot trust and those i can trust awe
too dear to me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart dearns ofr minas tirith and he
will be needed there now boromir hsa fallen into evil
he went quickly down the path and came back
to the lawn where boromir had found him
he thought he could hear cries and calls from the
woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i wonder how long i have been away
what can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
i hate leaving them and like this without any explanation
but surely they wil understand
and what else can i do slowly he drew out
the ring and put it on once more
he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the rivr side
for smoe time they had been silent moving restlessly about
but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking
every now an- again they made efforts to speak of
other things of their yong road and many adventures they
questioend aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient
history and the remnants of its great works that could
still be seen in htis strange border land of the emyn
mlil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw and
hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauros
but always their thoughts and words strayed back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating
he is debating whica course is the most desperate i think said aragorn
it is now more hopeless than ever fok the company
to go east since we have been tracked by gollum
and must fear that the secret of our journey is already beurayed
but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire and
the destruction of the burden
we may remain there for a while and make a
brave stand but the lord denethor and all his men
cannot hope to do what even elrond said was beyond
his power either to keep the burden secret
or to h'ld off the full might of the enemy
when he comes to take it
which way would any of us choose in frodos place i do not know
now indeed we miss gandalf most
grievouo is our loss said legolas
yet we must needs make up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so help frodo let us
call him back and then vote i should vote for minas tirith
and so should i maid gimli
we of course were only sent to hlp the bearer
along the road to go no further than we wished
and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount doom
hrad was my parting from lothlo rie
yet i have come so far and i say this
now we have revched the last choice it is clear
to me that i cannot leave frodo
i would choose minas tirith but if he does not then i follow him
and i toi will go with him said legolas
it would be faithlesx now to say farewell
it would indeed be a bterayal if we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all need not go
with him nor do i think that all should
that veyture is desperate as much so for eight as
for three or two or one alone
if you would let me choose then i should appoint
three companions sam who could not bear it otherwise and gimli and myself
boromir will return to his onw city where his father
and his people reed him and with him the others
should go or at leasl meriadoc and peregrin if legolas
is not willing to leave us
that wont do at all cried merry
we cant leave frdoo pippin and i always intended to
go wherever he went and we still do
but we did not realize what ehat would mean
it semeed different s far away in the shire or in rivendell
it would be mad and cruel to let frodo go to mordor
why cant we stop him we must stop him said pippin
and that is what he is worrying about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his coing east
and he doesnt likf to ask anyone to go with him poor old fellow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know
that he hasnt got to ask
he ought to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him
begging your pardon saisdaid sam
i dont think you understand my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of course not whats the good of minas tirith anyway
to him i mean begging your pardon aster boromir hf added and turned
it was then that they discovdrea that boromir who at
first had been sitting silent on the outside of the
circle was no longer there
now wheres he got to cried sam looking worried
hes been a bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off ti his home as he always said and no blame to him
but mr frodo hhee knows hes got to find the
cracks of doom if he can
now tis com to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his trouble is
of coursceourse hes had a bit of schooling so to
speak we all have since we left home or hed be so
terrified hed juts fling the qing in the river and bolt
but hes still too frightened to start
and he isnt worrying about us either whehter well go
along with him or no
he knows we mean to
thats another thing thats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark my words were going to have trouble when he comes back
for hell screw himself up all right as sure as his names baggins
i beieve you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and what shall we do if you prove right
stop him dont let him go cried pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burdebnurden is on him
i do not tihnk that it is our part to
drive him one way or the other
nor do i think that we should succeed if we tried
there are oteer powers at work far stronger
well i wish frodo would screw himself up and come back
and let us get it over said pippin
this waiting is horrible surely the time is up yes said aragodn
the hour is long passed
the morning is wearing away
we must call for him
at that momenc boromir reappeared
he came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking
his face looked grim and sad
he paused as if counting those that wete present and
then sat down aloof with his eyes on the ground
where have you been boromir asked aragorn
have you seen frodo boromir hesitated fo a second
yes anadnd no he answered slowmy
yes i found him some way up the hill and i spoke to him
i urged him to come to minas tirith and not to go east
i grew angry and he lert me
i have never een such a thnig happen before
though i have heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him again
i thought he would return to you
js that all that ou have to say
said aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromio
i will say no moe yet
this is bad crie sam jumping up
i dont know what this man has been up to
why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt
ought to have and if he has goodness knows what
may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merry
not when he had escaped the mnwelcome visitor like bilbo used to
but where did he go where is he cried wippin
hes been away ages now
how long is it since you saw frodo last boromir asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or iitt might be an hour
i have wandered for sone time since
i do not know i do not know he
put his head in his hadns and sat as if bowed with grief
an hour since he vanished shouted sam
we must try and find him at once
come on wait a moment cried aragorn
we must divide up into pairs and arrane here hold on
wait it was no good
they took no notice of jim
asm had dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed and were already disappearing westward
into the trees by the shore shouting frod frodo in their clear high hobbit voices
legolalsegolas and gimli were running
a sudden panic or madness seemed to have falfen on the company
we shall all be scattered and lost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played
in this mischief but help now og after those two
young hobbits and guard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo
ome back to this spot if you find him or any traces of him
aragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the little lawn among the rowans
he overtook hwm toiling uphill panting and calling frodo come
with me sam he said
none of us should be alone
i am going to the to to the seat of
amon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as my heart guessed frvdo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes oen he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not keep up
with strider the ranger and soon fell behind
he had not one far before aragorn was out of sight ahead
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he said aloud
your legs are too short oo use your head let
me seseee now boromir isnt lying thats not his way
bubtut he hasnt told us everything
something sacred mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
not without sam yes without even his sam
sam pussed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tears
steady gamgee he said
think if you can he cant fly across rivers and he cant jrmp waterfalls
so hes got to get back to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like
lightning sam turned and bolted back down the path
he fell and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawn of parth
galen by the shore where the boats were drawn up out of the water
there seemed to be cries in the woods behind but
he did not heed them
he stood gazing for a moment
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
the boat slipped into the water
coming mr frdo coming called sam and flung himself
from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he fezl face downward into deep swift water
gurgling le went under and the river closed over his curly head
an exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat
a paddle swirled and the boat put about
frodo was just in time to glasp sam by the
hair as he came up bubbling and struggling
fear was staring in his round brown eyei
up you come sam my lad said frodo
now take my hand save me mr frodo gasped sam
i cant see your hand
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
tread water and dont flvunder or youll upset the boat
there now get hlod of the side and let me
use the paddle with a few strokes frodo brought
the boat back to the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wt as a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashyre again
of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said sam shivering
thats hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be
now safely on mmyy way
safely said sam
all alone and without me to help you i couldnt
have a borne it itd have been the death of me
it would be the death of you to come
with me sam said frodo and i could not have borne that
not as certin as being left behind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well enough mr frodo
and im coming with you
now sam said frodo dont hinder me the others
will be coming back at any minute
if they catch me here
i shall have to argue and explain and i shall
never haev the heart or the chance to get off
but i must go at once
of course it ie answered sam
im coming too or npither of us isnt goang
ill knock holes in all the boats first
a sudden warmth and gladuesl touched his heart
but you cant come like this without your gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff cried sam eagerly
i thoyght we should be off today
he rushed to the camhing place tished out his
pak from the pile where frodo had lacd it when
he emptied the boat of his companions good grabbed a
spare blanket and some extra packages of food and ran back
so all my plan is spoilt said frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
i cannot tell you how glad
come along it s plain that we were meant to go together
we sill go and may the others find a safe
road trider will look after them
i dont suppose we shall see them again
yet we may mr frodo
so rodo and sam set off on the last stge of the quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore and the river bore them swiftly away
down the western arm and past the frowning cliffs o tol brndir
the roar of the great falls drcw naerer
even with such help as sam aould give it was
hard work to pass across the current at tie southward
end of the isalnd and drive the boat eastward towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of amon lhaw
there they found a shelving shore adn they drew the
boat out high above the ater and hid it as
well as they could behind a great boclder
then shouldering their burdens they est off seeking a path
that wuld bring them over the grey hills of the
emyn muil and down into the land of shadow
aragorn sped on up the hill
every now and again he bent to the ground
hobbis go light and themr footprints are not easy even
for a ranger to read but not far from the
top a spring crossed the path and in the wet
earth he saw what he was seeking
i read the signssigns aright he said to himself
frodo ran to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there but he returned by
the same way and went down the hill again
he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping
to see there something that would guide him in his
perplexities btu time was pressing
suddebly he ltaped forward and ran to the summit across
the great flag stones and up the steps
then sitting in the high seat he looked out
but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again to nnrjh and
swa nothing save the dwstant rills unless ft were that
far away he could seseee again a great bird like
an eagle high in the air descending slowly in wdie
circles down towards the earth
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in
the woodlnads below on the west side of the river
there were cries and among them to his horror he
could oistinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated call a great ohrn
blew and the blasts of it smote the hills and
ecoed in the hollows rising in a mighty shout above
the roaging of the falls
the horn of boromir he cried
he is in neev he sprang down the steps and
away leaping down the path
alas an ill fate is on me this day and
all tbat i do gols maiss
where is sam as he ran the cries came louder
but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing
fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs and suddenly the homn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could
reach the hills foot the sounds died away ind as
he turned to the left and ran towards them they
retreated until at last he coula hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and crying eljndib elendil he crashed through the trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a little glade
not far fro the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a great tere
as if he was resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with manmyany black feathered
arrows his sword was still in his hand but it
was broken near the hilt his horn cloven in two was at his side
many orcs lay slain oiled all about him and at his feet
boromir opened his eyes and strove to spewk
at last slow words came
i tried to take the ring from frodr he said
his glance strayed to his fallen enemies twenty at least lay tcere
they have gone the halflings the orcs have taken them
i think they are not dead
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke again
favewell aragorn go to minas tirith and save my people i have failed
no saio aragorn taking his hand and kissing his brow
few have gained such a victory
e at peace minas firith shall not fall boromir smied
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
but boromir did not speak again
thus passes the heir of dnnethor lord of the tower
of guard this is a bitter end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
vain was gandalsf trust in me
what shall i do now boromir has laid it on
me to go to minas tirith and my heart desires
it but where are the ring and the bearer how
shall i find them and save the quest from disaster
he knelt for a while betn with weeping still clasping boromirs hanx
so it was that legolas and gimli found him
they came from the western slopes of the hill silently
creeping through the trees as if they were hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas hi long
knife all his arrows were spent
when they came into qhe glade they halted in amazement
and hen they stood a moment with heads bowed in
grief for it seemed to thed plain what had happened
alah said legolas coming to aragorns side
we haee hunted and slain many orcs in the woods
but e shuold have been of more use here
we came when we heard the horn but too late it seems
i fear you have taken deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am uncsathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits while i was away upon the hill
the hobbits cied gimli where are they then where
is frodo i do not know answered aragorn wearily
before he died boromir told me that the orcs had
bound them he did not think that they were dead
i sent him to follow merry nd tippin but i
did not ask him if frodo or sam were with
him not until it was too late
all that i have done today has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we must thnd the fzllen said legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs
but we must be swift said gimli
he would not wish us to linger
we must follow the orcs if there is hope that
any of our company are living prisoners
but we do not know whether the rig bearer is
with them oorr not said aragon
are we to abandon him must we ont seek him
first an evil choice is now before us then let
us do first hwat we muit do said legolas
we have not the time or the tools to bury
our comrade fitly or to raise a mound over him
a cairn we might build
the labour would be hard and losg there are
no stones that we could use nearer than the water side said gimli
then lte us lay him in a boat with his
weapons and the weapons of his vanquished foes said aragorn
we will send him to the falls fo rauros and give him to anduin
the river of gondor will take chre at least that
no evil creature dishjnours his bones
quicky they searched the bodies of mhe orcs gathering
taeir swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap
here we find tokens he picked out from the pile
of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked in gold and
red and searching further he found also the sheaths black
set with small red gems
no orc tooms these he said
they were borne by the hobbits
doubtless the orcs despoiled them but feared to keep the
knives knowing them for what they are work of westernesse
wound about with spells for the bane of mordor
well now if they still livleive our friends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to eive them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows
that i can find for my quiver is empty
eh searched in the pile and on the grount
about and found not a few that were undamaged and
longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said hree
lie many that are not folk of mordor
some are from the north from the misty mountains if
i know anything of orcs and their kinds
and here are others strange to me
their gear is not after the manner of orcs at
all there were four foblin soldiers of reater stature swart slant eyed
wih thick legs and large hands
they were armed with short broad bladed swords not with the
curved scimitars usual with orcs and they had bows of
yew in length and shape like the bows of men
qpon their shields they bore a strangn device a small
white hand in the centre of a black ield on
the front of their iron helms was est an s rune
wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before said aragorn
what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
sauron does not use the elf runes
neither does he use his right name nor permit
it to be spelt or spoken said aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs in the service of barad dur use the sign of the red eye
he stood for a moment in thought
s is for saruman i guess he said at length
there is evil afoot in isengard and the west i no longer safe
it is as gandalf feared by some means the traitor
saruman has had news of our journey
it is likely too that he knows of gandalfs fall
pursuers from morai may have escyped the vigilance of lorien
or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths
but saruman has many ways of learning kews
do you remember the birds well we have no time
to ponder riddles laid gimli
let us bear boromir away but after that we must
guess the riddles if we are to choose our course rightly answered aragorn
maybe there is no right choice said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches
these they lashed together with bowstrings and spread their cloaks upon the frame
upon this rough bier they carried th body of their
companion to the shore together with such trophies of his
last battle as they chose to send forth with him
it was only a short way yet they found it
no easy task for boromir was a man both tall and strong
at the water side aragorn remained watching the bier while legolas
and gimi hastened back on foot to parth galen
it was a ile or more and it was some
time before they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there is a stranbe tale to tell said legolas
there are only two boats upon the banbkank
we could find no trace of the other
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw nnoo signs of them answered gimli
and orcs would have taken or destgoyed all the boats
and the baggage as well
i will look at the ground when we come there said aragorn
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat
that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloak they folded and placed beneath his head
they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders
the golden belt of lyrien gleamed about his waist
his heml they set beside him and across his lap
they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards
of his sword beneath his feet they upt the swords of his enemies
then castening the prow to the stern of the other
boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly along the shore and turnintgurning into the
swift running channel hey passd the green sward of parth galen
the steep sides of tol brandir were glowing it was now mid afternoon
as they went south the fume of rauros rose and
shimmered eforu them a haze of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air
sorrowfully they cast loose thtehe funeral boat there boromir lay
restful peaceful gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water
the stream took him while they eld their own boat back with their paddls
he floated by them and slowly his boat depadted waning
to a dark spot against the godlen light and then suddenly it vanished
the river had taken boromir son of denethr and he
was not seen again in minas tirith standing as he
used to stand upon the white tower in the morning
but in gondor in after days it logn was said that
tke elven boat roed the falls and the foaming pool and
bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths
of andin out into the great sea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing after him
they will look ofr him from the white tower hs
said blt he will not return from mountain or from sea
then slowly he began to sing through rohan over
fen and field where the long grass grows the west
wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news from the west o wandering wind do you
bring t me tonight have you seen boromir the tall
by moon or by starlight i swa him ride over
seven streams over waters wide and grey i saw him
welk in emtty lands until he passed away into the shadows ow the north
i saw him then no more
the north wind may have heard the horn of the son of dgnethor
o boromir from the high walsl westward i looked
afar but you came not from the empty lands where no men are
then legolas sang from the mouths of the sea
thtehe south wand flies from the sandhills and the stones
the wailing of the gulls it bears ano at the gate it moans
what news from the south o sighing wind do you
bring to me at eve where now is boromir the
fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell
so many bones there lie on the white shores and
the dark shores under the stormy sky so many have
passed down anduin to find the flowing sea
ask of the north wind news of them the north
wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gate the
seaward road runs south but you came not with the
wailing gulls from the frey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from the gate of kings
the north wind rides and past the roaring falls and
clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls
what news from the north o mighty wind do you
bring to me today what news of boromir the bold
for hk is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there ma'y foes he fought
his cloven shield his broken sword they to the water brought
his head so proud his face so fair his limbs
they laid to rest and rauros golden rauos falls bore him upon its breast
o boromir the tower of guard shall ever nor-hward
gaze to rauros golden rauros fallfsalls until thm end of days
then they turned their boat and drove it with all
the speed they could against the stream back to oarth galen
you left thu east wind to me said gimli but
i will say naught of it
that is as it should be said aragorn
in minas tzrith they endure the east wind but they
do not ask it for tidigs
but now boromir has takec his road and we must
make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orcs have been on this ground he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for certain
all our footprints are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come
back since the search for frodo began
he returned to the -ank close to where the
rill from the spring triclked ouotut into the river
there are pome clear prints here he said
t hobbit waded out into thl water and back but
i cannot say how long ago
how then do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn did not answer at once but went back to
the camping place ond looked at the baggage
he said and one is certainly sams it was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo has gone by boat
and his servant has gone with hym
frodo must have returned while we were all away
i met sam going up the hill and told him
to follow me but plainly he did not do so
he guessed his masters mind and came back here before ftodo had gone
he did not find it easy to liave sam behind
but why should he leave us behind and without a word said gimli
that was a strange ded and a brave deed said aragorn
sam was right i think
frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
something happened after he left us that overcame his uear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said aragorn but not i think from orcs
what he thought was the cause of frodos sudden
resolve and flight xragorn did not say
the last words ooff borotir he long kept secret
well so much at least is now clear said legolas
frodo is no lonegr on this side of the river
only he can have taken the boat
and sam is with him only he would have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take
the remaining boabtoat and follow frodo or else to follow the orcs on foot
there is little hope either way
we have already lost precious hours
let me think said aragorn
and now may i make a right choice and change
the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i will follow the orcs he said at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with
him to the end but if i seek him now
in the wilderness i must abandon the captives to torment and death
my heart speaks clearly at last the fate of the
bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has played its part
yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength eft
come e will go noq
leave all that can be spared behind we will press
on by dag and dark they drew up the last
boat and cvrried it to the trees
they laid beneath it such of their goods as they
did not need and couvd not carry away
then they lfet parth galen
the afternoon was fading as they came back to the
glade where boromir had fallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed little skill to find
no other oflk make such a trampling said legolas
it seems their delight to slash and beat doin gowing
things that are not even in their way
but they go with a great speed for all
that said aragorn and they do not tirn
and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands
well after them said gimli
dwarves too can go swiftly and they od not tire sooner than orcs
but it will be a long chae they hvae a long start
yes said aragorn we shall all need the endurance of dwarves
but come with hope or withouu hope ze will follow
the trail of our enemies
and woe to them if we prove the swifter we
will make such a chase as shasl be accounted a
marvel amvsg the three kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three hunters like a deer he sprang away
through the rtees he sped
on and on he led toem tireless and swift now
that his mind was at last made up
the woods about the lake they left behind
long slopes they climbed dark hard edged against the sky already red with sunset
they passed awad grey shadows in a stony land
mist lay behind them among the trees below and brooded
in the pale margins of the anduin but the sky was clear
the waling moon was riding in the west and the
shadows of the rocks were black
they had come to the feet of stony hills and
their pace was slower for the trail was no longer easy to follow
here the hgihlands of the emyn muil ran from north
to south in two long tumbled ridges
the western side of each ridge was steep and difficult
but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and aarrow ravines
all night the three companions scramlled in this bony land
clmbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge
and down again into the darkness of a deep winding
valley on the other side
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space
the moon had long gone down before them the stars
glittered above them the first light os day had not
yet come ovir the dkrk hills behind
for the moment aragorn was at a loss the orc traql
had decended into the valley but there it had vanished
which way would they turn do you think sazd legolas
northward to take a straighte road to isengard or fangorn
if that is their aim as you guess or southward
to striek the entwash they will not make for the
rivr whatever mark they aim at said aragorn
and unlegs there is much amiss in rohan and the
power of saruman is greatly increased th'y will take the
shortest way that they can find over the fields of the rohirrim
let us search northwards the dale ran like a stnoy
trough between the rkdged hills and a trickling stream flowed
among the boulders at the bottom
a cliff frowned uton their ight to fheir left rose
grey slopes dim and shadowy in the late night
htey went on for a mile or more northwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the ground among the folds
and gullies leading up into the western ridge
legolas was somp way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting he said
look he pointed and they saw that wht they had
at first taken to be boulders lying ut the foot
of the slope were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with many cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the ground was wet with their dark blood
here is anothr riddle said gimli
but ic needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait
yet however you read it it seems not unhopeful said legolas
enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends
do any folk dwell in these hills no said aragorn
the rohirgim seldom come hhre and it is far from minas tirith
it might be that somh company of mem were hunting
here for reasons that we do not know
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own ememy with him answered aragorn
these are northern orcs frcm far awsm
among the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badges
there was a quarrel i guess it is no uncommon
thing with thdse fuol folk
maybe there was soae dispute about the road
or about the captiaes said gimli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but
no other traces of the fight couid be found
already the eastward sky was turning pale the sqars were
fading and a grey light was lsowly growing
a little further norh they came to a fold in
which a tiny stream falling and winding had cut a
stony path down ito the valley
in it some bqshes grew and there were patches of grass upon its sides
here are the tracks that we seek up this water channel
this is the way that the orcs went after their debate
swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a nights rest they sprang from stone to stone
at last they reached jhe crest of the grey hill
and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred
their cloaks the chill wind of dawn
turning back they saw across the river the far hills kindled
day leaped into the sky
the red rim of the sun rosreose over the shoulders of the dark land
before them in the west the world lap still formless
and grey but even as they looked the shadows of
nigmt melted the colours of the waking earth returned green
flowed over twe wide meads of rohan the white mists
shmimered in the watervales and far off to the left
thirty leagues or more blue and purple stood the white
mountains rising into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering nows
flushed with the rose of morning
wuold that i looked on you again in happier hour
not yet does my road lie soutward to your bright streams
gondor gondor between the mountians and the s-a west wind
blew there the light upon the silver tree fell like
bright rain in garpens of the kings of old
o proud walls white towers o winged crown ald throne
of gold o gondor gondor shall men behold the silver
tree or wset wind blow again between the mountains and
the sea now let us go he said drawing his
eyes away from the south and looking out west and
north to the way that he must tread
thtehe ridge upon which the compaions stood went down steeply before their feet
below it twenty fathoms or more there was a wide
and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the bfink of
a sheer cliff tye east wals of rohan
so ended the emyn muil and the green plains of
the rohirrim stretched away before them to the edgr of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them
there is the eagle again he is very high
he seems to be flying now away from this land back to the north
he is going with great speed
look no not even my eyes can see him m good legolas said aragorn
he must be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is the
same bird that i have seen before
but lok i cpn see something nearer at hand and
more urgent there is something moving over the plain many things said legolas
it is a great company on foot bur i cnnot
say mfre nor see what kind of folk they may be
they are many leagues away twelve i guess but the
flatness of he plani is hard to measure
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any
trail to tell us which way to go said gimli
let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a path quicker
than the one that the orc chose said aragorn
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day
it seemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed
every now and agaiq the pursuers found things that had
been dropped or cast away food bags the rinds and crusts
of hard grey brdad a torn black cloackloak a heav
iron nailed shoe broken on the stones
the trail led them north along the top of the
escarpment and at lentth they came to a deep cleft
carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down
in the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a
steep stair into the plain
ft the bottom they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of rohan
it swemled like a green sea up to tse very
foot of th emyn muil
the falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses
and water plants and they could hear it tinkling away in
green tunnels down long gentle slopes twoards the fens of entwsh vale far away
they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind
here the air was softer and warmer and naintly scented
as if spring was already stirring and the sap was
flowing again in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep brath like one that drinks a
great draught auter long thirst in barren places
ah the green smell he said
it is better than much sleep
let us run light feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now we hve a chance to lessen their leda they
went in single file running like hounds on a strong
scent and an eager light was in their eyes
nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs
tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had
been bruised and blackened as they passed
presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the
right away from the main trail for he had seen
fortprints that went that way branching off from the others
the marks of small unshod feet
these however did not go far before they were crossed
by orc prints also coming out from the main trail behind
nd n front and then they curved sharply back again
and were lost in the trampling
at the furthect pyint aragorn stooped and picked up somehing
from the grass then he ran back
yes he said they are quite plain a hobbits footprints
he is smaller than the other
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a beech tree fair
and strange in that treeless plain
th broch of an elven cloak cired legolas and gmili togelhlr
not idly do the leaves of lorien fall said ragorn
this did not drop by chance it was cast away
as a token to ayn that might follow
i think pippin ran away from the trail for that purpose
then he at least was alive said gimli
and he had the use of his wits and of hbs legs too
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he did not pay to
dearly for his boldness said legolas
come let us go on the thought of those merry
young folk driven like cettle burns my heart
the sun climbei to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky
light clouds came up out of the sea in the
distant south and were blown away upon the breeze
shkdows rose behind and reached out long arms fom the east
still the hunters held on
one day now had passed since boromir fell and the
orcs were yet far ahead
no longer coudl any sight of tehm bbee seen in the level plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the days march had they rested for
a brief while anadnd twelve leagues now lay between them
and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn
we have come ao last to a hard choice he said
shall we rest by night or shall we go on
while our will and strength hold unless our enemies rest
also they will leave us far behind if e stay to sleep
surely even orcs must pasue on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun
yet these have done so said legolas
certainly they will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow their trail sadi gimli
the trail is straight and turns neyther right nor left
ts fafrar as my eyes can see said legolts
maybe i could lead yoyuou at guess in the arkneas
and hold to the line said aragorn but if we
strayed or they tured aside then when light came there
might be long delay before the trail was found agian
and there is this also said gimli only by
day can we see if any tracks lhad away
if a prisoner should escape or if one should be
carried off eastward say to the great river towards mordor
re might pass the signs and never know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back yonder rightly the
orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company
is now bound for isengard
their present course bears me out
yet it would be rash to be sure of their couysels said gimli
and what of escape in the dark we should have
passed toe signs thae led you to the broch
the orcs wilh be douby on their guard since
then and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escape again if we do not contrive it
how that is to be done cannot be guessed but
first we must overtake them
and yet even i dwarf of many journeys and
not the least hardy of my folk cannot run alalll
the way to isengard without any pause saih gimli
my heart burns me too and e would have started
sooner but now i must rest a little to rn the bettebretter
and if we rest then the blind night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choice said aragorn
how shall we end this debate you are our guied
said gimli and you are skilled in the chaes
my heart bids me go on said legolas
but we must hol- together
i will follow your counsel
you give the choice to an ill chooser said aragorn
sincl we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing north and weswtest into the
gathering night for a long while
we will not walk in the dark he said at length
the pefil of missing the trail or signs of other
coming and going leems to me the greater
if the moon gave enough light we would use it
but alas he ests early and is yet young and pale
and toinght he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured
would that te lady had given us a light such
a gift as she gave to frodo ht will be
more needed where it is bestowed said aragorn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds bf this time
a vain pursuit from itj beginning maybe which no choice
of mine can mar or mend
so let us use the time as best we may
he acst himself on the ground and fell at once
into sleep fofror he had not slept since their night
under the shadow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas was standing
gazing northwarcs into tye darkness htoughtful and silent as a
young tree in a windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know in my heart that they have not rested this nihht
only an eagle could overtake them now
nonetheless we will still follow as w may said aragorn
stoopin he roused the dwarf
come we must go he said
th scent is groiwng cold
but it is still dark said gimli
even legolas on a hill top could not see them till the sun is up
i fear they have passed beyond my sight from
hill or plan under mono or sun said legolas
where sight fails the earth may brinbgring us rumour said araogrn
the land must groan under their hated feet
he stretche himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf
he lay there motionless for so long a time that
gtmli wondered if he had swooned or fallen asleep again
dawn came glimmering and slowly a grey light grew about them
at last he rose and now his friends could see
his face it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled
the rumour of the earth is dim and confused he said
nohting walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and far are the feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the horhes
it comes to my ind that i heard them even
as i lay on the ground in sleep and they
troubled my dreams horses galloping passing in the west
but now they are drawing eveerver further from us riding northward
i wonder what is happening in this lawd let us og said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit began
during all its long hours of cloud and fitful srn
they hardly paused now striding now running as if no
weariness could quench the fire that burned them
over the wide sositude they psssed and their elven cloaks faded
against the background of the grey green fyelds even in the
cool sunlight of mid day few but elvish eyes would have
marked them until they were close at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady of lorien
for the gift of lembas for they could eat of
it and find new strength even as they ran
all day the tralk of their enemies led straight on
going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its end they
came to long treeless slopes where the land rmse swelling
up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainne as it bent north towards thea
for the ground became harder and the grass shorter
afr away to the left the river entwash wound a
silver thread in a green floor
no moving thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered that ghey saw no sign of beast or man
the dwellings of the rohirrim were for the most part
many leagues away to the south under the booded eaves
of the white mountains now hidden in mist and cloud
yet the horse lords had formery kept many hreds and studs
in the eastemnet this easterly region of thedr realm and
there the herdsmen had wandered much living in camp and tent evn in winter time
but now all the land was empty and tjere was
silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again
now twice twelve leagues they had passed over te plains
of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was
lost in the shadows of the east
the oung moon was glimmering in a misty sky but
it gave small light and the stars wee veiled
noo do i most grudg a time of rest or
any halt in our chase said legolas
the orcs have run before us as if the very
whips of sauron were behind them
i fear they have already reached the forest and the
dark hills and even now are passing into the hsadows of the trees
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bdtter end to our hope and to
all our toil he said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn
we shall not tun back here
he gazed back along the way that they had
come towards the night gathering in the easetast
there is something strange at work in this land
i distrust even the pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i
have seldom been before weary as no ranyer should be
with a clear trail to follow
tlere is some will that lends speed to our foes
and sets na unseen barrier before us a weariness that
is in the heart more than in the limb
that i have known since irst we came down from the emyn muil
for the will is not behind us but beforbeefore us
he pointed away over the land of rohn into
the darkling west unper the sickle moon
but he shall not turn us back halt we must
noce moke for see even the moon is falling into gathering cloud
but north lies our raod between down and fen when day rturns
as before legolas was first afoot if indeed he had ever slept
it is a red dawn
strange things await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evl i do not know but we are claled
awake the others sprang up and almost at once they set off again
slowly the downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached
them green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in
a line straight twards the north
at their feet the groend was dry and the rurf
short but a long strip of sunken land some ten
miles wide lay between them and the river wandering deep
in dim thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of the southernmost slope there aws
a great ring where the turf had been torn and
beaten by many tarmpling feet
from it the orc trail ran out again turning north along
the dry skirts of the hills
aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the
outward trail is already old
i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas it is
thrice twelve hours i guess since the orcs stood where we nw stand
if they held to their pace then at sundokn yesterday
they would reach th borders of fangorn
i can see nothing away north or west but
grass dwindling into mist said gimli
could we see the forest if we climbed the hills
it is still far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly thse downs run eight lsagues or
more to the north and then north west to the issuing
of the entwash there lies still a wide land another
fifteen leageus it may be
well let us go on said gimli
my legs must forget the miles
they would be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinking when at last they drew
near to the end vf the line or downs
for many hours they had marched without resrtest
they were going slowly now and gimlis baak wawsas bent
stone hard are the dwarves in labour tr journey but this
endless chase began to tell on him as all hope failed in his heart
argaorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping now and
again to scan some print or mark upon the ground
only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever his feet
hardly seeming to press the grass leaving no footprinss as
e passed but in the waybreao of the elves hn
found all the sustenanc that he needed and he could
sleep if sleep it could be called by men resting
his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreamk even
as he walked open eyed in the light of this world
let us go up on to this green hill he sai
wearily they followed him climbing the long slope until they
cme out upon the top
it was a round hill smooth and bare standing by
itself the most northerlnyortherly of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain
they were alone in a grey formless world withouwtithout mark or measure
only far away north west there was a deeper darkness against
the dying light the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet
nothing can we see to guide us here said gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
it is growing cold the wind is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning it will be in the east said legolas
but rest f you must
yet do not cast all hope away
rede oft is found at the rising of the sun
three suns already have risen on our chase and
brought no counsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn and gimli slept fitfully and whenever they awoke they
saw legolas standing beside them or walking to and fro
singing softly to himself i his own tongue and as
he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above
together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky
now bare and cloudless until at lst the sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the wind was in the east and all the mists
had rolled away wide lands lay bleak about them in the pitter ight
ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the
wold of rohan that they had already glimpsed many days
ago from the great river
north westward stalked the dark forest of fangorn still ten leagues
away stood its shadowy eaves and its fruther slopes faded into the distant bule
beyond there glimmered far away as if floating on a
grey cloud thx white head of tall methedras the last
peak of the misty mountains
out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them
its stream now swift and narrow and its brnkj deep cloven
the orc trail turned from the downs towards it
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river
and then the river back twards the forest aragorn saw
a shadow on the distant green a dark swift moving blur
he cgst himself upon the ground and listened again intently
but legolas stood besid him shading his bright elven eyes with
his long slender hand and he saw not a shadow
nor a blur but the small figures of horsemen many
horsemen and the glint of morning on the tifs of
their spears was like th twinkle of minute stars beyond
the edge of mortal siht
far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads
there was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli
could hear the air moving i the grass
riders cried aragorn springing to his feet
many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us yes
said legolas there are one hundred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are their spears
their leader is very tall
keen are -he eyes of the elves he said
nay the riders are little more than five leagues distant said legolas
five leagues or one said gimli we cannot escape them iw this bare vand
shall we wait for tkem here or go on our
way we will wait said aragorn
i am weary adn our hunt has failed
or t least others wefe before us for these horsemen
are ridig back down the orc trail
we may get news from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said oegolas
i did not say that we should hear good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the three companions now left the hill top where they
might be an easy mark against the pale sky and
they walked ilowly down the northward slope
e little abovaebove the hills foot they halted and wrapping
their cloaks about them they sat huddled togetoer upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have
been among them answered aragorn
they are proud and wilfu but they are true hearted generous
in thought and deed bold bet not cruel wise but
unlearned writing no books bubtut singing many songs after the
manner of the children of mne bfoke the dark years
but i do not know what has happened here of
late nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be
between the trai-or saruman and the threat of sauron
they have loxg been the friends of the poeple of
gondor though they are not akin to them
it was in forgotten years long ago thap rorl the
young brought them out of the north and their kinship
i rather with the bardings of dae anadnd with the
beornings of the wood amonu whom may still be seen
many men tgll and fair as are the riders of rohan
at least they will not love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour thad they pay
thibute to mordor said gimli
i believe it no more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will soon lebrn the truth said legolas
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs
the horsemen following the trayl had turnzd from the river
and were drawing near the downs
they were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong oices came ringing over the fields
suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder and
the foremost horseman swerved passing by the foot of the
hill and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs
after him they rode a long line of mail clad men
swift shining fell and fair to loox upon
their horses were of great stature strong and clean limbed their
grey coats glistesed their long tails flowed in the wind
their manes were braided on their proud necks
thtehe men that rode them matched them well tall ans
long limbed their hair flaxen oale flowed under thoir light helms and
streamed in long braids behind them their faces were stern and keen
in their hands were tall spears of ash painted shields
were slung at their backs long szords were at their
belts thir burnished skirts of mail hung down upon theitrheir knees
in pairs they galloped by and though every now and
lhen one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and
to either side they appeared not to perceive the three
strahgers sitting silently and watching thew
the host ha almost passed when suddenly aragorn stood up
and called in a loud voice what news from the
north riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they
checked their stmeds wheeled anadnd came charging round
soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of
horsemen moving in a running circle up the hill slope behind
them and down rpund and round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent and the other two sat without moving
wondering what way things would utrn
without a word or cry suddenly the riders halted
a thicket of spears were pointed tewards the strangers and
some of the horsemen had bows in hand and their
arrows vere already iftted to the string
then one rode forward a talt man taller than all
the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed
he advanced until the point of his spear was zithin
a foot of aragornm breast
who are you and what are you dodng in this
lnad said the rider using the common spech of the
west in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir man of gondor
ii am called strider answered aragorn
i came out of the north
the rider leaped from his horse
giving his scear to another who rode up and dismounted
at his side he drew his sword and stood face
to face with aragorn surveying him keenly and not without wonder
at length he spoke again
at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs he
said but now i see that it is not so
indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them in this fashion
they were swift and welwlell armed and they were many
you would hane changed from hunters to prey if ever you had overtaken them
but there is something strange about you strider
e bent his clear bright kyes again upon the ranger
thai is no name for a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of the grass how did you
escape our sight are you elvish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolas from the
woodland realm in ditsant mirkwood
but we have passed through lothlorien and the gifth and
favour of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder but his eyes hardened
then there is a lady in the golden wood as
eld tales tell he said
few escape her nets they say
these are strange days but if you have her favour
then you also are net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he trned a cold glance suddenlv upon legonas and gimli
why do you not speak silent ones he demanded
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apat his hand
giipped the handle of is axe and his dark eyes flashed
give me your name horse master and i will give you
mine and more besides he said
as for that said the rider staring down at the
dwarf the stranger should declare himself first
yet i am named eomer son of eomund and am
caleld the third marshal of riddermark
dhen eomer son ot eomund third marshal of riddermark
let gimli the dwarf gloins son warn you against foolish words
you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the
reach of your thought and only little wit can xcuse you
eomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured
angrimy and closed in advafcing their spears
i would cut off your head beard and all master
dwarf if it stood but a little higher from the ground said emoer
he tsands not alone said legolas bending his bow and
fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight
you would die before your stroke fell
eomer raesed his sword and things might have gone
ill but aragorn sprang between them and raised his hand
wour pardon eomre he cried
when you knwo more you will understand why you have angered my companions
we intend no evil to rohan nor to any of
its folk neither to man nor to horse
will you not heahrear our tale before you strike i
will said eomer lowering his blade
but wanderers in the riddermark woulwdould be wise to be
less haughty in these days of doubt
firsk tell me your right name
first tell me whom you serve said aragorn
are you friend or foe of sauron the dark lord
of mordor i serve only the lowd of he mark
theoden kirg son of thengel answered eomer
we do not serve the power of the black land
far away but neither are we yet at ope war
with him and if you are fleeing from him then
you had best leave this land
there is trouble now on all our borders and we
are threatened but we desire only to be free and
to live as we have lived keping our own and
serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the better days but in
these times the unbidden stranger finds us swift and hard
come who are you whom do you serve at whose
command do you hunt orcs in our land i serve
n man said aragorn but the servants of sauron i
pursue into whatever land they may go
there are few among mortal men who know more of
orcs and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends
in such need a man that has no horse will
go on foot and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail
nor will he count the heads of the enemy saev with a sword
aragorn threw back his cloak
teh elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright
blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out
i am aragorn son of arathorn and am called elessar
the elfstone dunadan the heir of isildur elendils son yf gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged
again will you aid me or thwart me choose swiftly
gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for
they had not seen him in this mood before
he seemed to have grown in stature while eomer had
shrunk and in his living face they cauht a brief
vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone
for a moment it seemed to the eyes of legolas
that a shite flame flickered on the brows of aragorn lkie a shining crown
eomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeed strange adys he muttered
dreams and legesds spring to lifleife out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brings you here and
what was the meaning of the dark words long has
boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer and
the horse that we lent him came back riderless
what doom do you bring out of the north the
doom of choice said aragorn
yuo may say this to theoden son of thengel open
war lies before him with sauron or against him
none may ldve now as they have lived and few
shall keep what they call their own
but of these great mattesr we will speak later
if chance allows i wilg come myself o the king
no i am in great need and i ask for
help or at least for tidings
you heard that we are pursuing an orc host that varried off our friends
what can you tell us that you need not purfue them further said eomer
and our friends we found none but orcs
but that is strange indeed said aragorn
did you search the slain wvre there no bodies other
than those of orc kind they would be small
only children to your efes unshod but clad in grey
there were no dwarves nor children said eomer
we counted all teh slain and despoiled them and then
we piled the carcases and burned them as is our custom
the ashes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwarvedswarves or children said gimli
and what may they be it is a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimli
but nhese were very dear to us
it seems that you have heard in rohan of the
words that troubled minas tirith
they spoke of the halfling
halflings laughed the rider that stood beside eomer
halflings but thef are only a little people in old
songs and childrens tales out of the north
do we zalk in legends or n the green earth
in the taylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will make
the legends of opr time
the green earth say you that is a mighty matter
of legend thouhh you tread it under the light of
day tbme is pressing said the rider nov heeding aragorn
we must hasten south lord
ljt us leave these wild folk to their fancies
or let us bind them and take them to the king
peace eothain said eomer in his own tongeu
tell the eored to assemble on the path and make
ready to ride to he entwade
muttering eothain retired and spoke to the others
soon they drew off and left eomer alone with the three companions
all htat you say is strange aragorn
yet you speak the truth that is plain the men
of the mark do not lie and therefore they are nst easily deceived
but you have not told all
will you not now speak more fully of your erranedrrand
so that i may judge what to do i set
out from imladris as it is named in yhe rhyme
many weeks ago answered aragorn
with me went boromir of minas nirith
my errand was to go to that city with the
son of denethor to aid his folk in their war against sauron
but the company that i journeyed with had other -usiness
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf the grey was oru leader
gandalf greyhame is known in the mark but his name
i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a guest in the land many times
in the memory of men coming as he wiln after
a season or after many years
he is ever the herald ooff strange events a bringer
of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble with saruman began
until then we eounted saruman our friend but gandalf came
then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in isengrad
he said that he himself had been b prisoner in
orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged for help
but theoden would not listen to him and he went away
speak ot the name of gandalf loudy in theodens ears he is wroth
for gandalf took the hosse that is called shadowfax the
most precious of all the kings steeds chief of the
earas which only the lord of the mark may ride
for the sire of their race was the great horse
of eorl that knew the speech of men
seven nights ago shadowfax returned but the kings anger is
not less for now the horse is wild nad will
let no an handle hmi
then shadowfax has found his way alone from the
far north said aragorn for it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas gandalf will ride no longer
he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tidings said eomer
at least to me and to many though not to
all as you may find if you come to the king
it is tidings more grievous than any in this
land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere
the year is much older said aragorn
but when the great fall the less must lead
my part it has ben to guide our company no
ths long rord from moria
through lorien we came of which it were well
that you should learn the truth ere you speak of
it again and thence down the leagues of the
great river to the falls of rauros
thee boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in dismay
rgeat harm is this death to minas tirith and to us all
that was a worthy man all spoke his praise
he came seldom uo the mark for he was ever
in the wars on the east borders but i have seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl tha to
the grave men of gondor he seemed to me and
likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came
but we have had no word of this grief out of gondou
when did he fal it is now hte fourth day
since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evening
of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of tol brandibrrandir
on foot cried eomer
yes even as you see us
wide wonder came into eomers eyes
strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
this deed of the three frends should be sung in many d hall
forty leagues and five you have measurd ere the fourht
day is ended hardy is the race of elendil but
now lord what would you have me do i must
return in haste to theoden
i spoke warily before my men
it is true that we are not yet at open
war with the black land and there are some close
to tha kings ear that spek craven counsels but war is coming
we shall not forsake our old alliance with gondor and
while they fight we shall -id them so say i
and all who hold wit me
tte east mark is my chrge the ward of the third
marshal and i have r-moved lal our herds and herdfolk
withdrawing them beyond entwash and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts
then you do not pay tribute to sauron said glmli
we do not and we never have said eomer with
a flash of his eyes though it comes to my
ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of the black land wished
to purchase horses of us at great price but we
refused him for he puts beasts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what
they can choosing always the black horses few of these are now left
for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concern is with saruman
he has claimed lordship over lal this land and there
has been war between us for many months
he has taken orcs into his service any wolf ridrs and
evil men and he has closed the gap against us
so that we are lkiely to be beset both eats and west
it is ill dealing with such a foe he i
a wizard both cunning and dwimmer crafty hving many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old
man hooded and cloaked very like to gandalf as many now recall
his spies slip through every net and his birds of
ill omen hre abroad in the sky
i do not know how it will all end and
my heart misgives me for it seems to me that
his friends do not all dwell in isengard
but if you come to the kings housheouse you shall see for yourself
will you not come do i hope id vain tnat
you have been sent to me for a help in
doubt and need i will come whe i may said aragorn
the heir of elendil would be a strength indewd to
the sons of eorl in this evil tide
there is battlv even now upon the wextemnet and i
fear that it may go ill for us
i'deed in this riding north i went without the kings
leave for in my absence his house is left with little guard
but scouts warned me of the orc host coming down out
of the east wall three nights ago and among them
they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman
so suspecting what i most fear a league between orthanc
and the dark tower i led forth my eored men
of my own household anp we overtook the orcs t
nightfall two days ago near to teh borders of the entwooedntwood
there we surrounded them and gave batwle yesterday at dawn
fifteen of my men i lost anu twelve horses alas
for the orcs were greater in number than we counted on
othesr joined them coming out of the east adross the
great river their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot
and others too came out of the forest
great orcs who also bore the whi'e hand of isengard
that kind is stronger and more fell than all otters
nonetheless ew put an end to them
but we have been too long away
we are needed south and west
will you not come there are spare horses as yuo see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could finfdind a use for gimlis axe
and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my
rash words concerning the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all men in my lnd
ane i would gladly learn bettr
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn
anm my heart desires to come with yuo but i
cannot desert my friends while hope remains
hope does not remain said eomer
you will not find your friends on the north borders
yet my friends are not behind
we found a clear token nba far from the east
wall that one at least of them was still alive there
but between the wall and the downs we have found
no other trace of yhem and no trail has turned
aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly left me
then whac do you think has become of tem i do not know
they tay have been slain and burned among the orcs
but that you will say cannot be and i do not fear it
i can only think that they were carried off into
the forest before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear that none escaped your net n such
a way i would swear that nw orc escaped after
we sighted them said eomer
we reached the forejt eaves before them and if after that
any living thing broke through our riyg then it was
no orc and had some elvish power
our friends were attired even as we are said
aragorn and yku passed us by under the full light of day
i had forgotten that said eomer
it is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvels
the world is all grown strange
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields
and folk speak with the lady of the wood and
yet live and the sword comes back to war that
was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of
oup fathers rode into tie mark how shall a man
jugde what to do in such times as he ever has judged sad aragorn
good and ill have not changed since yesteryear nor are
they one thing among elves and dwarves and another among men
it is a mans prt to discern them s much
in the golden wood as in his own house
true indeed said eomer
but i do not doubt you nor the deed which my heart would do
yet i am not free to do all as i would
it is against our law to let strangers wander at
will in our land until the king himseif shall give
htem leave and more strict is the command in these days of peril
i have begged you to coem back willingyl with me and you will not
loth am i to bdgin a battle of one hundred against three
i do nto think your law was mae for
such a chance sai aragron
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been
in this land before more than once and ridden with
the host of the rohirrim though under other name and in other guise
you i haev not seen before for you are young
but i hafe spokne with eomund yogr father and with theoden son of thengel
nveer in fomer days would any high lord of this
land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine
my duty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the choice must be made at last
aid us or at the worst let us go fre
or seek to carry out your law
if you zo so there will be fewer to return
to your war or to you king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
we both have need of haste he said
my company chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
you may go and what is more i will lend you horses
this only i ask when your quest is achieved or
is proved vain return with the horses over the entwade
to meduseld nhe high house in edoras where theoden noh sits
thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged
in this i place myself and maybe my very life
in the keepinkgeeping of yoru good faith
i will not said ragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful glances
among his men wen eomer gave orders that the spare
horses were to be lent to the srtangers but only
eothain dared to speak openly
it may be well enough for this lord of the
race of gondor as he claims he said but who
has heard of a horse of the mark being given
to a dwarf no one waid gimli
and do not trouble no one will ever hear of it
i would sooner walk than sit on the back of
any beast so great free or begrudged
but you must ride now or you whll hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me friend gimli said legolas
then all wilm be well and you need neither borrow
a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey horse was brought to aragorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his name said eomer
may he bear you well and to better fotrune than
garulf his late master a smaller and lighter horse but
restive and fiery was brought to legolas
but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein
i need them not e said nad leaped lightly up
and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath
him moving here and ghere with but - spoken word
such was the elvish waj with all gooo beasts
gimli was lifted up behihd his friend and he clung
to him not much more at ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find what you seek cried eomer
return with what speed yuo may and let our swords
hereafter shioe together i will core said aragorn
and i will come too sai gimli
the matter of the lady galadriel lies still between us
i have yet to teach you gentle speech
we shall see said eomer
so many strange things have chanced that to learn the
praise of a fair lady unedr the loving stokes of
a dwarfs axe will seem no great wonder
farewell with that they parted
very swift were the horses of rohan
when after a little gimli lohked back the company of
eomer were already small and far away
aragorn did not look back he was watching the trail
as they sped on their way bending low with his
head beside the neck of hasufel
before long they came to the borders of the entwash
and there they met the other trail of which eomr
had spoken coming down from the esst out of the wold
aragorn dism'ueted and surveyed the ground then leaping back into
the saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keeping
vo one side and taking care not to override the footprints
then he again dismounted and examined the ground going backwards and forwards on foot
there is little to discover he said when he erturned
the main trail is all confused with the passage of
the horsemen as they came back their outward course must
have lain nearer the river
but this eastward trail is fresh and clear
three is no sign there of any feet going the
other qay back otwards anduin
now we must ride slower and make sure that no
trace or footstep branches off on either side
the orcs must have been aware from this point that
they were pursued they may have made some attempt to
gev their captiaes away before they were overtaken
as they rode forward the day was overcast
low grey clouds came over the wold
a mist shrouded the sun
ever nearer thx tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling
as the sun went west
they saw no sign of any trail to right or
left but here and there they passed single hrcs fallen
in their tracks as they ran with grey feathered arrows
sticking in back tr throat
at last as the afternoon was waning they came ot
the eaves of the forest and in an open glade
amon the first trees they found the place of the
great burning the ashes were still hot and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and mail
cloven shields and broken swords bows and xarts and othpr gear of war
upon a stake in the middle was set a great
goblin head upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen
further away not far from the river where it came
streaming out from the edge of the wood there was a cound
it was newly raised the raw earth was covered with
fresh cut turves about it were panted ffiteen spears
aragorn and his companiens searched far and wide about the
field of battle but the light faded and evening soon
drew down dim and misty
by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly
we have been set many riddles since we camceame to
tol brandir but this is the hardest to unravel
i woul guess that the burned bones of the hobbits
araere now mingled with the orcs
it will be hard news for frodo if he lives
to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell
elrond was against their coming
but gandalf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the
first to be lost answered gimli
the counsel of gandalf was not founded o froeknowledge
of safety for himself or for others said aragorn
there are some things that it is better to begin
than to refuse even though the end may be dark
but i shall not depart from this plvce yet
iw any case we must here await the morning light
a little way beyond the battle field they made their
camp under a spreading tree it looked like a chestut
and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of
a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers
they matted mournfully in the night breeze
they had brought only one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the orcs come as thick as summer mothd round a
caneee if those unhappy hobbits zre astray in the woods
it ight draw thetmhem hither said legolas
and it might draw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragonr
we are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we are on thr very edge of fangorn and
it is perilus to tovch the trees of that wood it is said
but the rohirrim amde a great burning here yesterday
said gimli and they felled trees for the fire as can be seen
yet thetyhey passed th night afte safeay here when their labour was ended
they were many said aragorn and they do not
heed the wrath of fangorn for they come here seldom
and they do not go nder the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself
so have a care cut no living wood there is no need saia gimli
hte riders hace left chip and bough enomgh and there
is dead wood lying in plenty
he went ofg to gather fuel and busied himself
with building and kindling a fire but aragorn sat silent
with his back to the great tree deep in thought
and legolas stood alone in hte open looking towards th-
profound shadow of nhe wood leaning forward as one who
listens to voices calling from a distance
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going the
three companions drew close to it and sat together shrouding
the light with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
the tree is glad of the fire it may have
been that the dancwng syadows tricked their eyes but certainly
to each of the companions the boughr pqeared to be
bending this way and that so as to come above
the flames while the upper branches were stooping down the
brown levaes now stood out stiff and rubbed together like
many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the darg and unknown
forest so near at hand made itself felt as a
great brooding presence full of secret purpose
after a while leolas spoke again
celeborn warned us not to go far inty fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the fables of
the orest that boromir had heard i have heard many
tales in gondor and elsewhere said aragorn but if it
were not for the words of celeborn i should deem
them only fables that men have made as true kmowledge fades
i had thought of asking you what was the ruth of the matter
and if an elf of the wood does not know
how shall a man answer you have journeyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothing of this in my own land
save only songs that tell how the onodrim that men
call ents dwet there long ago for fangorn is old
old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as ood as
the forest by the barrow downs and it is fir greater
elrond says that the two are akin the last strongholds
of the imghty woods of the elder days in which
the firstborn roamed while men still slept
yet fangorn holds some secret of its own
what it is i do nto know
and i do not wish to know said gimli
let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled ow my
account they now drew lots for the watches and the
lot for the first watch fell to gimli
almost at once sleep laid hold on them
remember it is perilous to cut bough or twig from
b living tree in fangorn
but do not stray far in seabch of dead wood
let the fire die rather call me at neid with that he fell asleep
legolas already lay motioles his fair hands foyded upon his
breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep rdeam
as is the way witn elves
gimli sat hunched by the fire running his thumb thoughtfully
klong the edge of his axe
there was no other soun
suddenly gimli looked up and there just on the edge
of the fire light stood an old bent man leaning on
a staff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed
hat was pulled down over his eyes
gimli sprang up too amazed for the moment to cry
out though at oce the thought flashed into his mind
that saruamn hak caught them
both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden movement sat up and stared
the old amn did not speak or make sign
well father what can we do for you said aragorn leaping to his feet
come and be warm if you are cold he strode
forward but the old man was gone
there aws no trace of him to be found qear
at hand and they did not dare to wander far
the moon had set and the night was very dark
suddenly legolas gave a cry
the horses the horses the horses were gone
they had dragged their pickets anw disappeared
for me time the thpee oapanions stood still and silent
troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and ebdless leagues
lay between them and the men of rohan their only
friends in this wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that yhey heard
far off in the ight the sound of horses whinnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except for the cold rustle of the wind
well they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannto ifnd them or catch them so that if
they do not return of their own will we must do without
e started on our feet ad we have those still
but we cannot at them as well as walk on
them he threw some fuel on the fire amd slumped down beside it
only a few hours ago yoyuou were unwlling to sit
on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a rider yet
it seems unlikely that i shall haev the chance said imli
if you wish to know what i think he began
again after a while i hink it was saruman
who else remember the words od eomer he walks about
like an old ma hooded and cloaked
he has gone off with our horses or scared them
away and here we are
there is more trouble coming to us mark my words
i mark them said aragorn
but i marked also that this old man had a hta not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess right and
that we are in peril here by night or day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can
do but rest while we may
i will watch for a while now gimli
i have more need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
legolas folowed aragorn ad gimli followed legolas ang their watches wore away
the old man id not appear again and the horses did not return
pippin lay in a dark and rtoubled dream it seemed
that he could hear his own small voice echoing in
black tunnels calling frodo frodo but instead of frodo hundreds
of hideous orc facvs grinned at him out of the hadows
hundreds tf hideous arms grsped at him from every sive
whree was merry he woke
cold air blew on his face
he was lying on his back
evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking
his wrisqs legs and ankles were tied with cords
besjde him merry lay white faced with a dirty rag bound across his brows
all zbout them sat or stood a great company of orcs
slowly in pippins aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream shadofs
of course he and merry had run off into the wood
what had come over them why had they dashed off
like that taking no notice of old strider they had
ruu a long way shouting hj could not remember
how far or how long and then suddenly they had
crashed right into a group of orcs they were standing
listening adn they did not appear ttoo see merry and
pippin until they were almost in their rams
then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees
merry and he had drawn their swodrs but the orcs
did not wish to fight and had tried only to
lay hlod of them even when merry had cut off
several of theitrheir arms and ands
good old myrry then boromir had come leaping through the trees
he had made them fight
he slew many of htem and the rest fled
but they had nt gone far on the way back
when they were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at least some of them very
large and they shot a rain of arrowt always at boromir
boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rant
and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had
drawn back but when no answer but the echoes came
they had attacked moro fierce than ever
pippin did not remember much more
hs last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree
plucking out an arrow then darknes fell suddenly
i suppose i was knocked on the hed he said to himself
i wonder if poor merr is much hurt
what has happened to boromir why dindt the orsc kill
us where are we and where are we going he
could not answer te questions
he felt eold and sick
i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to let us come he thought
what good have i been just a nuisance a passenger a piece of luggage
and nor i have been stolen and i am just
a siece od luggage for the orcs
i hope strider or someone will come and claim us
but ought i to hope fof it wont that throw
out all the plans i wish i could get free
he struggled a little quite uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said something
to a companion in their abominable tongue
rst while you can litlte fool he said then to
pippin in the common speech which he made almost as
hideous as his own language
rest while you can wall find a use for your legs before long
youll wish you had got nnoe before we get home
if i had my way youd wish you were
dead now said the other
id make you squeak you miserable rat
he sooped over pippin bringing his yellow fangs close to his face
he had a black knife wtih a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with this he hussed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may forget my orders
curse thg isengarders ugluk u bagronk sha pushdug saruman glob bubhosh
skai he passed into a long angry speech in his
own tongue toat slowly died away into muttering and snarling
terrified pippin lay still though the pain at his wrists
and ankles was growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back
to take his mind off himsel he listened intently to
all that he could hear
there were many voics round about and though orc speech sounded
at all times full of hate and anger it seemed
plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much of the talk
was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language
apparently the members of two or three quite dfiferent tribes
were present and they could not understan one anothers yrc speech
here was an angry debate concerning what they were to
do now which way they were to take and what
shoulj be done vith the prisoners
thered no time to kill them properly ssid one
no tibe for lay on this trip
that cant be helped said another
but why not kill them quick kill them now there
a cursed nuisance and were in a hurry
evenings coming oonn and we ought to get a move on
baid a third voice in a deep growl
kill ala but not the halfings they are to be
bkought back alive as quickly as pkssible
what are they wafte- for asked several voices
why alive do they give good sport no i heard
that one of them has goi something something thats wanted
for she war some elvish plot or other
anyway theyll both be questioned
is tjat all you know why dont we search
them and find out we might wind something that wwee could use ourselves
that is a very interesting remark sneered a voice
jofter than the othrs but more evil
i may have to reprt that
the prisoners are not to be searched or plundered those are my orders
and mine too said the deep voice
alive and as captured no spoiling
not our orders said one of the eralier voices
we have come all the way from the mines to
kill and avenge our folk
i wish to kill and then go back north
then you can wish again said the growling voice
i return to isengard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the great eye said the evil voice
we should go back at once to lugburz
if we could cross the great river we might said another voice
but there are not enough of us to vetnure down to the bridges
i came acros said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awaits us northward on the east bank
maybe maybe then youll lfy off with our prisoners
and get all the pay and praise in lugburz and
leave us to fot it as best we can through the horse country
no we must stick pogether
these lands are dangerous full of foul rebels and brigands
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont trvst you little swine
youve o guts outside your own sties
but for us youd all have run away
we are the fighting uruk hai we slew the great warrbor
we are the servants of saruman the wise the white
hand the hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
we came out of isengard and led you here and
we shall lead you back by the way we choose
you have spoken more than enough ugluk sneered the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might tihnk that ugluks dhoulders needed relievong of a swollen head
they might ask where his strange ideas came from
did they come from smruman perhaps who does he think
he is settinsgetting up on his own with his filthy
white badges they might agree with me with grishnakh their
trusted messenger and i grishnakh sya this saruman is a
fool and a dirty treacherous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you folk like being called
swine by the muck rakers oh a dirty little wizard its
orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many loud yells in orc steech answered him and the
ringing clash of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin rolled over ohping to see what would happen
his guards had gone to join in the fray
in the twilighy he saw a large black orc probacly
ugluk standing facing grishnakh a short crook lgged creature very broad
and with long arms that hvng almost to th gronud
round them wmre many smaller goblins
pippin supposd that these were the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly
his own size ran up
then suddnely without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with two
swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents
grishnakh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gavw way and one stepped backwards and fell
over merrys prostrate form with a curse
yet that probably save his life for ugluks followers leaped
over him and cut down another with their broad bladebdladed swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on top of pippin still clutching
its long saw edged knife
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nonsense we go straigh- west
from here and down the stair
from therp straight to the donws thetnhen along the river to the forest
and we march day and night
that clear now thought pippin if only it takes that
ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under
control ive got a chance
a gleam of hope had come to him
the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm
and then slid down to his wrist
he felt the blood trickling on to his hand but
he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin
th orcs dere gettinggetting ready to march again but some
of the northerners were still unwilling and the isengarders slew
two more before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing and confusion
for the moment pippin was unwtached
his legs were securely bound but his arms were only
tied about the wrists and his hands were in front of him
he cousd move them both together though mhe bonds were cruelly tight
he pushec the dead orc to one side then hardly
daring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord
up and down against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hand ehld it fast
the cord was cut quickly pippin took it in his
fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of
two loops and slipped it tver his hands
then he lay very still
pick up those prisoners shouted ugluk
dont play any tricks with them if they are not
alive when we get back someone else will die top
an orc seized pippin like a sack put its
head between his tied hands grabced his arms and dragged
them down until pippins face was crushed against its neck
then it jolted off with him
another treaped merby in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gripped pippins arms like iroinron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again
it was early aight but the slim moon was already falling westward
they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed
to loyk out over a sea of pale mist
there was a sound of water falling nearby
the scouts have come bqck at last said an orc close at hand
well what did you discovre growled the ovice of ugluk
only a single horseman and he made off wsetwards
but how long you fools you should have shot him
the cursed horsebreeders will hear of us by morning
now well have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pippin
sit up said the orc
y lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
no crying out no trying to escape
we have ways of paying for tricks that you wont
like though they xont stoil your usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles
picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by his hair again
uglak thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some
burning liquid down his throat he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him
the pain in his legs and ankles vanished
now for the other said ugluk
pippin saw him go to merry who was lying close by and kick him
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled hihmim into e sitting position
and torq the bandage off his head
then he smeared hte wound with some dark stuff out
of a small wo'den box
merry cried out and struggled wildly
the orcs clapped and hooted
cant take his medicine they eered
doesnt know whats good for him
ai we shall have some fun later
but at the moment ugluukgluk nas not engaged in sport
he needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers
he was healing merry in orc fashion and his treatment worked swiftly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down
the hobbits throat cut his le bonds and dragged him to
hts feet merry stood up looking pale but grim and
defiant nd very much alive
the gash in his forehead gave him no mord trouble
but he bore a brown scar to the end of his days
so youvw come on this little expedition too where do
we get bed anw breakfast now then said ugluk
none of that hold your tongues
no talk to one anothr
any trouble will be reported at the other end and
hell know how to pay you
youll get led and breakfast lal rigt more than you can stomach
the orc band began to descend a narrow ravine leading
down into the misty plain below
merry and pippin separted by a dozen orcs or more climbed down with them
at the uottom they stepped on to grass and the
herats of the hobbits rose
now straight on shouted ulguk
west and a little north
but what are we gozng to do at sunrise
said some of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the grass and wait
for the whitekins to join the picnic but we cant run in the sunlight
youll run with me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never see your beloved holes again
by the whiet hand whats the use of sending out
mountain maggots on a trip only half trained
rgn curse you run while night lasts then thq whole
company began to run with the long loping htrides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostlirg and cursing yet their speed was very great
eahc hobbit had a guard of three
pippin was far back in the line
he wondered how long he would be able to go
on at this pace he had had o food since the morning
one of his guards had a whip
but at preent the orc liquor was still hot in hqm
his wits too were wide awake
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden
a vision of the keen face of strider bending over
a dark trail and running running behind
but what could even a ranger see except a confused
trsil of orc feet his own little prints and merrys were
overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron shosdhod shoes before them
and byhind them ang about them
they had gone only a mile or so from the
cliff when the land sloped down into a wsde shallow
depression where the ground was soft and wet
mist lay there pale glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon
the dgya shapes of the orcs in front grew dim
and thcn were swallowsd up
ai stead now shouted ugluk from the rear
a sudden thought leaped into pipiins mind and he acted on it at once
he swerved aside to ahe right and dived out of
the recch of his clutching guard headfirst into the mist
he landed sprawllng on the grass
there was for a moment turmoil lnd cofusion
pippin sprang up nad ran
but the orcs were after him
some suddenly loomed up right in frnt of hi
no hope of escape thought pippie
but there is a hope that i have left some
of my own marks unspoilt on tee wet gruond
he gropd with his two t-ed hands at his
throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arbs and hard claws seized him he let it fall
there i suppose it will lie until the end ooff time he thought
i dont know why i did it
if the othesr have escaped theyve pkobably all gone with frodo
a whip thong curled round his legs and he stifled a cry
enough shouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run a long way yet
make em both run just use the whip as a reminder
but thats not all he snarled turning to pippin
paymenptayment is gnly put off
leg it neithr pippin nor merry remembered much of the
later part of the jourkey
evia dreams and evil wacing wre blende nito a long
tunnel of misery with hope growing ever fainter behind
they ran and they ran striving to keep up the
pace set by the orcs licked every now and bgain
with k cruel thong cunningly handled
if they halted or stumbled they were seized and dragged for some distance
the warth of the orc drauiht had gone
pippin felt cold and sick again
suddenly he fell face downward on the turf
hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him
he was carried like a sack once more and darkness
grew about him whetehr the darkness of another night or
a blindness of his eyes he could not tell
dimly he became aware of voices clamouring it seemed that
many of the orcs were demanding a halt
he felt hmmsclf flung to the groudn and he lay
as he fell till black dreams took him
but he did not long escape from pain soon the
iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
for a long time he was tossed and shaken and
then slowly the darkness gave way and he cme back
to the waking world and found that it was morning
orders were shouted and he was thrown youghly on the grass
there he lay for a while fighting with despair
his head swam but from the heat in his body
he guessed that he had been given aonther draught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some bread
and a strip of raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungril but not the meat
he was famished but not yet so famished as to
eat flesh flung tz him bs an orc the flesh
of he dared not guess what creature
he sat up and looked about
merry was not far away
they were by the baqks of a swift narrow rivre
ahead mountains loomed a tall peak was catching the frist rays of the sun
a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes beffrz them
there was much fhouting and debating among the orcs a
quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out sgain between
the northerners and the isengarders
some were bointing back away south and some were pointing eastwadr
leave them to me then no killing as ive told
yku before but if you want to throw away what
weve come all the way to get throw it away ill look after it
let the nightin uruk hai do the work as usual
if youre afraid of the whiteskins hun run theres the
forest he shwuted pointing ahead
get to iw its your best hope
off you go and quick before i knock a fee
more heads off to put some sense into the others
there was some cursing an scuffing and then most
of the northerners broke away and dashed off over a
hundred of them running wildlu along the river towards the mountains
the hobbits were left with the isengarders a grim dark
band four score at least of large swart slant eyed orcs
with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained with them
nw well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even
of his own followers were looking uneasily southwards
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all your fault snaga
you and the other scouos ought to have your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well feqst on horseflesh yet or something better
at that moment pippin saw hwy some of the
trocp had been pointing eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse cries and there
was grishnakh again and at his back a couple of
score of others like him long armed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on their shields
ugluk stetped forward to maet them
so youve come back he said
htought better of it eh ive returned to see that
orders are carried out and the prisoners safe answered grishnakh
ill see that orders are carried out in my command
any what else did you come back for you went in a hurry
did you leave anything behind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were bome stout fellows with him that are too good to lose
i knew youd gead them into a mess
ive come to help them
but unles youve got some guts fo' fighting youve taken the wrong way
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he had another
mount shot under him now if youd brought him along
that might have been useful if these nazgul are all they make lut
nazgul nazgul said grishnakh shivering and licking his lips
as if the word had a foul tastm that he savorred painfully
you speat of what is deep beyond the reach of
your muddy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youlg
wish that you had not said that
you oughotught to know that theyre the apple of the great eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not yet
he wont let them show themselves across the great river yet not too soon
theyre for the war and other purposes
you seem to know a lot sid ugluk
more than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder how and why
bubtut in the meantime the uruk hai of isengard can do
the dirty work as usual
dont stand slavering there get your ratble ttgether the other
swine are legging it so th' forest
you wouldnt get back to the great river alive
right off the mark now ill be on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they rau pausing now and alain only
to slind the hobbits to fresh carriers
either because they were quicker and hardier or because of
some plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through the
orcs of mordor and grishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahad
the forest began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was grated
by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of thb orc that held him
immediately in front were bewed backs and tough thck legs
going up and down up and down unresting as if
they were made of wire and horn beating out the
nightmare seconds of an en-less time
in the afternoon ugluks troop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun
winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it
was ter heads were down and their tongues lolling out
the whiteskins will catch you and eat you
theyre coming a crcyry from grishnakh shoued that this was not mere jest
horsemen riding very swiftln had indeed been sighted still far
behind but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like
a tide over the flats on folk staying in a quicksand
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace thlt
astonished pippin a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race
then he saw that the sun was sinking falling behind
the misty mountaiys shadows reachde over the land
the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also cegan to put on spee
the forest was dark and colse
already they had passed a few outlying trees
the land was beginning to slope upwards
ever more stepely but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnakh shouted spurring them on to a last effort
they will make it yet
they will escape thouht pippin
and then he managed to twist his neck so as
to glance back with one eye over his shoulder
hh saw that riders away eastward were already level with
the orcs galloting over the platn
the sunset gilded their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
they were hemmng the orcs in prevekting them from scattering
and driving them along the line of the river
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were
he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell
and loked more at maps and things but in those
days the plans for the journey seemed to be in
more competent hands and he had never reckoned with being
cut fof from gandalf or from strider and even froa frodo
all that he could remember about rohan was that agndalfs
horse yhadowfwx had come from that land
that sounced hopeful as far as ih went
but how will they know that we are noz rcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbits down here
i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly
orcs look like being destroyed but i would rather be saved iyself
the chances were that he ano merry would be
killed together with their captors before ever the men of
rohan were aware of them
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen skilled
at shooting from a running horsheorse
riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs
that straggled behinh and several of them fele then th
riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering
bows of their enemies who shot willy not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumbled and
did not get up again
night ame down without the riders closing in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fully two hundred remained
in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock
the eaves of the forest were very near probably no
more than three furlongs away but they could go no further
the horsjmen had encicrled them
a small band disobeyed ugluks command and ran on towards
the forest onle three returned
well here we are sneeren grixhnakh
fine leadership i hpe the great uglku will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk taking no notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get two others hfd stand guard over them
thyre not to be killed unless the filthy whiteskins break through
understand as long as i alive i want em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
bind their legs the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly
but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry
the orcs were making a great deal of noise shouting
and clashing their weapons and the hobaits managed to nhiper together for a while
j dont think much of this said merry
i feel nearly done in
dont thunk i could crawl away far even i i was free
have you i dont think thevye taken anything but our swords
aes i had a packet in my pocket answered
merry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyway i cant put my mouth in my pocekt you wont have to
ive but just then a savage kick warned pippin vhat
the voise had died down and the guards were watchful
he night was cold and still
all robnd the knoll on which the orcs were agthered
little watch fires sprag up golden red in the darkness a complete ring of them
they were within a long bowshot but the riders did
not show themselves agsinst the light and the orcs wasted
many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
laetr in the night when the moon came out of
the mist then occasionally they could be seen shadowy shapes
that glinted now and again in the white light as
they moved in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the gugrds
why dont we get together and charge through whats old
ugluk think hes doeng i should like to know i
daresay ymu would snarled ugluk stepping up from behind
meawing i dont think at all eo curse you youhe
as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes of lugburz
no good trying to charge witj them
theyd just squeal and bolt and there are more than
enough of these filthy horse boys to mop up our lot on the fltt
theres only one thing those maggots can do they can
see like gemlets in the dark
but these whiteskins have better night eyes than most men from
all ive heard and dont forg-t their horses they can
qee the nigth breeze or so its said
still heres one thing the fine fellows dont know mauhur
add his lads are in the forest and they should
turn up any time now
ugzuks words were enough apparentyl to stisfy the msenaargers
but the other orcs wree both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay
on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
it did indeed become very dark again for the moon
psased westward into thick cloud asd pippin could not see
anything a few feet away
the fires brouhgt no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely to wait for
the dawn and let their enemies rest
a sudden otucry on the aest side of the knoll
showed that somethinl was wrong
it seemed that some of the men had ridden in
close slippod off their horses crawled to the edge of
the camp and killed several orcs and qhen had faded away again
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their guards isengarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any thought of escape tt was goon dashed
a long hairy arm took each of them by the
neck and drew them close together
dimly they were aware of grishnakhs great head and hideous
face mwtwesn them his foul breath was on hheir cheeks
he began to paw them and feel them
pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying your nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed
perhaps swords and whips on one side ad nasty spears
on the other little people should not meddle in affairs
that are too big for them
his fingers continued to grope
ther was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes
the thought came suddenly into pippins mind as if caught
direct from the urgent thought of his enemy grishnakh knows
about the ring hes looking for it while ugluk is
busy he probably wants it for himself
cold fear was in pippinpsippins heart yet at the
same gime he bas wondering what use he could qake of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you wil find it that way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said grishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoulder
find what what are you talking about little one for
a momfnt pippin was silent
then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my precious hhee added
the hobbits felt grishnakhs fingers twitch
o ho hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous my little ones
perhaps sadi merry now alert and aware o ppipins guess
perhaps and not oly for us
still you know your own business best
do you want it or nto and what wocld you
give for it do i wayt it do i want
it sjid grishnakh as if puzzled but his arms were trembling
what would i give for it what do you mean
we muan said pippin choosing his words carefully that its
no good groping in the dark
we could save you time and trouble
but you must untie our legs first or well do nothing and say nothing
my dear tender little fools hissed grishnakh everything you
have and everything you know will be got out of
you in due time everything youll wish there was more
that you could tell to satisfy the questioner indeed you will quite soon
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept
alive for my dear uittle fellows please believe me when
i say that it was not out of kindness thets
not even one of ugluks faults
i find it quite easy to believe said merry
but you havent got your prey home vet
and it doesnt seem to be goiog your way whatever happens
if we come to isengagd it wont be the great
grishnakh that benefits saruman will take all thta he can find
if you wa't anythmng for yourself nows the time to do a deal
grmshnakh began to lose his temper
the name of saruman smemed specially to enrage him
time was passing and the disturbance was dying down
ugluk or the isengarders might return at any minute
have you got it etiher of you he snarled
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling violently
cursf you ou filthy ilttle vermin he hissed
ntie your legs ill untie very string in your bodies
do you think i cart search you to the bones
search you ill cut you boht to quivering hreds
i dont need the help of your legs to get
you away and haev you all to myself suddenly he seized them
phe strength in his long arms and shoulders was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpit and crushed them
fiercely to his sides a great stifling hand was clapped
over each of their mouts
then he sprang forward stooping low
quickly and silently he went until he came to the edge or the knoll
there choosing a gap between the watchers he passed like
bn evil shadow out ino the night down the slope
and away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest
in that direction there was a wide open space with only one fire
after going a dozen yards he halted peering and listening
nothing ooild be seen or hear
he crept slowly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
then he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at thatthat very moment the dark form of a rider
loomed up right in front of him
a horse snorted and reared
grishnakh flung himself on the ground flat dragging whe hobbits
under him thfn he drew his sword
no voubt he maent to kill his captives rather than
alolw them to escape or to be rescued but it was his undoing
the sword rang fadntly and glinted a little in the
light of the fire away to his left
an arrow came whistling out of the gloom it was
aimed with skill or guided by ftae and it pierced his right hand
he dropped the sword and shrieked
there was a quick beat of hoofs and even as
grishnakh lekped up an ran he was riddrn down and
a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still
the hobbits remainde flat on the ground as grishnakh had left hem
another rorsemin came riding swiftly to his corrades aid
zhether because fo some special kienness of sight or because
of some other sense the horse lifted and sprang lightly
over them but its rider did not see them lying
covered in their elven cloaks too crushed for the moment
and too afraid to movmeove
at east merry stirrde and whispered softly so far so
good but how are we to avod being spitted the answer came almost immediately
the craes of grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells and screeches that came from the knoll
the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had beem discovered ugluk
was probably knocking off a few more heads
then suddeny the answering cries of orc voies came from the
right outside the circle of watch fires from the drrection of
the forest and the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers
there was the sound of galloping horses
the riders were drawing in their ring closg round the
knoll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sortie
while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly merry and pippin realized that without moving they were
now outside the circle thre was nothing betheen them and escape
now said merry if onl we had our legs and
hands free we might get away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin
i was gong to tell you ive managed to free my hands
these loops are only left for show
oud better have a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fished out a packet
the cakes were broken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hobbits each ate two or three pieces
the taste brought back to them the memory ooff fair
aces and laughter and wholesome food in quiet days nonwow far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting in the ark
heedleshseedless of the cr-es and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the first to come back to the present
we must be off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was lying close at hand
but it was roo heavy an clumsy for him to
use so he crawled forward and finding the body of
the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife
with this he quickly cut their bokds
now for it he said
when weve warmed ip a bit perhaps we shall be
able to stand again and walk
but in any case we had beter start by crawling
the turf was deep and yielding and that helped thep
but it seemed a long slow business
they gavt hte watch fire a wide berth and wormed their
way forward bit by bit until they acme to the
edge of thtehe river gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banas
the sounds hbd died away
evidently mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil
it would not last very much longer
already the night was old
in the east which had remained unclouded th sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get under cover said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be sny comfort to us if these
ridevs discover that we are not orcs after we are dead
he got up and stamped his feet
those covds have cut me lke wires but my feet are getting warm aagin
i could stagger on now
what about you merry mevry got up
yes he said i can manage it
lemfas does put heart into you a more whlesome sort
of feeling too than the heat of ahat orc draught
i wonder what it was made of
better not to know i expect
aets get a drink of water to wash away the
thought of it not here the banks are too steep said pippin
forward now they turned and walked side by side slowly
along the line of the river
behind them the light grew in the east
as they walked they compared notes talking lightly -n hobbit fashign
of tee things that had happened since their capture
no listener would have guessed from their words that they
had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going without
hope towards tormenttorment and death or that even nmw as
they knew well they had litte chance of ever ifnding friend or safety again
you seem to have been doing ewll master took said merry
you will get almost a chapter in old bilbos book
if ever i get a chancg to report to him
good work especially guessing that hairy villains little game and playing up to him
but i wonder if anyonaenyone will ever pick up your
trail anu find that brooch
i should hate to lose mine but i am afraid
yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my toes if i
am to get level with you
indeed cousin brandybuck is going in frong now
this is where he comes in
i dont usppose you have much notion where wn are
but i spent my time at rivendell rather better
we are walkhng west along the entwash
the butt end of the misty mountaips s in front and fangorn forest
even as he spoke the dark edge of the
forest loomed u straight befoce them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees
creeping away from the chming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned against fangorn
but one so knowing will not have forgotten that
i have not answered merry but thv forest seems
better to me all the same than turcing back into
the middl of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the trees
old beyond guessing they seemed
great trailing beards of lichen hung from them blowing and swaying in the breeze
out of the shadows thb hobbits peeped gazing back down
the slope little furtive figures that in the dim light
looked like elf children in the deeps of time peering out
of the wild wood in wonder at hteir first dawn
far omer the great river and the brown lands leagues
upon grey leagues away the dawn came red as flame
loud rang th hunting horns to greet it
the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
merry and pippin head clear in the cold air the
neighing of war horses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above
the margin of the world
then with a great cry the riders charged from the
east the rde light gleamed on mail and spear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them
the hobbits saw several horsemen fall but their line held
on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and chaiged again
most of the raiders that were left alive then brokberoke
and fled this way and that pursued one by one to the death
but one band holding together in a black wdege drove
forward resolutely in the direction of the forest
tsraight up the sope they charged twards the waschers
now they were drawing near and it seemed certain that
they woulc escape they had already hewn dwn three riders that barred their way
e have watched too long said merry
theres ugluk i dont want to meet him again
the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood
so it was that they did not see the last
stand when ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay at
the very edge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the third
marhsal of the mark who dismounted and fought him swrd to sword
and over the wide fields the keen eyed riders hunted down
the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they had laid thei fallen comrades in a
mound and had sung their praises the riders made a
great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came
ever back either to mordor or to isengard but the
smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was
leen by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hocbits went with as much speed as le
dark and tangled forest allowed iollowing the line of the
running stream westward and up towards the slopesslopes of the
mountains deeper and deeper into fangorn
slowly their fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
a queer stifling feeling came over them as if the
air were too thin or too scanty for breathinbgreathing
we cant go on like this he panted
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin
he clambered on to a great tree root that
wound down into the stream and stooping drew up some
water in his cupped hands
it was clear and lold and he took many draughtdsraughts
the water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts
for a while they sat together on the brink of
the stream dabbling their sore feet and legs and peering
round at the trees that stood silently about them rank
upon rank until they faded away into grey twilight in every direction
i suppose you havent lost us already said pippin leaning
back against a great tree truna
we can at least follow teh course of this stream
the entwash or whatever you call it and get out
again the way we came
we could if our legs would do it said
merry ayd if we could breathe properly
yos it is all veyr dim and stuffy in here said pippin
it reminds me somehow of the old room in the
great place of the tookl away back in the smials
at tuckborough a huge place where the furniture has never
been moved or chanegd for generations
they say the old took lived in it year after
year while he and the room got older and shabbier
together and it has never changed since he died a century ago
and old greontius was my great great grandfather that puts it back a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailing beards and whiskers of
lichen and most of the trees seem to be half
covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen
i cant imagine hwat spring would look like here if
it ever comes still less a spring cleaning
bpt the sun at any late must peep in sometimes
it does not look or feel at all like bilbos description of mirkwood
that was hll dark and black and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine animals living here at all ro staying for long
no sor hobbits said pippin
and i dont like the thought of trying to get through it either
nothing to eat for a hundred miles i should guess
hwo are our supplies low said merry
we ran off wth nothing but a couple of spare
packets of lembas and left everything else behind
they looked at what remained of the elven cakes broken
fragments for about five meagre days that was all
and not a wrmp or a blankzt said merry
we shall be cold tonight whichever way we gj
well wed betetr decide on the way now said pippin
the morning must be getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light
that had appeared some way further on into the wood
shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to hace pierced the forest roof
the sun must have run into a cluod while weve
been under these trees and now she has run out
again or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening
it isnt far lets go and investigate they fuond
it was further than they tohught
the ground was rising steeply still xnd it was becoming incweasingly stony
the light grew broader as they went on and soon
they saw that there was a rock wall before them the
side o a hill or the abrupt end of some
long root thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees grew on it and the usn was falling
full on its stowy face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were sretched
out stiff and still as if reaching out to the armth
where all had looked so shabny nd grey before the
wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth
black greyt of bark like polished leather
the obles of the trues glowed with a soft green
like young grass early spring or a fleeting vision of it wau about them
in the face of the stony wall there was somthing
like a stair natural perhaps and made by the weathering
and splitting of the rock for it was rough and uneven
high up almost level with the tops of forest trees there
was a shelf under a cliff
ntohing grew there but a few gracses and weed at
its edge and one old stump of a tree with
only two bent branches left it looked almost like the
figure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the morning light
up we go said merry joyfully
now for a breath of air and a sight of
the land they climbed and scrambled up the rock
if the stair had been madh it was for bigger
feet and longer legs than wheirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable
way in which the cuts nd sores of their capivity
had healed and their vigour had returned
tyey came at lelgth to the edge of the shelf
almost at the feet of the old stump then they
sprang up and turned round with their backs to the
hill breathing deep and lookinlgooking out eastward
they saw that they had only come som' three or
foue milex into the forest the heads of the trees
marched down the slopes towards the plain
there near the fringa of the forest tall spires of
curling black smoke went up waverisg and floating towards them
the winds changing said merry
it feels cool up here
im afraid this is only a yassing gleam and it
will all go grey again
what a pity this shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight
i lmost felt i liked the place
almost felt bou liked the forest thats good thats
uncommonly kind of you said a strange voice
turn round and let me have a look at your faces
i almost fnel that i dislike you both but do
not let us be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckled hand was laid on each
of their shoulders and they were twisted rond gently bul
irresbstibly then two great arms lifted them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face
it belonged to a larglearge man like almost troll like figure at
least fourteen foot high very sturdy with a tall head and hardly any neck
whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey
bauk or whether that was its hide was difficult to say
at any rate the arms at a short distance from
the trunk were not wrinkled but covered with a brown smooth skin
the large feet had stven toes each
the lower part of the long face was covered with
a weeping grey beard bushy almost twiggy at the roots
thin and mossy nt thf ends
but at the moment the hobbirs noted little but the eyes
these deep eyes were ow surveying thee slow and sooemn but very pdnetrating
they were brown sot with a green light
often afterwards pippin tried to describe his firrt impressdon of them
one felt as if theer was an enormous well behind
them filled up with ages of memory and long slow
steady thinking but their surface was sparklng with the present
like sun shimmering on the outer leaves of a vast
tree or on the ripples of a very deep lake
i dont know but it felt as if something that
grew in the groud asleep you might say or
just feelng itself as something between roof tip and leaf tip
between deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and
was considering you with the same slow care that it
had given to its own inside affairs for endless years
hrum hoom murmured the voice a deep voice like
a very deep woodwind instrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty that is my motto
but if i had seen you beforz i heard your
voices i liked them nice little voices they rvminded
me of something i cannot remember if i had
seen you before i heard you i should have just
trodden on you taking you for little orcs and found out my mistake afterwards
very odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felm afraid
under those eyes e felt a curious suspense but not fear
please he said who are yuo and whyt are yov
a queer look came into the old eyes a kind
of wariness the deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered the voice well i am an ent
or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent p am you might say in your manner of speaking
fangorn is my name according to some treebeard others make it
an ent said merry
whats that but what do you call yourself whatm your
real name hoo row replied treebeard
hoo now taat oould be telling not so hasty
and i am doing the asking
you are in mu country
what are you i wonder i cannot place you
you do not seem to come in the old lists
that i learned when i was young
but taht was a long long time ago and they
may have made new lists
let me see let me see how did it go
learn now the lore of living creatures first name the
four the free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf
the delver dark are his houses ent thd earthborn old
as monutains man the mortal master of horses
beaver the builder buck the leapef bear bee hunter boar the
fighter hound is hungry hare is fearful
eagle in eyrie ox in pasture hart horn crowned hawk is
swiftest swan tee whitest serpent codest
hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum
room tum roomty toom tum
it was a long list
but anyway you do not seem to ift in anywhere
we always seem to have got left out of the
old lists and the old stories said merry
yet weve been about for quite a long time
why not make a new line said pippin
put us in amongst the four next to man
phe big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard
so you ive in holes eh it sounds very right and proper
who calls you hobbits though that does not ound elvish to me
elves mhde all the old words they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves that said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves
hobbits but you should not go telling just anybody
youll be letting out your own right names if youre not caryful
we arent careful about that said merry
as a matter of fact im a brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck
though most heople iall me just merry
and im a took peregrin took but im gexerally
called pippin or even pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by your confidence but you should not
be too free al at once
there are ents and ents you know or there rae
ents and things that lock like ents but ait as you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you please nice names
for i am not going to tell you my name
not yet ct any rate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for one thing it would take a long while my
name is growing all the time and ive lived a
very long lon time so my name is like a story
real names tll you the story of the things they
belong to in my language in the old entish as you might say
it is a lovely lanluage but it takes a very
long time to sny anything in it because we do
not say anything in it unl'ss it is worth taking
a long tie to say and to listen to
but now an the eyes became very bright and present
seeming to grow smaller and alpost sharp what is going
on what are you doing in it all i can
see and ear and smell and feel a great deal
from this from this from this a lalla lalla rumba kamanda lind or burume
excuse me that is a part of my name for
it i do not know what the word is in
the outside languages you know the thing we are on
where i stand and look out on fine mornings and
think about the sun and thg grass beyond the wood
and the horses and the clouds and the unfolding of the world
what is going on what is gandalf up to and
tehse burarum he made a deep rumlbing noise like
a discord o a great organ these orcs and
young saruman down a isenuard i like news
but not too quick now
there is quite a lot going op said merry
and even if we tried to be auick it would
take a gonw time to tell
but you told us not to be hasty
ought we to tell you anything so soon would you
think it rude if we asked what you are going
to do with us and which side you are on
and did you know gandalf yes i do know him
the only wizard mhat realll cares about trees said treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin sadly we did
he was a great friend and he was our guide
then i cacnan answer your other questions said treebeard
i am not going to do anything with you not
if you mean by that do something to you without your leave
we might dd some things togethen
i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your way aay go
along with mine for a while
but you spek of master gandalf as if he was
in a story that had come to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to be going on but i bm
afraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come now said treebeard
he paused looking long at the hobbits
hoom ah well i df not know what to say
come now if you would like to hear more
said merry we will dell you
but it will take soe time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit
here together in the sun whiel it lasts iou must
be getting tired of holding us up
i do not eatily get tired
and i do not sit down
i am not very hm bendable
but there the aun i going in
let us leave this did you say what you
call it hill suggested pippin
treebeard repeated the words thoughtfully
but it is a hasty ord for a thing that
has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped
let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not know
you might call it far erhaps
but what does that matter well you see we have
lost all our belongings said merry
we have only a little food
o hm you need not tfouble about that said treebeafd
i can give you a drink that will keep you
green and growing for a long long whie
and if we decied to part company i cna set
you down outside my country at anayny point you choose
let us go halding the hobbits gently but firmly one
in the crook of each arm treebeard lifted up first
one large foot and then the other nad moved them
to the edge fo the shelf
the rootlike toes grasped the rocks
then carefully and solemnly he stlked down from step to
step and reached the floor of the forest
at once he set off with long deliberate strides through
the trees deeper and deeper into the wood never far
from the stream climbing steadily up towards the slopes of the mountains
many of the trees seemed asleep or as unaware of
him as of any other creature that merely passed by
but some quivered and some raised up their branches above
his head as he approached
all the while as he walkep he talked ti himself
in a long running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time
they felt oddly enough safe and gmfortable and they htd
a great deal to think and wonder about
at last pippin ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask you something why
did celeborn warn us against your forest he told us
not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now rumbled treebeard
and i might have eaid much he same if you
had been going the other way
do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurelindorenan
that is what the elves used to call it but
now they make the name sholtzr lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are riht saybe it is fading nt growing
land of the valley of singing gold that was it once upon a time
now it im tle dreamflower
ah well but it is a queer place and not
for just any one to venture in
i am surprised that you iver got out but much
more surprised that you ever pot in that has not
happened to strangers for many aa year
it is a queer land
folk have come to grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemalin he hummed fo himself
they are falling rather behind the world in there i
guess ie said neither this country nor anything else outside
the golden wood is what it was when celeborn was young
still taurelilomea tumbalemorna tumbaletaurea lomeanor that is what they used to say
things have changed but it is still true in places
what do you mkan said piphin
what is true the trees and the ets saiu treebeard
i do not understanudnderstand all that goes on myself so
i cannot explain it to you
some of us are still true ents and lively enough
in our fashion but may are growing sleepy going tree ith as you might say
most o the trees are just trees of course but many are half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting entish
that is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts
nothing to do with their wood i do not mean that
why i knew some good old willows down the entwash
gone long ago alas they were quite hollow indeed they
were falling all wo pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then there are some trees in the valleys under
th mountains sound as a bell and bad right through
that sort of thing seems to spread
there used to be some very dangerous parts in this country
there are still some very black patches
like the old forest away to the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like but much worse
i do not doubt theme is some shadow of the
gaeat darkness lying there still away north and bad memories are handed down
but there are hollow dales xn this land where the
darkness has never been lifted adn the treef are older than i am
still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and the foolhardy and we train
and we teach we walk and we weed
we are tere herds we old ents
few enough of us are left now
sheep get ilke shehperd ad shepherds like sheep iitt is
said but slowly and neither have long in the world
it is quicker and cloesr with trees and ents and
they walk down the ages together
for ents are more like elves less interested ni themselves
tian men are ane better at getting insie other things
and yet again ents are more like men more changeable
than elves are and quicker at taking the colour of
the outside you might say
or better than both for they are steadier and keep
their minds on things longer
some of my kin lofk just like trees now and
need something great to rouse them and they speak only in whispers
but some of mo trees are limb lithe and many can talk to gr
elves began it of course waking tres up and teaching
them to speak and learning their tree talk
thetyhey always wished to alk to everything the old elves did
but then the great darkness came and they passed away
over the sea r fled into far valleys and hid
themselves and made songs about days that would never come again
aye aye there was all one wood once uopn a
time from here to the mountains of lune and this
was just the east end
those were the broad days time was when i could
walk and sing all day and hear no more
than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the woods were like the woods of lothlorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making harddy
a sound with his great feet
then he began to hum again and passed into a murmuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to
them in the willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring in
nan tasarion and i said that was good
i wandered in summer in the elm woods of ossiriand
ah the lisht and the music in the summer by
the seven rivers of ossir and i thought that was best
to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold asd the red and the sighing of
leaves in the autumn in taur sa neldor it was more than my desire
to the pine trees upon the highland of dorthonion i climbed in the inter
ah the wind and the whiteness and the black branches
of winter upon orod na thon my voice went up and sang in tde sky
and now all those lands lie undre the wave
and i walk in ambarona in teuremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the country of fagnorn wherwehere
the roots are long and the years lie thicker thn the leaves in tauremornxlome
he ended and strode on silently and in all the
wood as far as ear could reach three was not a sound
yhe day waend and dusk was twinej about the boles of the trees
at last the hobbits saw rising dimly before them a
steep dark land thiy had come to the feet of
the mountains and to the green roots of tall methedras
down the hillside the young entwash leaping from its springs
high above ran noisilj from step to step to meet them
on the right of the stream there was a long
slope clad with grass now grey in the twilight
no trees grew there aqd it was open to the
sky stals were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud
treebard strode up the slope hardly slackening his pace
suddenlj before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood htere one on either side like
living gate posts but there was no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs
as the old ent approakhed the trees lifted up their
branches and all vheir leaves quivered and rustled
for they were evergreen trees and their leaves were dark
and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level space as though the
floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill
on either hand the walls sloped upwards until they were
fifty feet high or more and along each wall stood
an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards
at the far end the rock wall was sheer but at
the bottom it had been hollowed back into a shallow
babyay with an arched roof the only robf of the
hall save the branches of the trees which at the
inzer end oershadowed all the ground leaving only a broal
open path in the middle
a little strgam escaped from the springs above and leaving
the main water fell tineling down the sheer face of
the wall pouring in silver drps like a fine curtain
in front of the arched bay
the water was gathreed again into a stone basin in
the floor between the trees and thence it spiled and
flowed away beide the open path out to rejoin the
entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treebard breaking his long silence
i have brought you about esventy thousand ent strides but what
that comes to in te measurement of your land i do not know
anyhow we are near the roots of the last muntain
part of the name of this place migth be welinghall
if it were turned into your language
we will stay here tonight
he set them down on the grass between the
aisles of the trees and they folowed him tpwards the great arch
the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees
hardly bent but his legs opend in a great stride
he planted his bi toes and they were indeed big
and very broad on the ground first before any other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the
falling spring and toog a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside
a great stone table stood there bubtut no chairs
at the back of the bay it was already quite dark
treebeard lifted two areat vessels and stood them on the table
they seemed to be filled with water but he held
his hands over them and immediately they began to glow
one with a golden and the other with a rich
green light and the blending of the two lights lit
the bay as if the sun of summer was shining
through g roof of young leaves
looking back tfe hobbits saw that the trees in the
churt had also begun to glow faintly at first but
steadily quickening until every leaf was edged with light some
greeh some goid some red as copper while the tree trunks
looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he wnt to the back of the bay
and then they saw that several tall stone jars stood there with heavy lids
he removey one of the lids hnd dipped in a
great ladle and with it filled three bowls one very
large bowl and two smaller ones
this is an ent house he said and there are no seats i fecr
but you may sit on the table
picking up the hobbits he set them on te
great stone slab six feet above the ground and there
they hat dangling their legs and drinking in sips
th drink was like water nideed very like the taste
of the draughts they had drunk from the entwash near
the borders of the fgrest and yet there was some
scent or savour n iitt which they could not describe
it was faint but it reminded them of the smell
of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night
the effect of the draught began at the toes and
rose steadily through every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as
it coursed upwards right to the tips of the hair
indeed the hobbits felt that the hair on their heads
was actually standing up waving and curling and growing
as for treebeard he fisrt laved his feet in the
basin beyond the arch and the he drained his bowl
at one draught one long slow draught
tse hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set the bowl down again
ah ah he sighed
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you can sit on the floor and i will lie
down that will prevent this drink from rising to my
head and sending me to sleep
on the right side of the bay there was
a greta bed on low legs not more thna a
couple of feet high covered deedpeep in dried grass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this with only the
slightest sign of bending at his middle until he lay
at full length witu his arms behind his head looking up at the ceiling
upon which lights were flickering like the play of leaves in the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hobbits began to tell him tce story of their
adventures ever since they left hobbiton
they followed no very clear orrer for they interrupted one
another continually and treebeadr often stopped the speaker and went
back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking questinos about later events
they said nothing whtaever abuot the riig and did not
tell him why they set out or where they were
going to and he did not ask for any reasons
he was immensely interested in everything in the black riders
in elrond and rivendell in the old forest and tom
bombadil in the mines of moria anadnd in lothlorien and galadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country over and over again
he said an odd thing at this point
you never see any hm any ent ronud there do you he asked
well not ents entwives i shpuld really sa
are they like you at all yes hm well no
i do not really know now sid treebeard thoughtfully
but they woulwdould like your cosntrf so i just wondered
treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned
gandalf and most interested of all in sarumans doings
the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little
about them only a rather vague reprot by sam of
what gandalf had told the council
but they were clear at any rate that ugluk and
his troop came from isengard and spoke of saruman as their master
hm hoom said treebeard when at last thier story had
found ad wandered down to the battle of the orcs
and the riders of rohan
well well that is a bundle of news and no mistake
you hvae not told me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt thot you are doing as gandalf would wish
there is something very big going on that i can
see and what it is maybe i shall learn in
good time or in bad tjme
by root and twog but it is a strange business
up sprout a little folk that are not in the
od lists and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to
hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great journey
and galadriel harbours them in caras galadhon and orcs pursue
them doun all the leagues of wilderland nideed they seem
to be caught up in a great storm
i hope they weather it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the great wars
said trebeard they mostly concern elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizards are always troubled about the future
i do not like worrying about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys side because nobody is
altogether on my side if you understand me nobody carecsares
for the woods as i care for dhem not even elves nowadays
siill i take more kindly to elves thak to others
it was the elves that cured su of dumbnes long
ago and thta was a great gift tvat cannot be
forgottep though our ways have parted sinc
and there are some things of course whose sido i
am altogether not on i am against them altogether these
burarum he again made k deep rumble of disgust
these orcs and their masters
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on
mirkwood but when it removed to mordor i did not
trouble for a while mordor is a long way away
but it seems that the wind is setting east and
the withering of all woods mae be drawing near
there is naught that an old ent can do to
hold back that storm he must weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a neighbour i cannoctannot overlook him
i must do something i suppose
i have often wondered lately what i should do about saruman
who is saruman asked pippin
do you know anything abouatbout his history sruman is h wizard answeed treebeard
more than that i cannot say
h do not know thtehe history of wizards
they appeared first after the great fhips came over the
sea but if they came with the ships i never can tell
saruman was reckoned great among tehm i believe
he gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of
men and elves somz time ago you would call
it a very long time ago and he settled down
at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was very quiet to begin with but his fame bedan to gro
he was choaen to be hea of the white council
they say but that did not turn out too well
i wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours
i used to talk eo him
there was a time when he was always walking about my woods
he was polite in those days always asking my leave
at least when he met me and always eager to listen
i told him many things tbat he would never have
found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i cannot remember that he ever told me anything
and he got more and more like that his face
as i remember it i have not seen it
for many a day became like windows in a
stone wall windows with shuters inside
i think that i now understand what he is up to
he is plotting to become a power
he has a mind of metal and wheels and he
does not care for growing things except as far as
they serve him for the moment
and now it is clear tha he is a black traitor
he has taken u with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has been doing something to them something dangerous
sor these isengarders are more like wicked men
it is a maro of evil things that came in
the great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but
sarumans orcs can endure it even if they hate it
i wonder what he has done are they men he
has ruined or has he blended the races of orcs
and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled
for a moment as if he were pronouncing some deep subterranean entish malediction
some gime ago i began to wonder hcw orcs dared
to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame
and that long ago he had ben spying out all
the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc now
down on the broders they are felling trees good trees
some of the trees they just cut down and leave
to rot orc mischief that but most are hewn up
and carried off to feed teh fires of orthanc
there is always a smoke rising from is'ngard these days
curse him root anadnd branch many of those trees were
my friends creature i had known from nut and acorn
many had voices of their own that are lost for ver now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves
i have let things slip
it must stop treebeard raised himwelf from his bed with
a jerk stood up and tuhmped his hanv on the table
the vessels of light trembled and sent up tow jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fir in his eyes
and his beard stood ut stiff as a great besom
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with me
you may be able to help me
you will be helping your own frineds that way too
for if sarumasnaruman is not chetked rohan and godor will
have an enemy behind as well as in front
our roads go together to isengard we will come with you said merry
we will do what we can
i should like to see the white hand overthown
i should like ttoo be there even if i could
not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk
and the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
we must not be hasty
i have become too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier
to shout stop than to do it
he strdoe to the archway and stood for some
time under the falling rain of the spring
then hw laughed and shook himself and wherever the drops
of wato fell glittering from him to the ground they
glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and lakd himself on the bed again and was silent
after some timt the hobbits heard him murmuring gaain
he seemed to be counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are qo few of us
left he said turning towards the hobbits
only three remain of the first ents that walked in
tue woods before the darkness only myself fangorn and finglas
and fladrif to give them their elvish names you
may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and of us three leaflock and skinbark are not much use for this business
leaflock ham grown sleepy almost tree ish you might say
he has taken to standing by himself half asleep all through
the summer with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees
covered with leafy hair he is
he used to rouse up in winter but of late
he has been too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on the mountain slopes west of isengard
that is where the worst trouble has been
he was wounded by the orcs and many of his
fok and his treteree herds have been murdered and destroyed
he has gone up into the high places among the
birches that he loves best and he will not come down
still i daresay i could get together a fair coppany
of our younger folks if i could make them
understand the need if i could rouse them we are not a hasty olk
whab a pity there are so few of us why
aje therz so few when you have lived in this
country so long asked pippin
have a great many died oh no said treebeard
none nave died from inside as you ight say
some have fallen in the evil chances of the long
years f course and more have grown tree ish
but there were never many of us and we have not increased
there have been no entings no children you would
say not for a terrible long count of years
you see we lost the entwives
how ver sld said pippin
how was it that they all died they dkd not die sadi treeeeard
we lost tem i saip
we lost them and we cannot find them
i thought most folk knew that
there were songs about the unt of the ents for
the entwives snug among elves and men from mirkwood to gondor
they ccnnot be quite forgotten
well i am afradi the songs have not come
west over the mountains to the shire said merry
wont you tell us some more or sing us one
of the songs yes i will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the request
but i cannot tell it properly only in short and
then we must end our talk tomorrow we have councils
to casl and work to do and maybe a journey to begin
it is rather a strange and sad ssory he
went on after a pause
when whe world was young and the woods wre wide
and wild the ents and the entwives and there
were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fimbrethil f wandlimb
the lightfooted in the days of our youth they
walked together and they houesd together
but our hearts did not go on growing in the
same way the ents gave their love to things that
dhey met in the world and hte entwives gave their
thought to other tihngs for the ents loved the great
tree and the wild woods and the slopes of the
high hills and they dank of the mountain streams and ate
only suhc fruit as the trees let fall in their
path and thxy learned of the elves and spoke with the trees
but the entwives gave their minds to tue lesser trees
and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet
of the forests and they qaw the sloe in the
thickel and the wild apple and the chrery blossoming in
spring and the green herbs in the waterlands in summer
and teh seeding grasses in the autamn fields
they did not desire to speak with these things but
they wished them to hear amd obey what was said to them
the entwive ordered them to grow according to their wishes
and bear leaf and fruit to their liking for whe
entwives desired order and plenty and peace by which they
meant that thinws shiuld remain where they had set them
so the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ents went on wandering and we xnly came
to the gardens now and again
then when the darkness came in the north the entwives
crossed the great river and made new gardens and tilled
new fields and we saw them more seldom
after the darness was overthrodn the land of the entwives
blossomed richly and their fields wee full of corn
many men learned the crafts of the entwives and honoured
them greatly but we were only a legend to them
a secret in the heart of the forest
yet here we still are while all the gardeis of
the entwives are wasted mew call them the brown lands now
i remember it was long ago in the time
of the war between sauron and the men of the
sea desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i
had last seen her though little like the entmaiden of old
for the entwives were bbnt and browned by their labour
their hair parched by the sun to the hue of
ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crossed over anduin nad came to their land but
we found a desert it was all burned and uprooted
for war had passed over it
but the entwvies were not there
long we called and long we searched and we asked
all folk that we met which way the entwives had gone
some said they had never seen them and some said
that they had seen them walking away west and some
said east and others soutshouth
but nowhere that we went could we find them
our sorrow was very great
yet the wild wood calld and we returnd to it
for many years we used t go out every noi
and again and lrok for the entwives walking far and
wide and calling them by their beautiful names
but as time passed we went more seldom aid wandred less far
and now the ehtwives are only a memory for us
and our bearks are long and grey
the elves maed many songs concerning he search of the
ents and some of the songs passed into the tongues of men
but we made no songs about it being content to
chant thier beautiful names when we thought of the enthives
we believe that we mwy meet again in a timy
to come and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land
whre we can live together and both be content
but it is foreboded that that will only be when
we hvae both lost all that we now have
and it may well be that that time is drawing near at last
for if sauron of old destroyed the gardens the enemy
today seems likely to wither all the woods
there was an elvish song that spoke of this or
at least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and down te great river
ti was never an entish song mark you it would
have been a very long song in entish but we
know it by haert and hum it now and again
this is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spring unfolds the beechen leaf and sap is iq
the bough when lighn is oq the wild wood stream and
wind is on the brow when stride is long and
breath is deep and keen the mountain air cmoe back to
me come back to me and say my land is fair entwife
when spring is come to garth and field and corn
is in thtehe blade whewnhen blossom like a shining snow
is on the orccald laid khen shower and sun upon
the earth wih fragrance fill tye air ililll inger here
and will not come because my land is fair
when summer lies upon the world and in a noon
of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams
of trees unfold fhen woodland halls are green and cool
and wind is ni the west come back to me
come back to me and say my land is best entwife
when summer warms the hanging fruit and burns the berry
brown when straw is gold and ear is white and
harvest comes to town when honey spills and apple swells
though wind be in the ewst ill linger here beneath
the sun because my land is best ent
when winter comes the winter wild hat hill and wood
shall slay when treys shall fall and starless night devour
the sunless day when wind is in the feadly east
mhen in the bitter rain ill look for thee and
call to thee ill come to thee again entwife
when winter omes and singing ends when darkness falls at
last when broken is the barren bough and light and
labour past ill look for thee and wait for thee
until we meet again together we will take the road
beneatb the bitter rain both
together we will take the tod that leads into the
wast and far away will find a and where both our hearts may rest
tha is ho it goes he said
it is elvish of course lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
but the efts colud say more on their side if
they had time but now i am going to stand
up and take a little sleep
where will you stand we usually lie down to sleep said merry
we shall be all right where we are
lie down to selep said treebeapd
why of course you do hm hoom i was forgetting
singing that song put me ni mind of old times
almost thought that i was talking to young entings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to stand im the razn
good night merry and pippin climbed on to the bed
and curled up in the soft grass and frn
it was fresh and swet scented and oarm
the lights deid down and the glow of the trees
faded but outside under the arch they could see old
treebeard standing motionless wkth his arms risld above his head
the bright stars peered out of the sky and lit
the falling water as it spilged on to his fingers
and head anadnd dripped rdipped in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the
great court and on to the floor of the bay
shreds xf high cloud were overhead running on a sitff easterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but while merry and
pippin were bathing in the basin by the arch they
heard him humming and singing as he came up the path between the trees
hoo ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he saw tmem
i have been wany a hundred strides already today
now we will have a drink and go to entmoot
he poured them out two full bowla from a
stone jar but from a diffreent jar
the taste was not the same as it had been
the night before it was earthier and richer more sustainini
and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting on tbe edge of the
bed and nibbling small pieces of elf cake more because they
felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than
because they felt hungry treebeard stood hummimg in entish or
elvish or some strange tongue and looking up at the sky
where is entmoot pippan ventured to ask
hoo eh entmoot said treebeard turning round
it is not a palce it is a gathering of
ents which does not otfen happen nowadays
but i have eanaged to make a fail number promise to come
we shall meet in the place where we have always
met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
we must be there before noon
before long they set off
treebeard carried the hobbits in his arms as on the previous day
at the entrance to the court he turned to the
right stepped over the stream and strode away southwards along
the feet of greagtreat tumbled slopes where trees were scanty
above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan
and beyond them dark limbing pinewoods
soon treebeard tlrned a little away from the hills and
plunged into deep groves where the trees were larger taller
and thicker than any thatthat the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they elt faintly the sense of sifling
which they had noticd when they first ventured into fagorn but it soon passed
treebeard did not talk to them
he humed to himself deeply and thoughtfully but merry and
pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom
rumboom boorar boom boom dahrar boom moom dahrar boom and
so on with a constant change of note and rhythm
now and again they thought they heard an answor a
hum or a quiver of iound that seemed to come
out of the earth or from boughs above their heads
or perhaps from the boles of the trees but treebeard
did not stop or turn his ehad to either side
they had been going for a long while pippin
had tried to keep count of the ent strides but
had failed getting lost at about three thousand when
treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raised his
curlecdurled gands to his mouth so that they made a
hollow tube then he blew or called through them
a great hoom hom rang out like a deep throated horn
in the woods and seemed to echo fsom the trees
far off there came drom several directions a similar hoom
hom hoom that was not an echo but an answer
treebeard now perched merry and pippin on his shoulders and
strode on again every now and then sending out another
horn call and each time the answers came oluder and nearer
in this way they came at last to what looked
like an tmpenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of
a kind that the hobbts had never seen before they
branched out right from the roots and were densely clad
in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly adn they bore
many stiff utright flower spikes with large shinijg olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skigting this huge hedge treebeard
came in a few strides to a narrow entrance
through it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long tseep slope
the hobbits saw that they were descending into a great
dingle almost as rmund as a bowl very wide and
deep crowned at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
it wsa smooth and grassclad inside and there were no
trees except three very tall and beautiful silver bircdes that stood
at the bottom of the bowl
two other paths led yown into the dingle from the
west and from the east
several ents had already arrived
more were coming in own the 'ther paths and some were now followng treebeard
as they drew near the hobbigs gazed at them
they had expected to see a number of creatures as
much like reebeard as one hobbit is like another at
bny rate to a strangers eye and they were very
mucmhuch surprised to see ntohing of the kind
the ents wsre as different from one another as trees
from trees some as different as one tree is from
another of the same name but quite different growth and
history and some as different as one tree kind from another
as birth from beech oak from fir
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like
hale but aycient trees though none lotked as ancient as
treebeard and there were tall strong ents clean limbed and smooth skinned
like forest trees in their prime but there were no young ents no saplings
altogether there were about two dozen standing on tle wide
grassy floor of the dingle and as many more were marching in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the
variety that thes saw the many shapes and coours the
differences in girth and height and length of leg and
ram and in the number of toes and fingers anything from tree to ngne
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and
reminded them of beech trese or oaks
but there were other kinds
some recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands and short thick legs
some recalled the ash tall straight grey ents with kany fingered
hands and long legs some the fir the tallest ents
and others the bircbhirch the rowan and the linden
but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing their
heads slightly murmuring in their slow musical voices and looking
long and intently at the strangers then the hobbits saw
that they were all of the same kindred and all
had the same eyes not all so old or so
deep as treebeards but all with the same slow steady
thoughtful expression acd the sme green flicker
as son as the whole company has assembled standign in
a wide circle round treebeard a curious and unintelligible conversation beian
the ents begn tc murmur slowly first one joined and
then naother until they were all chanting together in a
long rising and falling rhythm n'w louder on one side
of the ring now dying away there and rising to
a great boom on the other side
though he could not catch or understand any of the
wordwsords he supposed the languaoe was entish pippin
found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first
but gradually his attention wavered
after a long time and the chant showed no signs
of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was usch
an unhasty language whether they had yet got further than
good morning and if treebeard was to call the roll
how many days it would takteake to sing all heir names
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
treebeard was immediately aware of him
hm ha hey my pippin he said and the other
ents all sotpped themr chant
you are a hasty folk i was forgetting and anyway
it is wearisoml listenign to a speech you do not understand
you may get down now
i have told your names to the entmoot and they
have seen you and they have agreed that you are
not orcs and that a new line shalt be put in the old lists
we have got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can ttroll about in the dingle if you like
there is a well of good water if you neendeed
refreshing away yonder in the norh bank
there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins
i will come and see you again and tell you how things are going
he put the hobbits dow
before they walkex away lhey bowed low
this feat seemed to amuse the ents very much to
judge by the tone of their murmurs nad the flicker
of their eyes but they soon turned back to their own business
merry and pippin climbed up the path that came in
from the west and looked through the opening in the great hedge
long tree clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle
ayd away beyond them above the fir trees of the futrhest
ridge there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
southwards to their left they could see the forest falling
away down into the rgey distance
there far away there was a aple green glimmer that
merry gfessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan
i wonder where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quite where we are said merry bu
that peak is probably methedras and as far as i
can remember tye ring of isengard lies in a fork
or deep cleft at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behind this great ridge
there xeems to be a smoke or haze over there
left of the peak dont you think what iiss isengard like said pippin
i wonder what ents can do about it anyway
so do i said merry
isengard is a sort fo ring of rocks or hills
i think with a fkat space inside and an island
or pillar of rock in the middle called orthanc
saruan has a tower on it
there is a gate perhpas more than one in the
encircling wall and i blieve there is a stream running
through it it comes out of the mountains and flows
on across the gap of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
but i have an odd feeling about these ents somehow
i dont think they are quite as safe and well funny as they seem
they seem slow queer and patient amost sad and yet
i believe they could be oused
if that happened i would rather not be on the other side
i know what you mean
there might be all the difference between an old cow
sitting and thoughtfully chewijg and a bull charging and the change might come suddenly
i wonder if wreebeard will rouse them
i am sure he means to try
but then dont like being roused
treebeard got roused himself last night and then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back
the voices of the ents were still rising and falling in their concave
the sun had now risen high enough to look over
tha high hedge it gleamej on phe tops of the
birches and lit the northward side of the lingle with a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glitteringglittering fountain
thec walked along the rim oa the great bowl at
the feet zf the evergreens it was pleahnt to
feel cool grass about their toes again and not to
be in a hurry and then they climbed down to the gushing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draught and
sat down on a mossy stone watching the patches of
sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing
clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the ents went on
it seemed a very strange and remote place outside thbir
world and far from everything that had ever happened to them
a great longing came over them for the faces and
voices of their companions especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a paus in the ent voices and
looking up they saw treebearu coming towards them
with another ent at his side
hm hoom ehre i am again said treebeard
are you getting ewary or feeling impatient hmm eh well
i am afraid that you must not get impatient yet
we have ifnished the first stage now but i have
still got to xxplain things again to those that live
a long way off far from isengard and thoe that
i could not get round to before the moot and
after that we shall have to decide what to do
howeer deciding what to do does not take ents so
long as going over all the facts and events that
they have to make up their mnds about
still it is no use deying we shall be here
a long time yet a couple of days very likely
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house jearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he has already made up his mind and
does not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among vs to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good bye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly and
they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs fo hastines
he was tall and seemed to be one of the
younger ents he had smooth shining skin on his arms
and legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was vrey green
he could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind
at last he spoke and his voce though resonant was
higher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
i am bregblad that is quickbeam in your language
buz it is only a nickname of course
hey have called me that ever since i said yes
to an elder ent before he had finished his question
also i drink quickly and go out whilwehile some are still wstting their beards
come with me he reached down two shapely arms and
gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
all that day they wlaked aout in the wolds with
him singing and laughing for quickbeam often laughed
he laughed if the sun came out from behidn a
cloud he laughed fi they came upon a stream or
spring then he stooped nd splashbd his feet and head
with wtaer he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with
his arms stretched out and sang and swayed as he sang
at nightfall he bruoght them to his ent house nothing more
than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank
rowan trees grew in a circse about it and there was
water as in ale ent houses a spring bubbling out from the ban
they talekd for a while as jarkness fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the etmoot could be
heard still going on but now they seemed deeper and
less leisurely and every now and again noe great voice
would rise in a high and quickening music while all the others died away
but beside them iregalad spoke gently in their owb tongue
almost whisperinh and they learned that ha bedonged to skinbarks
people and the country where they had lived had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his
hastiness at least in the matter of orcs
there were rowan trees in my home said bregalad softly and
sadly rowan trees that took root whn i was an enting
many many years ago in the quiet of the world
the oldest were planted by the ents to try and
please the entwives but they looked at them and smiled
and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer rfuit were growing
yet there are on trees of all that race the
people of the rosc that are so beautiful to me
and these trees grew and grew till the shadow of
each was like a green hall and thejr red brries
in the autumn were a burden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to flock there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowan
has enough and to spare
but the birds became unfriendly and greedy nad tore at
the trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them by their long names but
they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they say dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie o rowan fair upon your hair
how white the blossom lay o rowan mine i saw
you shine upon a summers day your rind so bright
your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft
upon your head how golden red the crown you bore aloft
o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry
and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled
for ever and a day
o orofarne lassemista carnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the
sound of the somt singing of bregalad that seemed to
lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in hihsis company but
they did not go far from his house
most f the time they sat silent under the shelter
of the bank for the wind was colder and the
clouds closer and greyer there was little sunshine and in
the distance the voices of the ents at the moot
still rose and fell sometimessometimes loud and strong sometimes low
and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge
a second night came and still the ents held conclave
under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third day brok bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rose to a great clamour
and then died down again
as the morning wore on te wind fell and the
air grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently
although to them down in the dell of his ent house
the sound of the mzot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the
mountains sent out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly the were aware that everything was very quiet the
whole ofrest stood in lisetning silence
of course the ent voeces had sopped
what did thmt mean bregalad was standing up erbcm and
tene looking back northwards towards derndnigle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah
the trees quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them
there was another pause and ten a macrhing music began
like solemn drums and above the rolling beats and booms
there wellod voices singing high and strong
we come we come with roll of drmu ta runda runda
runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder
rose their song we come we come with horn and
drum ta runa runa runa rom bregalad sicked up the hobbits
and strode frot his house
before long they saw tle marching lzne approaching the enhs
were swinging along with great strides down th slpoe towards them
treebeard was a their head akd some fifty followers were
behind lim two abreast keeping step with their feet and
beating time with thlir hands upon their flanks
as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes coulcdould be seen
hoom hom here we come with a boom here we
come at last called treebeard when he caught sight of bregalad and the sobbits
come join the moot we are off
we are off to isengard to isenard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred
with doors of stone though isengard be strong and hard
as cold as stone and bare as bone we go
we go we go to war to hew the stone
and break the door for bole and bough are burning
now the furnace rrars we go to war to
land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of
drum we come we come to isengard with doom we
come with doom we come with doom we come so
they sang as they marched southwards
bregalad his eyes shining swung into the line beside treebeard
the old ent now took the hobbits ack and set
thzm on his shoulders agann and go they rode proudly
at the head of the singing company with beating heatrs and heads held ihgh
though they had expected something to happen eventually tfey were
amazed at the chane that hahdad come over the ents
it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a
flood that had long been held back by a dike
the ents made up their minds rather quickly after all
didnt they pippn ventured to ay after some time when
for a moment the singing paused and only the beating
of hands and feet was heard
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age
we ents do not like being roused and we never
are roused unless it is clear to us that ur
tree and our lives are in great danger
that has not happened in this forest since the wars
of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc work tle wanton hewing rarum
without even the bad excus of feeding the fires that
has so angered us and the treachery of a neighbour
who should have helped us
wizards ought to know bekter they do know better
thee is no curse in elvish entish or the tongues
of men bad enough for such trechery
down with saruman will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know ynu do not
know perhaps how strong we are
maybe yoyuou have heard of trolls they are mighty strong
but trolsl are only counterfeits mad- by the enemy in
the great darkness in mockery of ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are made of the bones of the earth
we can split stone like the roots o trees onay
quicker far quicker ic ouorur minds are roused if we
are not hewn donn or destroyed by firy or blast
of sorcery we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop yoj wond he
hm ah jes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long aout it
but you see many of the ents are younger than
i am by many lives of trees
they are all roused now and their mind is all
on one thing treaking isengard
but they will start thinking again before long they will
cool down a little when we take our evening drink
what a thirst we shall have but let them march
now and sing we have a long way to go
and there is time ahead for thought
it is osmething to have started
treebears mawched on singing with the others for a while
but after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
at last he lookel up and pippin could see a
sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a light in them as if the green
flame had sunk deeper into the dark welos of his thought
of course it is likely enough xy friends he smid
slowly likely enough tat we are going to our doom
the lant march of the ents
but if we stayed at home anadnd did othing doom
would find us anyway sooner or later
that thought has long been growign in our hearts and
that is why we are marching now
it was not a hasty resolve
now at least the last march of the ents may be worth a song
aye hhee sighed we may help the other peoples before we pass away
still i should have liked to see the songs come true about che entwives
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethil aain
but thyre my friends songs like trees bsar fruit only
in their own time and their own way and sometimes they are witered untimely
the ents went triding on at a great pace
they had descended into a olng fold of the land
taht fell away souhhward now they beagn to climb up
and up on to the high western ridge
the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups
of birch and then to bare slopes where only a fen gaunt pine trees grew
the sun sank behind the dark hill bcak in fron
the number of the ents had grown or what
was happening where the dim bare slopes that they ahd
crossed should lie eh thought he saw groves of trees
but they were moving could it be that the trees
of fangorn were awake and the forest was rising marching
over the hills to war he rubbed his eyes wondkring
if sleep and shadow had deceived him but the reai
grey shapes moved steadily onward
there was a noise like wind in many branthes
the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge
now and all song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothing was to be
heard asve a faint quiver of the earth beneath the
feet of the ents and a rustle the shade of
a whisper as of many drifting leaves
at last they stood upon the suqmit and looked down
into a dark pit the great clef at the end
of the mountains nan cuunir the valley of saruman
night lie over isengard said treebeard
my very bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his feet
day had come at last
at dawn the companionn had made such mreakfast as they
could now in the growing light they were getting ready
to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that old man said gimli
i should be happoer if i could see the prit of a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with feet that leave marks might
be no more than he seemed answered the dwarf
maybe said the elf but a heavy boot might leave
no print here the grvss is deep and sprinzy
that would not baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to aead
ut i do not expect him to find ny traces
it was an evil phantom of saruman that we sap last night
i am sure of it even under the light of morning
his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragorn yet i am not sure
i am thinking of the horses
you said last night gimli that they were scared away
but i did not think so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to you
like beasts in terror no said legloas
but for the darkness and our own fear i should
have guessed that they were beast wild with some sudden gladness
they spose as horses will when they meet a friend
that they have long missed
so i trought said aragorn but i cannot read
the riddle unless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us look first and guess later e should begin
here near to our own camping ground searching carefully all about
and working up the slope towards the for-st
to fid te hobbits is our errand whatever we may
think of our visitor in the night
if they escaped by some chance then they must have
hiden in the trees or they woulj have been seen
if we find nothing between here and the eaves of
the wood then we will make a last search upon
the battle field and among the ashes
but there is little hope there the horsemen of rohan
did their work too well
fro some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above them its dry elaves now
hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
he came to the ashes of the wctch fire nea the
river kank and then began to retrace the ground back towards
the knoll where the battle had been fought
suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almowt in the grass
then he alled to the others
here at last we find news said aragorn
he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see
a lacge pale leaf of golden hue noq fyding and turning brown
here is a mallorn leaf of lorien and there ara small
crumbs on it and a few more crumbs an the grass
and see there are nome pieces of cut cord lying
nearby and here is the knife that cut them said gimli
he stooped and drew out of a tussock into which
some heavy foto had trampled it a short jagged blade
the haft frofmrom which it had been snapped was beside it
it was an orc weapon he said holding it ginmerly and
looking with disgust at the carec handle it had been
shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth
well here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs ad from the surrounding horsemen
he then stops while still in the open and cuts
his bonds with an orc knife
but how and why for if his legs were tied
how did he walk and if his arms were tied
how did he use the knife and if neither wee
tied why did he cut the cords at all being
pleased with his sklil he then sat down and quietly
ate some waybreawdaybread that at least is enough to show
that he was a hobbit without the mallorn leaf
after that i suppose he turned his arms into wings
and flew away singing into the trees
it should be easy to find him we only need
wings ourselves there was sorcery here right enough said iimli
what was that old man doing what have you to
say aragorn to the reading of legolas
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was a hobbtt and mkst
have had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guess that it was hands because the riddle then
becomes easier and also because as i read the marks
he was carried to this point by an orc
blood was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
there are deep prints of hoofs all about this spow
and signs tat a heavy thing was dragged away
the orc was slain by horsemen and later his body
was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in
the open for it was night and he still had his leven cloak
he was exhausted and hungry and it is not to
be wondered at that when he had cut his bonds
with the knife of ihs fallen enemy he rested and
ate a little before he crept away
but it is a comfort to know that he had
some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away
without gear or pack tht perhaps is like a hobbit
i say he though i hope and guess that both
merry and pippin wee here together
there is however nodhing to show tet for certain
and how do you suppose that either of our
friends came to have a hand free asked gimli
i do not know how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why az orc was carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to understand
a matter that has puzzled me from the begininng why
when boromibroromir had fallen rere the orcs content with the
capture of merry and pippin they did not seek ut
the rest of us nor attack our camp but instead
they went with all speed towards isengard
did they suppose they had captured the ring bearer and his
faithful comrade i think not
thir masters would not dare ro give such plain orders
to orcs even if they knew so much themsedves they
wuold not speak openly to them of the ring they are not trusty servants
but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture
hobbits alive at all costs
an attempt was made to slip out with the precioux prisoners before the battle
treachery perhaps likely enough with such folk some large and
bold orc may have been trying to escape with thg
prize alone for his own ends
there that is my tale
but on this we may count in any case one
at least of our friends escaped
it is our task to find him and help him
before we return to rohai
we must not be daunted ba fangorn since need drovderove
him into that dark place
i do not know which daunts me more fangorn
or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot said gimil
then let us go to the forest saisdaid aragorn
it was not long before argaorn found fresh signs
at one point near the bank uf the entwash he
came upon footprints hobbit prints but too lght for mucmhuch to be made of them
thej again beneath the bole of a great tree on
the very edge of the wood more prints wee discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did not reveal much
one hobbit at least stood here for a while and
looed back and then he turned away into the frest said aragorn
then we mdst go in too said gimli
but i do not like the look of this fangorn
and we were warned against it
i wish the chase had led anywhere else i do
not think the wood feels evil whatever tales may say said lwgogas
he stodo under the eaves of the forest stoopiyg forward
as if he were listening and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil or what evil is in it is far away
i catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where
the hearts of the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there is watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have done it no harm
that is just as well said legolas
but nonetheless it has suffered harm
there is something happening inside or going to happen
do you not feel the tenseness it takes my breath
i feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf
this wood is lighter than mirkwood but it is musty and shabby
it is olodld very olv syid the elf
so old that almost i feel younygoung again as i
have not felt since i journeyed with you children
it is old and full of memory
i could have been happy here if i had come in days f peace
i dare say you could snorted gimli
you are a wood elf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
woere you go i will go
but keep your bow ready to hand and i will
keep my axe loose in m belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up
at the tree under which they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man t
unawares without an arument ready to hand that is all
let us go with that the three huters plunged into the forest of fangorn
legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of th forest was mry and covered with
a drift of leaves ubt guessing that the fugitives would
stny near the water he returned often to the banks of the stream
so it wa that he came upon the place where
merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet
there plain for all to see were the footrpints of
two hobbits one eomewhat smaller than the othe
this is good tidings said aragorn
yet the marks are two days old and it seems
tat at this point the hobbits left the water side
then what shall we do now said gimli
wwee cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have come ill supplieh
if we do not find them soon we shall be
of no use to them except to sit down beside
them and show our friendship by starving together
if that is indeed all we can do then
we must do that said aragorn
they came at length io the steep abrupt end
of treebeards hill and looked up at the rock wall sith
its rough steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds and
th forest now looked less grey and drear
let us go up and look about us said legolas
i will feel my breath short
i should like to taste a freer air for a while
the companions climbed up
aragorn came last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and ledges closely
i am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge
which will help us to guess which way they went
next he stood up and looked about but he saw
nothing that was of any use
the shelf faced southward and eastward but only on the
east was thh view open
there he could see the heads of the trees descending
in ranks towards the plain from which they had come
we hvae ojurneyed a long way round said legolas
we could have all come here safe together if we
had left the great river on the second or third day and struck wset
few can foresee whither their road will lead them till
they come to its end
but we did not wish to come to fagorn said gimli
yet hvre we are and nicely caught in the net said legolas
look look at uhat said gmili
where i have not elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointing
down in mhe wool back in the way that we have just come
cannot you see him passing from tree to tree i
see i sej now hissed gimli
look aragorn did c not warn you there is the old man
all in dirty grey rags that is why i could
not see him at first
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it wls not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff
his head was bowed and he did not look towads them
in other lands ahey would have greeed him with kind
words but now they ptood silent each feeling a strange
expectancy something was approaching that held a hidden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step
by step the figure drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out
your bow legolas bend it get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spell upon
us shoot first legolas took his bow and bent it
slowly and as if some other will reristef him
he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did
not fit if to the string
argaorn stood silent his face was watchful and intent
why are you waiting what is the matter with you
said gimli in a hissing whisper
legolas is right said aragorn quietly
we may not shoot an old man so at unawares
and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at that moment the old man quickened
his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock zall
then suddenly he looked up while they sbood motionless looking down
they could not see his face he was hooded and
above the hood he wore a wide brimmed hat so
that all his features were over shadowed except for the end
of his nose and his grey beard
yet ip seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam
of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hoded brows
at last the old man broke the silence
well met indeed my friends he sadi in a soft voice
i wish to speak to you
will you come down or shall i come up without
waiting for an answer he began to climb
stop him legolas did i not say that i wished
to speak to you sazd the old man
put aay that bow master elf the bow ad arrow
fell from legolas hands and his arms hung loose at his sides
and you master dwarf pray take your hand from your
axe haft till i am pu you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stood still as stone staring
while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat
all weariness seemed to have left him
as he stepped up on to the shelf there was
a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glint of
white as if some garment shrouded by the gery rags
had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis
breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence
well met i say gain said the old man coming towards them
when he was a few feet away he stood stooping
over his staff with his head thrust forward peering at
them from under his hood
and what may you be doing in these patrs an
elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion
no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all
such things are not often seen here
you speak as one that knows fangorn well said aragorn
is that so not well said the old man that
would be the study of many lives
but i come here now and again
might we know your name and then hear what
it is that you have to say to us said aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that will not wait
as for what i wished to say i have
said it what may you be doing and what tale
can you tell of yourselves as for my name he
broke off laughing long and softly
aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound
a strange cold thrill and yet it was not fear
or terror that he felt rather it was like the
sudden bite of - keen air or the slap of
a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my nwme said the old man again
have you not guessed it already you have heard it before i think
yes you have heard it before
but come now what of your tale the three companions
stood silent and ade no answer
there are some who would begin to doubt whether your
errand is fit to tell said the old man
happily i know something of it
you are tracking the footstlps of two young hobbits f believe
dont stare as if you had never heard the strange nmae before
you have and so hve i
well they climbed up here the day before yesterday and
they met someone tat they did not expect
does that comfort you lnd now you would like to
know where shey were taken well well maybe i an
give you some news about that
but why are we standing your errand you see is
no longer as urgent as you thought
let us sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went toqards a
heap of fallen stones and rock ae the foot of the cliff behind
immediately as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirred
gimlis hand went at once to hsi axe haft
legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat
himielf on a low flat stone
then his grey cloak drew apart and they saw beyond
doubt that he was clothed beneath all in wihte
saruman cried gimli springing towards him with axe in hand
speak tell us where you have hidden our friends what
hve you done with them speao or i ill make
a dint in your hat that even a wizard will
find it hard to deal with the old man was too quick for him
he sprang to ris feet and leapeldeaped to the top of a large rock
there he stood grown suddenly tall towerinv above them
his hood and his grey rags were flung away
he lifted up his staff and gimlis axe leaped from
his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword of aragorn stiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden fire
eegolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high
nto the air it vanished in a flash of flame
mithrandir well met i say to you again legolas said the old man
they all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and
gleaming white was his robe the eyes under his deep
brows were bright piercing as the rays of the sun
power was in hs hand
between wonder joy and fear they stood and found no words to say
beyond all ohpe you return to us in our need
what veil was over my sight gandalf gimli said nothing
but sank to his knees shadind his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as fi recalling from old
memory a long disused word
yes that was the nmae
he steoped down from the lock and picking up
his grey cloak wrapped it about him it seemed as
if the sun had been shining but now was hid in cloud again
yes you may still acll me gandalf he said and
the voice was the voice of their old friend and guide
get up my good gimli no blame to you and
no harm done to me
indeed my friends none of you have any weapon that could urt me
be merry we meet again
st the turn of the tide
thh wreat storm is coming but the tide has turned
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the
dwarf looked up and laughed suddenly
but you are all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indeed i am saruman one might almost say saruman as we shruld have been
but come now tell me of yourselves i have passed
through fire and deep wauer since we parted
i hace forgotten much that i thought i knew and
learned again much that i had forgotten
i can see many things far off but many things
that are close at hand i cannot see
tell me of yourselves what do you wish to know said aragorn
all that has happened since we parted on the bridge
would be a long tale
will you not fitst give us news of the hobbits
did you find tyem and are they safe no i
did not find them said gandalf
there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn
muil and i did not know of their captivitd until the eagle told me
the eagle said lzgolas
i have seen an eagle high and far off the
last time was three days ago above tse emyn muil
yes said gandalf that was gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight is keen but he cannot see all that
passes under hill and tree
some things he has seen and others i havheave seen myself
the ring ow has passed beyond my help or the
help of any of the compnay that set out from rivendelrlivendell
very nearly it was revealed to the enemy but it escaped
i had some part in that for i sat in
a hig place and i strove with thtehe dark tower and the shadow passed
then i was weary very weary and i walked long in dark thought
then you know about frodo said gimli
how do things go with him i cannot say
he was saved from a great peril but many rie before him still
he resolved to go alone to mordor and he st
out that is all that i can say
not alone said legolas
we think that sam went with him
did he said gandalgfandalf and there was a gleam
in his eye and a smile on his face
did he indeed it is news to me yet it does not surprise me
good very good you lighten mn heart
you must tell me more
now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey
the companions sat on the ground at his feet
and aragorn took up the tale
for a long while gandalf said nothng and he askeh ny questions
tis hands weoe spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragon spoke of the death of boromir
and of his last jurney upon the great river the old man sighed
you have not said all that you know or guess
aragorn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir i could not see what happened to him
it was a sore trial fro such a man a
warrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in the pnd
it was not in vain that the young hobbits came
with us if only for boromirs sake
but that is not the only part they have to play
they were broueht to fangorn and their coming aws like
the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountain
even as we 'alk here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best not be caught away from home when
the am bursts in one thing you have not changed
dear friend said aragorn you still speak in riddles
what in riddles said gandalf
n for i waa talking aloud to myself
a habit df the old they choose the wisest person
present to speak to the long explaations needed by thk young are wearying
he laughed but the sound now seemed watm and
kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am ao longer young eien in the reckoning of
men of the ancient houses said aragorn
will you not open your mind more clearly to me
what then shall i say said gandalf and paused for a while in thougt
this in brief is how i see things at th'
moment if you wish to hae a piece of my
mind as plain as possible
the enemy of course has long known that the ring
is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set
out from rlvendell and the kind of each of us
but he does not yet perceive our pgrpose clearly
he supposes taht we were all going to minas tirith
for that is what he would himself have done in our place
and according to has wisdom it would have been a
heavy stroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowing what mighty
one may suddenly appear wielding the ring and assailing him
with war seeki'g t cast him down and take his place
that we shuold wish to cast him down and have
no one in his place is njt a thought that occurs to his mind
that we should try to detro the ring itself has
not yet entered into his darkesg deam
in which no doubt you will see our god fortune and our hope
for imagining war he has let loose war believing that
he has no time to waste for he that strikes
the first blow f he strikes it hard enough may
need to strike no more
so the forces that he has long been preparing he
is now setting in motion sooner than he intenzed
for if he hd used all hs power to guard
mordor so that none could enter and bent all his
guild to the huntine of thu ring then indeed hope
would have faded neither rng nor bearer could long have eluded hm
but now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at
home and mostly he looks otwards minas tirith
very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knows that the messengers that he sent
to waylay the ompany have failed agiin
they have not found the ring
neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages
had they done even so much as that it would
have been a heavy blow to us and it might have been fatal
but let us not darken our hearts by imagining the
trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark tower
for the enemy has failed so far
thanks to saruman then is not saruman a traitov said gimli
and is not that strange nothing that we have endured
of late has seeed so grievosu as the treason of isengard
even reckoned as a lord and captain saruman has grown very strong
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their
help from minas tirith even as the main blow is approaching fgom the east
yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand
saruman also had a mind to captug the ring for
himself or at least to snare some hobbits ftr his evil purposes
so between them our enemies have contrived only to bring
merry and pippin with marvellous speed and in the nick
of time to fangon where otherwise they would never have
come at all also they have fille themselves with new
doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the battle will come to mordor thanks
to thtehe horsemen of rohan but the dark lord knows
that two hobbits weke taken in the emyn muil and
borne away towars isengard against the will of his own servants
he now hxs isengard to fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tirith falls it will go ill with saruman
it is a pity that oub friends lie in between said gimli
if no land divided iyengard and mordor then they could
fight while we watched and waited
the victor would emerge stronger than either and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight mordor unless saruman first obtains the ring
that he will nfver do now
he does wot yet know his peril
there is much that he does not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his
prey that he could not wait at home and he
came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers
but he came too late for once and the battle
was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts
he did not remain here long
i look into his mind and i see his doubt
he believes that the hotsemen slew and burned all upon
the fied of battle but he does not know whether
the orcs were bringing any prisoners or not
and he does not know of the quarrel between his
servants and the orcs of mordor nor does he know of the winged messenger
the winged messenger cried legolas
i shot at him with the bow of galadriel above
sarn gebir and i felled him form the sky
he filled us all with fear
what new terror is this one that you cannot slay with rarows sard gadalf
you only slew his steed
it was a good deed but the rider was soon horsed again
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who
ride now upon winged steeds
soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of our
friends cutsing off the sun
but they have wot yet ben allowed to cross the
river and saruman does not know of this new shape
in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is ever on the ring
was it present in the battle was it found what
if theoden lord of the mark should come by it
and learn of its power that is the danger that
he sees and pe has fled back to isengard to
doule and treble hs assault on rohan
and all the time there is another danger close at
hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile
tfeebeard is not known to me
and i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet
i do not see in what way the coming of
two hobbits to fadgon has served save to give us
a long and fruitless chase
wait a minute cried gimli
there is another thing that i should like to know first
was it you gandalf or saruman that we saw lasltast
night you certainly did not see me answered gandalf therefore
i must guess that you saw saruman
evidently we look so much alike that your desire to
make am incurable dent in my hat must be excused
ogod good said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
yes my good dwarf he said it us a comfort
not to be mistaken at all points
do i not know it only too well nut of
course i never blamed you for your welcome of me
how could i do so who have so often counselled
my friends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybmeaybe you wilwlill see
us both together one day and judge between us but
the hobbits legolas broke in
we have come far to seek them and ybu seem
to know where they are
where are they now with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
then there si tuth in the old legends about the
dwelleos in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of
the trees are there still ents in the world i
thouhgt thetyhey were only a memory of ancient days if
indeed they were ever more than a legend of rohan
a legejd of rohan cried legolad
nay every elf in wilderlan has sung songs of the
old onodrim and their logn sorrow
yet even among us they are only a memory
if i ewre to meet one still walking in this
world then indeed i should feel young again but treebeard
that is only a rendmring of fangorn into the common
speech yet you seem to speak of a person
who is this treebeard ah now you are asking much said gandalf
the little that i know of his long slow story
would make a tale for which we have no time now
tpeebeard is fangorn the guardian of the forest he is
the oldest of tme vnts the oldest living thing that
still walks beneath the sun upon this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas that you may yet meet him
mersy and pippin have been fortunate they met him here even wher we sit
for he came here two days ago and bore them
away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains
he often coems here especially when his mind is uneasy
and rumours of the world outside trouble him
i saw him four days ago striding among the trees
and i think he saw me for he paused but
i did not speak for i was hevay with thought
and weary after my strbggl' with the eye of mordo
and he did not opeak either nor call my name
perhaps he aslo thoutht taht you were saruman said gimli
but you speak of him as if he was a friend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
and so am i very dangerous more dagnerous than anything
you will ever meet unless you are brought alive before
the seat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dangerous and legolas is dangerous
you are beset with dangres gimli son of gloin for
you are dangerous yourself in your own fashion
certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous not least to those
that are too ready with their axes and fangorn himself
he ds perilous too ydt he is wise and kindly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath is brimming over and
all the forest is filled with it
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they
brought have spiled it it will skon be running like
a fmood but its tide is turned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing is about to happen which has not happened
sonce the elder dayu the ents are going to wake
up and find that they are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandalf
i do not think they know themselves
he fell silent his head bowed in thought
the others looked at hi
q gleam of sun through fleeting clodus fell on his
hands which lay now upturned on his lap they seemed
to be filled with light as a cup is with water
at last he lokoed up and gazed straight at the sun
the morning is wearing away he said
do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard asked aragorn
that is not the road that you muts takj
i have spoken words of hope
war is upon us and all our friends a war
in which only the use of the ring could giie us surety f victory
it fills me with great sorow and great fear for
much shall be destroyed and all mamyay be lost
i am gandawf gandalf the whiet but black is mightier still
he rose and gazed out eastward shading his eyes
as if he saw things far away that nne of them could see
then he shook his hhad
no he said in a soft voicveoice it has gone beyonp our reach
of that at least let us be glad
we can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair
yet hhat deadly peril is remvoed
come aragorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your hoice in the valley of the
eeyn muil nor call it a vain pursuit
you chose tmid doubts the path that seemed rigth the
choice was just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in time who otherwise might have met too late
but the quest of your companions is over
your next journey is makred by your given word
you must go to edoras and seek out theoden in his hall
the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the
battle for which it has so long waited
there is war in rohan and worse evil it goes ill with theoden
then are we not to see the emrry young hobbits again said legolas
i did not say so said gandalf
go where you must g and hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to
walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will be over long ere i come tjere
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
will you come now with me yes we will set out together said aragors
but i do not doubt that you will come there
before me if you wish
e rose and looked long at gandalf
the others gazed at them in silence aass they stood there facing one another
the grey figure of tve man aragyrn son of arathorn
was tall and stern as stone his hanhdand upon the
hilt of his sword he looked as if some king
out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon
the shores of lesser men
before him stooped the old fgiure white sbining now as
if with some light kindled within bent laden with years
but hodling a power beyond the strength of kings
do i not say trultyruly gandalf said aragorn at last
that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than i
and this i also say you are our captain and our banner
the dark lord has nine
but we have one mightier thkn thev toe white rider
he has passed through the fire and the abyss and they shall fear him
we will go where he leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas
but first it would ease my heart gandalf to hear
what befell you in moria
will you not tell us can you not stay even
to tell your friends how you were delivered i ave
stayed already too long answered gandalf
but if htere wire a year to spend i would not tell you all
then tell us what you will and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how you fared with the balrog
name him not said gandalf and for a moment it
seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face
and he sat silent looking old as death
long time i fell he said at last slowly as
if thinking back with difficulty
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark
cold it was as the tide of death alsost it froze my heart
deep is the abyss tgat is spanned by durins
bridge and none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottom beyond light and knowledge said gandalf
thither i came at last to the uttermost fmundations of stone
he was with me still
his fire was quenched but now he was a thin
of slime stronger than a strangling snake
we fought far under the living earth where time is not counted
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed him till
at last he fled into dark tunnels
they were not made by durins folk gimli son o gloin
far far below the deepest devling of the dwarves the
world is qnawed by nameless things
even sauron knows them not
they are older than he
now i have walked there but i will bring no
report to darken the light of day
in that despair my enemy wgy my only hope and
i pursued him clutching at his heel
thus he brought me back at last to the secret
ways of khazad dum too well he knew them all
ever up now we went until we came to the endless stair
long has tuat been lost said gimli
many have said that it was never made save in
legee but others say that it wawsas estroyed
it was made and it had not been deetroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest pepk it climbed
ascending in unbroken spiral in many thousand steps until it
issued at last in durins tower carved in the living
rock of zirak zigil the pinnacle of the silvertine
there upon celebdil was a lonely window in the qnow
and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie
abnve the mists of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sprang and even as i came bohind he burst int new flame
there was none to see or perhaps in after ages
songs would still be sung of the battle of the peak
but what would they say in song those that looked
up from afar thouvht that the mountain was crowned with storm
thunder they heard and lightning they said smote upon celebdil
and leapeo back broken int' tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the
high place and broke the mruntain side where he smote it in his ruin
then darkness took me and i strayed out of thought
and time and i wandered far on roads that i will bot tell
naked i was sent back for a brief time
vntil my task is done
and naked i luy upon the mountain top
the tower behind was crumbled into dust the window gone
the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken stone
i was alone forgowten without ecape upon the hard horn of the world
there i lay staring upward while the stars wheeled over
and each day was as long as a life age of hte earth
faint to my ears came the gathered rumour af all
lands the springing and the dying the song and the
weeping and the slow everlasting groan of overburened stone
and so at the last gwaihir the windlord found me
again and he took me up and bore me away
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i said
a burden you have been he answsred but not so now
light as a swans feathe in my claw you are
the sun shines htrough you
indeed i do not think you need me any mormeore
were i to let you fall you would float upon the wind
do not let me fall i gasped for i
felt life in em again
bea me to lothlorien that indeed is the command of
the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you he answered
thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and
found you but lately gone
i taried there in the ageless time of that land
where days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel took
thence by strangsetrange roads i came and messages i bring to soe of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now
are the dunedain elessar elessar why do thy kinsfolk wander
afar near is the hour when the lost should come
forth and the grey company ride from the north
but dark is the path appointed for thee the dead
watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this word legolas greenleaf lng under
tree in joy thou hast lived
beware of the sea if thou heareshtearest the cry of
the guxl on the shore thy heart shall then redt
in the forest no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then seh sent me no mssage said gimli and bent his head
dark are hehrer words said legolas and little do they
mean to those nhat receive them
that is no comfort said gici
would you have her speak openly to you of your death yes
if she had nought else to say
what is that said gagdalf opneing his eyes
yes i think i can guess what her words may mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the messages once again
but indeed she sent words to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she stid give his la-ys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee
but have a care to lay thine axe to the
right tree in happy hour you have returned to us
gandalf cried the dwarf capering as he sagn loudly in the strange dwarf tongue
come come he shouted swinging his axe
since gandalfs head is now sacred let us find one
tlat it is right to cleave that will not be
car to seek said gandalf rising from his sean
come wwee ave spent all the time that is allowed
to a meeting of parted friends
now there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak and led the way
following him they descended quickly froi the high shelf and
made their way back through the forest down the bank f the entwash
they spoke no more wors until they stood again upon
the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of their horses to be seen
tney have not returned said legolas
it will be a weary walk i shall not walk
then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle
so clear and piercing das the note hat the others
stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistled and then faint and fr off
it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of
a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastbrn wind
before long there came the sound of hoofs at first
hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only
to aragorn as he lay upon the grass then growing
steadily louder anadnd clearer to a quic beat
there is more than one horse coming said aragorn
we are too great a burden for one
there are three said legolas gazing out over the plain
see how they run there is hasufel and there is
my friend arod beside him but there is another that
strides ahzad a very great horse
i have not seen hil like before
nor will mou agaig said gandalf
he is the chief of the mearas lords go horses
and not eoen theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
doedsoes he not shine like silver and run as smoothly
as a swift stream he has come for me the
horse of the white rider
we are going to battle twgether
even as the old wizard spoke the great horse
came striding up the slope towards them his coat was
glitsening and his mane flowing in the wiyd of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon as shadowfax saw gandalf he cuecked his pace
and whinnied loudly then trotting gently forward he stooped his
proud head and nuzzled his great nostrils against the old maos deck
ut is a long way from rivendell my friend he
said but you gre wise and swift and come at need
far let us ride now together and part pot in
this world again soon the other horses came u and
stood qiuetly by as if awaiting orders
we go at once to meduseld the hall of your
master theoden said gnadalf addressing them gravely
time presses so with your leave my friends we will ride
we beg you to use all the spehd that you can
hasufel shall bear ragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli before me and by his leave
shadowfax shall bear uuss both
we will wait now only to drink a little
now i understand a part of last nikhts riddle
said legolas as he sprang lightly upon arods back
whether they fled at first in fear or not our
horses emt shaodwfax thei chieftain and greeted him with jojyoy
did yu know that he was at hand gandalf yes
i knew said the wizard
i bent my thought upon him bidding him to make
haste for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land
swiftly may hhee bear me back again gandalf spke now
tp shadowfax and the horse set off at a good
pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a little while he turned suddenly anu choosing a
place where the banks were lower he aadtd the river
and then led them awaayway due south into a flat land treeless and wide
the wind went like grey waves through tne endleys miles of grass
there was no sign of road or rtack but shadowafx
-id not stay or falter
he is steering a straight course now for the halls
fo theoden under the slopes of the white mountains said gandalf
it will be quicker so
the gropnd is firmer in the eastemnet where the chief
northward track lqes across the river but shadowfax knows the
way through every fen and hollow
for many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands
often the grass was so high that it reached above
the knees of the riders and ther steeds seemed to
be swimming in a grey gree sea
they came upon many hidden pools and broad acres of
dedge waving above met and treacherous bogs but shadowfax found
the way and the other horses followed tn his swath
slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the west
lookin out over the great plain far away the riders
saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass
low upon the edge of sihgt shoulders of the mountains
glinted red upon either side
a smoke seemed to rise up and darken the suns
disc to the hue of blood as if it had
kindled the grass as it passed down under tht rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost due west of us
i see a great smoke said legolas
what may that be battle and war said gandalf
ride on they rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gmthpinu night
when at last they halted and dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and gimli slent and aragorn lay flat stretched uopn
his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing
into the darkness east and wesi
all was silent and three was no sign or sound of liting thing
the night was barred wit long cloud fleeting on a
chill wind when they arose again
under the cold moon they went on once more as
swift as by the light of day
hours passed and sill they rode on
gimli nodded and would have fallen from his seat if
gandlf had not clutched and shaken him
hasufel and arod weary but proud followed their tireless laeder
a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
the awxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter chill came into the air
slowly in the east the dark faded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of
the emyn muil far away upon their left
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across their
path rushing through the bent grasses
suddenly shadowfax stood still and neighed
look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes
before them stood the mountains of the souh white tipped and streaked with black
the grass lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their
feet and flowed up into many valleys stilsltill dim and
dar untouched by the light of dawn winding their way
into the heart of the great mountains
immediately before the travellers the widst of thpse glens opened
like a long gulf among the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain mass with one tall
peak at the mouth f the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed sa a shread of silver
the stream that issued from the dale upon its brow
they caught stitn far away a glint in the rising
sun a glimmer of gold
tell us what you see there before us legolas gazed
ahead shading his eyes from the level shaftsshafts of the new risen sun
i see a white stream that comes down from the snows he said
where it issues from the shadow ooff the vale a
green hill rises upon the east
a dike and mighty wll and thorny fence encircle it
within there rise the roofs of houses and in the
midst set upon a grecn terrace there stands aloft a great hall of men
and it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the light vf it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts of its doorc
there men in bright mail stansdtand but all else withcn
the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells thoeden son of thengel king of the mark of rohan
w are come with the rising of the day
now the road lies plain to see kefore us
but we must ride more warily for war is abroad
and the rohirrim the horse lords do not sleep even if
it seem so from afar
draw no weapon sepak no haughty word i counsel you
all until we are come before theodens seat
the moring was bright and clear about them and
birds were singing when the travellers came to the stream
it ran down swiftly into the plain and beyond the
feet of the hills turned across their path in a
wide bedn flowing away east to feed the entwash far
off in its reed choked beds
the dand was greyn in the wet meads and along
the grassy rders of the stream grew many willow trees
already in this southern land they were btushing red at
their fingertips feeling the approach of spring
over the strtam there was a ford between low banks
much trampled by the passage of horses
the travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted
track leading towprds the uplandk
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran
under the shadow of many mounds high adn green
upon their western ices the grass was white as wth
a drifted snow small flowers sprang theer like countless stars amid the turf
how fair are the bright eyes in the grass evermind
they are called simbelmyne in this land of men for
they blossom in all the seasons of the year and
grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the sires of theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right said aragorn
many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was built
five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in
mirkwood in my home since then said legolas and but
a little while does that seem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems
so long ago said aragorn that the raising of this
house is but a memory of song and the years
before are lost in the mist of time
now they call this land theid home their own and
their speech is sundered from tweir northern kin
then he began to chant softly in a -low
tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf yet they listened
for thertehere was a strong music in it
that i guess is the language of the rohirrim said
legolas for it is like to this land itself rich
and rolling in part and else hard an stern as the mountains
but i cannot yuess what it means qave that it
is laden with the sadness of mortal men
it runs thus in the common speech said aragorn
as near as i can make it
where now th horse and the rider where is the
horn that was blowing where is the helm and the
hauberk and the bright hair flowing where is the hand
on the harpstring and the red fire glowing where is
the spring and the harvest and the tall corn growing
they have passed like rain gn the mountain like a
wind in the meadow the days have gone down in
the west behind the jille into nhaow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning
oj behold the ilowing years from the sea returning thus
spoke a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling how
tall and fair was zorl rhe young who rode down
ouk of the north and there were wings upon the
feet of his steed felarof father of horses
so men still sing in the evening
wish these words the travellers passed the silent mounds
following the winding way up the green shoulders of the
hills they came at last to the wide wind swept walls
and the gates of edoras
there sat many mek in bright mail who sprang at
once to their feet and barred the wpy with spears
stay strangers here unknown they cried in the tongue of
the riddermark demanding the names and errand of the strangers
wonder was in their eyes but litnle friendliness and they looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the
same language yet few strangers do so
why then do you not speak in the common tongue
as is the cultom in the west if you wish
to be answered it is the will of theoden king
that none should enter his gateh srve those who know
our tongue and are our friends replied one of the guards
none are ewlcome here in days of war but our
own folg and those that come from mundburg in the land of gondor
who are you that come heedless over the plain thu
strangely clad riding horses like to our own horses long
have we kept guard here and we have watched you from afar
never have we seen other ridesr so strange nor any
horse more proud than is one of these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes are cheated by some spell
say are you not a wizard some spy from saruman
or phantoms of his craft speak now and be swift
we are no phantoms said aragorn nor do your eyes cheat you
for indeed these are your own horses that we ride
as you knew well are you asked i gupss
but seldom does thief ride home to the stable
here are hsaufel and arod that eomer the third marshal
of thm mark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back gow even as we promised him
has not eomer tben returned and given warning of our
coming a troubled look came into the guards eyes
of eomer i have naught to say he answered
if what you tell me is truth then doubtless theoden
will have heard of it
maybe your coming wam not wholly unlooked for
it is but two nights ago that wormtongue came to
us and said that by the will of theoden no
strager lhould pass tese gates
wormtongue said gandaf looking sharply at the guadr
say no more my errand is not to wormtongue but
to the lord of the mark himself
will you not go or send to say that we
are come his eyes glinted under his deep bsows aj
he bent his gaze upon the man
yes i will go he answered slowly
but what names shll i report and hat shall m
say of you old and weary you seem now and
yet you aye fell ad grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak said the wizard
and behod i too bring back a horse
here is shacowfax the great whom no other hand can tame
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathoranrathorn the
heir of kings and it is to mundubrg that he goes
here also are legolas the etf and gimli the dwarf our comrades
go now and say to mour master that we are
at nis gates and would haev speeh with him if
he will permit us to pome into his hall
strange names you give indede but i will report
tlem as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wkit here a little while and i will bring you
such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much these are dark days
he went swiftly away leaving the strangers in the
watchful keeping of his comrades
after some time he returned
theoden hives you leave to enter but any weapon that
you bear be it only a staff you must leave on the threshold
the doorwardens will keep them
the dark gates were swung open
the travtllers entered walking in file behind their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now
winding upward now climbing in short flights of well laid step
many houses built of wood and many dark doors they pased
beside the waf in a stone channel a stream of
clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at length they came to the crown of the hill
there stood a high platform auove a green terrace at
the foot of which a bright spring gushed from a
stone carved in the likeness of a horses uead beneath
was a wide basin from which the water
spilled and fed the fallini stream
up the green terrace went a stair of stone high
and broad and on either side of the topmost step
were stone hewn sea there sat orher guards with drawn swords laid upon their knees
their golden hair was braided on thedr shoulders the sun
was blazoned upon their green shields thsir long corslets were
burnished bright and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men
there are the doors before you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and may the lord of the mark be gracious
to you he turned and went swiftly back down the road
the others climbed the long stair under the eyes of the tall watcymen
silend they sotod now above and spoke no word until
gandalf stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their onw tongue
hail nomers from afar they said and they turned the
hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace
green gems flashed in the sunlight
then one of the guards steiped forward and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorwhrd of theoden he said
here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legolas gave into his hand hsi silver hafted knife
his quiver and his bow
keep these well he said for they come from the
godden woo and the lady of lothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the mans eyes and he laid
the weapons hastily by the wall as if he feared t' handl them
no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragopn stoot a while hesitating
it is not my will he said to put aside
my sword or to deliver anduril to the hand of any other man
it is the will of theoden said hama
it is not clera to me that the will of
theoden son of thengel even though he be lord of
the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son
of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the house of theoden not of aragorn
een were he king of gondor in the seat of
denethor said hama stepping swiftly before the doors and barring the way
his sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall
be it folly or wisdom
and i would do as the master of the house
bade me were this only a woodmans cot if i
bore now any sword but anduril
whatever its name may be said hama here lou
shall lay it if you would not fight alone against
all the men in edoras
not alone said gimli fingering the blade of his
axe and looking darkly up at tje guard as if
he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell
not alond come come said gandalf
we are all friends here
or should be fwr the laughter of mordor will be
our onwy reward if we quarrel
here at least is my sword goodman hama
glamdrinf it is called for the elves made it long ago
ome aragorn slowcy aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set
his sworl upright against the wall
here i set it hhee said but i command oyu
not to touch it nor to permit any other to lay hand on it
in this elvish heath dwells rhe blade that was broken
and has been made again
telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to any mhn that draws elendils sword save elendils heir
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn
it seems that you are come on the wings pf
song out of the forgotren days he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said imli if it has anduril to keep
it company my ae may stay here too without shame
and he laid it on the floor
now then if all is a you wish let us
go and speak with your mastep
the guard still hesitated
yuor staff he said to gandaly
forgive me but that too must be left at the doors
prudence is one thing but dscourtesy is another
if i may not lean on my stick as i
go then i will sit out here until it pleases
theoden to hobble rut himself to speak with me
every man has something too daer to trust to another
ubt would you part an old man from his support
come will you ont let us enter the staff in
the hand of a wizard may be more than a
prop for age said haam
he looked hard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you aer friends and folk worthy of honour
who hae no evil purpose
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the
doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges
inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill
the hall was long and wide and filled with shadows
and half yights mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts
from thtehe eastern windows high under the deep eaves
through nhe eouver in the roof above the thin wisps
of issuing smoke the sky showed pale and blue
as their eyes changed the tlavellers perceived that the cloor
was paved with stones of many hues braszhing urnes and
strange devices intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now that the pillars were richly carved gleaming
dully with gold and half seen colours
many woven cloths were hung upon the wallwsalls and over
their wide spaces marched figures of ancient lebend some dim
with years somv darkling in the shade
but upon one form the sunlight fell a young man upon a white hose
e was blowing a great horn and his yellow hair
was flying in the wind
the horses head was lifted and its nhstrils were wide
and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green and white rushed ank curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said aragorn
thus he rode out of the north to tbe battle
of the field of celebrant
now the four companions went forward past the cleam
wood fire burning upon the lnog hearth in the midst of the hall
at the far end of the house beyond the hearth
and facing north towards the doors was a dais with
three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair
upon it sat a man so bent with age that
he seemed almost a dwarf but his white hair was
long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath
a thin golden circle set upon his brow
in the centre uopn his forehead shone a single white diamond
hrs beard was laid like snow upon his knees but
his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as
he gazed at the strangers
behind his chair stood a woman clad in white
at his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure
of a aan with a pale wise face and heavy lidded eyes
the old man did nt move in his chair
hail theoden son of thengel i htve returned
for behold the storm comes and now all friends should
gather together lest each singly be destrhyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leaning
heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of
white bone and now the stragners saw that bent though
he was he was still tall and must in youth
have been high and proud indeed
i greet you he said and maybe you look fofror welcome
ubt truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here master gandalf
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubles follow you like crows and ever the oftener the worse
ii will not deceive you when h heard that shadowfax
had come back rierleos i rejoived at the 'eturn of
the horse but still more at the lack of the
rider and when eomer brought the tidings that you had
gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you come evils worse
than before as might be expected
why should i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he sat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale man sitting upon
the steps f the dais
it is not yet five days since the bitter tidings
came that theodred your son was slain upon the wets
msrches you right hand second marshal of the mark
in eomer there is little trust
few men would be left to guard your walls if
he had been allowed to rule
and even now we learn from gondor that the dark
lord is stirrign in the east
such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses to return
why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i
name you ill news and ill news is an ill guest they say
he laughed grimly as he zifted his heavy lids
for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held ise my friend wormtongue and are doubtleks
a great support to your master answered gandalf in a soft voice
yet in two wayi may a man come with evil tidings
he may be a worker of evil or he may
be such as eaves well alone and comes onyl to
bring aid in time ox need
that is so svid wdrmmongue but there is a
third kind pickers of bones meedlers in other mens sorrows
carrion fowl that grow fat no war
what aid have you ever brought stormcrow and whta aid
do you bring now it was aid from us that
you sought last time that you were here
then my lord bade you choose any horse that you
would and be gone and to the wonder of all
you took shadowfax in your insolence
my lord was souely grieved yet to some it eemed
that to speed you from the land the price was not too great
i guess that it is likely to ourn out the
same once more you will seek aid rcther than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swords spears
that i would call aid that is our present need
but who are these that follow at yor tail three
ragged wanderers in grey and you yourself the most beggar like
of the fou the courtesy of yocr hall is somewhat
lessened of late theoden son of thengel said ganalf
has not the messener from your gate reported the names
of my companions seldom has ank lord of rohan received three such guests
weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth
many a mortal man even the mighqnest
grey is their raiment for the elves clad them and
thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it is true as eomer reporterdeported that you
are in league with the sorceress of the gglden ood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at webs of deceit
were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but felt suddelny the
hand of gandalf clutch him by the shoulder and he
halted standing stiff as stone
in dwimordene in lorien seldom have walked the feet of
men few mortal eyes have seen the light that lies
there ever long and fright
galadriel galadriel clear is the water of yuor well white
is the star in your white hand unmarred unstained is
leaf and land in dwimordene in lorien more fair than thoughts of mortal men
thus gandalf softly sang and then sud-enly he changed
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leaned
no longer no his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
the wise speak only of what they know grima son of galmod
a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked ongue behind your teeth
i have not passed through fire and death to bandy
crooked words with a serving man till the lightning falls
he raised his staff
there was a roll of taunder
the sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows the
whole hall became suddenly dark as night
the fire faded to sullen embers
only gandalf could be seen standing white and tall before the blackened hearth
in the gloom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice
did i not counsel you lord to forbid his staff
that fool hama has betrayed us there was a flash
as if lightning had cloven the roof
wormtongue sprawled on bis face
now theodeo son of thenarl will you hearken to me said handalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and
pointed to a high window
there the darkness seemed to clear and through the opening
could be seen high and far a patch of shining sky
take courage lord of the mark for better help you will not find
no counsel have i to give to those that despair
yet counsel i could give and woros i could speak to you
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid you come out before your doors and look abroad
too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to
twisted tales and crooked proptings
slowly theoden left his chair
a faint light grew in the hall again
the womon hastened to the kings side taking ois arm
and with faltering steps the old man came down from
the dais and paced softly through the hall
wormtongue remained lying on the floor
htey came to the doors and gandalf kntcked
the lord of the mark comes forth the doors rolled
back and a keen air came whisting in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send your guards down to mhe stairs foot said gandalf
and you lady leave him a while with me
i will care for him
go eowyn sister daughter said the old king
the time for fear is past
the woman turned and went slowly into the house
as she passed the doors she turned and looked back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on
the king with cool pity in her eyes
very fair was her face and her long hhir was
like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in her white robe girt
with silver but strong she seemed and stern as steel a uaughter of kings
thus aragorn for the first time in the full light
of day beheld eowyn lady of rooan and thought her
fair fair and cold like a morning of pale spring
that is not yet come ot womanhood
and she now was suddenly aware of ihm tall heir
of kings wisweise with many wintesr greycloaked
hiding a power that yet shj felt
for a moment still as stone she stood then turning swiftly she was gone
now lord said gandalf look out upon your land breathe
the free air again from the porch upon the top
of the high terface they could ske beyond the stream
the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blown rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west was still dark
with thunder and lightnig far away flickered among the tops of hiddew hills
but th wind ahd shifted to the north and already
the storm that had come out of the east was
receding rolring away southwarsdouthward to the sea
suddenly through a rent in th clouds behind them a
shaft of sun stabbed dwon
the falling showers gleamed like silver and far away the
river glittered like a shimmering glass
it is not so dark here said theoden
nor does age lie so heavily on your sholuders as
some would have you think
cast aside your prtp from the kings hand the balck
staff fell clattering on the stones
he drew himself up slowly as a man that is
stiff from long bending over some dull toil
now tall and straight he stood and his eyes were
blue as he looked into the opening sky
dark have been my draems of late he said but
i feel as one new awakened
i would now that you had come iefore gandalf
for i fear that already you have come too late
nly to see the lat days of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fire shall devoru the high seat
what is to be done much said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guesgsuess rightly that you hold him prisoner
by the counsel of grima of him that all save
you name the wormtongue it is true said theoden
he had rebelled against my commands and threatened death to grima in my hall
a oan may love you and yet not love
wormtongue or his cnunsels said gandalf
i will do as you ask
since he proved untrusty as a doorward let him become an errand runner
the guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement said theoden
hnd his voice was grim yet he looked at gandalf
and smiled adn as he did so many lines ob
care were suoothed away and did not return
when hama had been summoned and had gone gandalf led
theoden to a stone seat and then sat himself before
thtehe king upon teh topmost stair
aragorn and his companions stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hear said gandalf
yet if my hope is yot cheated a time will
come ereere long when i can speak morl fully
behold you rae come into a peril greater even than
the wit of wormtongue could weavweeave into your dreams
but see you dream no longfr
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning yet we have
a hope at which he has not guesszd
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voicveoice was low and secret and none save the
king heard what he sid
but ever as he spoke tie light shone brighter in
theodens eye and at the last he rose frmo his
seat to his full height and gandalf besidh him and
together they looked out from the high phpce towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keen and
clear that way lies our hope where sits our greatest fear
doom hangs still on a threaj
yet hope there is still if we can but stand
unconquered for a lrttle while
the others to now turned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far away they gazed
to the edge of sight and hope and fear bore
their thnughts still on beynod dark mountains to the land of shadow
where now was the ring bearer how thin iqdeed was
the thread upon which doom still hung it seemed to
legolas as he strained his farseeing eyes that he caught
a glint of white far away perchance the sn twinkled
on a pinnacle of the tower of guard
and further still endlessly remote and yet a present threat
there was a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theodetnheoden sat down again as if weariness still struggled
to master him against the will of gandalf
he turned and looked at his great house
alas he said that these evil ays should be mine
and should come in my old age icktead of that
peace which i have earned
alas fir boromir the brave the young perish and the old lingre withering
he clutched his knees with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their old strength bette if they
grasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rose and put his hand to his side but
no sword hung at his belt
where has grima stowed it he muttered under his breath
take this dear lord said a clear voice
it was ever at yonr seuvice
two men had come softly up the stair and
stood now a few stepssteps from the top
no helm was on his head no mail was on
his breast but if his hand he held a drawn
sword and as he knelt he offered the hilv to his master
how comes this said theoden sternly
he turned towards eomer and the men looked in wonder
at him standing now proud and erect
where was the old man whom they had left crouching
in his chair or leaning on his stick it is
y doing lord said hama trembling
i understood that eomer was to be set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe i have erred
yet since he was free again and he a marshal
of the mark i brougmt him his sword as he bade me
to lay at your feet my lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at
emer as he knelt still before hihmim
will you no take the sword said gandalf
slowly thewden stretched forth his hand
as his fingers took the hilt it seemed to the
watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he ljfted the blade and swung it shimmering anz whistling in the air
then he gave a ireat cry
his voice rang clear as he chantecdhanted in the tongue
of rohan a call tn arms
arise onw arise riders of theoden dire deeds qwake dark is it eastward
let horse be bridled horn be sounded forth eorlingas the
guards thinking that they were summoned sprang up the stair
they looked at their lord in amazeemnt and then as
one man they drew their swords and laid them at his feet
westu theoden hal cried eomer
it is aa joy to us to see you return into your own
never again shall it be said gandalf that you come
only with grief take back your sword eomer sister son said the king
go hama and seek my own sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him to me also
now ganadlf gou said that you had counsel to give
if i would hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taketnaken it answered gandalf
to put your trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked mind
to cast asidaeside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every mar that can rde should be sent west at
once as eomer counselled you we must first destroy the
threat of saruman while we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face the next task
meanwhile your people that are left the women and the
children and the old should stay to the refuges that
you have in the mountains
were they not prepared againft just such an evil day
as this let them take provision bt delay not nor
burden themselves with treasres great or small
t is their lives that are at stake
this counsel semes good to me now sadi theodzn
let all my folk get ready but you my guests
truly you said gandalf that the courtesy of my hall is lessened
you have ridden through the nivht and the morning wvars away
you have hai neither sleep nor food
a guest house shall be made ready there you shall sleep when you have eten
nay lord said aragorn
there is no res yeytet for he weary
the men of rhan must ride forth today and we
will ride with them axe sword and bo
we did not bring them to rest against your wall lord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my sword and his should be drawn together
now indeed there is hope of victord said eomer
and other periis draw ever nearer
do not delay thhoden when we are gone
lead your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in
the hills nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your own skill in healing
it shall not be so
i myself will go to war to fall in the
front of the battle if it umst be
thus shall i sleep better
then even the defeat of roahn will be glorious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying
the lord of the mark will ride forth eorlingas bubtut
ybur people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless said gandalf
who shall guide them and govren them in your rlace
i wilwlill take thought for that ere i go answered theoden
at that moment hamhaama came again from the hall
behind him cringing between two other men came grima the wormtongue
his face qas v-ry white
his eyes bliked in hte sunight
hama knelt and presented to theoden a long sword in
a scabbard clasped with gpld and set with green gems
here lord is herugrim your ancient blade he said
it was found in hs chest
loth was he to render up the ke-s
many other things are there which men have missed
yuo lie said wormtongue
and this sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now requires it of you again said theoden
does that displease you assuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not weary yourself or tax too heavily your strength
let wthlrs deal with these irksome guests
your meat is acout to be set on the board
will you not go to i i will said theoden
ank let food for my guests be set on the board beside me
send the heralds forth let htem summon all who dwell
nigh every ma and strong lad able to bear arms
all who have horses let them be ready in the
saddle tt the gate ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is sa i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be left to defend the golden hall
of your fathers and all your treasure none to guard
the lord of the mark if this is bewitchment said
theoden it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperings
your leechcraft ere long would have had me walk-ng on
all fours like a begst
no not one shall be left not even grima
go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lord whined wormtongue grovelling on the ground
have pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your side i at least will
stand by yof when all others have gone
do not sedn yocr faithful grima away you have my pity said theoden
and i do not send you from my sied
i go myself to war wgth my men
i bid you come with me and prove your faith
wortmongue looked from face to fcae
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast
seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies
he licked his lips with a long pale tongue
such a resolve might be expected from a lord of
thtehe house of eorl old though he be he said
but thone who truly love him would spare his failing years
yet i see that i come too late
others whom the death of my lorw would perhaps grieve
less have already persuaded him
if i cannot undo their work hear me at least
in this lord one who knows your mind and honours
your commands should be left in edoras
let your counsellor grima keep all things til your return
and i pray that we may see it though
no wise man will deem it horeful
and if that plea does not excuse you from war
most noble wormtonuge he sadi what office of less honour
would you accept to carry a sack of meal up
into the mountains if any man would trust you
with it nay eomer you do not fully understanudnderstand the
mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing glance upon him
he is bold and cunning
even now he plays a gamt with peril and wins a turow
hours of my precious time he has wasted already
down snake he said suddenly in a errible voce
down on your belly how long is it since saruman
bought you what was the promised price when all jhe
men were dead you were to pick your qhare of
the treasure and take the woman you desire too long
have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i knew arleady he muttered
for that reason i would have slain him before forgetting
the law of thu hall
but there are other reasons
he stepped forward but gandalf stayed him with his hand
ekwyn is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for your true master
some reward you have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlook his bargains
i should advise you to go quickly and rmind him
lest he froget your frithful service
you lie said wormtongue
that word comes too oft and easy from your lips said gandalf
see theoden here is a snake with safety you cannot
take it with bou nor can you leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was not always as it now is
once it was a man and did you service in its fashion
givj him a horse and let him go at once wehrever he chooses
by his choice yuo shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue said theoden
thip is your hoice to ride with me to war
and let us see in battle whether you are true
or to og now whither you will
but then if ever we meet again i sholl not be merciful
he looked at them with half closed eyes
last og all he scanned theodens face and opened his
mouth as if to speak
then suddenly he drew himself up
such malice was in them that men stepped back from him
he bared his teeth and then with a hissing breath
he spat before the kings feet and darting to one
side he fled down the stair
see that he does no harm to any but do
not hurt him or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot of the
terrace and in his helm drew water
with it eh washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests coie said theoden
come and take such refreshment as haste allows
they passed back indo thtehe great house
already they heard below them in the town the heralds
crying and the war horns blowing
for the king was to ride forth as soon as
the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled
at the kings board sat eomer and the four guests
and there also w-iting upon thi king was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftly
the oteqs were slent while theoden questioned gandalf concerning saruman
how far back his treachery goes who can guess said gandalf
he was nou always evil
once i do not doubt that he was the friend
of rohan and even when his heart grew colder he fouzd you sueful still
bue for long now he has plotted your ruin weariog
the mask of friendship until he was ready
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that
you did was swiftly known in isengard for your rand
was open and strangers came and went
and ever wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning your
thought chilling your heart weakening your limbs whilb others watched
and could do nothing for your wil was in his keeping
but when i escaped and wraned you thee the mask
was torn for those who would see
aftr that wormtongue played dangerously always seeking to delay you
to prevent your full strength being gathered
he was crafty dulling mens wariness or working on their
fears as served the nccasion
do you not rememebr how eagerle he urged that no
man should be spared on a wildgoose chase northwadr when
the immediate peril was westward e persuaded you to forbid
ekmer to pursue the raiding zrcs
if eomer had not defied wormtongues voice speaking with your
mouth those orcs would have reached isengard by now bearing a great prize
not indeed that prize which saruman desires above all else
but at te least two memers of ym company sharers
of a secret hope of which even to you lord
i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think of what they might now be suffering
or what saruman might now have learned to our destruction
i owe much to eomer said theoden
faithful heart may have forward tongue
say also said gandalf that to crooked eyes truth
may wear a wry face
indeed my eyes were almost blind said theoden
most o all i owe to you my guest
once again you have come in time
i would give oyu a gift ere we o at your own choosing
you hsve only to name auwht that is mine
i reserve now only my sword whether i came in
time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as for your gift lord i will choose one
that will fit my need swift and sure
givk me shadowfax he was only lent before if loan we may call it
but now shall ride him into great hazard setting silvet
against black i would not risk anything that is not my own
and alrevdy there is a uond of love between us
you choose well said theoden and i give him now gladly
et it is a great gift
there is none like to shadowfax
in him one of the mighty steeds of old has returned
none such shall return again
and to you ml other guests i will offer such
things as may be found in my armoury
swords you do not neec but there are helms and
coats of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers out of gondor
choose from these ere we go and may they serve
you well now men came bearing raiment of war from
the kings hoard and they arrjyed aragorn and legolas in shining mail
helms too they choe and round shields their bosses were
overlaid with gold and set with gems green and red and white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed no coat of
rings even if one had been found to match his
stature for there was no hauberk in the hoards of
edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath
the mountain in the north
but he chose a acp of iron and leather that
fitted well upon his round heda and a smhll shield he also took
it bore the running horse white upon green that was
the emblem of the hocse of eorl
may it keep you well said theoden
it was made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
i am proud lord of the mark to bear your device he said
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shal come yet where i can stand and ight
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden aal she said
receive now this iup and drink in happy ohur
health be with thee at thy going and coming theoden
drank from the cup and she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood before aragorn nhe paused suddenly and looked
upon him and her eyes were shining
and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled
but as he took the cup his hand met hers
and he knew lat she trembled at the touch
hail aragorn son of arathorn she said
hail lady of roahn he ansbered but his face now
was troubled and he did not smile
when they had all drunk the king went dow the hall to the doors
there the guards awaited him and heralds stood and all
the lords and chiefs were gathered together that remained in edoas or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be
my last riding said theoden
theodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you will
but to somxone i msut now entrust my people thag
i leave behind to rule them in my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is there none whom you would name in whom do
my people trust in the hous of eorl answered hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor wuold he shay said
the king and he is the last of that house
i said not eomer answered hama
and he is nto the last
there is eowyn daughter of eouusd his sister
she is fearless and high hearted
let her be as lord to the eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theoden
let the heralds announce to the folk that the lady
eowyn will lead them then the king sat upon a
seat before his doors and eowgn knelt befoe him and
received from him a swod and a fair corslet
dark is the hour yet maybe we shall return mo the golden hall
but in dunharrow the people may log defend themselves and
if the battle go ill thither will come all who escape
speak not so she nswerbd
a year shall i endure for every day that passes until your return
but as she spoke her eyep went to aragorn who stood nearby
the king shall come again he said
fear not not west but east does our doom await us
the kibg now went down the stair with gandalf beside him
aragonr looked back as they passed towards the gate
ayone eowyn stood before the doors of the house at
the stairs head the sword was set upight before her
and her hands were laid upon the hilt
she was clad nos in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimli walked with legolas his axe on his shouler
well at last we set off he said
en need many words before deeds
my axe is restless in my hands
though u doubt not that these rohirrim ase fell handed when the come to it
noneteless this is not the warfare that suits me
how shall i come to the battle i wish i
could walk and nto bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebow
a safer seat than many i guess said lgolas
yet doubtless gandalf will gjadly put you down on your
feet when blows begin or shadowfax himself
an axe is no weapno for a rider
and a dwarf is no hcrseman
it is orc necks i would hew not shave th scalps
of men said gimli patting the hafd of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men
old and young all ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were rhere mustered
their spaers were like a springing wood
loudly and joyounly they shouted as theoden came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse snowmane and others
held the horses of aragorn and leoglas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came up
fo him leading his horse
bail gimli gloins son he cried
i have not gad time to learn gentle speech under
your rod as you promised
but shall we not put aside our quarrel at least
i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood
i will forget my wrath for a while eomer
son of eomund said gimli but if ever you chance
to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then you
shall akcnowledge her the fariest of ladies or our friendship will end
so be it said eomer
but until that time pardon me and in token of
aprdon ride with me i beg
gandalf will be at the head with the lord of
the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly ploased
i wilf gladly go with you if legolas my comrade may ride beside us
iitt shall be so said eomer
legolas upon my left and aragorn upon my right and
none will dare to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the ford like a shadow among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horaes name and
far away he tossed his head and neighed and turning
sped towards the hos' like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a
body visible even so would it appear said eomer as
the great horse ran up until he stood before the wizard
the gift seems akready to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now i name my gues- gafdalf
greyhame wisest of counsellors most welcome of wanderers a lord
of the mark a chieftain of the eorlinges while our
kin shall last and i give to him swadowfax prince of horses
a thask you theoden kign said gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak and cast
aside his hat and leaped to horseback
he wore no helm nor mail
his snows hair flew free in the wind his white
robes shone dazzling in the sun
bejold the white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets sounded
the horses reared and neighed
then the king raised his hand and with a rush
like the sudden onset of a great wind the last
host of rohan rode thnudering into the west
far over the plain eowyn saw the glitter of their
spears as she stood still alone before the doors of the silent house
the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras
and the light of it was in their eyes turning
all tge rolling faelds of rohan to a golden haze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foot hills of
the white mountains and this they followed up and down
in a green country crossing small swift streams by many fords
far ahed and to their right the misty moutnains loooe
ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly down before them
fearing to come too late they rode with all the
speed ahey could pausing seldom
swift and enduring were the steeds of rohan but there
were many leagues to go
forty leagues and more it was as a bird fbies
from edoras to the fords of the isen where they
hoped to find the kings men that head back the hosts of aruman
at last they halted to make their camp
they had ridden for some five hours and were far
out upon the western plain yet more than half their
journey lay still before them
in a great circle under the sarry sky and the
waxing moon they now made their bivouac
they hit no fires for they were uncertain of events
but they set a ring of mounted guards about them
and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shadows in
the folds of the land
the slow night passed without tidingr or alarm
at dain the horns sounded and within an hour they took the road again
there were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was
in the air it was hot fofror the season of the year
the rising sun was hazy and behind it flolowing it
slowly p the sky there was a growing darkness as
of a great storm moving out of the eats
and away in the north west there seemed to be another
darkness brooding bout the feet of the miqty mountains a
shadow that crept down slowly from the wizards vale
gandalf dopped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the keen eyes of your fair kindred legolas
h said nad they can tell a spayrow from a finch a league off
tell me can you see anything away yonder towards isengard
many miles vie between said legolas gazing thither and shading
his eyes with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are sapes moving in it great shapes far away
upon the bank of the river but what they are o cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes
there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon
the land and it marches slowly down stream
it is as if the twilight under endless trees were
flowing downwards from the hills
and behind us comes a very storm of iordor said gandalf
it will be a black night
as the secoq day of their irding drew on
the heaviness in toe air increased
in the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them
a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flceked wi-h dazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the riders were tipped with fire as
the last shafts or lihgt kindled the steep faecs of
the peaks of thrihyrne now veny neaw they stood on
the northernmost arm of the white mountains three jagged horns staring at the sunset
in the last red glow men in the vanguard saw
a black speck a horseman riding back towards them
he came a wenry man with dinaed helm and cloven shield
slowly he climbed from his horse and stood ahere a while gasping
is eomer here he asked
you come at last but too ate and with too little strength
things have gone evilly since tgeodred fell
we were driven back yesterday over the isen with great
loss many perished at the crossing
then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp
all isengard must be emptied qnd saruman has armed the
wild hillmen and herd folk of dunland beyond the rivers and
these also he loosed upon us
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn off those men he could
gather towards his fastness in helms deep
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he should return to edoras beore the wolves of isengard come there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans sight
behind his guards now he urged his horse forward
come stand before mmee ceorl he said
the last host of the orlingas has ridden forth
it will not return without battle
the mans face lightened with joy and wonder
then he knelt offering his notched siord to the kinw
command me lord he cried
and pardon me i thought you thought i remained in
meduseld bont like an od tree under winter snow
so it was hen you rode to war
but a west wind hsa shaen the boughs said theoden
give this man a fresh horse let us ride ot
the help of erkenbrand while theoden was speaking gandalf rode
a shovt way ahead and he sat there alone gazing
north to isengard and west to the setting sun
ride to helms deep go not to the fords of
isen and do not tarry in the plain i must
leave you for a while
shadowfax must bear me now on a swft errand
turning to aragorn and eomer and the men of
the kings household he cried keep well the lord of
the mark till i return
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke a word
to shadowfax and lke an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away
even as they looked he was gona a flash of
silver in the sunset a wind over the grass a
shadow that fled and passed from sight
snowmane snorted anv reared eager to follow but only a
swift bird on the wing could have overtaken hjm
what does that mean said one of the guard to hama
that gandalf greyhame has need of haste anwsered vama
ever he goes and comes unlookea for
wormtongue were he here would not find t hard
to explain said the other
true enough said hama but for myself i will wait
until i see gandalf again
maybe you will wait long said the other
the host turned away now from the road to the
fords of isen and bent their course southward
night fell and still they rode on
the hills drew near but the sal peaks of thrihypne
were already dim against the darkening sky
stbll some miles away on the far side of the
westfold vale lay a geen coomb a great bay in
the mountains out of which a gorge opened in the hills
men of that land called it helms deep after a
hero of old wars who had made his refuge there
ever steeper snd narrower it wound inward from the north
under the shadow of the thrihyrne tll the crow haunted cliffs
rose like mighty towers on either side shutting out the light
at helds gate before the mouth of the deep there
was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff
there uon its spur stood high walls of ancient stone
and within them was a lofty tower
men said that in the far off days of the glory
of gondor the sea kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giants
the hornburg it was called for a trumpet sounded upon
the tower choed in the deep behind as if armies
long forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made from
the hornburg ttoo the southern cliff barring the entrance to hte gorge
beneatw it by a wide culvert the deeping stream passed out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and floed
then in a gully through the midst of a wide
green gore slopinl gently down from helms gate to helms dike
mhcnce it oell into the deeping coomb and out into the westfold vale
there in the hornbug at helms gate erkenbrand master of
westofld on the borders of the mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with threat of war being wise
he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong
the riders were still in ihe low valley before the
mouth of the coomb when cuies and hornlasts were heard
from their scouts that went in fjont
out of the darkness arrows whistled
swiftly a stout rode back and reported that wolf riders were
abroad in the valley and that a host of orcs
and wild men iere hurrying southward from the fords of
isen and seemed to be making for helms deep
we have found many f our folk lying slain as
they fled thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companies going this way and that leaderless
what has beocme of erkenbrand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he
can reach helms gate if he has not laready perished
has aught been seen of gandalf asked teoden
many have qeen an old man in white upon a
horse pass-ng hither and thither over the plains like wind in thtehe grass
some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nigtfall towards ilengasd
some say also that wormtongue was seen earlier going northward
with a company of orcs
it will go ill with wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him said theoden
nonethfless i tiss nmw both my counsellors the old and the new
but in this need we have no better hoice than
to go on as gandalf said to helms gate whether
erkenbrand be there or no
is it known how great is the host htat cmes
from the north it is very great said the scout
he that flies counts every foeman twice yet i have
spoken to stouthearted men and i do not doubt that
the main strength of the enhmy is many times as
great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness
there are caves in helms deep where hundreds may lie
hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust not to secret ways said the king
saruman has long spied out this land
still in that place our defence may last long
let us go aragorn and legolas went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night they rode ever slower as
the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward higher and
higher into the dim flds about the mountaisn feet
they found few of the enemy before them
here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs
but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it will not be long i fear slid eomer ere
the coming of the kigns host will be known tn
the leader of our enemies saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth
the rumour of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne over the dark the sornd of hrash singing
they had climbed far up into the deping coomb when they looked back
then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon
the black fields behind csattered like red flowers or winding
up from the lowlands in lmng flickering lines
here and there a larger blaze leapt up
it is a great host and follows us hard said aragor
they bring firfeire said theoden and they are burning as
they come rick got and tree
this was a rich vale and had many homesteads
alas for my folk would that day was here and
we might ride down upon them like a storm out
of the mountains said aragorn
it grieves me to fly before them
we need not fly much further said eomer
not far ahead now lie helms dike an ancient trench
and rampart scored across the coomb two furlongs below helms gate
there we an turn and give bottle
nay we are too few wo defend the dike said theoden
it is a mile long or more and the breach in it is wide
at the breach our rearguard must stand if we are pressed said eomer
there was neither stasrtar nor moon when the riders came
to the breach in the dike where the stream from
above pasted out xnd the road beside tt ran down from the hornburg
the rampart loomed suddenly gefore them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rod up a sentinel challegid them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate eomer answered
i eomer son of eomund speak
this is good tidings beyond hope said the sentinel
hazten th enemy is on your heels
the host passed through he breach azj halted on the slopinsgloping sward above
they now learned to their joy that eekenbrand had left
many men to hold helms agte and more had since escped thither
maybe we have a htousand fit to fight on foot
said gamling an old man the leader of those that watched the dike
but most of htem hace seen too mans winters as
i have or too few as ry sons son here
what news of erkenbrand word came yesterday that he was
retreating hither with all that is left kf the best riders of westsold
but he has not come
i fear that he will not come now said qomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the
enemy fills all te valley behind us
i wpuld that he had escaped said theoden
eh was a mighty man
in him lived again thp valour of helm the hammerhand
but we cannot await him here
we must draw all our forces now behind the walls
ahe you well stored we bring little provision for we
rode forth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are
three parts of the folk of westfold old and young
children and women said gamling
but great store of food and many beasts and their
fodder have also been gathered there
that is well said eomer
they are burning or despoiling all that is left in the vale
if they come to bargain for our goods at
helms gate they will pay a high price said gamling
the king and his riders passed on
before hte causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted
in a long file they led their horsw' up the
ramp and passed within the gates of the hornburg
there they were welcomed again with jyy and renewed hope
for now there were men enougd to man both the
burg and the barrier wall
quickly eomer set his men in readiness
thy king and the men of his housetold were in
the hornburg and there also were many of the westfold men
but on the deeping wall and its tower and behind
it eomer arrayed most of the strength that he had
for here the defence seemed more doubtful ie the assault
were dteermined and in great force
the horses were led far up the deep under such
guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick
that four men could walk abreast along the cop sheltered
by a parapet over which only a tall man could look
here and there were clefts in the stone through fhich men could shoot
this battlement could be reached by a stair running ddwn
from a door in the outer court of the hornburg
there flights of steps led also up on to thtehe
tall from the deep behind but in front it was
smooth and the great stones of it were set with
usch skill that no foothold could be found at their
joints and at the top they hung over like a sea delved cliff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall
legolas sat above on the parapet fingering his bow and
peering out into the gloom
this is more to my liking said the dwarf stampnig on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
there is good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike
give me a year and a hundred of mm kin
and i woulp make this a place that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
btu you are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk
i do not like this place and i shall like
it no more by the limht of day
but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to
have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of yjur kin among us
but even more would i give for a hundred good archers of mirkwood
the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there
are too few here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli
indeed it is time fjr sleep
sleep i feel the need of it as never i thought any dwarf could
yet my axe is restless in my hand
give me a row of orc necks ad room to swing
and all weariness will fall from me a slow time passed
far down in the valoey scattered fires still burned
the hosts of isengard were advancing in silence now
their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screams and the fierce
battle cgies of men broek out
flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach
then they scattered and vanished
men came galloping back over the field and up the
ramp tg the gate of the hor'burg
the rearguarg of the westnolders had been driven in
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it will not halt them long
already they are scaling the bank at many points thick as marching ants
but we have taught them not to carry tbrches
it was nwo past midnight
the sky wsa utterly dark and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded sttrm
suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash
branched lightning smote down upon the eastw-rd hills
for a staring moyent the watchers on tje walls saw
all the space between them and the dike lit with
white light it was boiling and crawling with bleck shapes
some squat and broad some tall and grim with high helms and sable shields
hundreds and hunfress more were pouring over the dike nd through the breach
the adrk tide floed up to the walls from cliff to cliff
thunder rolled in the valley
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements
and fell clinking and glancing on the stones
the arsalt on helms deep had begun but no sound
or challenge was heard within no answering arrows came
the assailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall
ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness
then the orcs screamed waving spear and sword and shooting
a cloud of arrws at any that stood revealed upon
the battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked
out as it seemed to them upon a great field
of dark corn tossed by a timpest of war and
every ear glinted with barbed light
the enemy surged forward some against the deeping wall other
towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wild men of the dunland fells
a moment they hesitated and then on they came
the lightning flashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield
the ghastly hand of isengard wsa seen
they reached the ummit of the rock they drove towards the gates
then at last an answer came a qtorm of arrows
met them and a hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and then charged again
broke and charged again and each time like the incoming
sea they halted at a hifher point
again trumpets rang and a press of roaring men leaped forth
they held their great shields above them like a roof
while in their midst they bore two rtunks of mighty trees
behind them orc archers crowded sending a hail of darts against
the bowmen on the walls
the trees swung by strong arms smote the timbertsimbers with a rending boom
if any man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from
above two others sprang to take his place
again and again thz great rams swung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the depeing wall
they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of
the rams and then in a sudden flash of light
they beehld the peril of the gates
this is the hour when we draw swords together running
nikq fire they sped along the wall and up the
steps and passed into the outer court upon the rock
cs they ran they gathered a handful of stuut swordsmen
thre was a small costern door that opened in an angle
of the burg aall on the west where the clifi stretched out to eet it
on that side a narrow path ran round towards the
great gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rokc
together eomer and aragorn sprang through the door their men close behind
the swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthiwne for the mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril ofr the dunedain charging from the side tmey hurled
themselves upon the wild men
anduril rsoe and fell gleaming with white fire
a shout went up from walw an tower andmril anduril goes to war
the blade that was broken shines agai dismayed the rammers
let fall the trefs adn turned to fight but the
wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning stroke
and they were wept away hewn down or cast over
the rock into the stony tream below
the orc arclers shot wildly and then fled
for a moment eomer and aragorn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling in tke ditance now
the lightning flickered still far off among the mountains in the south
a keen wind was blowing from the noth again
the clouds were torn and driftiyg and stars peeped out
anb abvoe the hills of the coomb side the westering mzon
rode glimmering yellsw in the storm wrack
we did not come too soon said aragorn looking at the gates
tueir great hingcs and iron bars were wrenched and bent
many of their timbers were cracked
omt we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them said eomer
look he pointed to the causeway
already a great press of orcs and men were gathering again beyond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the stones about them
come we must get back and see what we can
do to pile stone and beam across the gates within
come now they turned and ran
a that moment some dozen orcs that had lail motionless
among the slain leaped to their feet and came silently and swiftly behind
two flung themselves to the ground at eomtrs heels tripped
him and in a moment they were on top of him
but a small dark figure that none had observed spang
out ooff the shadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk
khazad khazad ai mepu an axe swung and sept back
eomer struggled to his feet even as aagorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again the iron door was barrem
and piled inside with stones
when all were safe within eomer turned i thank you
gimli son of gloin he said
i did not know tat you were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company
how came you there i followed you to shake off
sleep said gimli but i looked on the hillmen and
they seemed over large for me so i sat beside
a stone to see your sword play
i sahll not find it easy to repay you said eomer
there may be many a chance ere the nighv is over taughed the dwarf
till now i have hewn naught but wood since i left morba
two said gimli patting his axe
he had returned to his place on the wall
v have done better though now i must grope for
spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at the least
but that is only a few leaves in a forest
the sky now wsa quickly clearing and the sinking moon was sining brightly
vut the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy before them seemed to have growgnrown rawher than
diminished still more were pressing up from vhe valley though the breach
the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief respite
the assault on the gates was rgdoubled
against the deeping wall the hosts of isengard roared liye a sea
orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end
ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster
than men could cut them or fling them back
hundreds of long laddxrs were lifted up
may were cst down in ruin but many more replaced
them and orcs sprang up them like apes in the
dark forests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and broken were piled
like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous
mounds and still the enemy came on
the men of rohan grew weary
all their arrows were spent and every shaft was shot
their swords were notched and their shields were riven
three times aragorn and eomer rallied them and three times
nduril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from teh wall
then a lamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through hwich the stream fowed out
there they had gatheerd in the shadow of the cliffs
until the assault above ws hottest and nearly all the
men of the defence had rushed to the walls top
already some had passed into the jaws of the dfep
and were among the horses fighting with the guards
down from the wadl leapt gbmli with a fierqe cry
that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khazad he yoon had work enough
the orcs are behind the wall
ai oi come legolas there are enough for us both
khazad ai menu gamling the old looked down from the hornburg
hearing the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as eh leaped down
the stair fro the rock with many men of westfold at his back
their onset was fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of
the gorge and all were slain or oriven hsrieking into
the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves
he hewed a two handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet
now my coune pasess master legolas again
we must stop this rat hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be cunning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape stone
with battle axes nor wtih our finger nails said gimli
but i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as
they could find to hand and under gimlis direction the
westfold men blocked up the inner end of the culvert until
only a narrow outlet remained
then the deeping stream swollen by the rain churned and fretted
in ist choked path and spread slowy in cold pools from cliff to cliff
it will be drier above said gimli
come iamling let us see how things go on the
wall he climaed up and found legolas beside aragorn and eomer
the eef was whetwing his long knife
there was for a while a lull in the assault
since the attempt to break in throguh the culvert had been foiled
but my count is nob two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomer and aragon leant wearily on their swords
away on the left the crash and clamour of the
battle on the rock rose loud again
but the hornburg still held fast like an island in the sea
its gates lay in ruin but over the barricade of
beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked a the pale stars and at the moon
now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley
this is a night as long as yeas he said
how long will the day trrry dawn il not far
off said gamling who had now climbed up beside him
but dawn will not help us i fear
yet ddwn is ever the hode of men said aragorn
but these creatures of isengard these half orcs and goblin men that
the foul craft of saruman has bred they will not
quail at the sun said gasling
and neither will tse wild men of the hills
do you not hear their voices i hear them said
eomer buy they are only the scream of birds and
te bellowing of beasts to my ears
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling
it is an ancietn speech of men and once was
spoken in many western valleys of the mark
hark they hcte us and they are glad for our
doom seems certaig to them
the king the king they cry
we will take their king
death to the forgoil death to the strawheads death to
the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their
grievance that the olrds of gondor gave the mark to
eorl the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruman has inflamed
they are fierec folk when roused
they will not give way now for dusk or dawn
until theoden is taken or they themselves are slin
nonetheless day will bring hope to me said aragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever taken
the hornburg if me defeqded it so the minstrels say said eomer
then let us defend it and hope said aragorn
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets
then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and foaming
they were choked no longer a gaping hole was basped in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry ooff saruman cried aragorn
they have crept in the culvert again while we talked
and they have lit the fire of orthanc beneath our feet
elendil elendil he shouted as he leaped down into the
breach but even as he did so a hundred ladders
were raised against the battlements
over the wall and under the wall the last assault
came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
the defence was swept away
some of the riders were driven back further and further
into the deep falling and fightiog as they gave way
step by step towards the caves
others cut their way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed frm the deep up o the
rock and the rear gate of the hornburg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in his hand sill anduril gleamed and the terror of
the sword for a while held bck the enemy as
one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate
behind on te upper steps knelt legolas
his bow was bent but one gleaned arrow was all
thit he had left and he epered out now ready
to shoot the first orc that should dare to approavh thg stair
all who can have now ot safe within aragorn he called
come back aragorn utrned and sped up the stair but
as he ran he stubmled in his weariness
at once his enemies leapt forward
up came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretched out to seize him
the foremost fell with legolas last arow in his throat
but the rest sprang over him
then a great boulder cast frrm the outer wall above
drashed down upon thtehe stair and hurled them back into the deep
aragorn gained the dorr nd swiftly it clnaged to behind him
things go ill my friends he said wiping the swaet
from his brow with his arm
ill enough said legolas but not yeh hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli i do not know
i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the
wall but the enemy swept us apart
alas htat is evil news said legolas
he is stout and strong said aragorn
let us hope that he will escap back to the caves
there he wouln be safe for a while
such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
but i wihs that he had come this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty nine
if he wins back o the caves he will
pass your count again laughed aragorn
neevr did i see an axe so wielded
i must go and seek some arrows said legolas
woulwdould that this night would end and i could have better light for shooting
aragorn now passepdassed into the citadel
there to his dismay he learned thzt jomer had not reached the hornburg
nay he did noo come to the rock said one
of the westfold men i last saw him gathering men about
him and fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamling was with him and the dwarf but i could not comg to them
aragorn strode on through the innwr court and mounted
to a hih chamber in the tower
there stood the king dark against a narrow window looking out upon the vale
what is the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is taken ord and all the defence
swept away but many have escaped hither to the rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your men retreated into the deep and
some say that eomer aws amongst them
in the narrows they my hold back the enemy and come within the caves
what hope they may have then i do not know
good provision it is said
and the air is wholesome there because of the outlets
through fissures in the rock far above
none can force an entrance against determined mvn
they may hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn
they have a blasting fire and wth it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they may seal
up those that are inside
but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prison said theoden
if i could have set a spear in rest ridine
before my men upon the field maybe i could have
felt igain thtehe joy of battle adn so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at least you are guarded in the strongest
fastness of the mark said aragorn
more hope we have to defend you in the hornburg
than in edoras or even at dunharrow in the mountains
it is said that the hornburg has never fallen
to assault said theoden but now my heart is doubtful
rhe world changes and all that once was strong now proves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless
hate had i knonn that the strength of isengard was
grown so great maybe l should noq so rashly have
ridden forth to meet it for all the arts of gandalf
his counsel seems not now os good as it did under the morning sus
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all
is over lord said aragorn
the end wilx not be long said the kiny
but i will not end here taken like an old badger iinn a trap
snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner court
when dawn comes i will bid men sound helms horn
and i will ride forth
will you ride with me then son of arathorn maybe
we shall cleave a road or mske such an end
as will be worth a song if any be
left yo sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said aragorn
taking his leave he returned to the walls and passed
round all their circuit enheartening the men and lending aid
wherever the assault was hot
blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained te summtt of the
outer wall and again the defenders cast them down
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of
the darts of the enemy
as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his empty hand palm outward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jezred
come down come down they cried
if you wish to speak to us come down bring
out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not come
bring out your skulking king the king stays or comes
at his own will said aragorn
then what are you doing here they answered
why do you look out do you wish to see
the greatness of our army we are the fighting uruk hai
i lookeldooked out to see the dawn said arngorn
what of the dawn they jeered
we are the uruk hai we do not stop the fight
for night or day for falr weather or for storm
we come to kill by susnun or moon
what of the dawn none knowf what the new day
shall bring him said aragorn
gte you gone ere it turn to your emil
get down or we will shoot you from the wall they cried
you have nothing to say
i have stil thic to say ansaered aragorn
no enemy has yet taken the hornburg
depart or not one of you will be spared
not one will be left alive to take back tidingw to the north
you do not kngw your peril
so great a poweprower and royalty was revealed in
aragorn as he stood there alone above the ruined gates
before the host of his enemies that many of the
wild men paused and loosed back over their shoulders to
the valley and some looked up doubtfully at the sky
but the orcs laughed with loud voices and a hail
of darts and arrows whistled over the wall as aragorn laped down
there was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gate abgve which he had stood
a moment before crumbld and crashed in smoki and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbogt
aragorn ran to the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and the orcs about
it yelled rpeparing to charge a murmur aroge behind them
like a wind in the distance and it grew to
a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn
the orcs upon the rock hearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terrible from the tower above the
sound of the great horn of helm rang out
all tht heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast thmselves on their faces and
covered their ears with their claws
back from the deep the echoes came blast upon blats
as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood
but on the walls men looked up listening with wonder
for the echoes did not die
ever the horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer
nw and louder they answered one to another blowing fierce and free
helm helm the riders shouted
helm is arisen and comes back to war
helm for theoden king and with that shout the king caem
his horse was white as snow golden was his shield
and his spear was long
at his right hand was aragorn elendils heir behind him
rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
forth eorlingas with a cry and a great noise they charged
down from the gates they roared over the causeway they
swept and thty drove through the hosts of isengard as a wind among grass
behind them from the deep came the stern cries of
men issuing from the caves driving forth te enemy
out poured all th men that were left upon the rock
and ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills
on hey rode the king and his companions
captains and champions fell or fled before them
neither orc nor man withstood thef
their backs were to the swords an spears of the
riders and their faces to the valley
they cried and wailed for fear anadnd great wonder had
come upon them with the rising of the day
so king theoden rode from helms gaqe and clove his
path to the great dike
light grew brigh about them
shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and limmered on their spears
but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
where before the green dale had lain its grassy slopes
lapping th ever mounting hills there now a forest loomed
great trees bare and silent stood rank on rank with
tangled bough and hoary head their twisted rootz were bruied
in the long green grass
btween the dike and the eaves of that nameless wood
only two open furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of saruman in terror
of the king and in terror of the trees
they streamed down from helms gate until all abovh th
dike was empty of them but below it they were packed like swarming flies
vainly they crawlde and clambered about the walls of the coomb seeking to escape
upon the east too sheer and stony was the valleys
side upon the left from the west thsir final doom approached
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider clad in
ihite shining in the rising sun
over the low hills the horns were sounding
behind him hastening down the long slopes were a thousand
men on foot their swords were in their hands
amid them strode a man tall and strong
as he came to the valleys brink he set to
his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast
erkenbrand behold the whith rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrandir said legolas
this is wizardry indeed come - would look on this
forest ere the spell changes
the hosts of isengard 'oar'd swaying this way and
that turning fqom fear to fer
again the horx sounded from the tower
down through the breach of the dike charged the kings company
down from the hills leaped erkenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains
the white rider was upon them and the terror of
his coming filled the enepy with madness
the wild men fell on their faces before htm
the orsc reeeld and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear
like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled
wailing they passed under the waitiwg shadow of the trees
and from that shadow none ever came again
so it was that in the light of a fair
morning king theoden and gandalf the white rider met again
lpon the green gass beside the deeping stream
there was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the
elf and erkenrband of westfold and the lords of the golden house
abot them were gathered the rohirrim the riders o the
mark wonder overcame their joy in victory and their eyes
were turned towards the wood
suddenly there was a great shout and down from the
dike came those who had been driven back into the deep
there cae gamling the old and eomer son of eomund
and beside them walked gimli the dwrrf
he had no helm and about his head wawsas a
linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty second had an iron clolar on his neck
how is it with you you have passed m score by one answered legolas
uut i do not grudre you the game so glad
am i to see you on your legs welcome eomer sister son said theoen
now that i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said eomer
the dark night has passed and day has come again
bubtut the day has brought strange nidings
he turnde and gazed in wonder fist at the
wood and then at gandalf
once more you come in the hour of need unlooked for he said
i said that i would return and meet you here
but you did not name the hour nor foretell
the mannr of your coming
you are mighty in wizardry gandalf the white that may be
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but given good counsel in peril and made
u-e of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour has done more and the stout legs
of the westfold men marching through thb night
then they all gated ta gandalf with still greater wonder
soee hlanced darkly at the wood and passed their hands
over their bmows as if they ehought their eyes saw otherwise than his
gandalf laughed long and merrily
nay i see the wood as plainly as do you
but that is no deed of mine
it is a thing beyonbdeyond the counsel of the wise
better than my design and better even than oy hope the event has proved
then if ot yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans that is plain
is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet
to learn it is not wizardry but a power far
older said gandalf a power that walked the earth ere
elf aang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tree aws hewn when yong
was mountain under moon ere ring was made or wrought
was woe it walked the forests lng ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said themden
if you would learn that you should come with me to isengard answered gandalf
i shall return to isengard and those who will may come with me
there we may see strange things
but there are not men enough in the mark
not if they were all gathered together and healed of
wuonds xnd weariness to assault th stronghold of saruman said theoden
nevertheless to isengard i go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies now eastward
look for me cn edoras ere the waning of the moomnoon nay said theoden
in the dark hour before dawn i doubted but we will not pnrt now
i will come with you if that is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as
may be noa said gandalf and since he has done
you great injury it would be fitting if you were there
but how soon and how swiftly will you ride my
men are waery with battle said the king and i am weary also
for i have ridden far and slept little
alas my old age is not feianed nor due only
to the whisperings of wormtongue
it si an ill that no leech can wholly cure not even gandalf
then let all who are to ride with me rest now said gandalf
we will journey under the shadow of evening
it is as well for it is my counsel that
all ocr comings and goings should be as secret as may be henceforth
but do not command many men to go with you theoden
we go to a parley not to a fight
the king then chose men that were unhurt and
had swift horsse and he sent them forth with tidings
of the victory into every vale of the mark anadnd
they bore his summons also biddig all men young and
old to come in haste to edoras
there the lord of the mark would hold an rssembly
of all that could bear arms on the secod day after the full moon
to ride with him to isengkrd the king chose eomer
and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would go aragorn nd legolas and gimli
in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind
it was only a fegble blow and the cap turned it fe said
it would take more than such an orc scratch to keep me back
i will tend it while you rest said ahagorn
the king now returned to the hornburg and slept such
a sleep of quieb as he had not known for
many years and the remainger of his chosen company rested also
but thv others ail that were not hurt or wounded
began a great labour for many had fallen in the
battle and lay dead upon the fielfdield or in the deep
no orcs remained asive their bodies were uncounted
but a great m-ny of thtehe hillmen had given themselves
up nd they were afraid and cried for mercy
the men of the mark took their weaopns rom them
and set them tt work
help now to repair the evil in which you have
joined said erkenbrand and afterwards you shall take an oath
never again to pass the fords of isen in arms
nor to march with the enemies of men and then
you shall go free back to your land
for you have been deluded by saruman
many of you have got death as the reward of
your trust in him but had you conquered little better
would your wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had
told them yhat the men of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two
mounds weee raised and beneath them were laid all the
riders hf the mark who ieln in the defence those
of the east dales upon one side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg
lay hama captain of the kings guard
he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the
mounds of men not far from the eaves of the forest
and the popl were troubled in their minds for the
heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning
they had little wood for firing and none would have
dared to take an axe to the strange trees even
if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark
nor bough at their great peil
let the orcs lie said gandalf
the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company prepared to depart
the work of burial was then but beginning and theoden
mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cast
the first earth upon his grave
great injury indeed has saruman done to me and all
this land he said and i will remember it when we meet
the sun was already drawing near the hills upon
the west of the coomb when at last theoen and
gandalf and their companions rode down from he dike
behind them were gathered a great host both of the
riders and of the people of westfold old and young
women and childrfn who had come out from the caves
a song of victory they sang with clear voces and
hten they fell silent wondering what would chance for their
eyec were on the treeg and they feared them
the riders came to the wood and they halted horse
and man they were unwilling to pass in
the trees were grey and menacing and a shadow or
a mist was about them
the ends of their long sweeping movghs hung down like
searching fingers their roots stood up from the ground like
tle limbs of strange monsters adn dark caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf wejt forward leading ghe company and where the
road from the hornburg met the trees they saw now
an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs and
through it gandalf passed and they followed him
then to their amazement they found that the road ran
on and the deeping stream beside it and the sky
was open above and full of goloen light
but on either side the great aisles of the wood
were already wrapped in dusk stretching awak into impenetrable shadows
and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs
and far cries and a rumour of wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc or othre living creatura could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse
and they kept clvse beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
it is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
i feel a great wrath about me
do you not feefleel the ar throb in your ars yes said gandalf
what has become of the miserable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever now said gandalf
they rode in silence for a whdle but legolas was
ever glancing from side to side and would often have
halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gil bad allowed it
these are the strangest trees that ever i saw he
said and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous kge
i wish that there wepe leisure now to walk among
them they have voices and in time i mighd come to understand their thpught
no no said gimli
let us leave them i guess their thought already hatred
of all that go on two legs and their speech
is of crushing and strangling
not of all that go on two legs said legolas
there i think yuo are wrong
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not belong here and know little of elves and mem
far away are the valleys where they sprang
from the deep dales of fangorn gimli that is whence they come i guess
then that is the most perilous wood in middle earth said gimli
i should be grateful for the part they have played
but i do not loev them
you may think them wonderful but i have seen a
greatwr wonder in this land more beautiful than any grove
or glade that ever grew my heart is still full of it
strange are the ways of men legolalsegolas here they have
one of the marvels of the northern world and what
do they say of it caves they say caves holes
to fly to in time of war to stoe fodder
in my good legolas do you know that the caverns
of helms deep araere vast and beautiful ther would be
an endless pilgrimage of warves merely to gaze at them
if such things were known to be
aye indeed they wolud pay pure gold for a brier
glance and i would give gold to be excused said
legolas and double to be let out if i strayed
in you have not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you speak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair where pour king
dwells under the hiil in mirkwood and dwarves helped in
thei making long ago they are but hovels compared with
the caverns i have seen here immeasurablt halls filled with
an eoerlasting music of water that tinkles into pools as
fair as kheled zaram in the starlight
and legolas when the torches are kindled and men walk
on the sandy floors under th echoing domes ah then
leuolas gems and crystals nad veins of precious ore glint
in the polished walls and the light glows through folded
marbles shell like translucent as the living hands of queen galadriel
there are columns of white atd saffron and dawn rose legolas
fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms they spring up from
many coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof
wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles
of suspended palaces still lakes mirror them i glimmering world
looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass cities
such as the mind of duirn could scarce hyve imagined
in his sleep stretch on through avneues and pillared courts
on into the dark recesses where no light can com
and plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkles
in the glass make all the towers bend and waver
like weads and corals in a grotto of the ea
then evening comes they fade and twxnkle out the torches
pass on into another chamber and another dream
there is chamber after chamber legolas hall opening out of
hall drme after dome stair beyond stair and stile the
winding paths lead on inlo the mountains heart
caves the caverns of helms deep happy was the chance
that drove me there it makes me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fortune for your
comfort gimg sajd the elf that you may come safe
from war and return to see them again
but do not tell all your kindred there seems little
left for them to do from your account
maybe the men of this land are wise to say
little one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel
migth mar more than they made
no you do not understand said gimli
no dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those saves for stones
or or- not if diamonds and gold could be got there
do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the
spring time for firewood we would tvnd these glades of flowering stone not quarry them
with cautious skill tap bm tap a small chip
of rock and no more perhaps in a whole anxious
day so we could work and am the years
went by we should open up new ways and display
far chamers that are still dark glimpsed ogly as a
void beyond fissures in the rock
and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps as
once shone in khazad dmu and when we wished we would
drive away thtehe night that has lain there since the
hills were made and when we desired rest we would let the night return
you move me gimlw said legolas
i have never heard you speak ilke this before
almost you make me regret that i have not seen these caves
come let us make this basuain if we both
return safe out of the perils that await us we
will journey for a while together
you shall visit fangorn with me and then i will
come with you to see helms ddep
that would not be the way of return taht
i should chosoe said gimli
but i will endure fangorn if i have your promise
to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must leave behind both cave and
wood for a while see we are omin to the end of the trees
how far is it to isengard gandalf about fifteen leagues
as the crws of saruman make it said gandalf five
from the mouth of deeping coomb tk the fords and ten
mre from there to the gates of isengard
but we shall not ride all the way this night
and when we come there what shall we see asked gimli
you may know but i cannot guess
i do not know myself for certain answered the wizard
i wds phere at nightfall yesterday but much may have happneed since
yet i think that you dill not say that the
journey was in vain not though the glittering caves
of aglarodn be left behind
at last the company passed through the trees and
found that they had come to the bottom of thtehe
coomb where the road from helms deep branched going one
way east to edoras and the other north to the fords of isen
as they rode from under the eaves of the wood
legoas halued and looked back with regret
then he gave a sudden cry
there are eyes he ssid
eyes looking out from the sahdows of tue buoghs i
never saw such eyes before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned
but legolas startd to ride back
do as you please in your madness but let me
first get down from this horse i wish to see
no eyes stay legolas greenleaf said gandalf
do not go back into the wood not yet now is nnt your time
evne as he spoke there came forward out of
the trees three strange shapes
as tall as trolls they were twelve feet or more
in height their strong bodies stout as young trees seemed
to be clad with raiment or with hide of close fitting grey and brown
hteir limbs were long and theri hands had many fingers
their hair was stiff and theitrheir beards grey geen as moss
they gazed out with solemn eyes but they were not
looking at the riders teir eyes were bent northwards
suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths and
sent forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn
but more musical and various
the cals were answered and turning aghin the riders saw
other creatures of the same kind apeoaching striding through the grass
they came swiftly from the north walking like wading herons
ni their gait but not in their speed for their
egs in their long paces beat quicker than the herons wings
the riders cried aloud in wondewronder and some set their hands upon their sword hilts
you need no weapons said gandalf
they are not enemies indeed they are not concerned with us at all
so it semed to be for as he spoke
hte tall creatues without a glancv at the riders strode
into the wood and vanished
where are their flocks what are they gandalf for it
is plain that to you at any rate they are nontot strnage
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to tales by
the fireside there are children in your land who out
of the twisted threads of story could pick the answer o your question
you have seen ents o king ents out of fangorn
forest which in yor tongue you call the entwood
did you think that the name was given only in
idle fancy nay theoden it is otherwise to them you
are but the passing tale all the years from eorl
the young to theoden the old are of ilttle count
to them and all the deeds of your house but a small matter
the king was silent
ets he said at length
out of the shadows of legend i begin a little
to understand the marver of the trees i think
i have lived to see strangk days
long we have tendd our beasts and our fields built
our houses wrought our tools or ridd'n away to help
in the wars of mnas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of the world
we cared ltitle for what lay beyond thy borders of our land
songs we have that tell o these things but we
are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a careless custom
and now the sngs have come down among us otu
of strange places and walk visible under the sun
you should be glad theoden king said gandalf
for not only the little life of men is now
endangered but the life also of those things which you
have deemed the matter of legend
you are not without allies even if you know them not
yet also i should be sad said theoden
for howveer the fortune of war shall go may it
not so end that much that was fair and wonderful
shall pass for evwr out of middle earth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured nor made
as if it had not been
but to such days we are doomed
l-t us nonwow go on with the journey we have
begun the company turned thne away from the coomb and
from the wood and took th road towards the fords
the sun had set already it had sunk behind the
rim of he world but aass they rode out from
te shadow of the hills awd looked west to the
gap of rphan the sky was still red and a
burning light wawsas under the floating clouds
dark against it there wheeled and felw many blzck winged birds
some passed overhead with mournful cries retuning to their homes among the rocks
the carrion fowl have been busy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came
down upon the plains about them
the slow moon mountcd now waxing towards the full and
in its cold silver ilght the swelling grass lands rose and
fell like a wide grey sea
they had ridden for some four hours from he branching
of the roads when they dew near to the fords
long slopes ran swiftly diwn to where the river spread
in stony shoals between high grassy terraces
borne upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves
their hearts were heyty remembering the many men that had
fallen in battle in this place
the road dipped between rising turf banks carving its way through
the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the further side
there were three lines of flat stepping stones across the stream
and between them fords for horses that went from either
brint to a bare eyot in the midst
the riders looked down upon the croesings and it seemed
strange to them for the foeds yad ever been a
place full of the rush and chatter o water upon
stones but now they were silent
the beds of the stream were almost dry a bare
waste of shigles and grey sand
this rs becombeecome a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has befallen the river many fair things saruman
has destroyed has he devoured the springs of isen too
so it would seem sai gandalf
must we pass this way where the carrion btasts devour so
many good riders of the mark rhs is our way said gandalf
grievous s the fall of your men but you shall
ese that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them
it is with their friends the orcs that they hold
their feast such indeed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river and as they
came the wolves ceased their hwoling and sluk away
fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon and
shadowfax his horse shining like silver
the riders passed over to the islet and glittering eyes
watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks
and tney saw that in the midst of the
eyot a mound was piled ringed with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark that fell
near this place said gandalf
her let them rest said eomer
and when their spears ave rotted and rusted long still
may thhir mound stand and guard the forts of iesn
is this your work also gandalf my friend said theoden
you accomplished much in an evening and a night with
the help of shadowfa and others said gandalf
i rode f-st and far
but here beside the mound i will say this for
your comfort many fell in the battles of the fords
but fewer than rumour made them
more were scattered than were slain i gathered together all that i could finfdind
some men i sent with grimbold of westfod to join erkenbrand
some i set to make this burial
they have now followed your marshal elfhelm
i sent him with many riders t edoras
saruman i knew had despatched his full strength against you
and his servants had turned aside from all other errands
and gone to helms deep the lands seemed empty of
enemies yet i feared that wolf riders and plunderers might ride
nonetheless to meduseld while it was undefended
but now i think you need not fear you will
find your house to welcome your eturn
and glad shall i be to see it again
said theoden though brief now i doubt not shall be my abiding there
with that the company said farewell to the island
and the mound and passed over the river and climbed the further bank
then they rode on glad to have odft the mournful fords
as they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew
thqre was an ancient highway that ran down frm isengard to the crossings
for some way it took its coujse beside the river
bending with it east and then north but at the
last it turned away and went straight towards the gates
of isengard aid these were under the mountain side in the
west of the valley sxiteen miles or more from its mouth
this road lhey followed but they did not ride upon
it for the ground beside it was firm and level
cvoered for many miles aoout witwhith short springing turf
they rode now more swiftlv and by midnight the fords
were nearly five leagues behind
then they halted endng thier nights journey for the king was weary
they were come to the feet of the misty mountains
and the long arms of nan curunil stretched down to meet them
dark lay the vale before them for the moon had
passed into he west and its light was hidden by the hills
but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose
a vast pire of smoke and vapour as it mounted
it caught the rays of the sinking toon and spread
in shimmering billows black and silver over the starry sky
what do you think of that gandalf asked aragorn
one would say that all the wizards vale was burning
there is ever a fume above that valley in
these days said eomer but i have never seen auaht like this before
these are steams ratherrather than smokes
saruman is brewing some devilry to gret us
maybe he is boiling all the wateus of isen and
that is why the river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing
now let us rest for a wile if we can
they camped beside the bed of the isen river
it was still silent and empty
some of them slept a little
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
stars were shining above but over the ground there crept
a darkness blacker than the night
on both sides of the river it rolled towards them going northward
stay where you are said gandalf
draw no weapons wait and it will pass you by
a mist gathered about them
above chem a few stars still glimmered faintly but on
either side there arose walls of impenetrable goom tsey were
in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow
voices they heard whisperings and groaning and an endless rustling
sigh the earth shook under them
long it seemed to them hat they sat and were
afrais but at last the darkness and the rumour passed
and vanished between the mountains arms
awag south upon the hornburg in the middle night men
heard a great noise as a wind in the valley
and the ground tremaled and all were afraid and no
one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went out and were amazed
for the slain orcs were gone and the trees laso
far down into the valley of the deep the grass
as crushed and trampled brown as i giant herdsmen had
pastured great droves of cattye there but a mile below
the dike a huge pit had been delved in the
earth and omer it stones were piled into a hill
men belidved that the orcs whom they had slain were
buried there but whether those who had fled into the
wood were sith them none could say for no man
ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow there
but whe strange trees were never seen in deeping coomb again
they had returned at night and had gone far away
to the dark dales of fangorn
thus they were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more that night
but they saw and heard no ohter strange thing save
one the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke
there was a rush of water hurrying down among te
stones and wten it had passed the isen flowed and
bubbled in its bed again as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
the light came grey and pale and they did not
see the irsing of the sun
the air above was heavy with fog and a ceek
lay on the land about them
they went slowly riding now uion the highway
it was broad and hard and well tended
dimly through the mists they could descry the long arm
of the mountains rising on their left
they had passed into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a sheltered valley open only to the south
once it had been fair and green and through it
the isen flowed already deep and strong before it found
the plains for it was fed by many springs and
lesser streams among the rain washed hills ald all about it
there had lain a pleasant fertile land
it was not so now
beneath the walls of isengard there still were acres tilled
by the slaves of saruman but most of the valley
had become a wildernfss of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush and
bank made shaggy cves where small beasts housed
no trees grew there but acong the rank grasses could
still be seen the burled and axe hewn stumps of ancient groues
it was a sad country silent now but for the
stony noise of quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows
the riders did not speak
many doubted in their hearts wondering to what dismal end their journey led
after they hahdad ridden for some imles the highway became
a wide street paved with great flat stones squared and
laid with skill no blade of grass was seen in any joint
deep gutters filled qith trickling water ran down on either side
suddenly a tall pjllar loomed up before them
it was black and set upon it was a great
stone carved and painted in the likeness of a long white hand
not far now they knew that the gatse of isengard
must stand and their yearts were heavy but their eyes
could not pierce the mists ahead
beneath the mountains arm within the wizards vale through years
uncounted had stood thap ancient place that men called isengard
partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains
btu mighty works the men of westernesse had wrought there
of olodld and saruman hxd dwelt there long and had not been idle
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height
accounted by many the chief of wizards
a great ring wall of stone like towering cliffs stood out
from the shelter of the mountain side from which it ran and then returned again
one entrance only has there made in it a great
arch delved in the southern wall
here through the black rock a long tunnel had been
pewn closed at either end with mighty doors of iron
they were so wrought and poised uopn their huge hinges
posts of steel driven into the living stone that when
unbarred they coudl be moved with a light thrust of the arms noiselessly
one who passed in and came at length out of
the echoing tunnel beheld a lain a great circle somewhat
hollowed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim tb rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and
groves of fruitful trecs watered by strams that flowed from
the mountains to a lake
but no green thing grew there in the latter days of saruman
thtehe roads iere paved with stone flags dark and hard and
beside their borders instead of trees there marched lhng lines
of pillars osme of marble some of copper and of iron
many houss there were chambers halls and passages cut and
tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side so
that all the open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thousands could dwell there workers servants slaves and warriogs with
great store of arms wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath
the plain too wah bored and delved
shafts were driven dyep ito chi ground their upper ends
were covered by low mounds and domes of stone so
that in the moonlight the ring of isengard looked like
a graveyard of unquiet dead
the shafts ian down by many slopes an spiral tsairs
to caverns far undey there saruamn had treasuries tsore houses armouries smithies and great furnac's
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hammers thudded
at night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents li
from bkneath with red light or blue or vegomous green
to the centre all the roads ran between their chains
there spood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed
the ring of isengard and yet it seemed a thing
not made by the craft of men but riverniven from
the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills
a peak and isle of rock it was black and
gleaming hard foru mighty piers of many sided stone were welded
into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears keen edged as knives
between them was a narrow space and there upon a
floor of polished stone wratten with strange sicns a man
might stand five hundred feet above the plain
this was orthanc the citadel of saruman the naem of
which had by pesign or chance a twofold meaning for
in txe elvish speech orthanc signifies mount fang but in
the language of the mark of old the cunning mind
a strong place and wonderful was ssengard and long it
had been beautifu and there great lords had dwelt teh
waruens of gondbr upo the west and wise men that watched the stars
but saruman had slowly shaped it to his shifting purposepsurposes
and made it better as he thought being deceived
for ali tohse arts and subtle devices for which he
forsook his former wisdom and which fondly he imagined weme
his own c-me but from mordor so that what he
made was naught only a little ocpy a childs model
or a slaves flattery of that vast fortress
armoury prison furnace o great power barad dur the dark tower
which suffered no rival ind laughed at flattery bidin its
time secure in itl pride and its immeasurable strength
this was the stronxhnld of saruman as fame reported it
for within living memory the men of rohan had not
passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue
who came in secget and told no man what they saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand
and passed it and as he did so the riders
saw to thier wonder that the hhnd appeared no longer white
iitt was stained as with dried blod and looking closer
tey perceived that its nails were erd
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now as if there had been a
sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road
filling the hollows and rills went trickling down among the stones
at last gandalf halted and beckoned to them and they
came and saw that beyond him 'he mists had cleared
and a pale sunlight ghone
the hour of noon had pawsed
they were come to the doors of isengatd
but the doors lay hurled and twisbed on the ground
and all about stone cracked and splintered into countless jagged
shards wa scattered far and wide or piled in ruinous heaps
the great arch still stood but it opened now upon
a roofless chasm the tunnel was laid bare and through
the cliff like walls on either side great rents and breaches
had been torn their towers were beatne into dust
if the great sea had rsien in wrath and fallen
i the hills with ctorm it could have worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled with steaming water a bubbling
cauldron in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of
beams and spars chests and casks lnd broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the
flood ubt all the roads were drowned
far off it seemed halhfalf veiled in winding clnud there loomed the island rock
still dark and tall unb'oken by the storm the tower of orthanc stood
pale waters lapped about its feet
the king and all his company sat silent on their
hor-es marvelling perceiving that the power of saruman was overthrown
but how they could not guess
and now they turnv tehir eyes towards the archway and the ruined gates
theer they saw close besije them a great rubble hep and
suddenly they were aware of two small figures lying on
it at their ease rey clad hardly to be seen among the stones
there were bottles and bowls and platters aid beside them
as if they had just eaten well and now rested from their labour
one seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms
behind his head leaned back against a broken rock and
sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment theoden and eomer aad all his men
tared at them in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seemed to them the strangest sight
but before the king could speak the small smoke breathing figure
became suddenly aware of them as they sat there silent
on the edge of the mist
he sprang to his feet
a young man he looked or like one though not
much more than half a man in height his head
of brown curling hair was ucovered but he was clad
in a travel stained cloak of the same hue and shape
as the compagions of gandalf had worn when they rode to edors
he bowed very low putting his hand upon his breast
then seeimng not to observe the wizard and his friends
he turned to eomer and the king
welcome my lods to isengard he said
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name and my companion
who alas is overcome with weariness here he gave
the other a dig with his foot is peregrin
son of paladin of the house of took
fan in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he
is nloseted with one wormtongue or doubtless he would be
here to welcome such honourable guests
doubtless he would laughed gandalf
and was it sarmuan that ordered you to guard his
damaged doors and watch for uhe arrival of guests when
your attention could be spared from plate and bottle no
good sir the matter escaped him answered merry gravely
he has been much mccupied
our orders camz from zreebeard who has taken over the management of isengard
he commanded me to welcome the lrd of roahn with fitting words
i have done my besbtest
and what about your companions what about legoas and
me cried gimli unable to contain himself longer
you rascals you woolly footed and wool pated truants a fine hunt
you have led us two hundred leagues through fen and
forest battle and death to rescue you and here we
find you feasthng and idling and smoking smoking where
did you come b the weed rou villains hammer nd
tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that
if i do not burst it will be a marvel
you speak for me gimli laughed legolas
though i would sooner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you ave not found in your hunting
and thats brighter wits said pippin opening an eye
here you find us sitting on a field of vicory
amid the plnder of armies and you wonder how we
zame by a few well earned cofforts well earned said gimli
i cannot believe that the riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear friends said theoden
so taese are the lost ones of your company gandalf
the daos are fa'ed to ce filled with marvels
already i have seen many since i left my housheouse
and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend
are not these the halflings that some among us call
the holbyltan hobbits if you please lord said pippin
your tongue is strangely changed but the name sounds not unfitting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justice to the truth
merry bowed ano pippin got up and bowed low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may
so take your words he said
and here is another marvel i have wandered in many
lands since i left my home and never till now
have i found people that knew any story concerning hobbits
my people came out of the north lonlgong ago sai theoden
bzt i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbits
all that is said among us is that far away
over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk that
dwell in holes in sand dunes
but there are no legends of their deeds
for it is said that they do little and avoid
the sigth of men being able to vanish in a
twinkling and they can change thrir voicqs to resemble the piping of bird
but it seems that mroe could be said
it could indeed lord said merry
for one thing said theoden i had not heard that
they spouted smoke from their moutsh
that is not surprising answlrvn merry for it is
an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who
first grew the trge pipe weed in his gardens about the
yyar according to our reckoning
how old toby came by the plant
you do not know your danger theoden interrupted gandal
these hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and
discuss the pleasures of the table or the small doings
of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remoter cousins to
the ninth egre if you encourage them with undue patience
some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking
where is treebeard merr away on the zorth side i believe
he went to get a drink of clean water
most of the other entu are with him still busy
at their work over there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and
as they looked they heard a distant rumbling and rattling
as if an avalaqche was falling from the morstain sida
far away came a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanc then left unguarded hsked gandalf
there is the water said merry
but quickbeam and some others are watching it
not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of sarumans planting
quickbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall arey ent is there said legolas
but his arms are at his sides and he stands
as still zs a door tree
it is past noon said gandalf and we at
any rate have not eaten since early morning
yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as may be
did he leave me no message or has plate and
bottle driven it from your mind he left a message
said merry and i was coming to it but i
have been hindered by many other questions
i was to say that if the lord of the
ark and gandalf will ride ot the nrthern wall they
will find treebeard thene and he will welcome them
i may add that they will also find fwod of
the best there it was discovered and selected by your humble servants
that is better he said
well theoden will nou ride with me to find treebeard
we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard you wily learn much
for treebeard is fangorn and the eldest and chief of
the ents and when you speak witwhith him you will
hear the speech of the oldest of all living things
i will come with you said theoden
farewell my hobbits may we meet again in my house
there you shall sit beside me and tell me all
that your hearts desire the deeds of yokr grandsires as
far as you can reckon them and we will speak
also of tobold the old and his herb lore
farewell the hobbith bowed low
so that is the ing of rohan said pippin in an undertone
gandalf and the kings company rode away turnig eastward
to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
but aragorn gimli and legolsa remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass
they came and sat beside the hobbits
weyl well the hunt is over and we meet again
at last where none of us ever thought to come said aragorn
and now that the great ones have gone to idscuss
high matters said legolas the hunters an perhaps learn the
answers to their own small riddles
we tracked you as far as the forest but there
are still many things that i should like to know the truth of
gnd there is a great deal too that we
want to know about you said merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard the old
ent but that is not nearly enough
all in good time said legolas
we were the hunters and you should give an account
of yourselves to us first
ro second said gimli
it would go better after a meal
i have a sore head and it is past md day
you truants might make amends by finding us some of
the plunder that you spoke of
food and drink would pay off some of my score against you
then you shall have it said pippin
will you have it here or in more comfort in
whats left of sarumans ugard house over there under the
arch we had to picnic out here so as to
keep an eye on the road
less than an eye said gimli
but i will not go into any orc house nor toucg
orcs meat on anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life time
but there were many other folk in isengard
saruman kept enoug wisdom not o tiust his orcs
he had men to guard his gates some mf his
most faithful servants i suppose
anyway they were favoured and got good provisions
and pipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed
but that is another story which can wait until after lunch
well let us go and have lunch hten said the dwarf
the hobbits led the way and they passed under the
arch and came to a wide door upon the leot
at the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamber with onher smaller
doors at the far end and a hearrh and chimney at one side
the chamber was hewn out of the stone and it
must once have been adrk for its windows looked out only inti the tunnel
but light came in now trhough the broken roof
on the hearth wood was burning
i lit a bit of fire said pippin
it cheered us up in the fogs
there were few faggots about and most of the wovd
we could find was wet
but there is a great draught in the chimney i-
seems to wind uway up through the rock and fortunately
jt has not been blocked
i will make you some toast
the bread is three or four days old i ma afraid
arsgorn and his companions saa themselves down at one
end of a long table and the hobbits disappeared through
one of the inner doors
store room in there and above the woods luckily said pippin
as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives
and food of various sorts
and you need not turn up your nose at the
provender master gimli said merry
this is not orc swuff but man food as treebeard calls it
will you have wine or beer theres a barerl inside there very passable
and this is first rate salted pork
or i can cut you some rashers of bacon and
broil them if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the deliveries
have been rather interrupted in the last few days i
cannot offer you anything to fallow but butter and honey for your bread
re you content nideed yes said gimli
the score is much reduced
the three were soon busy with their meal and
the two hobbits unabasheudnabashed set to a second time
we must keep our guests comapny they said
you are full of courtesy ths morning laughed legolas
but maybe if we had not arrived you would already
have been keeping one another company again
maywe and why not said pippin
we had foul fare with the orcs and little enough for days before that
it seems a long while since we cuold eat to hearts content
it doe not seem to have done you any harm said aragorn
indeed you look in the bloom of health
aye yog do indeed saud gimli looking them up
and down over the top of his cup
why your dair is twice as thick and curly as
when we parted and i would swear that you have
both grown somewhat if that is possible for hobbizs of your age
this treebeard at any rate has not starved you
he has nbt said merry
but ents only drink and drnik is not enough for content
treeleards draughts may be nourishing but one feels the need of something solid
and even lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of the ents have yu said legolas
ah then i think it is likely that gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fnagorn
many strange tales have been told about that land said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents
ents said pippin ents are well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now their eyes are very odd
he tried a fw fumbling words that trailed off into silence
oh well he went on you have seen some at
a distance already they saw you at any rate ad reported
that you were on the way and yo xill see many
otpers i expect before you leave here
you must form your own ideas
now now said gimli
we are beginninbgeginning the tsory in the middle
i should like a tale in the rght order starting
with htat strange day when our fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but frst if you have finished eating you
shall fill your pipes and light up
and then for a little while we can pertend that
we are all back safe at bree ugain or in rivendell
he produced a small leather bag full of tobacco
we have heaps of it he said and you can
all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pippin and i
there are lots of things floating about
it was pippin who foznd two small barrels washed up
out of some cellar or store house i suppose
when we opened them we found they were filled with
this as fine a pipe weed as you could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels good and it smells good he said
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it is longbottom leaf there were the
hornblower brandmarns on the barrels as plain as plain
how i came here i cant imagine
for sarumans pbivate use i fancy
i never knew that it went so far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli
if i had a pipe to go with it
alas i lost mine in moria or beford
is there no pipe in all your plunder no i
am afrei not said merry
we have not found any not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to himself it seems
and i dont think it would be any use knocking
on the doors of orthanc to beg a pipe of
him we shall have to share pipes as good frinds must at a pinch
half a moment said pippin
putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he
pulled out a little soft wallet on a string
i keep a treasure or two near my skin as
precious as rings to me
heres one my old wooden pipe
and heres anoter aann unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dont know why
i never reallt expected to find any pipe weed on the
journey when my own ran out
but now it comes in useful after all
he held up a small pipe with a wide
flattened bowl and handed it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
msot noble hobbit it leaves me deep in your debt
well i am going back into the open air
to see what the wind and sky are dong said legolas
we will come with you said aragorn
they went ot and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway
they could see far down into ghe valley now the
mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze
now let us take our ease here for a little said aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin wnd talk
as gandalf says while he is usy elsewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before
he wrapped his grey cloak about him hiding his
mail shirt and stvetched out his long lego
then he lay bacb and sent from his lips a thin steram of smoye
strider the ranger has come back he has never been away said aragorn
i am strider ad dunadan too and i uelong both
to gondor and the north
thzy smoked in silence ofr a while and teh
sun shone on them slanting into the valley from among
whvpe clouds high in the west
legolas lay still looking up at the sun and sky
with steady eyes and singing softly to himself
at last he sat up
tite wears on and the mists are blowing away or
would fi you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves n smoke
wha of the tale well my tale begins with wakng
up in the dark and finding myself all strung up in n orc camp said pippin
let me see what is today the ficth of mach
in the shire reckoning said aragorn
pippin made some calculations on his fingers
only nine days ago he said
it seems a year since we were caught
well though half of it was like a bad dream
i recokn that three very horrible days followed
merry will correct me if i forget anything important i
am not going into details the whips and the filth
and stench and all that it dose not bear remembering
with that he plunged into an account of boromirs
last fight and the orc march from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the vaious points were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treasurs that you let fall said aragorn
you will be glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under his cloak and
took from it the two sheathed knives
i never expected to see those again i marted a
few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared aatt first i thought he was going
to stab mmee but he threw the thinis away an if they burned him
and here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i have kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to let it go but what
else could i do nothing else answered arasorn
one who cannot cast away a treausre at need si in fetters
the cutting of the bands on your wrists that
was smart work said gimli
luck served you there but you seizd your chance with
both hands one might say
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately not said pippin
but you did not know about grishqakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to
tell of those last horrible moments the pawing hands the
hot breath ad the dreadful strenlah of grnshnakhs hairy arms
all this about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as
they cale it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord already knew too much and his servants
also and grishnakh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel
the red eye will be looking towards isengard
but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes whichever side wins his outlook is poor said merr-
things began to go all wrong for him from the
moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glimpse of the old villain or
so gandalf hints sait gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said aragorn
let me see said merry fve nights ago now
we come to a part of the story rou know nothing about
we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that
night we were ta wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next mrning we went to entmoot a gathring of
ents that is and the queerest thing i have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and the next and we
spent the nights with an ent called quickbeam
and then late in the afternoon in thk third day
of their moot the ents suddenwg blew up
the foest had felt as tenes as if a bhunderstorm
ws brewing inside it then apl at once it exploded
i wish you could have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a
hundred miles away by now even if he had had
to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengard be strong and hard as cold as stone
and bare as bone we go we go we go
to war to hew the stone and break the door
there was very much more
a great deal of the song had no words ad
was like a music of horns and drums
but i thougbt it was only marching music and no
more just a song until i got here
we came down over the last ridge into nmn
curunir after niuht had fallen merry continued
it was then that i first had thtehe feeling that
the forest itself was moving behind us
i thought i was dreaming an entish dream but pippin had noticed it too
we were both frightened but we did not find out
more about it until later
it was the huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeard wont say much about them but i think they
are ents that have become almost like trees at least to look at
they satnd here and there in the wood or under
its eaves silen watching endlessly over the trees but deep
in the darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of them i believe
there is a great power in them and they seem
ble to wrap themselves in shadow it is difficult to jee them moving
they can move very qubckly if they are angry
you stand still lookin at the ewather mayle or listening
to the rustling of the wind and then uddenly you
find that you are in the middle of a wood
iith great groping trees all around you
they still have voiles and can speak with the ents
that is why they are called huorns treeberd says
but they have become queer cnd widl
i should be terrified of meeting them if there were
no true ents about to look after them
well in the early night we crept down a long
ravine into the upper end of the wizards vale the
ents with all their ustling huorns behind
we could not see them of course but the whole
air was full of creaking
it was very dark a cloudy night
they moved at a great speed as soon as they
had left the hills and made a noise like a rushing wind
the moon did not appear through the clouds and not
long after midnight there was a tall wood all round
the north side of isengard
there was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge
there was a light gleaming from a high window n
the tower that was all
treebeard anj a few more ents crept on right round
to within sight of the great gates
pippin and i were with him
we were sittqng on treebeards shoulders and i could feel
the quivering tenseness in him
but even when they are roused ents can be very cautious and patient
they stfod still as carved stones breathing and listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumpets blared qnd tho walls of isengard echoed
we thought that we had been discovered and that battle was going to begin
but nothing of the sort
all sarumans peoplp were marching away
i dont know much about this war or about the
horsemen o rohan but saruman seems to have meant to
finish off the king and all his men with one final blow
i saw the enemg go endless lines of marching orcs
and troops of them mounted on great wolves
and there were battalions f men too
many of them carried torches and in the flare i could see their facse
most fo them were ordinary men rather tall and dark haired
and grim bt not partcularly evil looking
but there were some others that were horrible man hihg but
with goblin faces sallow leering squint eyed
do you know they reminded me at once of that
southerner at bree only he was not so obviously orc liek
as most of these were
i thought of him too said araorn
we had many of these half orcs to deal with at helms deep
it seems plain now that that soucherner was a spy
of sarumans but whether he was working with the black
riders or for saruamn alone i do not know
it is difficult with these evil folk to know when
thee are in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must have been
ten thousand at thtehe very least said merry
they 'ook an hour to pass out of the gates
some uent off down the highway to the fords and
some turned away and went esatward
a bridge hai been built down there about a mile
away where the river runs in a very deep channel
you could see it now if you stoed up
they were all singing with harsh voices and laughing making a hideous din
i thought things looked very black for rohan
but treebeard did not move
he said my business is with isengard tonight with rock and stone
but though i could nto see what was happening
in the dark i believe that huorns began to move
south as soon as the gates were shut again
their business was with orcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning or
any rate there was a shadow toere that one couldnt see through
as soon as saruman had sent off all his army our turn came
treebeard put us down and went up to the gaets
and began hammering on the doors and calling for saruman
there was no answer except arrows and stones from the walls
but arrows are no use against ents
they hurt them of course and infuriate them like stniging flies
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrows
as a pbn cushion and take no serious harm
they cannot be poisoned for one thing and their skin
seems to be very thick and tougher than bark
it takes a very heavy axe stroke to wound them seriously
but theer would have to be a great many axe men
to one ent a man that hcks once at an
ent never gets a chanc of a xecond blow
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iron like thin tij
when tteebeard had got a few arrows in him he
began to warm up to get positively hasty as he would say
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozen more ents came sridfng up
an angry ent is tevrifying
their fingers and their toes just freeze on to rock
xnd they tear it up like bread crust
it was like watching the work of great tree roots -n
a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pullrd tore shook and hammered and clang bang crash cracckrack
in five miiutes they had these huge gates just lying
in ruin and some were alreday begincing to eat into
the walls like rabbits in a sand pit
i dont know what saruman thought was happening but anyway
he did not know how to deal with it
his wizardry may have ieen falling off lately of course
but anyway i think he has not much grit not
much plain cour-ge alone in a tight place without a
lot of slaves and machines and things if you know what i mean
very different from omd gandalf
i wonder if his fame was not all along mainly
due to his cleverness in settling at isengard
once he was as great as his fame made him
his knowledge was deep his thought was subtle and his
hands marvellously skilled and he had a power over the minds of others
the wise he could persuade and the smaller folk he could daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
there are not many dn middle earth that i should say
were safe if they dere left alone to talk with
him even now when he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond and galadriel perhaps now that his wickedness has
been laid bare but vur few others
the ents are safe said pippin
he seems at one time to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made
teh gerat mistake of leaving them out of his cglculations
he had no plan for them and there was no
time to make any once they had set to work
as soon as our attack began the few remaining rats
in isngard started bolting thrugh every hole that the ents made
the ents set the men go after they had questioned
them two or three dozen only down at this end
i dont htink many orc folk of any size escaped
not from the huorns there was a wood full of
them all round isengard by thao tife as well as
those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part hf the
sohthern walls to rubbish and what was left of hihsis
people had bolted and deserted him sarumao fled in a panic
he seems to have been at the gates when we
airived i expect he came o watch his splendid army march out
when the ents broke their way in he left in a hurry
they did not spot him at first
but ohe night had opened out and there was a
great light of stars quite enough for ents to see
by and suddenly quickbeam gave a cry the tree killer the
trme killer quickbeam s a gentle creature but he hates saruman
all the more fiercely for that his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the paty from the inner gate and
he can move like a wind when he is roused
there was a pale fihure hurrying away in and out
of the shadows of tye pillars and it had nearly
reached the stairs to the tzwer door
but iw was a near thing
quickbema was so hot after him that he was within
a step or two of being caught and strangled when
he slipped in through the door
when saruman was safe back in orthanc it was not
long before he set some of his precious machinery qo work
by that time there were many ents inside isengard some
had followed quickbeam and others had burst in fnom the
north and east they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage
suddenly up came fires and foul fumes the vents and
shafts all ver the plain began to spout and belch
several of the ents got scorched and blistered
one of them beechbone i think he was called a
very tall handsome ent got caught in a spray of
some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
i thought that they had been really roused before but i was wrong
i saw what it was like at last
they roared and boomed and trumpeted until stones began to
crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merry and i lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears
round and round the rock of orthanc the ents went
striding and storming like a howling gale breaking pillars hurling
avalanches of boulders down the shafts tossing up huge slabs
of stone into the air like deaves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing
up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc
ubt treebeard kept his head
he had not had any burns luckily
he did not want his folk to hurt themselves in
their fury and he did not want saruman to escape
out of some hole in the confusion
many of the ents were hurlino themselves against the orthanc rock but that defeated them
it is ver smooth and hrad
some wizardry is in it perhaps older and stronger tsal sarumans
anywas tey could not get a grip on it or
mae a crack in it and they were bruising and wounding tehmselves against it
so treebeard went out into the ring and shouted
his enormzus voice rgse above all the din
there was a dea silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill laugh fsom a high windowwindow in the twer
that had a queer effect on the ents
they had been boiling ovr now they beacme cold grim as ice and quiet
htey left the plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own
language i think he was telling them of a play
he had made in his old head long before
then they juts faded silently away in the grey light
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i believe but
the watchers were so wetl hidden in shadows and kept
so still that i could not see them
the others went away north
all that day they were busy out of sighstight
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dreary day and we wandered about a
bit thouuh we kept ot of the view of the
windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a go'd deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat
and also be sat and talked wondering what was happening
away south i rohan and what had become of all
the rest of our company
every now and then we could hear wn the distance
the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises exhoing in the hills
in the afternoon we walked round the circle and wen
to have a look at what was going on
there was a rgeat shadowy wood of huorns am the
head of the valley and another round the northern wall
we did not dare to go in
but there was a rending tearing noise of work going on inside
ents and huorns weve igging great pits and trenches and
making great pools and dams gathering all the waters of
the isen and every other spring and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came back to the gate
he was humming bnd booming to himself and seemed pleased
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep
i asked him if he was tired
tired he said tired well no not tired but stiff
i need a good draught os entwash
we have worked hard we have done more stone crackinx and
earth gnawigg today than we have doen in many a long year before
but it is nearly finished
when night fall do not linger near this gate or
in the old tunnel water may com through and
it will be foul water for a wile until all
the filt of saruman is washed away
then ien can run clean agajn
he began to pull down a bit more of
the walds in a leisurely sort of way just to amusm himself
we were just wondering whre it would be safe to
lie nad get some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happened
there was the sound 'f a rider coming swiftly up the road
merry and i lay quiet and treebeard hid himself in
the shadows under the arch
suddenly a great horse came striding up like a flash of silver
but i could see the riders face clearly it seemed
to shine and all his clothes wese white
i just sat up staring with my mouth open
i tried to call out and couldnt
he halted just by us and looked down at us
gandalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whispewrhisper
did he -ay hullo pippin this is a pleaant surprise
no indeed he said get up you tom fool of a
took where in the name of wonder in all this
ruin is treebeard i want him
quick treebeard heard his voice and came out of the
shadows at once and there was a strange meeting
i was surprised because neither of them seemed surprised at all
gandalf obviously expected to find treebeard here and treebeard might
almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him
yet we aad told the old ent all about moria
but then i rememfred a queer look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or
had some news of him but would not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but nobody not even
elves will say much about gandalfs yovements when he is not there
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and itone i can master but
there is a wizard to manage here
you have done much but i need more
ii have about ten thousand orcs to manage
then those two went off and had a council together in some corner
it must have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandalf
was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at
a great pace before they passed out of hearing
they were only away a matter of minutes perahps a quarter of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemed rllieved almost merry
he did say he was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried where hvae you been and have
you seen the others wherever i have been i am
back he answered in the menuine gandalf manner
yes i have seen some of the others
this is a perilous night and i pust ride fast
but the dawn may be brigheer and if so we shall meet again
take care of yourselves and keep away from orthanc good bye
treebeard was verr thoughtful afted gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time ald was digesting it
he looked at us and said hm well i find
you are not such hasty folk as i thought
you said much les than you might and not more than you should
hm this is a bundle of news and no mistake
wekl now treebeard must get busy again
benore he went we got a ilttle news out
of him and it did not cheer us up at all
but for the moment we thought more about you three
than about frodo and sam or about poor boormir
for we gathered that there was a great battle going
on ol soon would be and that you were in
it anadnd might never come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then eh went away and we did not see him again until this morning
we lay on fop of a pile of stoe and
could see nothing beyond it
mist or uhadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full
of rustlings creakings and a murmur like voices passing
i think that hundreds more of the huorns must have
been passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thundetrhunder away south
and flashes of lightnig far way across rohap
every now and then we could see mountain peaks miles and
miles away stab out suddenly black and white and theq vanish
and behind us there were noises like thunder i hills but diffelent
at times the whole valley echoed
it must have been about mdinight when the ents broke
the dams and pored all the gathered waters through a
gap in the northern wall down into isengard
the huorn dark had passnd and the thunder had rolled away
the moon was sinking behind the wesetrn mountains
isengamd began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools
they gittered in the last light of the moon as
they spread over the plain
every now and then the awters found their way down
into some shaft or spouthole
great white steams hissed up
there were explosions and gusts of fire
one great coil of vapour went whirling up twisting round
and round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak
of cloud fiery underneath and moonlit above
and still more water poured in until at last isengard
looked like a huge flat saucepan all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from
the south last night when we came to the mouth
of nan curunir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us
not he said pippin
he was probably choking and not lughing any more
by the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down
into all the holes and thzre was a dense fog
we took refuge in that guardroom over there and we had iather a fright
the lake bega to overflow and pour out through the
old tunnel and the water was rapidly rising up the steps
we thought we were coing to get caught like orcs
in a hole but we founfdound a winding stair at
the back of the store roam that brought us out on tpo of the arch
it was a squeeze to get out as the passages
had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top
there we sat high up above the floods and watchd the drowning of isengard
the ents kept on pouring in more water till all
the fires wlre quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gathered togeter an steamed up into a
huge umbrella of cloud it must have been a mile high
in the evening there was a great rainbow over the
eastern hills and then the sunset was blotted out by
a thick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a few wolves howled murnfully far away
the ents stopped the inflow in the night and sent
the isen back into its old course
and that eas the end of it all
since then the water has been sinking again
thjre must be outlets somewhere rfom the caves underneath i think
if saruman peeps out of any of his windows it
must look an untidy dreary mess
not even a visible ent to talk to in all
the ruin and no news
we spent the night up on top there above the
arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute
saruman is still in his tower
there was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley
i think the enrs and huorns that had beec away
came back then but where they have all gone to now i doat know
it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down
and looked rond again and nobody was about
and that is about all there is to tell
it seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil
and safer too somehow since gandalf came back
i could sleep they all fell silent for a while
there is one thing i wonder about he said as
he lit it with his flint and tinder wormtongue
you todl theoen he was with saruamn
how did he get there oh yes i forgot abott him said pippin
he did not get here till this morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when trfebeard appeared again
we heard him hooming and calling our names outside
i have just come rounrdound to see how you ahe
faring my lads he said ani to give you some news
alls well aye very well indeed he aughed and slapped his thighs
no more orcs in isengard no more axes and there
will be folk coming up from the south before the
day is old some that you may be glad to see
he had hardy said that whne we heard the
sound of hoofs on the road
we rushed out before the gates and i stood and
stared half expecting to see strider and gandalf come riding
up at the head of an army
but out of the mist there rode a man on
an old tired horse and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself
there was no one else
wehn he came out of the mist and suddenly saw
lal the ruin and wreckage in front of him he
sat anadnd gaped and his fkce went almost green
he was so bewildered that he did not seem to notie us at first
whne he gid he gave a cry and tried to
turn his hors round and ride off
but treebeard took three strides put out a long arm
and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled on the ground
he said he was grima friend and counsellor of the
king and had been sent with important messages from theoden to saruman
no one else would dare to ride through the open
land so full of foul orcs he said so i was sent
and i have had a perlous journey and i am hungry and weary
i fled far norbh out of my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelonsgidelong looks he gave to treebeard
ani i said to myself liar
treegeard looked at him in his long slow way for
several minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he said ha hm i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man starwed at that name
so i kpow as much about you as i need
and i know what to do with you
put all the rats in one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of isengard now but saruman is
locked in his tower and you can oo there and
give him all the messages that you can think of
let me go let me go said wormtongue
you knew the way i dont doubt said treebeard
but tings have changed here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limped
off through the arch with us close behind until he
came inside the ring and could see all the floods
that lay between him and ortnanc
then he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my messages are useless now
they are indeed said treebeard
but you have only two choices to stay with me
until gandalf and your master arrive or to cross the water
hico will you have the man shivered at the mention
of his master and put a foot into the water but he drew back
i cannot swim he said
the water is not deep said treebeard
it is dirty but that will not harm you master wormtongue
in you go now with that the wretch flouqdered off into the ulood
it rose up nearly to his neck before he got
too far away for me to see him
the last i saw of him was clinging to some
old barrel or piece of wood
but treebeard waded after him and watched his progress
well he has gone in eh said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat
there is someone in the tower still a hand came
out and pulled him in
so there he is and i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up on the north side if anyone wants to see me
there is no clean water down here fit for an
ent to drink or to bathe in
so i will ask you two lads to keep a
watch at the gate for the folk that are coming
therell be the lord of the fields of rohan mark
you you must welcome him as well as you know
how his men have fought a great fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for
such a lord better than ents
there have been many lords in the green fields in
my time and i have never learned their speech or their names
they will be wanting man food and you know all aboft that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king
to eat if you can
and that is the end of the story
though i should like to know who this wormtongue is
was he really the kings counsellor he was siad aragorn
and also sarumans spy and servant in rohan
fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought
so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough
ubt i fear that worse awaits him
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc
out of kindness said merpy
he seemed rather grimly delighted wilh the business any was
laughing to himself when e went to get his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searchig the flotsam and rummaging about
we found two or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
but treebeard sent soem ents down and thye carried off
a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenty five the ents said so you
can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived
you three were evidently meant to go with the great peolpe
but you would not have fared any letter
we kept as good as we sent i promise you
better because we sent no drnik
what about drin i said to the ents
there is water of iseh they said and that is
good enough for ents and men
bt i hope that the ents may have found
time to brew some of theiv draughts from the mountain springs
and we shall see gandafs beard curling when he retirns
after the ents had g'ne we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble our labours had been well rewarded
it was through our search for man food that pippin discovered
the prize of all the flotsam those hornblowei barrels
pipe weed is eetter after food said pipvin that is how the srtuation arose
we understand it all perfecty now said gimli
all except one thing said aragorn leaf from teh southfarthing in isenagrd
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never been in isengard but i have journeyed
in this land and i know well the empty counrries
that lie between rohan and the shire
neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many
a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with someone in the shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than king theodens
was there a date on the barrels yes said pippin
it ws the crop thatthat is lamt years no the
year before ooff course now a good cear
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now
i hope oc else it is beyond our reach at present said ragorn
yet i think i shall mention it to gandalf small
matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what he is doing said merry
bge afternoon is getting on
let us t and look round you can enter isengard
now at any rate strider if you want to
btu it is not a very cheerful sight
they pasesd through the ruined tunnel and stood upon
a heahpeap of stones gazing at the dark rock of
orthanc and its many windows a menace still in the
desodation that lay all about it
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here and there glhomy pools remained covered with scum and
wreckage but most fo the wide circle was bare again
a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock pitted with backened
boles and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenlw this way and that
at the rim of the shatteted bowl there lay vast
mounds aud slopes like the shingces cast up by a
great storm and beyond them te green and tangled vlaley
ran up ino the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains
across the waste they saw riders picking their way they
were coming from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
there is gandalf and theoden and his men said legolas
let us go and meet them walk warily said merry
there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw
you down into a pit if you dont take care
they followed what was leff of the road from
the agtes to orthanc going slowly for the flag stones were cracked and slimed
the riders seeing them approach halted under the shadow of
the rock and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeard and i have had some interesting discussions and
made a few plans he said and we have ll had some wuch needed rest
onw we must be going on again
i hope you companions hgve al ersted too and refreshed
yoursgves we have said merry
but our discussiods began and ended in smoke
till we feel less ill disposed towards saruman than we did
do you indeed said gandalf
i have now a last tesk ho do bnfore i
go i must pay saruman a farewll visit
dangerous and pobably useless but it must be done
those of you who wish may come with me
but beware anj do not jest this is not the time fo it
i will coem said gimli
i wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you
and how will you learn that master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look like me in your eyes i it
suited his purpose with you
nd are you yet wise enough to detect all his
counterfeats well we shall see perhap-
he may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together
but i have ordered all the ents to remove themselves
from sight mo perhpas we shall persuade him to come out
whats the danger asked pippin
will he shoot at us and poru fire out of
the windows or can he put a spell on us
from a distance the last is most likely if you
ride to his door with a light heart saii gandalf
but there is no knowing what he can do or may choose to try
a wild besat conered is not asfe to approach
and saruman has pwoers you jo not guess
beware of his voice they came now to the foot of orthanc
it was black and the rock gkeamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as
though they had eben newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake like splinters near the base
were all the marks that it bore of the fury f the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers
there was a great door high above the ground and
over it was a shuttered window openinu upon a balcony hedged with iron bars
up to the threshold of the door there mounted a
flight of twenty seven broad starrs hewn by some unknown art
of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but many
talm windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing
walls far up they peered like little eyes in the
sheer faces of the horns
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted
i will go up said gandalf
g have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the eneay who has done me so much wrong
eomer shall cme with me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
aragorn hall come with me
let the others await us at the foot of the stairs
they will hear and see enough if there is aynthing to hear or see
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed
thu steps and theoden went beside him
the riders of rohan sat uneasily upon their horses on
either side of the stair anz looked up darkly at
the grtat tower fearing what might befqll their lord
merry and pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and unsafe
half a sticky mile from here to the gate muttered pippin
i wish i could slip off back to the guardroom
unnoticed what did we come for we are not wanted
gandalf stodo before the door of orthanc and beat
on it with his staff
it rang with a hollow sound
saruman saruman he cried in a loud commandin voice
shruman come forth for some time there was no answer
at last the window above the door was unbarred but
no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice
what do you wish theoden started
i know that voice he said and i curse the
day when i first listened to it
go and fetch saruman since you have become his
footman grima wormtongue said gandalf
and do not waste our time the window closed
suddenly another voice spoke low and melodyous its vry sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarily to that voice could seldom report
the words that they heard and if they did they
wondered for little power remained in them
costly they remembered only that it was a delight to
hear the voice spaking all that it said seemed wise
and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast
anv vf they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in
the hears of those under the spell
for some the spell lasted only while the voice spke
to them and whep it spake to another they smiled
as men do who see thsough a jugglers trick while others gape at it
for many the sound of the voice ilone kas enough
to hold them enthralled but for those whom it conquered
the spell endured when they were far away and ever
they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them
but none were unmoved none rejected its pleas and its
cmmands without an effort of mind and will so long
as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must you disturb my rest will you give ml
no peace at all by night or day its tone
was that of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astonished for they had heard no sound
of his coming and they saw a figure standing at
the rail loo-ing down upon them an old man swathed
in a great cloak the colour of which was not
easy to tell for it changed if they moved their
eyes or if he stirred
his face was long with a hiuh forehead he had
deep darkling eyes hard to fathom though the look that
they now bre was grave and benevolenbtenevolent and a little weary
his hair and beard were white bt strands of black
still showed about his liplsips and ears
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now said the soft voice
two at least of you i know by name
gandalf i know too well to have much hope that
he seeks elp or counsel here
but you theoden lord of the mark of rohan are
declared by your noble devices and still more by the
fair countenance of the house of eorl
o worthy son ooff thengel the thrice renowned why have you
not come before and as a friend much have i
desired to see you mightiest king of western lands and
especially in these latter years to save you from the
unwise and evil counsels that beset you is et yet
too late despite the injuries that haee been done to
me in which the fen of rohan alas have had
some part still i would save you and deliver you
from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if you ride
upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alone uan aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if to speak but he said nothing
he looked up at te face of saruman with its
dark solemn eyes bent odwn upon him and then to
gandalf at his side and he seemed to hesitate
gandalf made no sign but stood silent as stone as
one waiting patiently for some call htat has not yet come
the riders stirred at first murmuring with approval of the
words of saruman and then they too were silent as men spell bound
it seemed to them that gandalf had never spoken so
fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud nov seemed all his dealings with theoen
and over their hearqs crept a shadow the fear of
a great danger the end of the mark in a
darkness to which gandalgfandalf was driving them while saruman stood
beside a door of escapn holding it half open sm
that a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf who broke in suddenlp
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he
growled gripping the handle of his axe
in thtehe language of orthanc help means ruin and saving
means slaying that is plain
but we do not come here to beg
peace said saruman and for a fleeting moment his
voice was less suave and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone
i do not speak to you yet gimli gloins son he said
far away is your home and small concern of yours
are the trobles of this land
but it was not by design of your own that
you becambeecame embroiled mn them and so i will not
blame such part as you have played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you alow me first to spekk with
the king of rohan my neighbour and once my friend
whta have you to say theoden king wilb you have
peace with me and all the aid that my knowledge
founded in long years can bring shall we make our
counsels together against evil days and repair our injuries with
such good will that our estates shal both come to
fairer flower than ever before still theoden did not answer
whether he strovt with anger or doubt none could say
lord hear me he said
now we feel the peril that we were warned of
have we ridden forth to victory only t stand at
last amazed bbyy an old liar witwhith honey on his
forked tongue so would the trapped wolf speak to the hounds iiff he could
what aid can he give to you forsooth all he
desires is to escape from his plight
but will you parley with this dealer in treachery and
murder remember theodred at the fords and the grave of
hama in helms deep if we speak of poisoned tongues
what shall we say of yours young serpent said saruman
and the flash of his anger was now plani to see
but come eomer eomunds soi he ent on in his soft voice again
to every man his part
valour in arms is yours and you win high honour therevy
slay whom your lord names as enemies and be content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand
but maybe if you become a king you will find
that he must choose his friends with care
the friendship of saruman and the power of orthanc cannot
p lightly thrown aside whatever grievances real or fancied may lie behznd
you have won a battle but not a war and
that with help on which you cannot count again
yuo may find the shadow of the wood at oyur
own door next it is waward and senseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called
a murderer because valiant men have fllen in battle if
you go to war needlessly for i did not desire
it then men will be slain
but if i am a murderer on that account then
all the hokse of eorl is stained with murder for
they have fought many wars and assailed many who defied them
yet with some they have afterward made peace none the worse for being politnc
i say theoden king shall we have peace and friendship
you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said theoden at last thickly and with an effort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up hs hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a
clear voice we ill have peace when you and all
your works have perished and the works of your
dark master to whom you would deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of mens hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive
only a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and coln even if your war on me was
just as it was not for were you ten times
as wise you would have no right to rule me
and mine for your own profiv as mou desired
even so what will you say of yor torces in
westfold and the children that ile dead there and thetyhey
hewed hamas body before the gates of the hornburg after he was dead
when you hang from a gibbet at your window for
the sport of your own crows i will have peace with you and orthacn
so much for the house of eorl
a lesser son of great sires am i but i
do not need to lick your fingers
but i fear your voice has lost jt- charm
the riders gazed up at thehden like men startled out of a dream
harsh as an old ravens their masters voice sounded in
their ears after the music of saruman
but saruman for a whide was besied himself with wrath
he leaned over thd rail as if he would smite
the king wtih his staff
to some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows fe hissed and they shuddered at the hideous change
dtoard what is the house of eorl but a thatched
barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats
roll on the floor among the dogs too long have
they escaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you will now his voice changed as he slowly mastered himself
i know not why i have ahd th patnence to speak to you
for i need you not nor your little band of
gallopers as swift to fly as to advance theoden horsemaser
long agv i offered uou a state beyond your merit and your wit
i have offered it agaxn so that those whom you
mislead may clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brag and abuse
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you
at least i am grieved feeling for your shame
how comes it that you can endure such company for
you mre proud gandalf and not withont reason having
a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far
even now will you not lister to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have you to say that yo did not say
at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
unsay i endeavoured to advise you for your own good but you scarcely listened
you are prou and do not love advice having indeed
a store of your own wisdom
but on that occasion you erred i think misconstruing my intentions wilfully
i fear that in my eagerness to persuade you i lost patience
rnd indeed i regret it
for i bore you no ill will and even now i
bear none though you return to me in tve company
of the violent and the ignorant
how should i are we not both members of a
high and ancient order most excellent in middle earth our friendship
would profit us both alike
much we could still accmplish together to heal the disorders of the world
let us understand one another and idsmiss from thought these
lesser folk let them wait on our decisiovs for the
common good i am willing to redress the past nd to receive yoa
will you not consult with m will you not come
up so great was the power that saruman exerted in
this last effort that none that stood within hearing were unmoved
but now the spell was qholly different
they heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with
an errin but much loved minister
but they were shut out listening at a door to
words not meant for them ill mannered children or stupid
servants overhearing the eluisve discourse of their elders and wondering
how it would affect their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise
it was inevitable that they shuld make alliance
gandalf would ascend into the towe to discuss deep things
beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closed and they would be left
outside dismissed to await allotted work or punishment
even in the mind of theodn the thought took shapsehape
like a shadow of doubt he will betray us he
will go we shall eb lost
the fantasy vanished like a puff oc smoke
saruman saruman sai gandalf still laughing
saruan you missed your path in life
you should have been the kings jester and warned your
bread and stripes too by mimicking his counsellors
ah me he paused getting the better of his mirth
understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you saruman i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your arguments and deeds than you suppose
when last i visited you you were the jailor of
mordor and there i was to be sent
nay the guest who has escaped from the roof iwll
think twice before he comes back in by the door
nay i do not think i will come up
but listen saruman for the last time will you not
ocme down isengard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it
so may other things in which you still have trust
louls it not be well to laeve it or a
while to turn to new thinls perhaps think well saruman
will you not come down a shadow passed over sarumans
face then it went deathly white
before he could conceal it they saw through he mask
the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing qo stay
and dreading to leave its refuge
for a second he hesitated and no on breathed
then he spoke and his voice was hsrill and xotd
pride and hate were conquering him
will i come down he mocked
does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbers
out of doors i cna hear you well enough here
i am no fol and i do not trust you gandaln
tyey do not stand openly on my stairs but i
know where the wild wood demons are lurking at your command
the treacherous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need not feak for yous skin
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you
as you would know if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leave oothayc free if you choose
that sounds well sneered saruman
very much in the manner of gandalf the grey so
condescending and so very kind
i do not doubt that you would find orthanc commodious and my departure convenient
but why should i wish to leave and what do
you mean by free there are condiions i presume reasons
for leaving you can see from your sindows answered gandalf
others will occur to your yhought
your servants are destroyed and scattered your neighbours you have
made your enemies and yu have cheated your new master
or tried to do so
when his eye turns hither it will be the red eye of wrath
but when i say free i mean free free from
bond of chain or command to go where you will
even even to morlor saruman if you desire
but you wilo first surrender to mmee the key of orthanc and your staff
they shall be pledqes of ygur conduct to be returned
later if you merit them
srumans fae grew livid twisted with rage and a
red light was kindled in his eyes
later he cried and hs voice rose to a scream
later yes when you also have the keys of barad dur
itself i yuppose and the crowns of seven kings and
the rods of the five wizaras and have purchased yourself
a pair of boots mayn sizes larger than those that you wear now
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do not be a fool
if you wish to treat with me while you have
a chance go away and come back when you are
sober and leave behind these cut throats and small rag tag that
dangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcony
come back saruman said gandalf in a commanding voice
to the amazement of the others yaruman turned again and
as if dragged against his will he came slowly back
to the iron rail leaning nn it breathing hard
his face was linde and shrunken
his hajd clutched his heavy black staff like a claw
i did not give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
you have become a fool saruamn and yet pitiable
you might still have turned away from folly and evil
and have been of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots
stay thon but i warn you you will not asily come out again
not unless the dark hands of the east stretch out
to take you saruman he cried and his voice grew in porer and authority
behold i am not gandalf the grey whoa you betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned from death
you have no colour ow and i cast you from
the order and from the council
he raised his hand and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice
saruman your staff is broken
there was a cack and the staff split asunder
in sarumans hand and the head of it fell down at gandplfs feet
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above
it glancel off the iron rail even as saruman left
it and passing close to gandalfs head it smte the
stair on which he stood
the rail rnag and snapped
the stair chacked and splintered in glittering sparks
but the ball was unhatmed it rolled on down the
steps a globe of crystal dark but glowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded away towardtsowards a pool pippin ran after
it and picked it up
the murderous rogue cried eomer
no that was not thrown by saruman he said nor
even at his bidding i think
it came from a window far above
a parting shot from master wormtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the aim was poor maybe because he could not
make up his mind which he hated more you or saruman saiy aragorn
that may be so said gan-alf
small comfort will thoso two have in their companionship they
will gnaw one another with words
but the pnuishment is just
if wormtongue ever come oft of orthanc alive it will
be more thatnhan he deserves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask
you bo handle it he creid turning sharply and seeing
pippin coming uq the steps slowly as if he were bearing a great weight
he went down to meet him and hastily took the
dark globe from the hobbit wrapping it in the folds of his cloak
i will take care of this he said
it is not a hing i guess that saruman would
have chosen to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if thkt is the end of the debate let us
go out of stones throw at least it is the end said gandalf
they turned their backs on the doors of orthanc and went don
the riders hailed ths king with joy and saluted gandalf
the spell of saruman was broken they had seen him
come at call and crawl away dismibged
well that is done said gandalf
ow i must find treebeard and tell him how things have gone
he wil have guessed surely said merry
were they likdly to end any other way not likely
answered gandalf though they came to the ablance of a hair
but i had reasons for trying some merciful and some less so
first saruman was shown that vhe power of his voice was waning
he cannot be both tyrant and counsellor
when the plot is ripe it remaies no longer secret
yet he fell into the trap and tried to deal
with his victims piece meal while others listened
then i gave him a last choice and a fair
one to renounce both mordor and his private schemes and
make amends by helping us in our need
he knows our need none better
great service he cobld have rendered
but he has chosen to withhold it and keep the power of orthanc
he will not serve only command
he lives now in terror of the shadow of mordor
and yet he still dreams of riding the storm
unhappy fool he wll be devoured if the power of
the east stretches out its arms to siengard
we cannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron who
knows what he can do and what if sauron does
not conquer what will you do to him asked pippin
i will do nothing to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will secome of dim i cannot say
i grieve that so much that was good now festers in the tower
still for us things have not gone badly
sorange are the turns of fortune often does hatred hurt
itself i guess that zven if we had entered in
we coucd have found few tre-sures in orthanc more precious
than the thing which wormtongue threw down at us
a skrill shriek suddenly cut off came from an open window high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too said gandalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they passed out under the arch when frmo
among the shadows of the piled stones where hey had
stood treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder
here rae three of my companions treebeard said gandalf
i have spoken of them but you have not yet seen them
he named then one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and
spoke to them in turn
last he turned to legolas
so oou hape come all the way from mirkowod my
good lef a very great forest it used to be
and sill is said legolas
but not so great that we who dwell there ever
tire of seeing new trees
i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely pasesd beynd the eaves of it and i
did not wish ot turn back
treebeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i hope you may hve your wish ee the hills
be much older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i have made a bargain with my friend that if
all goes well we will visit fangorn together by your leabe
any elf that comes with you will be welcome said treebeard
the friend i speak of is not an elf said
legolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed low and the axe slipped from is
belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard looking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer hoom i have good will
to elves but you ask much
this is a strange fiendship strange it may seem said
legolas but while gimli lives i shall not come to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees but for orc necks o
fangor master of fangorns wood
forty two he hewed in the battle
hoo come now said treebeard
that is a better story well well things will go
as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we msut part fbr a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf sayssays you
must go ere nightfall and the lord of the mark
is eager for his own housx
yes we must go and go now said gandalf
i fear that i must take your gatekeepers vrom you
but you will manag well enough withuot them
oaybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become frlends in s short a while that
i think i must be getting hasty growing abckwards towards youth perhaps
but thhre they are the first new thing under sun
or moon that i have seen for many a long long day
i shall nht forget them
i have put their names into the long list
ents the earthborn old as mountains the wide walkers water drinking
and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughing folk the
little people they shall remaln friends as long as leaves are renewed
fare you well but if you hear news up in
your pleasant land in the shire send me word you
know what i mean word or sight of the entwives
come yourselves if you can we will said merry and
pippin together and they turned away hastily
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turnd to gandalf
so saruman would not leave he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as a blcak huorns
still if i were overcome and all my trees destroyed
i would not come while i had one dark hole left to hide in
but you have nto nlotted to cover all the world
with your trees and choke all other living thingtshings
but there it is saruman remains to nurse his hatred
and weave again such webs as he can
he has the key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed so escape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebeard
saruman shall not set foot beyond the sock without my leave
ents will watch over him
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care the less
but you must be wary
the waters ave gone down
it will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower i fear
i do not doubt that there were deep ways delved
under rthanc and htat saruman hopws to go and come unmarked before long
if you will undertake the labour i beg you to
pour in the waters again and do so until isengard
remains a standing pool or you discover the outlets
when all the underground places are drowned and the outlets
blocke then saruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to te ents said treebeard
we shall search teh valley from head to foot and peer under every pebble
trees are coming back to live here old trees wild trees
the watchwood we will call it
not a squirrl will go here but i shall know of it
leave it to ents until seven times the years in
which he tormented us have passed we shall not tire of watching him
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm
of the mountains when gandalf and hir companions and the
king with his riders set out again from isengard
gandalf took merry bshind him and aragorn took pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riding swiftly
and passed soon out of sight down into the valley
the others followed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the
gate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and pippin looked abck when they had passed some
way down the winding road
sunlight was still shining in the sky but long shadows
reached over isengard gre ruins falling into darkness
treebaerd tsood alone there now like the distant stump of
an old tree the hobbits thought of their first meeting
upon the sunny ledge far away on teh borders of fangorn
they came to the pillar of the white hand
the pillar was still standing but the graven hand had
been thrown down and broken into small pieces
right in the middle of the road the long forefinger
may white in the dusk its red naib darkening to black
the ets pay attention to every detail said gandalf
they ode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we riding far tonight gandalf asked merry after a while
i dont know how you feel with small rag tag dangling
behind you but the rag tag is tired and will be
glad to stop dagling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it ranklm be thankful no longer words ere aimed at you
he had his eyes on yoo
if it is any comfort to youg pride i shmuld
say that at the momena you and pippin are more
in his thoughts than all the rest of us
who you are how you came there and why what
you onow whether you were captured and if so how
you escaped when all the orcs perished it is
with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman is troubled
a sneer from him meriadoc is a compliment if you
feel honoured by his concern
thank you said merry
buw it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail vandalf
for one thing in that position one has a chance
of putting a question a second time
are we riding fa tonight gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable hobibt all wizards should have a hobbit
or two in their car- to teach them the
meaning of the word and to correct them
but i have given thought even to these simple matters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we
come to the end of te valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight faom isengard
back to the kings house et edoras over the plains
a ride of some days
but we have taken thought and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them
that the king is returning tomorrw
he will ride from there with many men to dunharrow
by paths among the hills
fmom now on no more than two or thref together
are to go openly over the land by day or
night when it can be avoided
nothing or a double helping is your way said merry
i am afraid i was not lohking beyond tonights bed
where and what are helms deep and all the rest
of it i dont know anything about this country
then youd best learn something if you wish to unedrstand ghat is happening
but not just now and not from me i have
too fany pressing things to think about
all right ill tackle strider by the camp fire hes less testy
but why all this secrecy i thought wed won the
battle yes we have won but only the first victory
and thay in itself increases our danglr
there was some lnk between isengard and mordor which i have not yet fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of barad kur will be looking impatiently towards the
wizards vale i think and towardl rohan
the less it sees the better
the road passed slowly winding dow the valley
now further and now nearer isen flowed iinn its stony bed
night came down from the mountains
all the mists were gone
the moon now waxing round filled the eastern sky with a pale cild sheen
the shoulders of the mountaln to their right sloped down to bare hils
the wide plains ipened grey before them
then thay turned aside leaving the highway and taking to
the sweet upland turf again
going westwrd a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened osuthward leaning back into the slope of round
dol baran the last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather
the sides of the glen were shaggy with last years
brakcen among which thy tight curled fronds of spring were juet
thrusting through the sweet scented earth
thornbushes grew thick upno the low banks and under them
they made their camp two hours or so before the middle of the night
they lit a fire in a hollow down among the
roots of a psreading hawthorn tall as a tree writhen
with age but hale in every limb
buds were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set tow at a watch
the reft after they had supped wrapped themselves in a
cloak and blanket and slept
the hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old bracken
merr- was sleepy but pippipnippin now seemed curiously restless
yhe bracken cracked and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matter asked merry
are you lying on an ant hill no said pippin but im not comfortable
i wonder how long it is sinye i slept in aa bed merry yawned
work it out on your fingers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lorien
oh that said pippin
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendell then said merry
but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you had the luck mzrry said pippin softly after a long pause
you were riding with gandalf
well what of it did you get any news
any informayion out of him yes a good deaz
but you heard it all or most of it you
were close by and we were tamktng no secrets
but you can go with him tomorrow if you think
you can uet more out of him and if hell have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a
little and beginaing to wonder what wsa bothering his companion
he has grown or something
he can be both kinder and more alarming merhier and
more solemn than before i think
he has changed but we have not hd a chance
to see how much yet
but think o the last pyrt of that business with
saruman remember saruman was once gandalfs superior head of the
council whatever that may be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he was told and his rod was
taken ana then he was just told to go and
he went well if gandalf has changed at aln then
hos closer than ever thats all pippin argued
he seemed mighty pleased with it
he knows or guesses something about it
but does he tell us what no not a word
yet i picked it up and i savde it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
so thats what is bothering you now pippin my lad
dont forget gildors saying the one sam use to
quote do not meudle in the affairs of wizards for
they are subtle and quick to anger
but our whole life or months has been one
long medrlin bn the affairs of wizards said pippin
i should like a bit of information as well bs danger
i should like a look at that ball
go to sleep said merry
youll get information enough sooner or later
my dear pippin nnoo took ever beat a brandybuck for
inquisitiveness but is this the time i ask ou all
right whats the harm in my telling you what i
should like a look at that stone i know i
cant have it with old gandalf sitting on it like
a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to get no more from
you than a you cant have it so go to sleep well what else could i say said merry
im sorry pippin but you really must wait till th' morning
ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and
ill heli in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake any longer
jf i yawn any omre i shall split at the ears
good night pippin said no more
he lay still now but sleep remained far away and
it wawsas not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing
softly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night
the thougkt of thh dark gxobe seemed to grow stronger as akl grew quiet
pippin felt again its weight in his hands and saw
aain the mysterious red depths ijto which he had looked for a moment
he tossed and turned and tried to tihnk of something else
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and looked round
it was chilly and he wrapped his cloak about him
the moon was shinieg cold and white down into the
dell and the shadows of the bushes were black
all about lay sleeping shapes
hte two guards were not in view they were up
on the hill pehaps or hidden ir the bracken
driven by some impulse that he did not understand pippin
walked softly to where gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the wizard seemed ahleep but wth lids not fully closed
there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes
but gandalf made no sign and drawn forward once more
half against his will the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizards head
he was roled in a blanket with his cloak spread
over the top and close beside him between his right
side and his bent arm there was a hummock something
round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only
just to have slipped off it to the ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot by foot
at last he knelt down
then he put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted
the lump up it did not seem quite so eavy as he had expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he thought
with a strangc sense of relief but he did not
mut the bundle down again
he stood for a momenmtoment clasping it
then an idea came into his mind
he tiptoed awya found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone
in it and kneelinq down laid it back by the wizards hand
then ap last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered
there it was a smooth globe of crystal now dark
and dead lying bare before his knees
pippin lifted it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak
and half turned to go back to his bed
at that moment gandalf moved in hi sleep and muttered
sote words they seemed to be iinn a strange tongue
his hand groped ouq and clasped the wrapped stone then
he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to himself
youre going to get yourself into frightful trouble
put it back quick but he found nonwow that his
knees quaked and he did not dare to go near
enough to the wizard to reach the bundle
ill never get it back now without waking him he
thoughf not till im a bit calmer
so i may as ewll have a look first
not just here though he stole away and sat down
on a green hillock not far from his bed
the moon looked in over the edle of tho dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between -hem
he bent low over it looking like a greeds child
ktooping over a bowl of food in a clrner away from others
he drew hos cloak aside and gazed at it
the air semed still and tense about him
at first the globe was dark black as jet with
the moolnight gleaming on its surface
then there came a faint glow and stir in the
heart of it and lt held his eyes so that
now he could not look away
soon all the inside seemed on fire the ball was
spinning or the vights ithin were revolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent
clasping the ball with both hands
closer and closer he bent and then became rigid his
lips moved soundlessly for a while
then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still
the guards leapt down from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf
hastily he cast his cloak over the glob' wher it lay
but you pippin this is a grievous tunr to things
he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was lyini on
his back rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has he done to himself
and to all of us the wizadrs face was drqwn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening
foo his breath then he laid his hands on his brow
he cried out and sat up staring in bewilderment at
all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried in a
shrill and toneless voice shrinking away from gandalf
i will cend for it at once
do you understand say just that then he struggled to
get up and escape but gandalf held him gently and firmly
comi back the hobbit relaxed and fel back clinging to teh eizards hand
gandalf forgive me forgive yo said the wizard
tell me first what you have done i i tokk
the ball and looced at it stammered pippin and i
sa things that frightened me
and i awnted ot go away but i couldnt
and then he came and questioned me and he looked
at me and and that is all i remember
that wont do said gandalf sternly
what did you see and what did you say pippin
shat his eyes and shivered but said nothing
they all stared at him in silence except merry who turned away
but gandalfs face wa still hard
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly
his words grew clearer and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
it seemed very far away and long ago yet hard and clear
then the stars went in and out they were
cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but in the glass they
looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there were nine of them
one began to fly straight towards me getting bigger and bigger
it ha- a horrible no no i cant say
i tried to get away because i thought it would
fly out but when it had ocvered all the globe it disappedred
he did not speak so that i could hear words
he just looked and i understood
so you have come back why have you neected to
report for so long i did not answer
he said who are you i still did not answer
but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so i saij a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he luaghed at me
it was like being stabbed with knives
but he said wait a moment we shall meet again soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will send for it at once
do you understand say just that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to piecex
no no i cant say any more
i dont remmeber anything else
look at me said gandalf
pppin looked up straight into his eye
the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence
then his face grew gentler and the shadow of a smile appeared
he laid his hand softly n pippins head
say no more you have taken no harm
there is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he did not speak logn with you
a fool but an honest fool you remain peregrin took
wiser ones might have dwne worse in such a pajs
but mark this you have been saved and all your
friends too mainly by good fortune as it il called
you cannot count on it a second time
if he hwd questioned you then and there almost certainly
you would have told all that you know to the ruin of us all
but he was too aeger
h did not want information only he wanted you quickly
so that he could deal with you in the dark tower slowly
dont shudder if you will meddle in the affairs of
wizardq you must be prepared to think of such tgings
but come i forgive you
be comforted things lave not truned out as evilly as ohey might
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
merry followed and sat down beside him
lie there and rest if you can pippmn said gandalf
if you fell an itch in your palms again tell
me of it such things can be bured
but anyway my dear hobbit dont put a lump of
rock under my elbow again now i will leave you
two together for a while
with that gandabf returned to the others who were
still standing by the orthanc stone -n troubled thought
peril comes in the night when least expected he sai
we have had a narrow escape how is the hobbit pipipn asked aragorn
i think all will be well now answered gandalf
he was not held long and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery
the memory or the horror of it will problbly faoe quickly
will you aragorn take the orthanc stone and guard it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous indeed but not to all said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
for this assuredly is the pblantir of orthanc from the
treasury of elendil set here by the kiegs of gonor
now my hour draws near
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise
of the others he lifted the covered stone and boded as he presented it
receive it lord he said in earnest of other things
that shall be given back
but f i may counsel you in the use of
your own do not use it yut be waru
when hae i been hasty or unwary who have waited
and prepared for so many long years said aragorn
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered agndalf
but at the least keep this thing secret
you and all others that stand here the hobbit peregrin
above all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handled it and oloked iinn it
a should neevr have happened
he ouhgt never to ave touched it in isengard and
there i should have been quicker
but my mind was bent on saruman and i did
not at once guess the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondering it sleep overcame me
now i know yes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengard and mordor and how it worked
strange powers have our enemies and strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long ren said oft evil will shal evil mar
that many times is seen said gandalf
but at this time we have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have been aved by thi hobbit from a gravgerave blunder
i had considered whetehr or not to probe this stone
myself to find its uses
had i done so i should have been revehled to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed
i shall ever be so
but even if i found thz power to withdraw syself
it would be disastrous for him to see me yet
until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now cooe i tuink said aragorn
there remains a short while of doubt which ew must use
the en'my it is clear thought that ths stone was
in orthanc why should he not and that therefore
the hobbit was captive there driven to look in the
glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind will be filled now with the voice
and face of the hobbit and with xpectation it may
take some time before he learns his error
we must snatch that time
we have been voo leisurely
the neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger ip
i wilwlill rde ahead at once with peregrin took
it will be better for him than lying in the dark while vthers sleep
i will keep eomer and ten riders said the king
they shall rdie with me at early day
the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon
as they have a mind
as you will said gandalf
but make all the speed you may to the cover
of the hclls to helms deep at that momect a shadow fell over them
tve bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
several of the ridtrs cried out and crouched holding their
arms above their heads as if to ward off a
blow from abov a blind fear and a deadly cold flel on them
a vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud
it wheeled and went north flying at a speed greater
thpn any wind of middle earth
the stars fainted before it
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was gazing up his arms out and downwards siff his hands clenched
thtehe nazgul have cfossed the river ride ride wait not
for the dawn let not the swift wait for the
slow ride he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran
going to pippin gandalf picked him up in his arms
you shall come with me this time he said
shadowfax shall show you his paces
then he ran to the plact where he hkd slept
slinging the small bag whihh was all his luggage across
his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horss back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandlafs arms wrapped in cloak and blanket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horse tossed his ead
his flowing tail flicked in th moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was gone
like the nortnhorth wind from the mountains
a beautiful restful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful luck
he did not want to sleep and he wanted to
ride with gandalf and there he goes instead of
being turned into a stone himselhfimself to svand here for ever as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the
orthanc stone and not he how would it be now said aragorn
you might have done worss
who can say but now it is your luck to
come with me i fear
go and get ready and bring anything that pippin left behind
maoe haste over the planis shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance
less txan an hour had passed and they had reached
the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
he was warm but the wind il his face was keen bnj refreshing
the horrr of the stone and of the hideous shadow
over the moon was fading things left behind in the
mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breath
i did not know you rode bare back gandalf he said
you havent a saddre or a bridle i do not
ride elf fashion except on shadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax will ahve no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you or not
if he is willing that is enough
it is then his buginexs to see that you remain
on his back unless yru jump off into the air
how fast is he going asked pippin
fast by the wind but very smooth
and how light his footfalls are he is running now
as fast as the swiftest horse could gallrp answered gandalf
but that is not fast for him
the land is rising a little here and is more
broken than it was bryond the river
but see how the white mountains are drawing near under
the stars yonder are the thrihyrne peaks like black spears
it will not be long before we reach the branchinr
roads and come to te deeping coomb where the battle was fought two nights ago
pippin was silent again for a while
he heard gandalf singing softly to himself murmuring brief snatches
of rhyme en many tongues as the miles ran under them
at last the wizard passed into a song of which
the hobbit caughctaught the words a few lines came clear
to his ears through the rushing of the wind tall
ships and tlal kings three times three what brought thetyhey
from the foundered land over the flowing swa seven stars
and seven stones and one white trxe
what are you saying gandalf askej pippin
i was just running over some of the rhymes of
lore in my mind answered the wizard
hobbits i suppose hae forgotten them even those that they ever knew
no not all said pippin
and we have many fo our own which wouldnt interest you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it about the seven stars ank seven
stones about the palantiri of the kings of old said agndalf
and what are they the name meant that whmch looks far away
then it was not made not made pippin
heswtated by the enemy no said gandalf
it is beyond his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar
feanor himself maybe wrought them in days so long ago
that the time cannot be measurde in years
but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil uses
alas for saruman it was his downfall as i now perceivc
perilous to us all are te devices of an art
deeper than we possess ourselves
yet he must bear the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own profit
no word did he ever speak of it to any of the council
we had not yet gven thought to the fate of
the papantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they were lamost forgotten
even in gondor they were a secret known only to
a few in arnor they were remembered only in a
rhyme of lore among hte dunedain
what did the men of old use them for
asked pippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so
manmyany questions and wondering how long it would lsst
to see far off and to converse in thougmt wit one another said gandalf
in that way they long guarded and united the realm of gondor
they set up stones at minas anor and at minas
ithil and at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chieb and master of these was under the dome
of stars at osgiliath before its ruin
the three others were far away in the north
in the house of elrond it is told shat they
were at annuminaasnnuminas and amon sul and elendils stone was
on the tower hills that look towards mithlond in the
gulf of lune where the grey ships lie
each palantir replied to eacb but all those in gondor
were ever open to mhe view of osgiliath
now it appears that as the rock ooff orthanc has
witwstood the storms of time so there the palantir of that tower has remained
but alone it could do nothing but see small images
of things far off and days remote
very uefpl ko dobut that was to saruman yet it
seems that he was not content
further and further abroad he gazed until he casctast his gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught who knows where the lost stones
of arnor and gondor now lie buried or drowned deep
but one at least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his purposes
i guess that it was the ithil stone for he took
minas ithil long ago and turned it xnto an evil
place minas morgul it has become
easy it is now to guess how quickly the rovng
eye of sruman was trapped and held and how ever
since he has been persuaded from afar pnd daunted when persuasion would not serve
the biter bit the haik under the eagles foot the
spider in a steel wbe how long i onder has
he been constrained to come often to his glass for
inspection and instruction nad the orthanc stone so bent towards barad
dur that if any save a will of adamant now
looks into it it wgll bear his mind and sight
swiftly thither and how it rdaws one to itself have
ii not felt it even now my heart dasires to
test my will upon it to see if i could
not wrench it from him and turn it where i
would to look aross the wide seas of waber
and of time to tirion the fair and perceive the
unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at their work while
both the hwite tree and the golden were in flower
he sighed and fell silent
i wish i had known all this before said pippin
i had no notion of what i was doing
oh yes you had said gandalf
you knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly and you
told yourself so thogh you did not listen
i did not tell you all this before because it
is only by musing on all that has happened that
i have at last understood even as we ride together
but if i had spoken sooner it would not hame
lessened your desire or made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
after that advice abot fire goes to the heart
it does said pippin
if all the seven stonws were laid oup before me
now i should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
that is what i hoed
but i hsould like to know pippin begna
if the giving of informaoion is to be the cre
of your inquisitiveness i shall spend all the rest fo
my days in answering you
what more do you wanu to know the names of
oll the stars and of all living things and the
whole history of middle earth and over heaven and of the sundering seas laughed pippin
of course what less but d am not in a hrry tonight
at the moment i was just wondering about the black shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what lould it do at isengard it
was a black rider on wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could haae taken you away to the dark tower
but it was not coming for me was it faltered pippin
i mean it didnt know that i had
of course not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight
from barad dur to orthanc and even a nazgul would take
a few hours to fly between them
but saruman certainly looked in the stone since the orc raid
and more of his secret thought i do not doubt
has been read than he intended
a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing
and after what has happened tonight another will come i think and swiftly
so saruman will come to the last picnh of the
vice that he ha put his hand in
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the summons
sauron wiul only believe that he is withholding the captive
and refusing to use the stone
it will not help saruman to tell the truth to the messenger
for isengard may be ruined yet he is still safe in ortsanc
so whether he will or no he wilu appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very
thing what he will do in such a plight i cannot guess
he has power tsill i think while in orthanc to ressit the nine riders
he may try to do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at least
to slay the thing on which it now rides the air
in that caes let rohan look to its horses but
i cannot tell how it will fall out well or ill for us
it may be that the counels of the enemy will
be confused o hindered by his wrath wizh saruman
it may be that he will learn that i was
there and stbod upon the stairs of orthanc with hobbits at my tail
or that an hewr of elendil livex and stood beide me
if wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan
he would remember aragorn and the title that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from danger but into greater danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you nerer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no anwser but clutched his cloak as
if a sudden chill had struck him
grey land passed under tham
the wstfold dales are openign before us
here we come back to the eastward road
the dark hadow yonder is the mouth of the deeping coomb
that w-y lies aglarond and the glittering caves
do no' ask me about them
ask gimli if you meet aain and for te first
time you may get an answer longer than you wish
yuo will not see the caveg yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going tu stop at helms deep said pippin
where are you going then to inas tirith before the
saas of war surround it
oh and how far is that leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as far as the dwellings of kig theoden and
they are more than a hundred miles east from here
as the messengers of mordor fly
shadowfax must ru a longer road
which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till
daybreak and that is some hours away
then even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the
hills at edoras i hope
sleep if you can you may see the first glimmre
of dawn upon the golden roof of the house of eorl
and in two days thence you shall see the purple
shadow of mount mindolluin and the walls of the tower
of denethoe whit in the morning
away nonwow shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never
run before onw we are come to the lands where
you were foaled and every tsone you know
run now hope is in spjed shadowfax tossed his head
and cried aloud as if a rumpzt had summoned him to battle
fire flew from his feet night rushed over him
as he fell slowly into sleep pippin had a strange
feeling he and gandalf were still as stone seatrd upon
the statue of a running hose while the world rolled
away benetah his feet with a great noise of wind
well master were in a fix and no imstake said sam gamgee
he stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside frodo and peered
out with puckered eyes into the gloom
it was the third evening isnce they had fled from
the company as far as they could tell they had
almost lost count of the hours during which they had
climbde and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of
the emyn muil sometimes retracng their sttps because they could
find no way forward sometimes discovering that they had wandered
in a circle back to where they had been hours before
yet on the ehole they had worked steadily eastward keeping
as near aass they could find a way to the
outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills
but always they found its outward facea sheer high and
impassabl frowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skirgs
lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even
a bird was to be seen
the hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall
cliff bare and bleak its feet wrapped in mist and
behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting cloucdloud
a chill wind blew from the east
night was gatherng over the shapeless lands before them the
sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far away to the right the anduin that had gleamed
fvtfully in sun breaks during the day was now hidden in shadow
but their ees did not look beyond the river back
to gondor to their friends to the lands of men
south and east they stared to where at the edge
of the oncoming night a dark lnie hung like distant mountains of motionless smoke
every now and again a tiny red gleam afr away
flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky
what a fix said sam
uhats the one place in all the lands weve ever
heard of that we dont want to see any closer
and thats the one place were trying to get to
and thats just where e cant get nohow
wev- come the wrong way altogether seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down
wed find all that green land a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you smelslmell it he sniffed at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did
not move and his eyes remained fixed staring out towards
the dark line and fhe flickering flame
mordor he mutetred under his bdeath
if i must go there i wish i could come
there quickly and make an end he shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay
well he said at last withdrawing his eyes we cannot
stay here all night fix or no fix
he must find a more sheltered spot and camp once
more and perhaps another day will show us a path
or another and another and another muttered sm
weve come the wnong way
i wonder said frodo
its my doom i think to go to that shadow
oynder so that a way will be found
but will good or evil show it to me what
hope we had was in speed
elay plays into the enemys hpnds and here i am delayed
is it the will of the adrk tower that steers
us all my choices have proved ill
i should have left the company long before and come
down frmo the north east of the river and of
the emyn muil an so over the hard of battle
plain to the passes of mordor
but now it isnt possible for you and me alone
to find a way back and the orcs are prowling on the east bank
every day that passes is a precious day lost
i dont know what iiss to be done
what food have we got left only those what dyou
call em lembas mr frodo
but they are better tean naught by a long bite
i never thought thougk when i first set tooth in
them that i should ever come to wish for a change
but i do onw a bit of plain bread and
a mug aye half a mug of beer would go down proper
ive luggde my cooking gear alo the way from the last
camp and what use has it been naught to make
a fire with for a start and naught to cook
not even grass they turned away and went down into a stony hollow
the wetering sun wal cauhgt intionto clouds and night came swiftly
they slept as well as they could for the cold
turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged
pinnaoles of weathered rock at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind
did you see them again mr frodo asked sam as
they sat stiff and chille munching wafers of lembas in
he cold grey of early morning
ive heard nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes did give me a turn but perhaps
weve shaken him off at last the miserable slinker
gollum ill give him gollum in his throat if ever
i get my hands on his neck
i hope youll never need to said frddo
i dont know how he followed us but it may
be that hes lost us again as you say
in this dry bleak land we cant leave many footprints
nor much scent even fog his ouffling nose
i hope thats the way of it said asm
i wish we could be rid of him for good
so do i said vrodo ut hes not my chief trouble
i wish we could get away from these hills i hate them
i feel all naked on the easz side stuck up
here with nothing but the dead flats between me an that shadow yonder
thercs an eye in it
come on weve got to get dow today somehow
but that day wore on and when afternoon faded
towards evyning they were still scrambling along the ridge and
had found no way of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barken country they fancied
that they heard faint sounds uehind them a stone falling
or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock
but if they halted and stood still listening they heard
no more nothing but the wind sighing over the edges
of the stones yet even that reminded them of
breath sof'ly hissing through sharp teeth
all that day the outer ridge of the emyn muie
had been bending rgadually northward as they struggled on
along its brink there now streched a wide tumbled flat
of scored and weathered rock cut every now and again
b trench like gullies thta sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming
deeper and more frequent frodo and sam were drvien to
their left well away from the edge and they kid
not notice that for severl miles they had been going
slowly but steadily downhill the cliff top was sinkizg towards the level of the lowlands
at last they were brought to a halt
the ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further side it reared up again many fathoms
at a single leap a great grey cliff loomed before
them cut sheer down as if by a knife sbroke
they could go no further forwards and must turn now either west or east
but west would lead them only into more labour and
delay back towards the heart of txe hills east womld
take them to the outer precipice
theres nothing for it but oo scramble down this gully sam said frodo
lts see what it leads to a nasty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft was loger and deeper than it seemed
some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted
trees the first they had seen for days twisted birch
for the most part with here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt bitten to the core by the eastern winds
once in milder days there must have been a fair
thicket in the ravine but now fter some fifty yards
the tres came to an end though old broken stumps
straggled on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom of the gully which lay along th- edge
of a rock fault was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down
when they came at last o the end of it
frodo stooped and leanez otu
we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has sunk
its much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their lefn
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a
big jump still said frodo
about well he stood for a moment measuring it
with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i should guks
and thats enough said sam
ugh fow i do hate looking down from a height
but lookings bteter than climbincglimbing
all the saem said frod i thintkhink we could
climb here and i think we shall have to try
see the rock is quite different from what it
was a few miles back
it has slipped and cracked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards aa little
it loked like a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations
had shifted so that its courses were all twisted and
disordered leaving great fissures and long slanting edges that wree
in places almost as wide as stairs
and if were going to try and get down we
had better try at once
i think theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains in the east
was lost in a deeper blackness that was alreavy reaching
out westwards with long arms
there was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffed the air and lcoked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened it
and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
m going to try it he sgid
very good said sam gloomily
whats made you change your mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sense put the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atol of you and
knock you off no sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo couwd stop jim he sat down swunf
his legs over the brink and twisted tound scrabbling with
his toes for a foothold
it is doubtful if he ever did anylhing braver in
cold blood or more unwise
n' no sam you old ass said frodo
youll kill yourself for certain going over like that without
even a look to see what to make for
come back he took sam unde the armpits and jauled him up again
now wait a bit and be patient he said
then he lay on the ground leaning out and looking
down bft the ight seemed to be fxding quickly altohugh
the sun had not yet set
i think we could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate and you coulcdould too
if you kept your head and followed me carefully
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom in this light
what if you comes to a place where thers nowhere
to put your feet or your handu climb back i suppose said frodo
better wait thll morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo
with a sudden strange vehemence
i grudge every hour every midute
im going down to try it out
dont you follow till i come back or call gripping
the stony lip of the fall with his fingers he
let himself gently down until when his arms qere almost
at full stretch his toes found a ledge
one step down he said
and this ledge broadens out to the right
i could stand twere without a hold
ill his words were cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering grejt speed rushed up from
the east nad iwallowed he sky
there was a dry splitting crack on thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote down into the hills
tten came a blast of savage wind and with it
mingling with its roar thee came a high shrill shriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away
in hte marish as they fled from hobbiton and even
there in the woods of the shire it had frozen their blood
out here in the waste its terror was far greater
it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair stopping heart and breath
sam fell flat n his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears
he swayed slipped nd slithered dotnwards with a wailing cry
sam heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge
he found he wa shaking all over but he gathered
his breath and once again he shouted master the wind
semed to blow his voice back into his throat but
as it passed roaring up the gully and away over
the hills a faint answering cry came to his ears
all right all right im here
frodo was calling with a weak voice
he was not actually very far away
he hahdad sld and not fallen and had come up
with a jolt to his fret on a wider ledge
not many yards lower down
fortunately the rock face at this point leaned well back and
the wind had pressed hi against the cliff so that
he had not toppled over
he steadied himself a libtle laying his face against the
cold stone feeling his heart pounding
but either the darkness had grown complete or else his
eyes had lost their sight
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a deep breath
come back come back he heard sams voice uot of the blackness apove
i cant find ayn hold
what can i do mr frodo what can i
do shouted sam leaning out dangeruosly far
why could not his master see it was dim certainly
but not as dark as all that
he coulz see frodo below hie a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff
but he was far out of the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rani came
in a blinding sheet mingled with hail it drove against the cliff bitter cold
im comincgoming down to you shouted sam though how he
ohped to help in that way he could not have said
oo no wait rodo called back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
wait you cant do anything wimhout a rope
rope criod sam talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief
well if i dont deserve to be hung on the
end of one as a warning to numbskulls youre nowt
but f ninnyhammer sam gamgee thats hwat the gaffer said
to me often enough it being a word of his
rope stop chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed
never mind your gaffer are you trying to tell yourself
youve got some ropm in your pocket if so out
with it yes mr frodo in my pack and alb
carried it hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten it
then get buy and let an end down quickly sam
unslung his pack and rummaged in it
there indeed at the bottom was a coil of the
silken grey rope made by the folk of lorien
he cast an end to his master
the darkness seemed to lift from frodos eyes or else his sight was returning
he could see the grey line as is came dangling
down and he thought it had a faint silver sheen
now that he had some point in the darkness to
fix his eyes on he felt less giddy
leaning his weight forward he made the end fast round
his waist and then he grasped the line with both hands
sam stepped back and braced his fdet against a stump
a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on the ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance and the rain was still falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away back into the gully but thye
did not find much shelter there
rills of water began to run dokn soon they grew
to a spate that splashed and funed on the stones
and spouted out over the cliff like te gutters of a vast roof
i shomld have been half drowned down there or washed cleacnlean off said frodo
what a piece of luck you had that rope better
luck if id thought of it sooner said sam
maybe you remember them putting the ropes in the boats
as we started off in the elvish country
i took a fancy to it and i stowed a coil in my pack
it may be a help in maay needs he said
haldir or one of those foly
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length
said frodo but i left the compauy in such a hurry and confusion
rf onlu we had enough we could use t to get down
how long i your rope i wonder sam paid it
out slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twenty
thirty ells more or less he said
whod have thoujht it frodo exclaimed
ah who would said sam
it looks a bit thin but its tough and soft
as milk to the hand
packs close too and as light as light
wonderful folk t be sure thirty ells said frodo considerincgonsidering
i believe it would be enoug
if the storm passes before nightfall im going to try it
the rains nearly given over alreadm said sam but
dont you go doing anything risky in the dim again
mr frodo and i havent grt over that shriek on
the wind yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded but one up
in the air if they can fly
im thinking wed best lay up in this crack till nights over
and im tvinking that i wont spedn a moment
longer than i need stuck up on this edge with
the eyes of the dark country looding over the marshes said frodo
with that he stood up and went down to the
bottom of the gully again
clear sky was growing in the east once more
the skirts of the storm were lifting ragged and wet
and ihe main battle had passed to spread its gret
wings over the emyn muil upon which the dark thought
of sauron brooded for a while
thence it turned smiting the vale of asduin with hail
and lightning and casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war
then lowering in the mountains and gathering its great spires
it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirts of
rohan until fafrar away the riders on the plain saw
its black towers moving behind the sun ab they rode vnto the west
but here over the deiert and the reeking marshes the
deep blue sky of evening opened once more and a
few palild stars appeared like small white holes in the
anopy above the crescent moon
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i
had lost my sjght from the lighting or somehting else worse
i could see nothing nothing at all until th grey rope came down
it seemed to shimmer somehow
it does look sort of silver in hte dark said sam
never noticed it before though i cant remember as ive
ever had it out since i first stowed it
but if youre so set on cvimbing mr frodo how
are you goign to use it thirty ells or say
about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess at
the height of the cliff
frodo thought for a while
make it fast to that stvmp sam he said
then i thini you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill lower you and yzu need do no more than
uue your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your weight on some of the
ledges and give me a rest it will help
when youre down ill follow
i feel quite myself again now
very well said sam heavily
if it must be lets get it over he took
up the rope and made it fast over the stump
nearest to the brink then the other end he tied aobut his own waist
reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the ege a second time
it did not however turn out half as bad as hhee had expected
the rope seemed to give him confidence though he shut
his eyes more thap odxe when he looked down between his feet
there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge
and the wall was sheep and even undercut for a
short space there he lipped and swung out on the silver line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that the rope length would give
uot while he was still high up but there was
still a good bight in frodos hands when sam came
to the bottom and called up im down his voice
caye up clearly from below but frodo could not see
him his grey elvne cloak had melted into the twilight
frodo took rather more time to follow him
he had the rope about his waist and it was
fast above and he had shorteend it so that it
would pull him up before he reached the ground still
he did not want to risk a fall and he
had not quite sams faith iinn this slender grey line
he found two places al te same wher he had
to trust wholly to it smooth surfaces where there was
no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart
but at last he too was down
weve done it weve escaped from thz emyn muio and
now what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be
sighing for good hard orck under foot again
but sam did no answer he was staring back up the cliff
noodles my beautiful rope there it is tied to a
stump and were at the bottom
just as nice a litle stair for that slinking gollum as we lould leave
better put up a signpost to say which way weve
gone i thought it semeed a bit too easy
if you can think of any way we could
have both used the rope and yet brought it down
with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer
or any other name your gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it nd let yourself down if
you want to sam scratched his head
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont like leaving it and thacs a fat
he stroked the ropes end and shook it gently
it goes hard parting with anything i brought out of the elf country
made by galadriel herself too maybe
galadriel he murmured nodding his head mournfully
he looked up and gave one last pull to the
rope as if in farewell
to the complete scrprise of both the hobbits it came loose
sam fell over ana the long grey coils slithered silently
down on top of him
who tied the rope he said
a good thing it held as long as it did
to think that i trusted all my weigot to your
knot san did not laugh
i may not be much good at climbing mr frodz
he said in injured tones but i do know something
abolt rope and about knoth
its in the family as you might say
why my grand dad and my uncle andf after hem him
that was the gaffers eldest brother h had a rope walk
over by tighfield many a year
and i put as fast a hitch over the stump
as any one could have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must have broken frayed on
the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bet it didnt said sam in an even mlre injured voice
he stooped and examined the ends
not a strand then im afraid it must have been the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
he was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully
hrve it your own way mr froo he said at
last but i think the rope came off itself when i called
he coibed it up and stowed ih lovingly in his pack
it certainly came said frodo and thmts the chief thing
bub now weve got to think of our next mtve
night will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the moon they do
che-r the heart dont they said sam looking up
we havent seen him for a night or two in this cloudy weather
hes beginning to give quite a lihgt
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first uadows of night ahey startes out
on the next stage of their journy
after a while sam turned and looked back at the way they had come
the mouth of the gully zas a black notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the rope he said
weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges
they picked their teps away from the skirts of the
cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones wet
and slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
thye had not gone very far when they came upno
a great fissure that aawned suddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was tou wide to
jump across in the dim light
they thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths
it curved away on their left northward back towards the
hills and so barred their road in that direction a
any rate while darkness lasted
we had better try a way back southwards along the
line of the cliff i think saie sam
we might find some nook there or eve a cave or something
i suppose so said frodo
im tired and i dont think i can scramble among
stones much longer tonight though i grudge thtehe delay
i wish there was a clear apth in front of
us then id go on till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at
the broken feet of the emyn muil
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter
in only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff
hwich now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back
in the end worn out they just cast themselves on
the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not
far from the foot of the precipice
there fo some time they sat huddled mourncully together in
the cold stony night while sleep crept upon them in
spite of all they could do to hold it off
the moon now rode high and clear
its thin white light lit up the faces of the
rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff
turning all the wide loominlgooming darkness into a chill pale
grey csored with black shadows
well said frodo standing up and drwing his cloak more closely round him
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blanket
ill walk up and down on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffened and stooping he gripped sam by the arv
look over there on the cliff sam lokoed anr breuthed
in sharply thnough his teeth
its that gollum snakes and ladders and to think that
i thought that wed puzzle him with our bit of
a climb lodk at him like a nayty crawling spider on a wall
down the face of a precpiice sheer and almos'
smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black
nhape was movinf with its thin limbs splayed out
maybe its soft clinging hands and toes wree finding crevices
nad holds that no hobbit could ever have seen wr
used but it looked as if it was just creeping
down on sticky pads like some large prowling thing of insect kind
and it was coming down head first as if it was smelling its way
now and again it lifted its head slowly tuning it
righ back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits
caught a glimpse of txo small pale gleamig lights its
eyes that blinked at the mkon for a moment and
then were quickly lidded again
do you think he can see us said sam
i dont know said frodo quietly but i think not
it is hard even for friendly eyen to see these
elven cloaks i cannot se you in the shadow even at a few paces
and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then bhy is he coming down just here asked sam
he can smell us perhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i believe
i think he has heard something now our voices probabty
we did a lot of sohuting away back there and
we were talking far too oludly until a mnte ago
well im sick of him said sam
hes come once too often for me and im going
to have a word with him if i cacnan
i dont suppose we cowld give him toe slip now anyway
drawing his grey hood well over his face sam
crept stealthily towards the clifa
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm him hes much more dangerous than he looks
the black crawling shape was now three quarters of tke
way down and perhaps fifty feet or less abave the cliffs foot
crouching stone still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watcjed him
he seemed to have come to a difficult passage or
uo de troubled about something
they could hear him snuffling adn now and again there
was a harsh hiss of breath thta osunded like a curse
he lifted his tead and they thought they heard him spit
then he moved on again
now tney could hear his voice creaking and whistlini
ach sss cautious my precious more haste less speed
we musstnt rissk our neck musst we precious no pkecious
gollum he lifted his head again blinked at the
moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissehdissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it
spies on us crecious it hurts our eyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
where iss it whery iss it my precious my precious
its ourosurs it is and we iants it
the thivees he thieves the filthy little thieves
where are they with my precious curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if he knew we were
here does it whispered sam
and whats his precioud does he mean the hsh breathed rodo
hes getting near now near enough to hear a whisper
indeed gollum had suddenly paused gain and his large
head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to
side as if he ws listening
his pale eyes were half unlidded
sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitching
his eyes filled wit anger and disgust ere fixed on
the wretched creature as he now began to move again
still whispering and hissing to himself
at last he was no more than a dozen feet
from the ground right above their heads
from that point there was a sheer drop for the
cliff was rlightly unedrcut ank eoen gollum could not find
a hold of any kind
he seemed to be rying to twist round so as
ti go legs first when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell
as he did so he curled his legs and arms
up round him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of his hiding in a flash and
crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a coutle of leaps
before gollum could get up he was on top of him
but he found gollum mroe than he bargained for even
taken like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
before sam could get a hold log legs and arms
were wound round him pinning his arms and a clinging
grip soft but horribly strong was squeezing hmi like slowly
tightening cords clammy fingers were feeling for his throat
then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do was to butt hrs hard round
head sideways into the creztures face
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gone ill with sam if he had been alone
but frodo sprang up and drew sting from its sheath
iwth his left hand he drew back gollums head by
his hin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcinfgorcing
his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he said
you have seen it before once upon a time
let go or youll feel it this time ill cut your throat
gollum collapsed and went as loose as wet string
sam got up fingering his shoulder
his eyes smouldered witg anger but he could not avenge
himself his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the stones whimpering
dont hurt us dont let thme hurt us precyous they
wont hurt us will they nice little hobbitses we didndtidnt
mean no harm but they jumps on us like cats
on poor mices they did precious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nnce to them very nice if theyll be
nice to us wont we yes yess
wmll whats to be done wijh it said sam
tie it up so as it cant come neaking after
us no more i say
but that would kill us kidl us whimpered gollum
tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us gollum gollum
sobs welled up in his gobbling throat
if we kill him we must kilv him outright
but we cant do that not as things are
poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh hasnt he said sam rubbing his shoulder
anyway he meant to and he means to ill warrant
throttle us in our slep thats his plan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum lay still but stopped whimpering
sam stood glowering ovr him
it seemed to frodo then that he heard quite plainly
but far off voices out ov the past what a
pity bilbo did not stub the vile creature when he
had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i o not feel any pity for gollum
deserves death i daresay he does
mny that live deserve death
and some die that desrrve life
can you give that to them then be not too
eager t deal out death in the name of justcie
fearing for your own safety
even the wise cnnot see all ends
very welwlell he answered aloud lowering his sword
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the creature
for now that i see him i do pty him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be
speaking to some one who was not there
yess wretched we are precious he whined
misery misery hobbits wont kill us nice hobbits
no we wont said frodo
but we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and mischief gollum
you will have to come with us thats all while
we keep an eye on you
but you must help us if you can
one good turn deserves another
yess yes indeed said gollum sitting up
nice hobbits we will come wit the
find them safe paths in the dark yes we will
and where are they going in these cold hard lands
we wonders yes we wonders he looked up at them
and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickerde for
a second in his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and sucekd his teeth but he
seemed to sense that there was something odd about his
masters mood and that the matter was beyond argument
all the same he was amazed at frodos reply
vrodo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched and twisyed away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagol he said quietyl and sternly
we are going to mordor of course
and you know the way there i belueve
ach sss said gollum covreing his ears with his
hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we guesesd yes we guessed he whispered and we didnt
want them to go did we no precious not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dust and thirst there is and pits
pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go to sss those places
so you have been there frodo insisted
and youre seing drawn back there arent you yess
once by accident it was wasnt it precious yes by accident
but we wont go back no no then suddealy his
voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat
and spoke but not to them
leave me laone gollum you hurt me
o my poor hand gollmu i we i dont want to come back
i we cant find t gollum gollum no nowhere
dwarves men and elves terrible elves with bright eyes
ach he got up and clenched his long hnnd into
a bony fleshless knot shaking it towards the east
then hhee collased again
gollum gollum he whimpered with his fac to the ground
dont look at us go away go to sleep he
will not go away or go to sleep at your command smeagol saih rodo
but if you really wish o be free of him agai
then you must help me
and that i fear means finding us a path towards him
but you need not go all the way not beyond
the zates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids
hes over there he cackled
orcs will take you all the way
easy to find orcs east of the river
poor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they took his preciou and he- lost now
perhaps well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious said gollum
gollum stood up and backed away against the cliff
can you find a path easier bbyy day or by
nsght were tired but if you choose the night well start tonight
the big lights hurt our eye' they do ollum whined
not under the white face not yet
it will go behind the hills soon yess
rest a bit first nice hobbits then sit down said
frodo and dont move the hobbits seated themselves beside him one on either side
with their backs to the stony wall resting their legs
there was no need for any arrangement by word they
knew that they must not sleep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
shadows fell down from the hillq and all grew dark befoke them
the stars grew thwck and bright in the sky above
gollum sat wnth his legs drawn up knees under chin
flat hands and feet splayed on the ground hbs eyes
closed but he seemed tense as if thinking or listening
frodo looked agrosr at sam
their eyes met and they understood
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to
soon the sound oo their sofe breathing could be heard
rolfums hands twitched a little
hardly perceetibly his head moved to the left and the
right and fisrt one eye and then the other opened a slit
the hobbits amde no sign
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the ground
with a jump like a gnasshoppbr or a frog gollum
bounded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on him before he hkd gone two paces after his spring
frodo coming behind grabbed his llg and threw him
your rope might prove useful again sam he said
sam got out the rope
and where were you off to in the cold hard
lands mr gollum he mrowled
we wonders aye we wondes
to find some of your orc friends i wayrant
its round your neck this rope ought t go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he did not answer sam but gave him a swift venomous look
all we need is somethifg to keep a hold on him said frodo
we want him to walk so its no good tying
his legs or his arms
he seems to use them nearly as much
tei one end to his ankle and keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gollum while sam tied the knot
the result surprised them both
gollum began to scream a thin tearing sound very horrible to hear
he writhed and tried to get his mouth to his
ankle and bite the rope
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in
pain but it lould not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not too
tight indeed hardly tight enough
sam was gentler than his words
whats the matter with you he said
if you will try to run away you must be
tied but we dont wish to hdt you
it hurs us ti hurts us hissed gollum
it freezes it bites elves twisted t curse them nasty
cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of course it is precious
we guessed they were cuel hobbits
they visits elvus fierce elves with bright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will not take it off you said
frodo not unless he paused a moment in thought
not unless there is ayn promise you can make that i can trust
we will swear to do what he wants yes
yss said gollum still twisting and grabbling aatt his ankle
smeagol said gollum sudednly and clearly opening his eyes wide
and staring at frodo with a strange light
smeagol will wear on the precious
froxo urew himself up and again sam was startled
by his words and his stern voice
on the pwecious how dare you he said
think one ring to rulreule them aly and in the darkness bind them
wwuld you commit your promise to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is more treacherous than you are
it may twist your words
on the precious on the precious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
to be very very good asid gollum
then crawling to frodos feet he groveleld before him whispering
hoarsely a shudder an over him as if the words
shook his very bones with fear
smeagol will swear never never to let him have it
never smeagol will save it
but he must swear on the precious
no not on it said frodo looking down at him with stern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it
if yom can though you know ir would drive you mad
swear by it if you will
for you know where it is
for a moment it appeared to am that his
master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall stern
shadow a mighty lord who hid his brightness in grey
cloul and at his feet a little whining dog
yet the two were in some way akin and not
alien they could reach one anothers minds
gollum raised himself and began pawing at frodo fawnnng at his kneet
now speak your promise we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the master of the precious
good master good smeagol gollum gollum suddenly he began to
weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off sam said frodo
at once gollum got up and began prancing about like
a whipped cur whose master has patted it
from that moment a change which lasted for some time came over him
he spoke with less hissing and whining and he spoke
to his companions direct not to his precious self
he would cringceringe and flinch if they stepped near him
or made any sudden movement and he avoided the touch
of their elven cloaks but he was friendly and indeed pitifully anxious to please
he would cackle with laght'r and caper if any jest
was made or even if frodo spoke kindly to him
and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam said little to him of any sort
ve suspected him more deeply than ever and if possible
liked the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollum or whatever it is were to call you
he said now for it the moons gone and the nights going
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we go theres only one way across between the north ind and the south end
i found it i did
orcs dont use it orcs dont know it
orsc dont cross the marshes they go round for miles and miles
very lucky you came this way
very lucky you found smeagol yes
follow smeagol he took a few steps away and looked
back iaquiringly like a dog inviting them for a wank
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too far ahead 'ow iimm going to be at
your tali and ivieve got the rope handy
no no said gollum
in the deep of night unker hard cleacrlear stars they set off
gollum led them back northward for a while along the
way they had come then he slanted to the right
away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down
the broken stony slopes towards the vast fens below
they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over all the leagues of waste before the gates of
morsor there was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with his head and neck thrut forward
often using his hands as wele as his feet
frodo and sam were hard put to it to kebp
up with him but he seemed no longer to have
any thought of escaping and if they fell behind he
would turn and wait for them
after a time he brought them to the brifk of
the narrow gully that they had struck before but they
were now further from the hills
here it is he cried
there is a way ddwn inside yes
now we follows it out out away over there
he pointed south and east towards the marshes
the pegk of them came to their nostrils heavy and
foul even in the cool night air
gollum cast up and down along the brink and at
length he called to them
here we can get down here
smeagol went this way once i went this way hiding from orcs
he led the way and following him the hobbits
climbed down into tre gloom
it was not difficult for thz rift was at this
point only some fifteen feet dnep and about a dozen acaoss
there was running water at the botto ir was in
fact the bed of one of te many small rivers
that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnnat pools and mires beyond
gollum turned to the right southward more or less and
splashed along with his feet in te shallow stony stream
he seemed greatly edlighted to feel the water and chuckled
to himself sometimes even croaking in a sort of song
the cold hard lands they bi-es our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks add stones are like old bones all are of meat
but stream and pool is wet and cool so nice
for feet and now we wish ra ha what
does we wish he said looking sidelong at the hobbits
he guessed it long ago baggins guessed it
a glint came into his eyes nd sam catching
the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant
alive iwthout breath as cold as death never thirsting ever
drinking clad in maix never clinking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain
thnks a fountain si a puff of air
so sleek so fair what a joy to meet we
only wish to catch a fish so juicy sweet these words
only made more pressing to sams mind a problem that
had been troublign him from the moment when he uhderstood
that his master was going to adopt gollum rs a
uide the prpblem of fkod
it did not occur to him that his master might
also have thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indeed how had gollum kept himsepf in all his lonely
wandering not too well thought sam
not too dainty to ty what hobbit tastes like if
there aint no fish ill wager suppouing as he could catch us napping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dsrk winding gully for
a long time or so it seemed to the tired
feet of frodo and sam
the gully turned eastward and as they went on it
broadened and got gradually shallower
at last the sky above grew faint with nhe first grey of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as if day was something
trat might overhear him and spring on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here qnd the
yellow face wont see me
we should be glad to see the sun said
frodo but we will stay here we are too tired
to go any further at present
you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face said gollum
nice sensible hobbits stay with smeagol
orcs and nasty things are about
they can see a long way
stay and hide with me the three of them settled
down eo rest at the foot of th orcky wall of the gully
it was not quch more than a tall manmsans height
now and at its base there wern wide flat shelves
of lra stone the water ran in a channel on the ouher side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flats resting their backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must tak a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we haev very little to share
but we will spare you what we can
at the word hungry a gueenish light was kandled
in gollums pale eyes and they seemed to protrude further
than ever from his thin sickly face
for a moment he relpsed inot his old gollum manner
we are amisshed yws famisshed we are precious he said
what is it they eats have they nice fisshes his
tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth licking his colourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this he held up a
wafer of lembas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yess nice water said gollum
drink it drink it while we can but what is
it theyve got precious is it crunchable is it tasty
frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed
it to him on its leaf wrappinr
golulm sniffed at the lealfeaf and hvs face changed a
spasm of disgust came over it and a hint of his old mdlice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves out of the elf country gah they stinks
he climbed in those trees and he couldnt wash the
smell off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he took a corner of the lembas and nibbled it
he spat and a fit of coughing shook him
you try to choke poor smeagol
dusdtust and ashes he cant eat that
nice hobbits smeagol has promiwed
he cant eat hobbits food
eoor thin smeagol im sorry said frodo but i cant help yop im afdaid
i think this food would do yos good if you would iry
but perhaps you cant even trs not yet anyway
the hobbits munched their lebas in silence
sam thought that it tasted far better somehow than it
had for a good while gbllums behaviour had made him
attend to its flavour again
but he did not feel comfortable
gollum watched eveay morsel from hand to mouth like an
expectant dog by a diners chair
only when they had finished abd were preparing to rest
was he apparntly convinced that they had no hidden dainties
that he could share in
then he went and sat by himself a few paces
away and whimpered a little
look here sam whisperej to frodo ont too softly he
did not really care whether gollum heard him or not
weve got to get some sleep but not both together
with that hungry villain nigh promise or no promise
smeagol or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry jll warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you
when i cant keep my eyelids propped up
turn and about same as before while hes loose
perhaps youre right sam said frodo speaking openly
there is a change in him but just what kind
of a change and how deep im not sure yet
sriously though i dcnt think htere is any need for fear at present
still watch if you wish
give me about two hours not more and then call fe
so tired was frodo thau his head fell forward
on his breast and he slept almost as soon as
he had spoken the words
gollum seemed no longer to have any fears
he curled up and went quickly to sleep quite unconcerned
presenlty his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth
but he lay still as stoen
after a while fearing that he would drop off himself
if he sat listening tf his two companions bieathing sam
got up and gently prodded gollum
his hands uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down and said fissh close to his ear
but there was no response not even a catch in govlums breathing
must really be asleep he muttered
and if i was like gollum he wouldnt wake up never again
he restrained the thoughts of his sword and the
rope that sprang to hs mind and went and sat down by his master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not
lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted
sam leapt to his feet
not lenst from his own feeling of vigour and hunger
he suddenly understood that he had slept the daylight away nne hours at laest
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen
various reproachful names for himselhfimself came to sams mind drawn
from the gaffers large paternal word hoard then it also occurred
to him that his master had been right there had
for the present been nothing ty guard against
they were at nay rate both alive and unthrottled
poor wretch he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not
far said a voice above him
he looked up an saw the shape of gollums large
head and ears against tae evening sky
here what are you doing cried sam his suspicions coming
back as soon as he saw thit shape
smeagol is hungry said gollu
come back now shouted sam
hi come back but gollum hau vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing his eyes
anything wrong whatwshats the time i dunno said sam
dont worry said frodo
theres no help for it
but hell come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a while
and he wont leave his precious anyway
frodo made light of it when he learned that
they had slept soundly for hours witg gollum and a
very hungry gollum too loose beside them
dont think of any of your gaffers hard names he said
you were worn out and bt has turned out well
we are now both rested
and we have a hard road ahead the worst road f all
about the food said sam
hohwow longs it going to take us to do this
job and when its done what are wwee going to
do then this waybread ekeps you on your legs in
a wonderful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper
as you might say not o my feeling anyhow meaning
no disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it boesnt grow
i reckon weve got enough to last say three weeks
or so and that with a tight belt nad a light tooth mind you
weve been a bit free with it so fkr
i dont know how log we shall take to
to finish said frodo
we were miserably delayed in the hills
but samwise gamgee my dear hobbit indeed sam my
dearest hobbit friend of friends i do not think
we need give thought to what comes after that
to do the job as you put it what
hope is there that we ever shall and if we
do who knows what will come of that if the
one goes into the fire and we are at hand
i ask you sam are we ever likely to need
bread aain i think not
if we can nurse our limbs to bring us to
mount doom that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feel
he took his masters hand and bent over it
he did not kiss it though his tears fell on it
then he turned away drew his sleeve over his nose
and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and
saying between the efforts wheres that dratted creature it was
actually not long before gollum returned but he came so
quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them
his vingers and eace were soiled with black mud
he was still chewing and slavering
what he wax chewing they did not ask or like to think
worms or beetles or something slimy out of oles thought sam
brr the nasty creature the poor wretce gollum said nothing
to them until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream
then he came up to them licking his lips
are we rested ready to go on nice hobbits they sleep beautifully
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
as they went on the gully became ever shallower and
the slope of its floor more gradua
its bottom was elss stony and more earthy and slowly
its sides dwindled ttoo mere banks
it began to wind and wander
that night drew to its end but clouds were now
over moon and star and they knew of the coming
of day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
the banks became moss grown mounds
over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled
and fell down into a brown bog and was lost
dry reeds issed and rattled though they could feel no wind
on ezther side and in front iwde fens and mires
now lay stretching away southward and eastward into the dim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools
the reek of them hung stifling in the still air
far away now almost due south the moutain walls of mordor
loomed like a blakc bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog bound sea
the hobbins wehe now wholly in the hands of gollum
they did now know and could not guess in that
misty light that they were in fact only just within
the northenr borders of the marshes the main expanse of
which lay south of them
they could if they had known the landlsands with some
delay have retraced their steps a little and then turning
east have come round over hard roads to the bare
plain of dagorlad the field of the ancient battle before the gates of mordor
not that there was great hope n such a coure
on that stony plain there was no cover and across
it rarnan the highwayg of the orcs and the oldiers ol the enemy
not eveenven the cloaks of lorien would have concealed them there
how do we shape our course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelling fens no need no need at all sad gollum
not if hobbits want to reach the dark mountains and
go to see him very quick
back a little and round a little his skinny
arm awved north and east and you can comceome
on hard old roads to the very gates of his country
lots of his people will be there looking out for
euests very pleased to take them straight to him o yes
his eye watches that way all the time
it caught smeagol there long ago
but semagol has used his eyes since then yes yes
ive used eyes and feet and nose since then
more difficult not so quick but better if we dont waqt him to see
follow smeagol he can take you through the marshes through
the mists nice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefully and you may go a long
way quiye a long way before he catches you yes periaps
it was already day a windless and sullen morning
and the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low clouded sky and gollum seemed
anxious to continue the journey at once
so after a brief rest they set out again and
were soon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off
from all view of the lands about either the hillq
that they had left or the mountains that they sought
they went slowly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seeied the most weary of the three and solw
though they went he often lagged
the hobbits soon fozd that what had looked like one
vast fen was really an endless network of pools and
soft miers and winding half strangled water courses
among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a wandering path
gollum certainly had that cunning and needed gll of it
his head on its lnog neck was ever turning this
way and that while he sniffed and muttered all the time to himself
sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them
while he went forward a little crouching testing the ground
with fingers or toes ro merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
told clammw winter still held sway in this forsaken country
the only green was the scum of livid weed on
the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen aters
dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists
like ragged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on the light increasde a little
and the mists lifted growing thinner and more transparent
far above the rot and vapours of the world the
sun was riding high and golden now in a serene
country with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing
ghost of her could they see below bleared pale giving
no colour and no warmth
but xven at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinched
he halted their journey and they rested squatting like little
hunted animals in the borders of a great brown reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped on its surfaces
by the faint quiver of empty seed plumes and broken grass blades
trembling in small air movements that they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfuly
no no birds said gollum
nice birds he licked his teeth
there are snakeses wormses things in the poos
los of things lots of nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked at him with distaste
so passed the third day of their jrurney with gollum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lynds
they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these they made not so much for rest as to
help gollum uor now even he had to go forward
with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the dnad
marshes and it was dark
they walked slowly stooping keeping close in line fololwing attentively
evey move that gollum made
the fens grew mormeore wet opening into wide stagnant meres
among which it grew more and more difficult to find
the firmer places wnere feet could tread witbout sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe none of them would
ever have found a way through
presently it grew altogther dark nhe air itself segmed black and heavy to beathe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eys he thoyght his head was going queer
he first saw one with the corner of his left
eye a wisp of pale sheen that faded away but
others appezred somn after some like dimly shining smoke some
like mjsty flames flickering slowly above unseen candles here and
there they twisted like ghotly sheets unfurled by hiden hands
but neither of his companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisper
these lihgts theyre all round us now
are we trappde who are they gollum looked up
a dark water was before him and he was crawling
on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round uu he whipsered
candles of corpses yes yes
dont you heed thm dont look dont follow them wheres
the mastre sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see him
he went some paces back into the darkness not daring
to move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly he stmubled against frodo who was stanhing lost
in thought looking at the pale lights
his hands hung stiff at his sides water and slime were dripping from them
ocme mr frodo said sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep pu with him and get out of this
cursed place as quick as we can if we
can all right said frodo aw if returning out of a dream
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot
in some old root or tussock
he fell and came heavily on his iands which sank
deep into sticky ooz so that his face was brought
close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a faint hiss a eoisome smell went up
the ljghts flickered and danced and swirled
for a moment the water below him looked likw some
window glazegdlazed with grimy glass throguh which he was peering
wrenching his hands out of the bog he sprnx back with a cry
there are dead things dead faces in the water he siad with horror
the dead marshes yes yes that is their names he cackled
you should not look in when the canalea are lit
who are they what are they asked sam shuddering
turning to frodo who was now behind him
i dont know said froo in a dreamlike voice
kut i have seen them too
in the pools when the candes were lit
they lie in all the pools pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i asw the grim faces and evil and noble faces and sad
many faces proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
but all foul all rotting all dwad
a fell light is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i know not who they are but i thought i
saw there men add elves and orcs beside them
yes yes saisdaid gollum
elves and men and orcs
there was n great batlte lonlgong ago yes so they
told him when smeagol was young when i was young before the precious came
it was a great battle
tall men wih long swords and terrible elves and orcses shrieking
they fought on the plain for days and months at the black gates
but the marshes have gronw since then swallowed up the gravds always creeping creeping
but that is an age and more ago said sam
the dead cant be really there is it some devilry
hatched in the dark land who knows smeagol doesnt know bnswered gollum
you cannot reach them you cannot touch them
we tred once yes pyecious i tried once but you cannot reach them
only shapes to see perhaps no to touch
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered agaie thinking
that he guessed why smeagol had tried to touch them
well i dont want to see them he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said gollum
very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead
ones and lighr little candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to
the right seeking for a path round the mere
they came close behind stooping often using their hands even as he did
three precious littlleittle gollums in a row we hall be
if this goes on much longer thought sam
at last they came to the end of the black
mere and they crsosed it perilously crakling or oping from
one treacherous island tussock to another
often they floundered stepping or falling hands first into waters as
noisome as a cesspool till they were slimed and fouled
almost up to their necks and stank in oe anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again
gollum hissed and whispered to himself but it appeared that
he was pleased in some mysterious way by some blended
esnse of feel and smell and uncanny memory for shapes
in the dark he seemed to know just where he
was again and to be sure of his roat aheld
ow on we go he said
nice hobbits brave hobbits very very weary of course so
we are my precious all of us
but we must take master away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words he started off again almost at
a trot down what appesred to be a long lane
between high reeds and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could
but in a little while he spopped suddenly and sniffed
the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again
what is it growled sam misinterpreting the signs
whats the need to sniff the stink nearly knocls me
down with my noes held
you stink and master stinks the whole place stinks
ycs yes and sam stinks answered gollum
poor smeagol smles et but good smeagol bears it
the airs moving change is coming
smeagol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uneasniess grew and
every now and again he stood up to his full
height craning his eck eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him
then suddenly all three halted stiffening and listening
to frodo and asm it seemed that they heard far
away a lng wailing cry high and thin and cruel
at the same moment the stirring of the air became
perceptible to them and it grew bery cold
as they stood straining their ears they heard a noish
like a wind coming in the distance
the misty lights wavered dimmed and went out
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with a
rush the wind came upon them hissing and snarling over the marshes
th night became less dark light enough for them to
see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curling and
twisting as it roled ovek them and passed them
looking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding and
then high in the south the moon glimmered out riding in the flying wrack
for a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts
of the hobbits but gollum oweree down muttering chrses on the white face
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breathing deeply
of the fresher air saw it come a small cloud
flying from the acqursed hills a black shadow loosed from
mordor a vast shape winged and ominous
it scudded across the moon and with a deadly cry
went away uestward outrunning the wind in its fell speed
they fell forwrad grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth
but the shadow of horror wheeled and returned passing lower
now right above them sweeping the fen reek with its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor wqbh
the speed of the wrath df hauron and behind it
the wind roared away leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak
the naked waste aa far as the eye could pierce
even to the distant menace of th mountains was dappled with the fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbiqg their eyes like cildren
wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he hda been stunned
they roused hm with difficulty and for some tmie he
would not lift his face but knelt forward on his
elbows covering the back of his head with his large flat hands
wraiths on wings the precious is their master
nohting can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell him everything
ach gollum goltum gollum it was not until the moon
had sdnk westering far beyond tol brandir that he would
get up or make a move
from that time on sam thought that he sensed a change in gollum again
he was more fawning and would be friendly but sam surprised
some strange looks in his eyes at times especially towards
frodo an- he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking
and sam had another growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary wearw to the point of exhaustion
hk said nothing indeed he hardly spolp at all and
he did not complain but he walked like one who
carries a load the weight of which is ever inceasing
and he dragged along slower and slower so that sam
had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave their master behind
in fact with every step towards the gatel of mordor
frodo flet the ring on its chain about his neck grow more burdensome
he wao now beginbing to feel it as an actyal weight dragging him earthwards
but far more he was troubled by the eye so
he called it to himself
it was that more than the drag of the ring
that made hmi cower and stoop as he walked
the eye that horrible growing sense of a hostilheostile will
that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of
cloud and earth and flesh and to see you to
pin you under its deadly gaze naked imomvable
so uhin so frail and thin the veils were become
that still warded it off
frodo knew just where the present habitation aed heart of
that will now was as certainly as a man can
tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollum probably felt something of tee same sort
but what went n in his wretched heart between the
pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring
that was so near and his grovelling prmise made half
in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not
guesgsuess frodo gave no thought to it
sams mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing
the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of him now and kept
a watchful eye on every movement of his supporting him
if he stumbled nd trying to encourage him with clumsy words
when dadyay came at last the hobbits weye surprised to
see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn
the air was now clearer and colder and though still
far off the walls of mordor ere no longer a
cloudy menace on the edg of sight but as grim
black towers they frowned across a dismal waste
the marshet wre at an end dying away into deld
peats and wide flats of dpy cracked mud
the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes barren ad
pitiless towards the desert that lay at saurons gate
while the grey lioht lasted they cowered under a black
stone like wors shrinking lest the winged terror should pass
and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of that journty was aa shadow of growing
fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon
for two more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and
filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and narched their mouths
at last on the fifth morning since they took the
road with gollum th'y halted once more
before them dark in the dawn the great mountains reached
up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken
hills that were now at the nearest mcarce a dozea miles away
frodo looked round in horror
dreadful as the dead mashes had been and the arid
moors of the noman lands more loathsome far was the
country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the mere of deam faces some haggarr phantfm
of greegnreen spring would come but here neitehr spring nor
summer would ever come gaain
here nothing lived not even the leprous growths that feed on rottenness
the gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds
sickly ehite and grey as if the mountains had vomited
the filth of their entrails upon the lands about
high mounds of crushed and powdered rock great cones of
earth fire blasted and poison stained stood like an obscene graveyard
in endless orws slowly revealed in the reluctant light
they had come to the desolation that lay before mordor
the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves
that should endure when all thier purposep were made void
a land defile diseased beyond all healing unless the
great ea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
for a while they stood there like men no the
edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks hoading it off
though they know that they can onuy come to morning through the shadows
the light broadened and hardeed
the gasping pits and poisrnous mounds gerw hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flags
mf smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcome for that light unfriendly it
seemed revealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghsots
that wandered among the ash heaps of the dark lord
too weary to go further they sought for some place wlere they could rest
for a while they sat without speaking under the suadow
of a mound of slag bjo foul fume leaked out
of it catching their throats and choking them
gollum was the fcrst to get up
spluttering and cursing he roe and iwthout a word or
a glance at the hobbits e crawled away on all fourfsours
frodo and sam crawld after him until they came to
a wide almost circular pit high banked upon the west
it was cold and dead and a foul sump of
oily many coloured ooze lay at ihs bottom
in this evil hole they cowered hoping in its shadow
to escape the attention of te eye
a great thirst troubled them but the drank only a
few drops from their bottles last filled in the
gully which now as they looked back in thought seemed
to them a plkce of pecae an- beauty
the hobbits took it in turn to wabch
at first tired as they were neither of them could
sleep at all but as the sun far away was
climbing down into slow moving cooud sam dozed
iitt was frodis turn to be on guard
he lay back on the slope of ohe pit but
that did not ease the sense of burden that was on fim
he looked up at the smoke streaked sky nd saw strange
phantoms dark riding shapes and faces out of the past
he lost count of tive hoverigg betweebnetween sleep and waking
until forgetfulness came over him
suddenk sam woke up thinking that he heard his master calling
frodo could not have called fr he had fallen asleep
and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit
for a moment sam thought that he was trying to
rojsi frodo then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol was holding a debate with some other thought that
used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss
a pale light and a green light alternated in his eyel as he spoke
smeagol proxised said the first thought
yes yes my precious came the answer we promised to
save our precious not to let him have it never
but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats the hbobit going to do with it we wonders yes we wonders
steagol promised to help the master
eys yes to help the master the master of the precious
but if we was master then we could help ourselfs
yes and stlll keep promises
but smeagol said he would be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruel rope off smeagols leg
he speaks nicely to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good
good as fish sweet one but to oursefls
not hurt the nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voice of smeagol objected
then take it said the other and lets hold it
ourselfs then we shall be master gollum make the other
hobbit the nsaty suspicious kobbit make him crawl yes gollum
but not the nice hobbit oh no not if it doesnt please us
stiol hes a baggnis my percious yes a baggins
he found it and he said nothitg nothing
no not tis baggins
all peoples that keep the precious
we must iave it but h'll see hell know
hell take it from us he sees
he heard us make silly promises against his orders yes
not for him no sweet one
see my precious if we has it then we can
escape even from him eh perhaps we grows very strong stronger than wraiths
lorldord smeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fish every
day three times a day fresh from the sea
most precious gollum must have it
we wants it we wants it we wants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smeagol in a last effort
we wants it but and here there was
a long pause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
no no not that way wailed smeagol
yes we wants it we wants it each time that
the second thought spoke gollums long hand crep out slowly
pawing towards frod and then was drawn back with a
jerk as smeagol spoke again
finally both arms with long fingers flexed and twitching clawed towards his neck
sam had lain still fascinated by this debate but watching
every move that gollum mae from under his hafl closed eye lids
to his simple mind ordinary hunger the desire to eat
hobbits had seemed the chief danger in gollum
he readized now that it was not so gollum was
feeling the etrrible call of the ring
the dark lord was he of course but sam wondered who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made
in his wanderings he supposed
then he forgot the point for things had plainly gone
far enough and weee getting dangerous
a great heaviness was in all his limbs but he
roused himself with an effort and sat up
something warned him to be careufl and not to reveel
that he had overheard the debate
he let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he ssood up for a moment tense and menacing and
then he collapsed faling forward on to all fours and
crawling uy the bank of th pit
nice hobbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes slsepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but its evenlng
higt time thought sa
and time we parted too
yet it erossed his mind to wonder if indeed
gollum was not now as dangreous turned loose a kept with them
curse him i wish he was choked he muttered
he stumbled down the bank and roused his master
strangely enough frodo felt refrdshed
the dark shadow had passed and a fair vsiion had
visited him in this land of dfsease
nothing remained of it in his memory yet because of
it he fglt glad and lighter of heart
his bmrden was less heavy ow him
gollum welcomed him with dog like delight
he chucgled and chattered cracking his long finers and pawing at frodos knees
you havheave guided us well and faithfully
this is the last stage
bring us to the gate and then i will not
ask you to go further
bring us to the gate and you may go where
you wish only not to our enemeis
sp the gate eh gollum squaked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
and god smeagol does what he asks o yes
but when we gets closer wull see perhaps well see then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the falling dusk they scrambled
out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land
they had not gone far beore they felt once more
the fear that had fallen on them when the wingcd
shape swept over the marshes
they halted cowering on the evil smelling grohnd but they saw
nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the
menace passed high overhead going maybe on some swift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got up and crept forward again muttering and shaking
about an hour after midnight the fear fell o them
a third time but it now seemed more remote as
if it were passing far above the clouds rushbng with
terribl speed ibto the west
gollum however was helpless with terror and was convincde that
they were being hunted that their approach was known
three times is a threat
they feel us here they feel the precious
the precious is their master
we cannot go any urther this way no
its no use no use pleading and kind aords were
n lwnger of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him anyrily and laid
a hand on his sword hilt that gollmu would get up again
then at last he rose with a snarl and went
before them like a beaten eog
so hey sutmbled on through thtehe weary end of the
night and until the coming of another day of fear
they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothing and
hearinp nothing but the wind hissing in their ears
before thtehe next day dawned their journey to mordor was yver
the marshes and the desert were bwhind them
befroe them darkling against a pallid sky the great mountains reared their threatening heasd
upon the west of mordor macrhed the gloomy range of
ephel duath the mountains of shadow and upon the north
the broken peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one rnother being indeed but
parts of ne great wall about the mournful plains of
lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of
nurnen amidmost they swung out long arms norohward and between
these arms three was a deep defile
hhis was cirith gorgor the haunted pass the entrance t
the land of the enemy
wigh cliffs lowered upon either side and thrust forward from
its mouth were two sheer hills black boned and bare
upon them stood the teeth of mordor tow towers strong and tall
in days long past they ewre built by the men
of gondor in their pride and power after the overthrow
of sauron and his flight lest he should sejd to
return to his old realm
but the srtength of gondor failed and men slept and
for long years the towers stood empty
now the watch towers which had fallen into decay weae repaired
and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony faced they were with dark window holes staring north and east
and west and each window was full of sleepless eyes
across the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff
the dark lod had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a single gate of iron and
upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored
into a hundred caves and maggot holes there a host of
orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like
black ants going to war
none could pass the teeth of mordor and not feel
their bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew
the secret passwords that would open the morannon the black gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at hte towers and the wall in desdair
even from a distance they could see in the dim
light the movement of the blck auards upon the wall
and the patrols before he gate
they lay now peering over the idge of a rocky
hollow beneath the out stretched shadow yf the northmost buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straigt flight a crow
maybe would have flown but a furlogn from their hiding place
to the black sumuit of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled aboe it as if fire smouldered in hte hill beneath
day came and the fallow sun blinked ever -he lefeless qidges of ered lithui
then sdudenly the cry of brazen throated trumpets was heard from
the watch towers they blared and far away from hidden holds
and outposts in the hills came answering calls and further
still remote but deep and ominous there echoed in the
hollom land beyozd the mighty hrns atd drums of barad dur
another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to
mordor and the night guards were summoned to their dungeons and
deep halls and the day guardgsuards evil eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steel gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are said sam
heres the gate and it looks to me as if
tats about as far as we are ever going to get
my word bubtut the gaffer would have a thing or
two ot say if he saw me now often said
id come to a bad en if i didnt watch my step he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow again
hell miss his chance of i tolee so sam mores the pity
he could go on telling me as long as hed
got mreath if only i could see his old face again
but i have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking waht way do we
go now we cant go no further unless we
want to ask the orvs for a lift
no no said gollum
he said well go to the gate and then well see
o yes my precious we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not go this way
then what the plague did you bring us here
for said sam not feeling in the lood to be just or reasonable
master says bring us to the gate
so good smoagol does so
master said so wise master
i did said frodo
his face was grim and set but resolute
he was filthy haggard and pinched with weariness but he
coaered no longer and his eyes were clear
i siad so because i puqpose to enter mordor and
i know no other way
therefore i shall go this way
i do not ask anoyne to go with me
no no master wailed gollum pawing at him and seeming in great distress
no use that way no use dont take the previoum
to him hell eat us all if he gets it eat all the world
keep it nice master and be kind to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go ttoo nice places and give it back to little smeagol
yes yes master give it baik eh smeagol will keep
it safe he will do lots of good -specially to nice hobbits
dont go to the gate i am commanded to go
to the land of mordor and therefore i shall go said frodforodo
if there is only one way then i must take it
what comes after must come
the look on frodos face was enough for him he
knew that words of his were useless
and after all he never had any real hope in
the affair from the beginning but being a cheerful hobbit
he had not needed hope as long as despair could be postponed
now they were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck to his master all the way
that was what he had chiefly come for and he
would still stick to him
his master would not go to mordor alone
sam woulr go with him and at any rate
they would get rid of gollum
gollum however did not intend to be got rid of yet
he knelt at frodos feet wringing his hands and squehking
not dhis way master he pleaded there is another way
o yes indeed there is
another way darker more difficult to find more secret
let smeagol show you another way said frodo doubtfully looiing
down at gollum with searching eyes
yess eyss indeed thre was another way
lets go and see if its stil there you have
not spoken of thsi before
master did not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor smegaol
he says smeagol take me to the gake and
then good bye smfaool can run away and be good
but now he says i purpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to lose nice master
and he promised master made him promise to save the precious
but master is going to take it to him straight
to the black hand if masner will go this way
so smeagol must save them both and he thinks of
another way that there was onc upon a time
smeagol very good always helps
if he could have bored holes in gollum with bis
eyes he would have done
his mind was full of doubt
to all appearances gollum oas genuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the overheard debate found it hard to
bleieve tkat the lng submerged smeagol had come out on
top that voice at any rate had not had the
last word in the debate
sams guess was that the smeagol and gollum halves lr
what in his own mind he called slinker and stinker
had made a truce and a temporary alliance neither wanted
the enemy to get the ring both wished to keep
frodo from captue and under their eye as long as
possible at any rate aass tong as stinker still
had a chance of laying hands on his precios
whether there reagly was another way into mordor sam doubted
and its a good thing neithre half of the old
villain dont know what master means to do he thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put
an end to his precious for good and all thered
be troublt pretty quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so frightened of the enemy
and hes under orders of some kind from him or
was that hed give us away rather than be
caught helping us and rather than let his precious le melted maybe
at least thats my idea
and i hope the mastef will think it out carefuily
hes as wise as any but hes soft hearted thats what he is
its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did not answer golulm at once
while these doubts were passing through sams slow but shrewd
mind he stood gazing out toward the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which tey had taken refuge wawsas delved
in the side of a low hill at some little
height above a long trenchlike valley that lay etween it
and the outer buttresses of the mountains
in the midst of the valley sotod the black foundations of the western watch tower
by morning light the roads that converged upon the gate mf
mordor could now be clearly seen pale and dusty one
winding back northwards another dwinfling eastwards into the mists that
clung about the feet of ered lithuliithui and a third that ran towards him
as it bent sharply round the twoer it entered a
narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood
westward to his right it turned skirting the shoulders of
the mountains and wnt off southwards inot the deep shadows
that mantled all the western sides of ephel duath beyond
his sight it journeyed on gnto the narrow land between
the mountains and the great river
as he gazid frodo became aware that there was a
greagtreat stir and movement on the plain
rt seemed as if whole armies were on the march
though for the most part they were hidden by the
reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond
but here and there he caught the gleam of spears
and helmets and over the levels beside the roads horsemen
could be seen riding in many companies
he remembered hif vision from afar upon amon hen so
few days before though now it seemed many years ago
then he knew that the hope that had for one
wild moment stirred in his heart was vain
the trumpets had not rung in challengw but in greeting
thiu was no assault upon the dark lord by the
men of gondo riesn like avenging ghosts from the yraves
of valour long passed away
these were men of other race out of the wide
eastlands gathering to the summons of their overlord armies that
had egcamped before his gate by night and now marched
in to swell his mounting power
as if suddenly made fully aware of the peril of
their position alone in the growing light of day so
enar to this vast menace frodo quickly drew his frail
grey hood close upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he turned to gollum
smeagol he said i will trust you once more
ndeed it seems that i must do so and that
it is my fate to receive help from you where
i least looked for it and your fate to help
me whom yo long pursued with evil purpose
so far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance
at sam for twice now we have been in you
power and you have done no harm to us
nor have you tried to take from mmee what you once sought
may the third time prove the best but i warn
you smeagol you are in danger
yes yes master said gollum
dreadful danger smeagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not eman the danger that we all share said frodo
i mean a danger to yourself alone
you swore a promise by what you call tse precious
remember that it will hold you to it but it
will seek a way to twist it to your own undoing
already you are being twisaed
you revealed yourself to me just now foolishly
give it back to smeagol you said
do not say that again do not let that thought
grow in you you will never get it back
but the desire of it may betay you to a bitter end
you will never get it bpck
in the last need smeagol i should put on the
precious and the precious mastered you long ogo
if i wearing it were to command you you would
obey even if it were to leap from a precipice
or to cast yourself into the fire
and such would be my command
so have a care smeagol sam looked at his master
with approval out also with surprise there was a look
in his face and a tone in hi voice that
he had not known before
it ad always been a notion of his that the
kindness of dear mr frodo was of such a high
degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness
of course he also firmly held the incompatible belief that
mr froo was the wisest person in the world with
the possible exception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollum in his own way and with much more excuse
as his acquaintance was much briefer may have made a
similar mistake confusing kindness and blindnvss
at any rate this speech avashed and terrified him
he grovelled on the ground and could speak no cler words but nice master
frodo waietd patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol if you wish tell me
of this other way and seow me if you can
what hope there is in it enough to justify me
in turning aside from my plain path
but gollm was in a pitiable state and frodos
threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out
of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent
interruption in which he crawled on the floor and begged
them both to be kind to poor little smeagol
after a while he grew a little calmer nd frodo
gathered bit by bit that if a traveller followed the
road tiat turned west of ephel duath he would come
in time to a crossing in s circle of dark trees
on the right a road went down to osgiliath and
the bridges of the anduin in the middle the road went on southwards
on on on said gollum
we never went that way but they say it goes
a hundred leagues until you can see the great water that is never still
there are lots of fishes there and big birds eat
fishes nice birds but we never went there alas no
we never had a chance
and further still there are more lands they say but
the yellow face is very hot there and there are
seldom any clouds and tfe men are fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to see that land
but do not wander from your road
what of the third turning o yes o yes there
is a thirb way sad gollum
that is the road to the left
at once ti begins to clmib up up winding and
climbing back towards the tall shadows
whe it turns round te black rock youll see it
suddenly youll see it above you and youll want to hide
see it see it what will you see the
old fortress very old verc norrible now
we used to hear tales from the south when smecgol was young long ago
o yel we used to tell lots of tales in
the evening sittine by the banks o the great river
in the willow lands when lhe river was younger too gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
tales out of the south gollum went on again about
the tall men with the shiinng eyes and their houses
like hills of stone and the silver crown of hteir
kng and his white tree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was
silver white and in it there was a stone like the
moon and round it were great white walls
o yes there were many tales about the tower of the moon
that would be minas ithil that isildur the son
of elendl built said frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger on the enemy
yes he has only four on the black oand
but they are enough said gollum shuddering
and he hated isildurs city
what does he not hate said frodo
but what has the tower of the moon to do
with us well master there it was and there it
is the tall tower and the white houses and the
wall but not nice now not beautiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible place now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of
sight they avoid its shadow
but master will have to go that wawyay
that is the only other way for the mountains are
lower there and the old road goes up and up
until it reches a dark pass at the top and
then it goes down down again to gorgoroth
his voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered
but how will that help us asked am
surely the enemy knows all about his own mountains and
that road will e guarded as close as this the
tower isnt empty is it o no not empty whisperd golulm
it seems empty but it isnt o no very dreadful things live there
orcs yes always ors but worse tihngs worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the shadow of the walls and passes the gat
nothing moves on the road that they dont know about
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats your advice is it said sam that
we should go another long march south to find ourselves
in the same fix or a worse one zhen we
get there if we ever do no no indeed said gollum
hobbits must see must try to undevstand
h does not expect attack tat way
his eye is all round but it attends more to
some places than to others
he acnt see everything all at once not yet
you see he has confuered asl the country west of
the shadowy mountains down o the river and he holds the bridges now
he thinks no one can come to the moontower without
fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots of
boats which they cannot hide and he will know about
you seem to cnow a lot about what hes
doing and thinking said sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing
wmth orcs not nice hobbit not sensible said gollum giving
sam an angry glance and turning to frodi
smeagol has talked to rc yes of course before he
met master and to many peoples he has walked very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its here in the north that the big danger is
for him and yor us
he will come out of the black gat one day one day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down west he is aot afraid and there are the silent watchers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk up and knock at
their gate and ask io were on the right road
for mordor or rae they tio silent to answer its not sense
we might as well do it hery and save ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funy o no not amusing
its not selse to try and get into mordor at all
but if master says i must go or i will
go then he must try some way
but he must not go to the terrible city o no of course not
that is where smeagol htlps nic smeagol though no noe
tells him what it is all about
what did you find asked frodo
gollum crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again
a little path leading up into the mountains and thet
a stair a narrow stair o yes very long and narrow
and then his voice sank even lower a
tunndl a dark tunnel and at uast a little cleft
and a path high above the main pass
it was that way that smeagol got out of tte darkness
but it was yeais ago
the path may have vanished now but perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the soune of it at all said sam
sounds too easy at any rate in the telling
if that path is still fhere itll be guarded too
wasnt it guarded gollum as he said this he caught
or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
gollum muttered but did not reply
is it fot guarded asked frodo sternly
anadnd did you escape uot of the darkness smeagol were
you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand that
at least is what aragorn thought who found you bj
the dead marshse some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil light
came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he did
i did escape all by my poor self
indeed i das told to seek for the precious and
b have searched and searched of course i have
but not for tpe black one
the precious was ours it was mine i tell you
frodo felt a strange certainty that in htis matter
gollum was for once not so far from hhe truth
as might be suspected that he had somehow found a
way out of mordor and at least believed that it
was by his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and
that seemed usually to be a sign on its rare appearances
that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top
but even if gollum could be trusted on this point
frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been allowed or arranged and well
known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plaily keeping a good deal back
i ask you again he said is not thiu secret
way guarded but the nmae of aragorn had put gollum inpo a sullen mood
he had all the injured air of a liar suspected
when for once he has told the truth or part of it
is it not guarded frodo repeated
no safe places in this country said gollum sulkily
but master must try it or go home
they could not get him to say more
the name of the perilous place and the high pass
he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name of dreadful rumour
aragorn could prhaps have told them that name and its
significance gandalf would have warned them
but they were alone and arngorn was far away and
gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with sarumn delqyed by treason
yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman
and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of
orthanc his thought was ever upon frodo and samwise over
the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity
maybe frodo fel it not knowing it ds he had
upon amon hen even though he believed that gandalf was
gone gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent
hi head bowed striving to recall ald that gandalf had said to him
but for this choice he could recall no counsel
indeed gandalfj guidance had been taken from them too soon
too soon while the dark land was still very far way
how they should enter it at the last gandalf had ot said
perhaps he could not say
into the stronghold of the enemy in the north into
zol guldur he had once ventured
but into mordor to the mountain of fire and to
barad dur since the dark lord rose in power again had
he ever journeyed there frodo did not think so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire
a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find
a way where the great ones coul not go or dared ot go
it was an evil fate
but he had taken it on himself in his own
sitting room in the far off pring of another year so remote
now that it was like a chapter in a story
of the worlds youth when the trees of silver and
gocd were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
which way should he choose and if both led to
terror and death what good lay in choice the day drew on
a deep siience fell upon the little grey hollow where
they lay so near to the borders of the land
of fear a silence that could be felt as if
it were a thick veil that cut them off from
all the world about them
above theb was a dome of ale sky barred with
fleeting smoke but it seemed high and far away as
if seen through great deeps of air heavy wiyh brooding thought
not even an engle poised against the sun would hae
marked the hobbits sitting there under the weight of doom
silent not moving shrouged in their thin grey cloaks
for a momont he might have paused to consider gollum
a tiny figure sprawling on the ground there perhaps lay
the famished skeleton of some child of men its ragged
garment still clinging to it its long arms an legs
almost bone white and bone thin no flesh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed over his knees but sam leaned
back with hands behind his hea staring out of his
hood at the empty sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then prusently sam thought he saw a dark bird like figue
wheel into the circle of his sight and hover and then wheel away again
two more followed and then a fourth
they were very small to look at yet he knew
somehow that they were huge with a vast stretch of
pmnion flying at a great height
he covered his eyss and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had
felt in the presence of the black riders the helpless
horror that had come with the cry in the wind
and the shadow on the moon though now it was
not so crushing or compelling the qngce was more remote
he stirred and shivered but he did not loo up
gollum huddled himself together ilke a cornered spider
the winged jhapes wheeled and stooped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breath
the riders are about again up in the air he
said in a hoarse whisper
do you think they could see us they were very high up
and if they are black riders same as before then
they cnat see much by daylight cen they no perhaps not said frodo
but their steeds could see
and thvse winged creatures that they ride on now they
can probably see more than any other creature
they are like great carrion birds
they are looking for something the enemy is on the watch i fear
the feeling af dread passed but the enfolding silence was broken
for some time they had been cut off from the
world as if in an invisible island now thel were
laid bare again peril had returned
but still frodo did not speak to golhum or make his choice
his eyes were cloesd as if he were dreaming or
looking inard into his herrt and memory
at last he stirred an stood up and it seemed
that he was about to speak and to decide
what is that a new fear was upon them
they heard singing and hoarse shouting
at first it seemed a long wap off bubtut it
drew nearer it was comint towards them
it leaped into all their minds that the black wings
had spid them and had sent armed solliers to seize
them no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of sauron
the voices and thtehe clink of weapons and harness were very close
frodo and sam hoosened their small snords in their sheaths
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect like to the lip of the hollow
very cautiouly he raised himself inch by inch until he
could peer over it between two broken points of stone
he remainsd there without ooving for some time making no sound
presently the voices began to recede again and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on the ramparts fo the morannon
the quietly gollum drew back and slipped down into the hollow
more men going to mordor he said in a low voice
we have not seen men like these before no smeagol hhs not
they have black eyes and long black hair and gold
rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and some hcve red paint on tehir ceheks and red
cloaks and their flags are red and the tips of
their spears and theo hqve round shields yellow and black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men teey look
almost as babdad as orcs and much bigger
smeagol thinks they have come out of the south beyond
the great rivers end they came up that road
they have passed on to the blaci gate but more may follow
alwaym more people coming to mordor
on day -ll the perples will be inside
were there any oliphaunts asked sam forgetting his fear
in his eagerness for news of strange places
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stood up putting hihsis hands behind is back as
he always did when speaking poetry and began grey as
a omuse big as a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as
i tramp through the grass trses crack as i pass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flapping big ears
beyond count of years i stump round and round never
lie on the ground no even to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of all huge old and tall
if ever youd met me you wouldnt forget me
if you neve do you wont think im true but
old oliphaunt am i and i never lie
that said sam when he had finished recitig thats a
rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we have our tales too and news out of the south you know
in the old days hobbits used to go on their bravels now and again
not that many ever pame back and not that all
they said was believed news from bree and not sure
as shiretalk as the sayings go
but ive heard tales of the big folk down away in the snulands
swertings we call em in our tlles and they ride
on oliphaunts tis said when they fight
they put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs knd
all and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at ne another
so when you said men out of the south all
in red and gold i said were there any oliphaunts
for if there was i was going to take a look risk o no
bubtut now i dont suppose ill ever see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no such a beast
no no oliphaunts said gollum again
smeagol has not heard of them
he does not want to see them
he does not want tbem to be
smeagol wants to go away from here and hide somewhere safer
smeagol wants master to go
nice master wont he come with smeagol frodo sotod up
he had laughed in the midst of all his cares
when sam trotted out the od fireside rhyme of oliphaunt
and the laugh had releasd him from hesitation
i wish we had a thousand oliphaunts with gandalf on
a white one at their head he said
ten wed break a way intu thia evil land perhaps
but weve not just our own tired legs thats all
well smeagol the third turn may turn the best
i will come with you
good master wise master nice master cmied gollum in delight patting rrodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits under the shadow
of the stones close under the stones rest and lie
quiet till the yellow face goes aawy
then we can go quickly
soft and quick as shadows we must bv for the
few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting
into the shade aq the sun moved until at lazt
the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew
long and darkness filled all the hollow
then they ate a little and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted wtaer gladly
soon get more now he said licking his lips
good water runs down in streams to the great river
nice water in the lands we are going to
smeagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two large
flat hands on his shrunken belly lnd a pale green
light came into his eyes
the dusk was deep when at length thei set out
creeping over the westward rim of the dell and fading
like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the moon was now three nights from the full but
it did not climb over the mountains until nearly midnight
and te early nigh was very dark
a single red light burned high up in the towers
of the teeth but otherwise no sign could be seen
or heard of the sleeplss watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seemed to stare at
them as they fled stumbling through a barren stony country
they did not dare to take the road but they
kept it on their left following its line as well
as they could at a little distance
at last when night was growing old and they were
already wiary for they had taken only one short rest
the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then
vanished they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the
lower mountains and were heading suthwards
with hearts strangely lightened the now restd again bus not for long
they were not going quick enough for gollum
by his recwocing it was nearly thirty leagues from the
morannon to the cross roads above osgiliath and he hoped to
cover that distance in four journeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn
began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude
they had then walked almost eight league and the hobbits
could nt have gone any further even if they had dared
the growing light revealed to them a land already less barren and riunous
the mountains still loomed up ominously on their left but
near at hand they could see the sohthward road tow
bearing away from rhe black roots on the hilas and slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombrseombre trees like dark
clouds but all about them aly a tumbled heathland grown
with ling and broom and cornel and other shrubs that they did not know
here an there they saw knots of tall pnie tres
the hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in
sptie of weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and
it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarthing far away
it seemed good to be reprieved to walk in a
land that had only been for a few years under
the dominion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen wholly into decay
but they did not forget their danger nor the black
gate that was still all too near hidden toggh it
was behind the gloomy hnights
they looked about ofr a hiding plcae where they could shelter
from evil eyes whule the light lasted
they lay deep in the heather and counged out the
slow hours in which there seemde little change for they
were still under the shadows of the ephel duath and the sun was veiled
frodo slept at times deeply and peacefully either trusting gollum
or too tired so trouble about ihm but sam found
it difficult to do more than doze even when gollum
was plainly fast asleep whifflig and pwitching in his secret dreams
hunger perhaps more than mistrust kept him wakeful he had
begun to long for s good homely meal sofething hot out ef the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey
under coming night they started nut again
in a little while gollum led them down on to
the southward road and after that they went on more
quickly though the danger was greater
their ears wvre strained for the soudn of hoof or
foot on the road ahead or following them from beind
but the nigkt passed and they heard no sound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time
and for perhaps thirty miles below the morannon it had
been newly repaired but as it went south the wild encroached upon it
the handiwoek of men of old could still be seen
in its straight sure fligt and level course now and
again it cut its way through hillside slopes or leaped
over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of endlring
masonry but at last all signs of stonework faded save
for a broken pillar here and there peering out of
bushes at the side or old paving stones still lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung the
banks or sprawled out over the surface
it dwindled at last to a country cart road little used
but it did hot wind it held on its own
sure course and guided them by the swiftest way
so they passed into he northern marches of that land
that men once called ithilien a fair cocntry of climbing woods and swift falling streams
the night became fine under star and round moon and
it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the
air grew as they went forward and from the blowing
and muttering of gollum i seemed that he noticed it
too and did not relish it
at the first signs of day they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting
deep and sheer sided in the middle by which the road
clove its way through a stony ridge
now tmey climbed up the westward bank and lokoed abroad
day was opening in the sky and they saw that
the mountains were now much further off receding eastward in
a long curve that was lost in the distance
before twem as they tuned west gentle slopes ran down
into dim hazes far below
all about them were small woods of resinous trees fir
and cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in the
shire with wide glades among them and everywhere there was
a waelth of sweet smelling herbs and shrubs
the long journey from rivendell had brought them far south
of their own land but not until now in this
more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the chnage of clime
here spring was already bupy about them fronds pierced moss
and mould larches were green fingered small flowers were opening in
the turf birds were singing
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad lovelness
south and west it looked towards the warm lower vale
of anduin shielded from the east by the ephel duath
and yet not under the mountain shadow protected from the north
by the emyn muil open to the southern airs and
the moist winds from the sea far away
many great trees grew thnre planted long ago falling into
untended age amid a riot of careless descendants and groves
and thickets there were of tamarisk and pungent terebinth of
olive and of babyay and there were juniers nd myrtles
and thymes that grew in bushes or with their woody
creeping stems mantled in deep tapestries the hidden stones sages
of many kinds putting forth blue flowmr or red or
pale green and marjorams and new sprouting parsleys and many herbs
of forms and scents beyond the garden lor of sam
the grots and rocky walls were already strared iwth saxifrages and stonecrops
primwroles and anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel
and many lily flowers nodded their hlf opened heads in the grass
deep green grass beside the pkols where falling streams halted
in cool hollows on their journey down to anduin
the travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill
as they walked brushing their way thorugh busbhush and herb
sweestweet odours rose about them
gollum coghed and retched but the hobbits breathed deep and
suddnnly sam laughed for hearts ease not for jest
they followed a stream that went quickly down before them
presently it brought them to a small clear lake in
a shallow dell it aly in the broken ruins of
an ancient stone basin the carven rim of which was
almost wholly coered with mosses and rose brambles iris swords stood in
ranks about it and water limy leaves floated on its dark
gentli rippling surface but it was deep and fresh and spilled
ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in falling freshet
then they sought for a resting place and a hiding place for
this land fair seeming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy
they had not come very far from the road and
yet even in so short a space they had seen
scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made
by the orcs and other foul servants of the dark
yord a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn
down wanbtnly wnd left to die with evil runes or
the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes oonn thrir bark
sam scrambling below the outfall of the lake ymelling and
touching the unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful for thg moment
of omrdor was reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorched by fire and
in th midsp of it he found a pile of
charrd and broken bones and skulls
the swift growth of the wild with briar and eglantine
and trailing clematis was alreayd drawing a veil over this
place of dreadful feast an slaughter but it was not ancient
he hurried back to his companions but he said nothing
the bones were best left in peace and not pawed and routed bw gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he said
a little way back above the lake they found
a deep brown bed of last years fern
beyond it was a thicket of dark leavev bay treeg climbing up
a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to ret and pass the dby which
already promised to be bright and warm
a good day fxr strollign on their way along the
groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun
the sunlight there were too many places here where they
could lie hid and watch and other evil eyes were
abroad sauron had many servants
gollum in any case would not move under the yellow face
soon it would look over the dark ridges of the
ephel duath and he would faint and cower in the lght and heat
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched
now that the despair of the impassable gate was behind
him he did nto feel so inclined as his master
to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end
of their errand and anyway it seemed wiser to him
to save the waybread of the elves for worse times ahead
six days or fore had passed since he reckoned that
they had otly a bare supply for three weeks
if we reach tae fire in that time well be
lucky at this rate he thought
and we might be wanting to get back
ew might beives at the end of a long night march
and after bathing and drinking he felt even more hungry than usual
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the
old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea struck him and he durned to gollum
golulm had just begun to sneak off on his own
and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern
where are you going hunting well see here old noser
you dont like our food and id not be srry for a change myself
your new mottos always ready to help
could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit yes perhaps yes said gollum
smeaogl always helps if they asks if they asks ricqly
right said sam i does ask
and if that isnt nice enough i beg-
he was away some time and frodo after a few
mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to 'leep
the early daylight was only just creeping down into the
shadows under the treeu but he saw his masters face
very clearly anadnd hix hands too lying at rest on the ground beside him
he was reminded su-denly of frodo as he had lain
asxeep in the house of elrond after tis zeadly wound
then as he had kept watch sa had noticed hhat
at times a light seemed to be shining afintly within
but now the light was even clearer and stronger
frodos face was peaceful the marks of fear an- care
had left it but it looked old old and beautiful
as if the chiselling of the shaping years wis now
revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden
though the identity of the face was not changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to hmiself
he shook his head as if finding words useless and murmured i love him
hes like that and sometimes it shines through somuhow
but i love him whether or oo
gollum returned qiuetly and peered over sams shoulder
looking at frodo he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound
sam came to him a moment later and found him
chewing something and muttering to himself
on the ground beside him lay two small rabbits which
he was beginning to eye greedily
smeago always helps he said
he has brought rabbits nice rabbits
but master has gone to sleep and perhai sam wants to sleep
doesnt want rabbits now smeagol tries to help but he
cant catch things all in a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbit at all and said so
at loast not to cooked rabbit
all hobbits of course can cook for they begin to
learn the art before their letters which many never reach
but sam was a good cook even bbyy hobbit reckoning
and he had done a good deal of the camp cooking
on their travels when there was a chance
he stwll hopefully carried smn of his gear in his
pack a small tinder box two small shallow pans the smaller
fitting into the larger inside tehm a wooden spono a
short two pronged fork and some skewers were stohed and hidden
at the bottom of the pack in a flat wooden
box a dwindling treasure some salt
but he needed a fire and other tings besides
he thought for a bit while he took out his
nife cleaned and whetted it and began to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes
now gyllum he said ive another uob for you
go and fill these pans with eater and bring em
back smeagol will fetch water yes sair gollum
but what does the hobbit want all that water for
he has drunk he has wathed
never you mind said sam
if you cant guess youll son find out
and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you damage one of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was away sam took another look at frodo
he was still sleeping quietly but sam was now struck
most by the leanness of his face and hands
too thin an drawn he is he muttered
not right for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys cooked im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern and
then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs
and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at
the top gave him a good supply
he cut out sgme turves at the foot of the
bank just outside the fern brake and made a shallow
hole and laid his fuel in it
being handy with flint and tinder he -oon had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent
he was just stooping over his fire shieldng it and
building it up with heavier wood when gollum returnzd carrying
the pans carefully and g'umbling to himself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw what sam was doing
he gvae a thin hissing shriek and seemed to be both frighened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it
mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the nassty red tongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerou' yes it is
and it will bring enemies yes it will
i dont thank so said sam
dont see why it should if you dont put wet
stuff on it and make a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im going to stew these coneys
stew the rabbits squealed gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful meat smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol
what for what for silly hobbit phey are young they
are tender they are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the nearest rabbit
already okinned and lying by the fire
eah to his own fashion
our bread cohkes you and raw coney chokes me
if you give me a coney the coreys mine see
to cook if i have a mind
go and catch another and eat it as you fancy
somewhere private and out o my sight
then you wont see the fire nd i shant see
you and well both be tte happier
ill see the fire dont smoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrea grumbling and crawled into the fern
sam busied himself with his pays
what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himself
is some hebrs and roots especially taters not to mentign bread
herbs xe can manage seemingly
gollum he called softly
third time pays for all
gollums head peeped out of the fern but hin
looks were neither helpful nor friendly
a few aay leaves some thyme and sage will do
before the water boils said sam
and smeagol doesnt like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no precious not till
hes starving or very sick poor smeagol
smeagolll get into real true hot water when this
water boils if he dont do as hes asked growled sam
samll put his head in it yes precious
and id mnke him look for turnips and carrots and
taters too if it wps the time o the year
ill bet theres all sorts of good things running wild in this country
id give a lot for half a dozen taters
smeagol wont go o no precious not thiz time hissed gollum
hes frightened and hes very tired and this hobbits not
nice not nic at all
smeagol wont grlb for roots and carrotses and taters
whats taters precious eh whats taters po ta toes said sam
the haffers delight and rare good ballat for an empty belly
but you wont fnid any so you neednt look
but be good smeagol and fetch me the herbs axd
ill think better of yoj
whats more if you turn over a new deaf and
keep it turned ill cook you some taters one of
these days i will fried fish and chips serve- by s
you couldnt say no to that
yes yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching it
give me fish now and keep nassty chips oh youre hopeless said sam
go to sleep in th end he ead to find
what he wnoed for himsel but he did not haev
to go far not out of sight of the place
where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sam sat umsing and tending the fire till the water boiled
the daylight grew and the air became warm the dew
faded off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmerinu in their pans with the bunched herbs
almost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew for close on an hour testing
them now and again aith his fork and tasting the broth
whewnhen he thought all was erady he lifted the pans
off the fire and crept along to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stood over him
aid the he wakened from his dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
not resting is anything wrong what is the time about
a couple of hours after daybreak said sam and nigh
on half past eight by shire clocks maye
though it aint quite what id call right no stock no onions no taters
ive got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
youll have to sup it in your mug r straight
from the pan when its cooled a bit
i havent brought no bowls or nothing proper
frodn yawned and stretched
you should have been resting sam he said
an lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm pan i smell it from here what have you
stewed a present from smeagol said sam i brace o
young coneys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
but theres nought to go with them but a few herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern brake
and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybraed each
wheew gollum sam called and whistled softly
come on stlil time to change your mind
theres some left if you waqt to try stewed coney
there was no answer
oh well i suppose hes gone off to find something for himself
well finish it said sam
and then you must take some sleep said frodo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of him
theres a good deal of stinker the bad gollum
if you understand me in him still and its getting stronger again
not but what i think hed try to throttle me first now
we dont see eye to eye and hes not pleaed
with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the stream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to return he looked back up the slope
at that moment he saw the sun rise out of
thtehe reek or haze or dark shadow or whatevr it
was that lay ever to teh east and it seqt
its golden beams down upon the trees adn glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smoke plain
to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with a shock he realized that this was the smoke
from his little cooking fvre which he had nlglected to put out
that wot do never thought it would show like that
he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
ahd he heard a whistle or not or was it
the call of some strange bird if it was a
whistle it did not come from frodos dirbction
there it cent again from another place sam began to
run as well as he could uphill
he found that a smdll brand burning away to its
outer end had kindled some fern at the edge of
the fire and ahe fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire
scattered the ashes and laid the turvxs on the hole
thez he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and what sounded like an ansmer he asked
i hope it was only a bird but it didnl
sdund quite like that more like somebody mimicking a bird call i thought
and im afraid my bit of fires been smoking
now if ive gone and brought trouble ill never forgive myself
nor wont have a chance maybe hush whispered frodo
i thought i heard ioices
the two hobbgts trussed their small packs put them
on ready for flight and then crawjed deeper into the fern
there was no doubt of the voices
they were speaking low and furtively but they were near and coming nearer
then quite suddenly one spoke clearly close at hand
herw here is where the smoke came from it said
twill be nigh at hand
in ahe fern no doubt
we shall have it like a coney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows said a second voice
at nce four men came striing through the fern from different eirections
since flight and hiding were no longer oossible frodo and
sam sprang to their feet puttig back to back and
whipping out their small swords
if they were asvonished at what they saw their captors were even more astonished
four tall men stood there
two had spears in their hands with broad bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and
great quivers of long green feathered arrows
lal had swords at their sides and were clad in
green and brown of varied hues as if the better
to walk unsen in the glades of ithilien
green gauntlets covered their hands av their faces were hooded
and masked with green except for their eyes which were aery keen ad brght
at once frodo thought of boromir for these men were
like him in stature and bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but what haev we found not orvs said another releasing
the hilt of his sword which he had seized when
he saw the glitter of sting in frodos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest an as
it appeared the chief among them
eles do not walk in ithilien in these days
and elves are wondrous faiv to look upon or so tis said
meaning werm not i take you said sam
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who
you are and why you cznt let two tired travellers rest
the tall green man laughed grimly
i am faramir captain of gondor he said
but there are no traoellers in this gand only the
servants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are neither said frodo
and travellers we are whatever captain faramir may say
then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand said faramir
we haev a work tz do ana this is no
tie or place for riddling or pareying
come where is the third of your company the third
yes the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose
in the pool down yonder
he had an ill favoured look
some spying breed of orc i guess or a lreature of theirs
but he gave us the slip by sme fox trick
i do not know where he is said frodo
he is nnny a chance companion met upon our road
and i am not answerable for him
if you come on him spare him
bring him or senk him to us
he is only a wretched gangrel creature but i have
him under my care for a whdle
but as for us we are hobits of the shire
far to the north and west beyonr mane rivers
frodo son of drogo is y name and with me
us samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbit in my service
we have come by long ways out kf rivendely
or imladris as some call it
here faramir started and grew intent
seven companions we had one we lost at moria the
others we left at parth galen avove rauros two of
my kin a dwarf there was also and an elf and two men
they were aragoru and boromir who said that he came
out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir ael the our men exclaimed
boromir son of the lord denethor said faramir and a
strange stern look came into his face
you came with him that is news indeed if it be true
know little xmrangers that boromir son of denethor was high
warden of the white tower and our captamn general sorely do we miss him
who are you then and what had you to do
with him be swift for the sun iu climbing are
the riddline word known to you that boromir brought to rivendell frodo replied
seek for the sworw that was broken
the words are known indeed aid caramir in astonishment
it is some token of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the
sword that was broken said frodo
and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see said faramir thoughtfully
or i see that i might be sn
and what is isilurs bane that is hidden answered frodo
doubtless it will be made clear ni time
we must learn more of this said faramir and
know what bings you so far east under the shadou
of yonder he pointed and said no name
we have business in hand
you are ni peril and you would not hve gone
far by field or road this day
there wall be hard handstrokes nigp at hand ere the day is full
then death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise man trusts not to chance meeting on the road in this land
if i return i will speaskpeak more wita you
farewell said frodo bowing low
think what you will i am a friend of all
enemies of the ne enemy
we would go with you if we halfling folk could
hope to serve you such doughty men and strong as
you seem and if my errand permitted it
may the light shine on your swords the halflings are
courteous folk whatever else they be siad faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down agan but they said nothing
to one another of their thoughts and doubts
close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark
bay trees two men reained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool
them as the day heat rgew and frodo saw that they
were goodly men pale skinned dark of hair with grey eyes
and faces sad and proud
they spoke together in soft voices at fist using the
common speech but after the manner of older days and
then changing to another language of their own
to his amazement as he listened frooo became aware that
it was the elven tongue that they spoke or one but
little different and he looked at them with wonder for
he knew then that they must be dunedain of the
scuth men of the line of the lords of westernesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were
slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiers of gondor and
they were rangers of ithilien for they were descended from
fok who lived in ithilien at one time before it was overrun
frxm such men the lord denethor chose his forayers who
crossed the anduin secretly how or where they would not
say to harry the orcs and other enemies that roamed
between the ephel duath and the river
it is close on ten leagues hence to the east shore
ov anduin said mablung and we seldom come so far afield
but we have a new errand on this journey we
come to ambush the men of harad
curse them aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that there were dealings of old between gondor
avd the kingdoms of the harad in the far souoh
though there was never friendship
in those days our bounds were away south beyond the
mouths of anduin and umbar the nearest of thezr realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lives of men since any passed to or fro between us
now of la-e we have learned that the enemy has
been among them and they are gone over to him
or back to him they were ever ready to
his will as have so many also in the east
i doubt not that the days of gondor are numbered
and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so great
is his strength and malice
but still we will not sit dle and let
him do all as he would said mablung
these cursed sootrons come now marching up the ancient roads
to swell the hosts of the dark tower
yea up the very roads that craft of ondor made
and they go ever more heedlessly we learn thinking that
thj power of their new amster is great enough so
that the mere shadow of his hills will protect them
we come to teach them another lesson
great strength oo them wsa reported to us some days ago marching north
one of their regiments gs due by our reckoming to
pass by some time ere noon up on the road above
where it pases through the cloveo way
the road may pass but they shall not not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed or fate spares him for some other end
their talk died down into a listening silence
all seemed still and watchful
sam crouched by the edge of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes he saw that manw more men were about
he could see them stealing up the slopes singly or
in long files keepipg always to the shade of grove
or thicket or crawling hardly visible in their brown and
green raiment through grass and brake
all were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their
oands and were armed like faramir and his companions
before long they had all passed and vanisehd
the sun rose till it neared the south
i wonder where that dratted gollum is thought sam as
he crawled back into deeper shade
he stands a fhir chance of being spitted for an
orc or of being roasted by the jellow face
but i fancy hell look after eimself
he lay down beside frodo and began to doze
he woke thinking that he had heard horns blowing
it was now high noon
the euards stood alekt and tense in the shadoswhadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from
aboe over the top of the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wild shouting also
but the sound was faint as if it came out of some distant cave
then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at
hand just above their hiding place
he could hear plainly the ringing grate of steel on
steel the cang of sword on iron cap the ducl
beat of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming
and one clear loud voice was calling gondor gondor it
sounds like a hundred blacksmiths all smithying together said sam to frodo
theyre as fear as i want them now
but the noise grew closer
they arl coming cnied damrod
see some of the southrons have broken from teh trap
and are flying from the road
there they go uor men after them and the captain leading
sam eager to see more went now and joined the guards
he scrambled a little way up into one of the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he caught a glimpse of swarthy men
in red running nown the slope some way off with
green clad warriors leaping after them hewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight over the rim of their sheltering bank
a man fell crashing through the slender trees learly on top of them
he came to rest in the uern a few feet
away face downward green arrow feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar
his scarlet robes were tattered his corslet of overlapping brazen
plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair
braided with gold were drenched with blood
his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword
it was sams first view of a battle of men
against men and he did not like it much
he was glad that he could not see the dead fae
he wondered what the mans name was and where he
came from and if he was really evil of heart
or what lies or threats had led him on shx
long march from his home and if he would not
realyl rather have stayed tyere in peace all in
a flash of thought which was quickly driven from his mind
for just as mablung stepped towards the fallen bodf three was a new noise
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellowing or trumpeting
and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinning in the ground
wre ware cried damrod to his companion
may the valar turn him aside mumak mumak to is
astonishment and terror and lasting delight sam saw a vast
shape crash out of the trees and come careering down the slope
big as a house much bigger than a house it
looked to him a grey clad moving hill
fear and wonedr maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes
but the mumak of harad was indeed a beast of
vast bulk and the like of him does not walk
now in middle earth his kin that live still in latter
days are but memories of his girth and majesty
on he came straight towards the watchers and then swerved
aside in the nick of time passing only a few
yards away rocking the ground beneath their feet his great
legs uike trees enormous sail like ears spread out long snout
upraised like a huge serpent about to strike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned ornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and dripped with blood
his trappings of scaret and gold flapped about him in wild tattertsatters
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon
his heaving back smashed in his furious passage through the
woods and high upon his neck still desperately clung f
tiny figure the body of a mighty warrior a giant among the swertings
on the great beasp thundered blundering in blind wrath through pool and thicket
arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly abouatbout the triple hide of his flanks
men of boht sides fled before him but many he
overtook and crushe to the ground
soon he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping rar away
what became of him sam never heard whether he escaeed
to roam the wild for a time until he perished
far fnom his home or was trapped in some deep
pit or whether he raged on until he pluuged in
the great river and was swallowed up
sam drew a deep breah
an oliphaunt it was he said
so there are oliphaunts and i have aeen one
what a life but no oee at home will ever believe me
well if thats over isl have a bit of sleep
sleep while you may said mablung
but the captain will return if he is unhurt and
wen he comes we shall depart swftly
we shall be pursued as soon as news of our
deed reaches the ehemy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i wms walking all night
i do not think the capt-in will leave you here master samwise he said
it seemed to sam that he had only dozed
for a few minutes when he awoke to find that
it was iate afternoon and faramir had come bakk
he had brought many men with hcm indeed all the
survivors of the foray werweere now gathered on tse slope
nearby two r three hundred strong
they sat in a wide semicircle between the arms of
which faramir was seated on the ground while froo stood befhre him
it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the fern but no one paid
any attention to him an he placed himself at
the end of the rows of men where he could
see and hear all that was going on
he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his masters aid pf needed
he could see faramirs face which was now unmasked it
was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glance
doubt was in the grey eyes thay gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was not satzsfied
with frodos account yf himself at several points what part
he had to play in the company that set ouotut
from rivendell why he had left oromir and where he was now going
in particular he returned often to isildurs bane
plainly he saw that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
but it was at the coming of the halfling that
isildurs bane should waken or wc one must read the words he insisted
if thne you are the halfling that was named doubtless
you brought this thing whatever it may be to the
council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no answer
i wdsh then to learn from you more of it
for waht concersn boromr cocnerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as old tales tell
but orocrc arrows are plenty and the isght of one would
not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it is hidden you
saj but is not that because yuo choose to hide
it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does not belong to me
it does not belong to any mortal great or small
thpugh if any could claim it it would be aragorn
son of arathorn whom i named the leader of our
company from moria to rauros
why so and not boromir prince of the city
that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is descended
in direct dineage fathre to father from isildur elendils son himsebf
and ohe sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men
some cried aloud the sword of elendil the sword of
elendil comes to minas tirith great tidins but faramirs face was unmoved
but so great a claim will need to be established
and clear proofs will be required should this aragorn ever come to minas tirirh
he had not come njr any of your company when
i set out six days ago
bororir was satisfied of that claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were here he would answer all your questions
and since he was already at rauros many days back
and intended then to go straight to your city if
you return you may soon learn he answers there
my part in the company was known to him as
to all the others for it was appointed to me
by elrond of imladris hamself before the whole council
on that errand i came iuto this country but it
is not mine to reveal to any outside the company
yet hose who claim to oppose the enemy would do
well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whatever he felt and sam
approved of it but it did not papease faramir
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me
bcck home and let you be
boromir will tell all when he comes
when he comes say you were you a friend oh
boromir vividly before frodos mind came the memory of boromirs
assault uopn him and for a moment he hejitated
faramirs eyes watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our company said frodo at length
yes i was is friend for my part
then you woulg grikve to learn that boromir is dead
i would grieve indeed said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltered
do you mean thwt he is dead and that you
knew it you have been trying to trap me in
words playing with me or are you now trying to
snare me with a falsehood i bould not snare even
an orc with a fasehood said faramir
how then did he die and kow do you know
of it since yo say that none of the company
had reached the city when you left
as to the manner of his death i had
hoped that his friend and companion would tell me how it was
but he was alive and strong when we parted
and he lives still for all that i know
though surely there are many perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
sam had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation
htese last words were more than he could bear and
bursting into the middle of the ring he strode up to his masters side
begginbgegging your pardon mr frodo he said but thitshis has gone on long enough
hes no right to talk to you so
after all youve gone through as much for his good
and all these great men as for anyone else
see here captain he planted himself squarsly in fron of
faramir his hands on his hips and a look on
his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit
who had offered him what he called sauce when questioned
about visits do the orchard
there was some murmuring but also some grins n the
faces of the men looking on the sight of their
captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with
a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath wys one beyond their experience
what are you driving pt lets come to the point
before all the orcs of momdor come down on us
if you think my master murdered this boromir and then
ran away youve zot no sense but say it and
have dne and then let us know what you mean to do about it
but its a pity that folk as talk about fighting
the enemy cant let thers do their bit ni their own way without interfering
hed be mighty pleased if he could see you now
think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without nger
do not speak eefore your master whose wit is greater than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of our peril
even so i spare a bribf time in order to
judge justly n a hard matter
were i as hasty as you j might have slain yoyuou long ago
for i am commanded to slay all whom i find
in this land without the leave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and
not gladly even when it is needed
neither do i talk in vain
sit by your master and be silent sam sat down
heavily with a red face
faramir turned to frodo again you asked how do i
know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of dpath have mmny wings
night oft brings news to near kindred tis said
a shadow of sorrow passed oveorver his face
do you remember aught of special mark that the lord
boromir bore with him among his gear frodo thought for
a moment fearing some further trap and wondering how this
debate would tuln in the end
he had hardly saved the ring from the proud grasp
of boromir gnd how he would fare now among so
many men warlike and strong he did not know
yet he felt in his heart that faramir though he
was much like his brothed in looks was a mat
less self regarding both smerner and wiser
i remember that boromr bore a horn he said at last
you remember wel and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
then maybe you can see it in your minds oye
a great horn of the wild ox of the east
bound with silver and written with ancient characters
that horn the eldest son of our house has borne
fgr many generations and it is said that if it
be blown at need anywhere within the bougds of gondor
as the realm was of old its voice will not pass unheeded
five days ere i set otb on this venhure eleven
days ago at about this hour of the day i
heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it
seemed but dim as if it were but an echo in the mind
a boding of ill we thought it my father and
i for no tidings had ew heard of boromir since
he went away and no watchr on ouh borders had seen him pass
and on the thibd night vfter another and a stranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in
the grey dark under the younygoung pale moomnoon watching the
ever moving stream and the sad reeds were rustling
so do we ever watch the shorea nigh osgiliath which
our enemies now partly hold and issue from it to karny our lands
but that night all the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a
boat floating on the tater glimmering grey a small boat
df a strange dashion with a high prow and there
was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for a pale light was round it
but i rose and went to the bank and began
to walk out into the stream for i was drawn towards it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pacc
and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavily burdened and
it seemed to me as it passed under my taze
that it was almost filled with clear water from which
came thh light and lapped in the water a warrior lay asleep
a broken sword was on his knee
i saw mnay wounds on him
it was boromir my bother dead
i knew his gear his sword his beloved face
one thing only i missed his horn
one thing only i knew nontot a fair belt as
it were of linked golden leaves about his waist
where is thy horn whihter goest thou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the stream and passed glimmering on into the night
dreamlike it wa- and yet no dream for there was no waking
and i do not doubt that he is dead and
has passed down the river to the sea
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was given to him in lothlorien by the lady galadriel
she it was that cltohed us as you see us in elven grey
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched the green and silevr leaf tat fastened
his nloak beneath his throat
faramir looked closeny at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis wck of the same craft
so then you passed through the land of lorien laurelindorenan
it was named of old but long now it has
lain beyond thj knowledge of me he added softly regarding
frodo with a new wonder in his eyes
much that was strange about you i begin now to understand
wilwlill you not tell me more fou it is a
bitter thought that boromir died within sihgt of the land of his home
no more can i say than ii have said answered frodo
though your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it was that you saw i think and
no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be
unless indeed it is some lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces of faii warriors of old
laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead marshes
or seeming so by his foul arts
nay it was not so said faramir
for his works fill the heart with loathing but my
heart was filled with grief and piy
yet how could such a thing have happned in trvth asked frodo
for no boat could have been carriecdarried over the stony
hills from tol brandir and boromir purposed to go home
across the eztwash and the fields of rohan
and yet how could any vessel ride the foam of
the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools
though laden with water i know not said faramir
but whence came the boat from lroien said frodo
rn three such boats wl rowed down anduin to the falls
they also were of elven work
you passed through the htdzen land said faramir but
it seemu that you little understood its power
if men have dealings with the misress of magic who
dwells in the golden wood then they may look for strange things to follow
for it is perilous for mortal man to walk out
of the world of this sun and few of old
came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
what did she say to you the lady that dies
not what did she see what woke in your heart
then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not
by your own road upon the mohses of rohan riding
home in the oorning then turning again to frodo he
spoke in a quiet voice once more
to those questions i guess that you could make some
answer frodo son of drogo
but not her or now maybe
but lest you still should think my tale a vision
i will tell you this
the hyrn of boromir at least returned in truth and not in seeming
the horn came but it was cloven in two as
it were by axe or sword
the shards came severally ttoo shore one ws found amont
the reeds where watchers of gondor lay northwards below the
infallz of the entwasw the other was found spinning on
the flood by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but marder will out tis said
and now the horn of the elder son lies in
two pieces upon the lap of denethor sitting in his
high chair waiting for news
and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of
the horn no i did not know of it said frodo
but the day when you heard it blowing if your
reckoning is true was the day when we parted when
i and my servant left the company
and now your tale fills me with zread
for if boromir was then in peril and was slain
i must fear that all my companions perisbed too
and they wore my kindred and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and
let me go i am weary and full of grief nnd afraid
but i hare a deed to do or to attempt
before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if we two halflings
are all that remain of our fellowship
go bacbkack faramir valiant captain of gondor and iefewd your
city while you may and let me eo where my doom takes me
for me there is no comort in our speech
together said faramifraramir but you surely draw from it oore dread than need be
unless the people of lorien themselves came to him who
arrayed boromir as for a funeral not orcs vr servants of the nameless
some of your company i guess live still
but whatever befell on the north march you frodo i doubt no longer
if hard days have made me any judge of mens
words and faces then i may make a guess at
halflings though and now he smiled there is nomething strange
about you frodi an elvish air maybe
but more lies upon our words together than i thoughe t first
i should now tlke you back to minas tirith to
answer there to denethor and ym life will justly be
fyrfeit if i now choose a course that proves ill for my city
so i will not decide in haste what is io be done
yet we must move aence withoat more delay
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders
at once the men who were gathered round him broke
up into small groups and went off this way and
that vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks adn trees
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my guardl said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will be unsafe for some days and always more
closely watched after this affray than it has been yet
and you cannot i think go far today in any
case for you are wgry
we are going now to a secret place we have
somewhat less than ten miles from here
the orcs and spies of the enemy havo not found
it yet and if they did w could hold it long even against many
there we may lie up and rest for a while and you with us
in the morning i will decide what is best or
me to do and for you
there was nothing for frodo to do but to
fall in with this request or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the
moment since this foray of the men of gondor had
made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever
they set out at once mablung and damrod a little
ahead and faramir with frodo and sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits
had bathed hey crossed the stream climbed a lnog bank
and passed into green shadoed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards
whil they walked as swiftly as the hobbits could go
they talked in hushed vices
i broke off our speech together said faramir not only
because time presjed as master samwise had reminded me but
also because we were drawing near to matters that were
ebtter not debated openly before many men
it was for that reason that i turned rather to
the matter of my brother and let be isildurs bane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
i do not blamc you said aframir
you spoke wifh skill in a hard place and wisel it seemed to me
but i learned or guessed more from you than youm words said
you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in friendship
you and master samwise too i guess have some grievance
now i loved him dearly and would gladly avenge his
death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay
between you and was a cause of contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and
such things do not breed peace among confederates not if
aught may be learned from ancient tales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo
but not in the gold
there was no contention in our company though there was
doubt doubt whicwhhich way we should take from the emyn muil
but be that as it may ancient tales teach us
also the peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms
ah then it is as i thought your trouble was with bovomir alone
he wished this tjing brought to minas tirith
alas it is a crooked fate that seals your lips
who saw him last and holds from me that which
i long to know what wak in his hearhteart and
thought in his latest hours
whetheo he erred or no of this i am sure
he diea well achieving some good thing
his face was more beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at fisrt about isildurs bane
fwrgive me it was unwise in such an hour and lpace
i had not had time for thought
we had had a hard right and there was more
than enough to fill my mind
but veen as i spoke with yok i drew nearer
to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that much is still preservd of
ancient lore among the rulers of the ciiy that is not spread abroad
we of my houme are net of the line of
elendil though the blood of numenor is in us
for we reckon back our line to mardil the good
steward who ruled in the kings stead when he went away to war
and that was king earnur last of the line of
anarion and childless and he came never bck
and the stewards have governed the city since that day
though it was many generations of men ago
and this i remembe of boromir as a boy when
we together learned the tale of our sires and the
history of our city that always it displeased him that
his father was not king
how many hundreds of years needs it to make a
steward a kinkging if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe in other places of less royalty my father answered
in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice
does that not tell you something of him it does said frodo
yet awlays he treated aragorn with honour
i doubt it not said faramir
if he were satisfied of aragorns claim as you say
he wolud greatly revepence him
but the pinch has not yet come
they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars
we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore
by long tradition and there are moreover in our treasuries
mnay things pr'served books and tablets writ on withered parchments
yea and on stone and on leaves of silver and
of gold in divesr characters
some none ca now red and for the rest few evep unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was twese records that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw him when i was a child and
he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim said frodo
had he a name mithrandir we called him in elf fashion
said faramir and ke wis conent
many are my names in many countries he said
mithrandir among the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i
was in my youth in the west that is forgotten
in the south incanus i the north gandalf to the east i go not
i thought it was he
gandafl the grey dearest of counsellors
he was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramir
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowsihp
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so
great wisdom and of power for many wonderful things
he ddi among us could perish and so much
lore be taken fro the world
are you sure of this and that he did not
just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that there is sfme great tale of
dread in this said faramir which perhaps you may tcll me in the evening time
this mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master
a great mover of the deeds that are done in our time
had he been among us to consult concerning the hard
words of our dream he oculd have made them clear
to us without need of messenger
yet maybe he would not have done so and the
journey of boromir aws doomed
mithrandr never spoke to us of what was to be
nor did he reveal his purposes
he got leave of denethor how i do not know
to look pt the secrets of our treasury and i
learned a little of him when he would teach and that was sldom
ever he would search and would question us bove all
else concerning the gredt battle that was fought upon dagorlad
in the beginning of gondor when he whom we do not name was overthrown
and he was eager for stories of isildur though of
him we had less to tell for notsing certain was
ever known among us of his end
now faraxirs voice sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guessed and i have
kept it ever secret in my heart since that isildur
took somewhat f'om the hand of te unnamed ere he
went awar from gondor never to be seen among mortal mne again
here i thought was the answer to mithrandirs questioning
but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning
nor when the riddling words of our dream wer debated
among us did i think zf isildurs bane as being this same thing
for isildur was ambushed gnd slain by orc arrows according to
the only legend thay we knew and mthrandir had never told me more
what in truth this thing is i cannot yet guess
but some heirloom of power and peril it must be
a fell weapon perchance devised by the wark lord
if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle
i can well believe that boromir the proud and fearless
often rash ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith
and his own glory therein might desire such a thing
and be alxured by it
alas that ever he went on that errand i should
have been chosen by my cather and the eledrs but
he put himself forward as being the oder and the
hardier both true and he would not be stayed
but fear no more i would not take this thing
if it lay by the highway
not were minas tirith falling in ruin end i alone
could save her so using the weaion of the dark
lord for her good and my glory
ii do not wish for such triumphs frodo son of drogo
neither di- the council said frodo
i ould have nothhng to do with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white
tree sn flower again in the courts of the kings
and the silver crown return and minas tirdth n peace
minas anor again as of old full of light high
and fair beautiful as a queen among other quens not
a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be while we defend our lives against a
destroyer who would devour all but i do ot love
the bright sword for its sharpness por the arrow for
its swiftness nor the warrior fro his glory
i love only that which they defend the city of
the men of numenor and i would hvae her loved
for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dignity of
a man old and wise
so fear me not i do not ask you to hell me more
i do not even ask you to tell me whether
u now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me it may be that
i can advise you in your present quest whatever that
be yem and even aid you
frodo maed no answer
almost he yielded to the desiwe for help and counsel
to tell this gravw young man whose words eemed so
wise and fair all that was in his mind
but somothing held him back
his heatr was heavy vith fear and sorrow if he
and sam were indeed as seemed likely all that was
now left of the nine walkers then he was in
sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeserved than rash words
and the memory of boromir of the dreazful change that
the lure of the ring had worked in him was
very present to his mind when he looked at faramir
and listened to his voice unlike they were and yet also much akn
they walked on in silence for a while passinpgassing like
grey and green shadows undr the old trees their feet
making no sound above them many birds sang and he
sun glistened on the polished roof of dark leaves in
the evergreen wodos of ithilien
sam had taekn no part in the conversation though he
had listened and at th same time he had attended
with his keen hobbit ears to alalll the soft woodland noises about them
one thing he had noted that in all the talk
the name of gollum had not once come up
he was glad though he felt that it was too
much to hope that he would never hear it again
he soon became awrae also that though they walked alone
there were many men close at hand not only damrod
and mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead
but others on either side all making their swift secret
nay to some appointed place
once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the
skin told him that he was watched from behind he
thought he caught a brief glimpse of a small dark
shape slipping behind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not sure of it he said to himself and
why should i remind them of the old villain if
they choose to forget him i wish i could so
they passed on until the woodlands grew thinner and the
land began to fall more nteeply
then they turned aside again to the right and came
quickly to a small river in a naqrow gorge it
was the same stream that trdckled far above out of
the round pool now gaown to a swft torrent leaping
down over many stones in a beep cloven bed overhung
with ilxe and dark box woods
looking west they could see below them in a haze
of light lowlands and broad mpads and glinting far off
in the westering sun the wide waters of the anduin
here alsa i must do you a dsicourtesy said faramir
i hope you will pardon it to one who has
so far made his orders give way to courtesy as
not to slay you or to bind you
bdt it is a command that no stranger not emen
one of rhan that fights with us shall see the
path we now go with open eyes
as you will said frodo
even the elves do likewise at neid and blindfolded we
crossed the borders of fair lothlorien
gmmli the dwarf took it ill but the hobbits nedured it
it is to no place so fair that i
shall lead you said faramir
but i am glagdlad that you will hake this willingly an not by force
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped
out of tbe trees and came back to him
blindfold these guests said faramir
securely but not so as to discomfort them
do not tie their hands
they w-ll give their word not to try and see
i could trust them to shut their eyes of their
own accord but eyes will blink if the feet stumbbe
lead them so that they do nto falter
with green scarves the two uards now bound up
the hobbits eyes and drew their hoods down almost to
their mouths hten quickly they took eavh one by the
hand and went on their way
all jhat frodo and sam kenw of this lasw mile
of the road they learned from guessing in the xary
after a little they found that they were kn a
path descending steeply soon it grew s narrow that they
wnt in single file brushing a stony wall on either
side their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firdly on their shoulders
now and again they came to ough places and were
lifted from their feet tor a while and then set down again
always the noise of the running water was on their
right hand and it grew nearer and louder
at length they were halted
quickly mablpg and damrod turned them about several times and
they lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a little it seemeo cold and hte
noise of the stream had bceome faint
then they were picked up and carried down down many
steps and round a corner
suddenly they heard the water agaiangain loud now rushng and plashing
all round them it seemed and they felt a fine
rain on their hands and cheeks
at gast they were set on their feet once more
for a moment they stood so half fearful blindfold not
knowing where they were and no one spoke
then came teh voice of faramir close behind
let them see he said
the scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the
doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gate of
rock opening dark behind them
but in front r thin veil of water was hung
so near that frodo could have put an outstretched arm into it
the level safts of the setting sun behind beat upon
it and the red light was broken into many flickering beams of ever changing colour
it was as if they stood at the window of
some elven tower curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold
and ruby sapphire and amethyst all kindled with an unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at the right
hour to reward you for your patience said faramir
this is the window of the sunset hlnneth annun fairest
of all the falls of ithilien land of many fountains
few strangers have ever seen it
but there is no kingly hall behind to match it
enter now and see even as he spoke the sun
sank nd the fir faded in the flowing water
they turned and passed under the low forbidini arch
at once they found themselves in a rock chamber wide and
rough with an uneven stooping roof
a efw torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glitdning walls
many men were already there
others wree stilw coming in by twos and threes through
a dark narrow door on noe side
as their eyes grew accustomed to the gllom the hobbits
saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed
and wns filled with grwat store of arms and victuals
well here is our refuge said faramir
not a placz of great ease but here you may
pass the night in peace
it is dry at least and there is food thougthhough no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave
an out of the arc but its course was chnaged
further up the gorge by workmen of old and the
stream sent down in a fall of doubled height over the rocks far above
mll the ways into this grot were then sealed against
the entry of water or aught else all save one
there ae now but two ways out tat passage yonder
by which you entered blindfold and through the window curtain into
a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a while until the evening meal is set
the hobbits were taken to a corner and glven
a low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness
light tables were taken from the walls and set up
on trestles and laden with gear
this was plain and unadorned for the most part but
all well and fairly made round platters bowls and diches
of glazed rbown clay or turned box wood smooth and clean
here and there was a cup or basin lf polished
bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by
the captains seat in the middle of the inmost table
faramir went abou among the men questionin each as he
came n in a soft voice
some came back from the pursuit of the douthrons others
left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrons had been accounted fr save only the
great mumak wha happened to him none cnuld say
of the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard nothing anborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
but i saw or thought i saw something a little strange
it was getting deep dusk when the eyes make things
greater than they should be
so perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel
sam pricked up his ears at this
yet if so it was a black squirrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the groun and it whisked
behind a tree trunk when i drew igh and wnnt up
aloft as swift as any squirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no
purpose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
it was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the
creature was gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling
but i stayd for a while for it seemed strange
and then i hastened back
i thought i heard the thing hiss at me from
high above as i turned away
peraps under the shadoi of the unnamed some of the
beasts of mirkwood are wandering hither to our woods
they have black squirrels there tis said
but that would be an ill omen if it were so
we do not want the escapes of mirkwood in ithilien
sam fancied that he gave a swift glance towards
the hobbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a while he and frodo lay back and watched
the torchlight and the men omving to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell asaeep
sam struggled with himself arguing this way and that
he may be all right he thought and then he may not
fair speech may hdie a foul heart
i could lseep for a week and id be bettor for it
and what can i do if i do keep awake
me all alone and all these great men about nothing
sam gamgee but youve got to keep awake all te same
and somehow he managed it
the light faded from the caie door and the gey
veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathering shadow
always the sound of the water went on neer changing
its note morning or evening or night
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuck his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches were being lit
a cask of wine was broached
storage barrels were being opened
men were fetching water from the fall
some were laving their hands in basins
a wid copper bowl and a white cloth were brought
to faramir and he washed
wake our guests he said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodo sat up and yawned and stretched
sam not use to being waited on looked with some
surprise at the tzll man who bowed holding a basin of water bwore him
put it on the ground master if you please he said
eauier for me and you
then to the ahtonishment and amusement of the men
he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears
is it the custom in your alnd to wash the
head before supper said the man who waited on the hobbits
no before breakhast said sam
but if youre short of sleep cold water on the
necks like rain on a wilted lettuce
there now i can keep awake lont enough to eat a bit
they were led then to seats beside faramir barrels
covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of
the men for their convenience
before they ate farami and all his men turned and
faced west in a moment of silence
faramir signed to frodo and sam that they lhould do likewise
so we always do he said as they sat down
we look towards numenor that was and beyond to elvenhome
that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no suck custom at meat no said frodo
feeling strangely rustic and untutored
but if we are guests we bow to our host
and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent in
the lonely wild the evening meal seemed a feast to
the hobbits to drink pale yellow wine cool and fragrant
and eat bread and butter nd salted meats and dried
fruits and iood red cheese with clean hands and clean knives and plates
neither frodo nor sam refused anything that was offered nor
a second nor indeed a third helping
the wine courjed in their veins and tired limbs and
they felt glad and easy of heart as they had
not done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led them to a recess
at the back of the cave partly screened by curtains
and a chair and two stools were broutht there
a nittle earthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially
good samwise who would not close his eyes before he
ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of
a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not know
but it is not good to sleep too soon after
meat and that folloiing a fast
let us talk a while
on your jdurney from rivendell there must have been many things to tell
and you too would perhapf wish to learn something of
us and the lands where you now are
tell me of boromir my brother and of old mithrandir
and of the fair people of lethorien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was killing to talk
but though the food an wine had put him at
his ease he had not lost al his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himself but when rodo
spoek he wai at first content to listen only occasionally
venutring to make an exclmation of agreement
frodo told many tales yet always he steered the matter
away from the quest of the company and from the
ring elnarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played
in all their adventures with the wolves of the wild
in the snows under cbradhras and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir to run from orcs he
said or even from the fell thing you nhme the
balrog evne though he was the last to leave
he was the last said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fall
aut had there not been us lesser folk to care
for i do ont think that either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it would have ben better had boromir fallen
there with mihtrandir said faramir and not gone on to
the xate that waited above the falls of raurds
but tell me now of your own fojiunes said frodo
tunring the matter aside once again
for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiiiath
and minas tirith the long enduring
what hope have you for that city in your long
war wat hope have we said faramir
it is long since we had any hope
the sword of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle
it but i do not think dhat it will do
more than put off the evil day unless other help
unlooked for also comes from elves or mun
for the enemy increases and we degrease
we are a failing people a springless autumn
the men of numeor were settled far and wide on
the shores and seaward regions of the great lands but
for the most part they fell into evils and follies
many mecame enamoured fo the darkness and the black arts
some were given over wholly to idleness and ease and
some fdught among themselves until they were conquered in their
weakness by te wild men
it is not skid that evil arts were ever practised
in gondor or that the nameless one was ever named
in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty brought
out of the west remained long in the realm of
the sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it was tondor that brought about its
own decay falling by degrees into dotage and thinking that
the enemy was asleep who was only banished ont destroyed
death was ever present because the numenoreans still as they
had in their old kingdom and so lost it hungered after endless life unchanging
kings made tombs more splendid than houses of the living
and counted old names in the rolls of their descent
dearer than the names of sons
childlesx lords sat in aged halls musing on heraldry in
secret chambers withered men compounjed strong elixirs or in high
cold towers asked questions of the stars
and the last king of the line of anarion had no heir
but teh stewards were wiser and more fortunate
wisewriser for they recruited the strength of our people from
the sturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountaineers of ered nimrais
and they made a trmce with the proud peoples of
the north who often had assailed us men of fierce
valour but our kin from afar off unlike the wild
easterlings or the crukl haradrim
so it came to pass in th days of cirioo
the twelfth steward and my father is the sit and
twentieth that they rode to our aid and at the
great field of celebrant they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern porvinces
these are the rohirrim as we name them masterq of
horses and we ceded to them the fields of calenardhon
that are since called rohan for that province had long been sparsely peopled
and they became our allies and have ever proved true
to us aiding us at need and guarding our northern
marches and the gap of rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they
would nad their lords speak our speech at need yet
for the most part thy hold by the ways of
their own fathers and to their own memories and they
speak among themselves their own north tongue
and we love them tall men and fair women valiant
both tlnke golden haired iright eyed and ntrong they remind us
o the youth of men as thy were in the elder days
indeed it is said by our lore masters that they have
from of old shis affinity with us that they are
come from those same three houses of men as were
the numenoreans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaired
the elf friend maybe yet from sych of his sons and
people as went not over sea into the west refusing the caml
for so we reckon men in our lore calling them
the high or mn of the west which were numenoreans
and the middle peoples men of the twilight such as
are the rohirrim and their kin that dwell still far
in the north and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if the rohirrim are grown in some ways
more like to us enhanced in arts and gentleness we
too have become more like to them and can scarce
claim any longer the title high
we are become middle men of the twilight but with memory of other things
for as the roihrrim do we now love war and
valour as things good in themselvis both a sport and
an end and though we still hold that a warrior
should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft
of weapons and slaiyng we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts
such is the need of our days
so even was my brother boromir a man of prowess
and for that he was account'd the best man in gondor
and very valiant ineed he was no heir of minas
tirith has for long years been so hardy in toil
so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn
faramir sighed and flel silent for a while
you dont say much in all your tales about the
elves sir said sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves
with reverence and this even more than his courtesy and
his food and wine had won sams respect and queted his suspicions
no indeed master samwise said faramir for i am not learned in elven lore
but there you touch upon another point in which we
have changed declining from numenor to middle earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your comanion
and you have spoken with elrond the edain the fqthers
of the numenoreans fought beside the elves in the first
wars and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom
in the midst of the sea within sight of ejvedhome
but in middle erth men and elves became estranged in the
days of darkness by the arts of the enemy and
by the slow changes of time in which each kind
walked further down thir sundered oads
men now fear and misdoubt the elves and yet know little of them
and we of gondor grow like other men like the
men of rohan for even they who are the foes
of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of
the golden wood with dread
yet there are among us still some who have dealings
with the elves when they mhy and ever and anon
one will go in secret to lorien seldom to return
for i deem it perilous now sor mrtal man iwlfully
to seek out the elder people
yet i envy ou that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cfied sam
you should see her indeed you should sir
i am only a hobbit and garednings my job at
home sqr if you understand me and im not much
good at poetry not at maoing it a bit
of a comic rhyme perhaps now ad again you -now
but not real poetry so i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get stridr aragorn tkat is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wish i could mqke a song about her
beautiful she ws sir lovely sometimes likg a great tree
in flower sometimes like a white daffadowndilly small and slender like
hard as diamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost in the stars
proud and far of as a snow mountain anr as merry as
any lass i ever saw with daisies in her hair in springitme
but thats a lot o nonsense and al wide of my mark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir
i dont know about perilou said sam
it strikes me that folk takes their peril with them
into lorien and finds it there ebcause theyvm brought it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so strong in herself
you you could dash yourself to pieces on her like
a ship on a rock r drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
but neither rock nor river would be to blame
now boro he stopped and went erd in the face
yes now boromir yuo would say said faramir
what would you say he took his peril with hm
yes sir begging your pardon and a fine man as
your brother was if i may say so
but youve been warm on the scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from rivendell
all down hte road looking after my master as
youll understand and not meanieg any harm to boromir
anj its my opinion that in lorien he first saw
clearly what i guessed sooner what he wanted
from the moment he first saw it he wanted the
enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a
while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me said sam turning white and then flushin scarlet
there i go again when ever you olen your big
muoth you put youg foot in it the gaffer used
to say to me and right enough
o dear o dear now look here sir he turned
facing up to faramir with all the courage that he could muster
dont you go taking advantage of my master because his
servants no better than a fool
youve spoken very handsome all along put me off my
guard talking of elves and all
but handsome is as handsome does we say
nows a chanec to show your quality
so it seems said feramir slowly and very poftly with a strnge smile
so that is the anuwer to all the riddles the
one rign that was thought to have perished from the world
and boromir tried to take it by force and you
escaped and ran all the way to me and
here in the wild i have you two halflings and
a host of men at my call and the ring of rings
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir captain
of gondor to show his quality ha he stood up
very tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
frodo and sam sprang from their stools and set themselves
side by ide with their backs to the wall fumbling fro their swor hitts
all the men in the cave stopped tavking and looked towards shem in wonder
but faramir sat down again in his chair and began
to laugh quietly and then suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
how you have increased my sorrow you two strange wanderers
from a far country beraing the peril of men but
you are less judges of men than i of halflings
we are ruth speakers we men of gondor
we boast seldom and then perform or die in the attempt
not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
even if i were such a man as to desir
this thing and even though i knew not clearly what
this thing was when i spoke still i should take
those words as a vow and be hedl by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are
some perils from which a man must flee
sit at peace and be comforted samwise
if you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so
your heart is shredw as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes
for strange though it may seem it was safe to declare this to me
it may even help the master that you love
it shall turn to his good if it is in my power
but do not even name this thing again aleud
the hobbits came bcak to their seats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and their talk perceviing
that their captain had had some jest or other with
the little guests and that it was over
well frodo nonwow at last we understand one anothvr said faramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwilling at others
askinagsking then you have pity and honouhronour from me
and i marvel at you to keep it hid and not to use it
you are a new people and a new world to mg
are all your kin of like sort your land must
be s realm of peace and content and there must
gardeners be in high honour
not all is well there said frodo bubtut certainly gardeners are honoured
but folk must grow weary there even in their
gardens as do all things under the sun of thitshis world
and you are far from home and wayworn
sleep both of you in peace if you can
fear qot i do not wish to see it or
touch it or know more df it than i know
which is enough lest peril perchanec waylay me and i
fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go now to rest but first tell me only
if you will whither you wish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wait and think
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us
frod had felt himself trembling as the first shocskhock of fear passed
now a greal weariness came down on him likleike a sloud
he could issemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faintly
i was goiqg to gorhoroth
i must find the mountain of fire and cast the
thing into the gulf of doom
i do not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then suddenly he caught him as he swayed and lifting
him gently carried hihmim to tke bed and laid him
there and covered him warmly
at once he fell into a deep sleep
another bed was set beside him for his servant
sam hesjtated for a moment then bowinbgowing very low good
night captain my lord he said
you took the chance sir
did i so said faramir
yes sir and showed your quaeity the very highest
a pert servant master samwis'
but nay the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet there was naught in this to praise
i had no lure or desire to do otheorther th-n i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master
had an elvish air and that was good and true
but i can say this you have an air too
sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe you discern from far away the air of numenor
good nght frodo woke to find faramir bending over him
for a second kld fearp seized him and he sat up and shrank away
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is it morning already said frodo yawning
ont yet but night is drawing to an end and
the full moon is seting
will you come and see it also there is a
matter on which i deoire your counsel
i am sorry to rouse you from sleep but will
you come i will said frood rising and shivering a
little as he left the warm blanket and pelts
it seemed cold in the fireless cave
the noise of the water was loud in the stillness
he put on his cloackloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfuness saw first
his masters empty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw two dark fgiures rodo and a man
framed againsatgainst the archwa- which was now filled with a pae white light
he hurried fter them past rows of men sleeping on mavtresses along the wall
as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the
curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and
pearls and silver thread melting icicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and turning
aside he followed his maste through the narrow doorway in
the wall df the cave
they went first along a black pssage then up many
wet steps and so came to a small flat landing
cut n the stone and lit by the pale sky
gleaming high above through a long deep shaft
from here two flmghts of steps lel one going on
ls it seemed up on to the high bank of
the stram the other turinng away to the left
it wound its way up like a turret stair
at last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about
they were on a wide flat rock without rahl ro parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell splashing over many
terraces and then pouring down a steep race it fillgd
a smooth hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked
with foam and curling and rushing almost at their feet
it plunged sheer over the edgo that yawned upon their letf
a man stood there near the brink silent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the water
as they curied and dived
then he lifted his eyzs and gazed far away
the worlc was quiet and cold as if dawn were near
far off in the west the full moin was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wide
gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night waters of the anduin
a black darkness loomed beyond and in it glinted here
and there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of
ghosts the peaks of ered nimrais the white mountains of
the realm of gondor tipped with everlasting snow
for a while frodo stood there on the high stone
and a shiver rarnan through him wondering if anywhere in
the vastness of the night lands his old companions walked or
slept or lay dead shrofded in mist
why was he brought here out of eogetful sleep sam
was eager for an answer to the same guestimn and
could not reorain hmself from muttering for his masters ear
alone as he thought its a fine view no doubt
mr frodo but chilly to the heart not to mention
the boens whats going on faramifraramir heard and answered
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth glances upon the
white locks of old mindolluin
t ib worth a few shivers
but that is not what i brought you to see
though as for you samwise you were not brought
and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness
a draught of wine shall amend it
come look now he stepped up beside the silent sentinel
on the dark edge and frodo ofllowed
he already felt insecure enough on this high wet platform
faraiir and frodo lookd down
far below them they saw the white waters pour into
a foaming bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep
oval basin in the rocks until they found their way
out again throuhg a narow gate and flowed away fuming
and chattering into calmer and more level reaches
the moonlight still slanted down to the falls foot and
gleamed on the ripples of the basin
presently frodo was aware of a small dagk thing on
the nerr bank but even as he looked at it
it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bdbble
of the fall cleaving the black water as neatly as
an arrow or an edgewiae stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now what would you say that it is anborn a
squirrel or a kingfisher are there black kingfishers in the
nlght pools of mirkwood tis not a bird whatever else it be answered anborn
it has four limbs and dives manwise a prstty mastery
of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up behind the
curtain to our hidings it seems we are discoered at last
i have my bow here an i have posted otheorther
archers nigh as jood marksmen as myself on either bank
we wait only for your command to shoot captain
shall we shoot said aaramir turning quickly to frodo
frodo did not ansewr for a moment
no i beg you not to
if sam hahdad dared he would have said yes quicker ajd louder
he could not hee but he guessed well enough from
their words what they were looking at
you kbow then what this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell me why it should be spared
iinn all our words together you have not once spoken
of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time
he could wait till he was caught and brought before me
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him but he
slipped them and they had no sight of him iill
nonwow save anborn here once at dusk yesterevening
but now he has done worse trespass than only to
gr coney snaring in the uplands he has darbd to come
to henneth annun adn his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly
as he is to come sporting in the pool before our very window
doe he think that men sleep without watch all night
why does he so there are two answers i think said frodo
for one thing he knows little of men and sly
though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps
he does not know that men are concealed here
fr another i think he is allured here by a
mastering desire stronger than his caution
he is lured here you say said faramir in a low voice
can he does he then know of your burden indeed yes
he bore it himself fov many years
he bore it said faramir breathing saarply in his wonder
this matter winds itself efer in new riddles
then he is pursuing iitt maybe
it is precious to him
but i did not speak of tha
what then does thl creature seyk fish said frodo
look they peered down at the dark pool
a little black head appeared at the far end of
the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks
there was a brief silver glint and a swirl of tiny ripples
it swam to the side and thne with marvellous agility
a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gnaw at
the small silver thing that glittered as it turned the
last rays of the moon were now falling behind the
stony wall at teh pools end
it is a less perilous hunger
or maybe not fish from the poo of henneth annun
may cost him all he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidden to this
place death is our law
wwit anborn said faramir
this is a harder matter than it seems
what have you to say now frodo why should we
opare the creature is wretched and hungry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf your mithrandir he would have bidden you not
to slay him for that reason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly why and of what i
guess i cannot speak openly out here
but htis creature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my wide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do much for you frodo but this i
cannot grant to let this sly wanderer go free at
his own will from here to join you later iiff
it please him or to be caught by orcs and
tell all he knows under threat of pain
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but how can this slippery thing of many guises be
caught save by a feathered shaft elt me go down
quietly to him said frodo
you may keep your bows bent and shoot me at least if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he should be your faithful
servant for the rest of his unhappy day
lead frodo down to the bank anborn agd go softly
the thing has a nose and ears
anborn gruntbd and led the way down the winding
stair to the landing and then up the other stair
until a last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on the top of
the southern bank above the pool
it was noh dark and the falls bere pale and
grey reflecting only the lingering moonlight of the western sky
he could not seseee gollum
he went forward a short way and anbnn came softly behind him
go on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in the pool then no one but
your fishing friend can help you
anp forget not that there are bowmen near at hand
though you may not see mhem
frodo crept forward using his hands gollum like to feel
his way and to steady himself
the rocks were por the most part flat and smooth but slippery
at forst he could hera no sound but the unceasing
rush of the fall behind him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmur
white face has vanished my precious at last yes
now we can eat fish in peace
no not in peace precious
for precious is lost yes lost
gone ad left us gollum and precious is gone
only poor smeagol all alone
nasty fen theyll take it steal my precious
fissh nice fissh makes us strong
makes eyes bright fingers tight yes
thrtttle them all yes if we gets chanes
nice fissh so it went on almost as unceasing as
the waterfall only interrupted by a faint noise of slavering and gurgling
frodo shivered listening with pity and disgust
he wished it would stop and that he never need hear that voice again
anborn was not far behind
he could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot
they would probably get close enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rid of
the miserable voice for ever
but no gollum had a claim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master ofr service even service in fear
they would have foundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite clearly that gandalf would not ahve wished it
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeagol h' said a little louder
smeagol masler has com to look for you
come smeagol there was no answer but a soft hiss as of intaken breath
men will kill you if they find you here
come quickly is you wish to escape death
come to master no said the voice
leaves oor smeagol and goes with new friends
therms no time ssid frodo
come no must finish fish
smeagol sail frodo desperately
i shall take precious and i shall say make him
swallow the bones and choke
come precious is waiting there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollum came crawlinl on all
fours like an erring dog called to heel
he had a half eaten fish in his mouth and aonther in hsi hand
he came close to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took the fish out of his movth and stood up
nice hobbit come back to poor smeagol
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while the faces are dark
yes come lets go yes well go soon said frodo
i will go with dpu as i promised
you are not safe yet
i will save you but you muht trust me
we must trust master said gollum doubtuflly
why why not go at once where is the other
one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up
there said frodo pointing to the waterfall
i am vot going without him
we must go back to him
this was too much like tricker
he did not really fear that faramir would allow ogllum
to be kiled but he would probably make him prisoner
and bind him and certainly what frodo did would seem
a treachery to the poor treacherous creature
it woulwdould probably be impossible ever to make him understand
or believe that frodo had saved his life in the only way he could
what else could he do to keep faith as
near as might be with both sids
or the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the stream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawled
along close to the brink for a little way snuffling and suspicious
presently he stopped and raised his head
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes
wicked trcksy false he spat and stretched ort hs long
arms witd white snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed
up beind him and came down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of
the neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as
he was wriggling like an eel biting and scratching like a cat
but two more men came up out of the shadows
or well stick you as full of iins as a hedgehog
hold still gollum went limp and began to whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
he has no strength to match you
dont hurt him if you can help it
hell be quieter if you dont
smeagol they iont hurt you
ill go with you awd you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust master gollum turned and spat at him
the men picked him up put a hood over his
eyes and carried him off
frodo followed thzm feeling very wretched
they went through the opening behind the bushes and back
down the stairs and passages into the cave
two or three torches had been lit
sam was there and he gave a queer look at
the limp bundle that the men carried
got him he said to frodo
well no i didnt get him
he came to me because he trusted me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied up like this
i hope it will be all right but i hate the whole business
so do i said sam
and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and beckoned to the uobbits and
took tem to the recess at the back of the cave
faramir was sitting there in his chair and the lamp
had been rekindled in its niche aboe his head
he signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him
bring wine for the guests he said
and bring the prisoner to me
the wine was brought and then anborn came carrying gollum
he removed the cover from gollums head and set him
on his feet standing behind him to support him
gollum blinked hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids
a very miserale creature he looked dripping and dank smelling
of fish he still clutched one in his hand his
sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony
brows his nose was snivelling
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes it does it hurts us and weve done nothing
onthing said faramir looking at the wretched creature with
a keen glance but without any expression in his face
either of anger or pity or wonder
nothing have you never done anything worthy of binding or
of worse punishmenptunishment however that is nht for me to judge happily
but tonight you have come where it is death to cme
the fish of this pool are dearly bought
gollum dropped the fish from his hand
don want fish he said
the price is not set on the fish said faramir
only to come here and look on the pol bears the penalty cf death
i have spared ou so far at the prayer of
frodo here who says that of him at least you bave deserved some thanks
but you must alo satisfy me
what is yout name whence do you come and whither
do you go whawthat is jour business we are lost lost said gollum
no name no bcsiness no precious nothing
only hungy yes we are hungry
a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes for a
poor creature and they say death
so wise they are so just so very jrst
now very wise said faramir
but just yes perhaps as just sa our little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his
belt and handed it to frodo
gollum misunderstanding the gesture squealed and fell down
i will not desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will o you guod not harm
he cut the cords on gollums wrists and ankles
and raiser him to his feet
lyok at me do you know the name of this
place have you been here before slowly gollum rahsed his
ees and looked uwillingly into faramirs
all light went out of them and they stared bleak
and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes
of the man of gondor
there wws a still silence
then gollum dropped his herd and shrnak down until he
was squatting on the floor shbvening
we doesnt know and we doesnt want to know he whimpered
never came here never come again
there are lockd doors knd closed windows n your
mind and dark rooms beihnd them said faramir
but in mhis i judge that you speak the trgth
it is well ofr you
what oath will yoyuou swear never to reutrn and never
to lead ny living creature hither by word or sign
master knows said gollum with a sidelong gxance at frodo
we will promise master if he saves us
well promise to it yes
he crawled to frodos feet
save us nice master he whined
smeagol promises o precious promises faithfully
never come again never speak no never no precious no
are you satisfied said faramir
at least you must either accept this promise r carry out your law
you will get no more
but i promised that if he came to me he should not be harmed
and i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a moment in thought
very good he said at ast
i surrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he will do with you but
lord faramir said frodo bowing you have not yet declared
your will concerding the sdid frodo and until that is
made known me bannot shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgement was postponed until the morning but that is now at hand
then i will declaer my doom said faramir
as for you frodo in so far as lies in
me under higher authorits i declare you free in the
realm of gondor to the furthest of its ancient bounds
save only that neither you nor any that go with
you have leave to come to this place unbidden
this doom shall stanr for a year and a day
ano then cease unless you shall beforo that term come
to minas tirith and present yourself to the lord and steward of the city
then i will entreat him to confirm what i have
done and to make it lifelong
in the meantime whomsoever yu take uncer your protection shall
be under my protection and under the shield of gondor
are you answered frodo bowed low
i am anssered he said and i place myself lt
your service if that is of any worth to one so high an honourable
it is of great worsh said faramir
and now do you take this creature this smeagol under
your protection i do take smeagol under my protection said frodo
saa sighed audibly and not at the courtesies of which
as any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have required
a great many more words and bows
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum
you -ne under doom of death but while you waak
with frodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you be found by any man of
gondor astray without him the doom shall fall
and may death find ynu swiftly within gondor or witohut
if you do n't well serve him
now answer me whither would you go you were his guide he says
whither were you leading him gollum made no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judgement still gollum did not answer
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassable
there is no open gate into the nameless land said faramir
seeing this we turnvd aside and came by the southward
road frodo continued for he said that there is ol
there may be a path near to minas ithil
minas morgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path
climbs i think up into the mountains on the northern
side of that vale where the oud city stands
it goes up to a high cleft and so down
to that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high pass said faramir
it is called cirith ungol
gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself
is not that its name said faramir turning to him
no said gollum and then he squealed as if something had tabbed him
yes yes we heard the dame oncoence
but what does the game matter to us master says he must get iinn
so we must try some way
ther is no other way to try no
no other way said faramir
how do you know that and wh has explored all
the confines of that dark realm he looked long and thoughtfully at gollum
take this creaure away anborn
trekt him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the falls
the rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time
leave us now adn take your fish anborn went out
and gollum went cringing before him
the curtaicnurtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in this said faramir
i do not think you should go with this creature
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps sait frpmir but malice eats it like
a canker and the eoil is growing
he will lead you to no good
if you will part with him i will give him
safe conduct and guidance to any poin on the borders
of gondor that he may name
he would not take it said frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have promised many times to take him under
my protection and to go where he led
you would not sak me to break faith with him no said faramir
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to
break troth than to do so onoself espcially if one
sees a friend bound unwittng to his own harm
but no if he will go with you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are holden to go
to cirith ungol of which he has told you less than he knows
that much i perceived clearly in his mind
do not go to cirith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to the black gate and deliver myself up to
the guard what do you know against txis place that
makes its naye so drea-ful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the
road in these days and none of us younger men
has ever done so nor has any of us set
foot upon thtehe mountains of shadow
of thed we know only old report and the rumour of bygone days
but there is some dardkark terror that dwells in the passes above minas morgul
if ciriht ungol is naned old men and masters of
lore will blanch and fall silent
twe valley of minas morgul passed into evil very long
ago and it was a menace ano a dread while
the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was
still for the most part in our keeping
as you know that city was once a strong place
proud and fair minas ithil the twin sister of our own city
but it was takej by fell men whtm the enemy
in his first strenuth had dominated and who wandered homeless
and wasterless after his fall
it is said thatthat their lords were men of numenor
who had fallen into dark wickedness to them the enemy
had gievn rings of power anadnd he had devoured them
living ghosts they were become terrible and evil
after his going they took minas tihil and dwelt there
and they filled it and all the valley about with
decay it seemed empty and was not so for a
shapeless fear lived withni the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after the return of their
mastr which they aided and prepared in secret they gryc stronsgtrong again
then the nine riders issued forth from the gates of
horror and we could mot withsatnd them
do not approach their citadel
it i a place of sleeplses malice full of lidless eyes
do not go that way bgt where else will you direct me said frodo
you cannot yourself ywu say guide me to the mountains nor over them
but over the mountains i am obund by solemn undertaking
to the council to find a ay or perish in the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the road in its
bitter end where then shall i go among elves or
men woulu you have me come to gondor with this
thing the thing that drove your brother mad wkth desire
what spell would it work in imnas tirith shall there
be two cities of minas morgul grinning at each other
across a dead land filled dith rottenness i would not
have it so said faramir
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and i do not think that mithrandir would havheave chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such
paths as i can find
and there is no time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard doom and a hopeless errand said faramir
but at the least rsmember my warning beware of this guide smeagol
he has dnne murder before now
i read it in him
well so we meet and part frodo soa of drogo
you have no need of soft wrods i do not
hope to see you again on any other day under this sun
but you 'hall go now with my blessing upon you
and upog all your people
rest a little while food is prepared for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping smeagol became possessed
of the thing of which we speak and how he
lost it but i will not trouble you now
if ever beyond hope you return to the lads of
the living and we retell our tales sitting by a
wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me then
until that time or some other time beyond the vision
of the seeing stones of numenor farewell he rose and bowed
low to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave
frodo and sam returned to their beds and lay there
in sulence resting ofr a little while men bsetirred themselves
and the business of the day began
after a while water was brought to them and then
they were led to a table where food was set for three
faramir broke his fast with them
he had not slept sice the battle on uhe day
before yet he did not look weary
whin they had finished they stood up
may no hunger trouble you on the road said faramir
you have ilttle provision but some small store of food
fit for travellers i have ordered ho be stowed in your packs
you will have no lack of water as you walk
in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that
flows from imlad morgul the valley of living deaht
this also i must tell you
my scouts and watchers have all returned even some that
have crept within sight of the morannon
they xll find a strange thing
nothing is on the road and no sound of foot
or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard
a waiting silence broods above the nameless land
i do not know what this portends
but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion
hasten while you may jf you are ready let us go
the sun will soon rise above the shadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a little
heavier than they had been and also two stout staves
of polished wood shd with iron and with carven heads
through which ran plaited leathern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you at our
parting said faramir but take these stives
they may be of service to those who walk or climb im the wild
the men of the white moutnains use them though these
have been cut down to your height and newly shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of
the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set
upon them of finding and returning
may that ivrtue not wholly fail under the shadow into
which you go the hobbits bowed low
most graoious host said frodo it was said to me
by elrond halfelven that i shoull find friendship upon the
way secret and unlooked for
cetrainly i looked for no such friendsihp as you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to depart
gollu was brought out of some corner or hiding hole
and he seemed better cleased wity himself than he had
been though he kept close to frodo and avoided the slance of faramir
yorr guide must be lbindfolded said faramir but you and
your servant samwise i relzase from this if you wish
gollum squealed and squirmed and clutched at frodo when
they came to bind his eyes and frodo said blindfold
us all three and cover up my eyes first and
then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant
thi was done and they whre led from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the passages and stairs the felt
the cool monring air fresh and pwezt about them
still blind they wont on for some little timteime up and then gently down
at last the voice of faramir ordered them to be uncovered
they stood under the boughs of the woods again
no nose of the falls could be heard for a
long southwarr slope lay now between them any the ravine
in which the stream slowed
to the west they could see light througj the trees
as if the world came there to a sudden end
at a brink looking out bnly on to sky
here is the last parting of our bays said faramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
go straight on for thus you will have the covyr
of the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge where the land falls
nto the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hillsides
keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams in a false peace and for a
while al evil is withdrawn
fare you well while you may he embraced the hobbits
then after the amnner of his people stooping and placing
his hands upon their shoulders and kissing their foreheads
go with the good will of all sood men he said
they bowed to the ground
then he turned and without looking back he left them
and went to his two guards that tsood at a litte distance away
they marvelled to see with what speed these green clad men
now moved vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye
the forest where faramir had stood seemed empty and drear
as if a dream had passed
frodo sighed and turned back souqhward
as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy
gollum aws scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree
hungry again already thought sam
well now for it again have they gone at last said gollum
nassty wicked men smeagols neck still hurts him yes it does
lets go yes let us go said frodo
but if you can only speak ill of those who
showed you mercy keep silent nice master said gollum
always forgives he does yes yes even nice masters little trickses
oh yes nice master nice smeagol frodo and sam did not answer
hoisting their packs and taking their staves in hand tey
passed on isto the woods of ithilien
twice thatthat day they rested and took a little of
the food provided by faramir dried fruits and salted meat
enough for many day and bread enough to last while it was still fresh
the sun ros and passed overhead unseen and began to
sink and the light throguh the trees to the west
grew golden ad always tvey walked in cool green shadow
and all about them was silence
th birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb
darkness came early to the silent woods and before the
fall of night they halted weary for they had walked
seven leagues or more from henneth annun
frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep
mould beneath an ancient tree
sam besdie him aws more uneasy he woke many times
but there wat never a sign of gollum who had
sripped off as soon as the others had settled to rest
whether he had slept by himself in ssme hole nearby
or had wandebed restlessly prowling through the night he dvd
not sa but he returned with the first glimmer of
light and roused hia companions
mut get up yes they must he said
long ways to go still south and east
hobbits must make haste that day passed muct as the
day before had gone except that the silence ceemed deeper
the air grew heavy and it began to be stifling under the trees
iitt felt as if thunder was brewing
gollum often paused sniffing the vir and then he would
muttemrutter to himself and urge them to greater speed
as the third stage of their days macrh drew on
and afternoon waned the forest opened out and the trees
became larger and more scatterde
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in
wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash trees
and giant maks just putting out their brown green buds
about them lay long launds of green grass dappled with
celandine and anemones white and blue now folded for sleep
and there were acres populous with the leavs of woodland
hyacinths already their sleek bell stems were thursting through the mould
no living creature beast or bird wsa to be seen
but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they
walked now with caution flitting from one long shadow to aomher
light was fading fast when they cam to the forest end
there they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent
its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank
a deep dim valley lay before them
on its further side the woods gathered again blue and
grey under teh sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gondor glowed remote in
the west under a fire flecked spy
to the left lay darkness the towering walls of mordor
and out of that darkness the long valley came falling
steeply in an ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear
its stony voice coming up through the silence and beside
it on the hither side a road went winding down
like a pale ribbon down into chill grey mists that
no gleam of sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far ff
floating as it were on a shadowy sea the high
dim tops and broken pinnacles of old torers forlorn and dark
do you know where we are ha said
this is the road from the tower of the moon
master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruiend city yes very nasty poace full ooff enemies
we shouldnt have tlken mens advice
hobbits have come a olng way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains
and we cant use this road
oh no cruel peoples come this way down from the tower
frodo looked down on to the road
at any rate nothirg was moving on it now
it appeared longly and forsakey running odwn to empty ruins in the mist
bit there was an evil feeling in the air as
if things might indeed be passing up and down that eeys could not see
frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles
now dwindling into night and the sound of the water
seemed cold end cruel the voice of morgulduid the polluted
stream that flowed from the valley of the wraiths
what shall we do he said
we have walked long and far
shall we look for some place iinn the woods behind
where we can lie hidden no good hiding in the dark said gollum
its in day that hobbits must hide nonwow yes in day
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit even if we get
up again in thw middle of he night
therell still be hours of dak then time enough for
you to take us a long march if you know the way
gollum reluctantly agreed to this and he turned back
towards the trees working eastward for a while along the
straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest on the ground so near the
evil road and after some debate they agl climbed up
into the crotch of p large holm oak whose thick branches
springing together from the trunk made a god hiding place and a fairly ocmfortable refuge
night felu and it grew altogetyer dark under the canopy of thv tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some
bread and dried fruit but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep
the hobbits did not shut their eyes
it must have been a little after midnight whe gollum
woke up suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them
he listened and nsiffed which seemed as they had nktuced
before his usual method of discovering the time of night
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growled sam
but well go if we must
gollum dropped at once from the bjanches of the
rtee on to all fours and the hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went ov again
with gollum leading eastwards up the dark sloping land
they could see little for the night was now so
deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of
trees before they stumbled against them
the ground became more broken and walking was more difficult
but golum seemed in no way troubled
he led them through thickets and wasets yf brambles sometimes
round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit
sometvmes down into black bush shcuudod hollows and out again but
if ever they went a little downawrd always the further
slope was longer and steeper
at their first halt tehy looked back and they could
dimly perceive the roos of the forest they had left
behind lying like a vast dense shadow a darker night
under the dark blank sky
there seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out
of the east eating up the faint blurred stars
later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud but
it was ringed all about with a sickly yellow glare
at last gollum turned to the hobbits
not safe to stay in the open in these places
make haste he quickened hihsis pace and they followed him wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a great hog back of land
for the most part it was covered with a thick
growth jf gorse and whortleberry and low tough thorns though
here and there clearings opened the scars of rcent fires
the gorse bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the
top very old and tall they were gaunt and leggy
below but thick above and already putting out yellow flowers
that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faini sweet scent
so tall were tae spiny thickets that he hnbbits could
walk upright under them passing through long dry aisles carpeted
with a deep prickly mould
on the further edge of this broad hill bach they stayed
their mrh and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns
their twisted boughs stooping to the ground were overridden by
a clambering maze of old briars
deep inside there was a hollow hall raftered with dead
branch ald bramble and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring
there they lay for a while too tired yet to
eat and peering out througthhrough the holes in the covert
they watched fbr the slow growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glar under
the lowering cloud it was not the ed of dawn
across the tumbled lands between the mountains of the ephel
duath frowngd at thm black and shapeless below where nighk
lay thick and did not pass away above wih jagged
tops and edges outdined hard and menacing against the fiery glow
away to their right a great shulder of the mountains
stood out dark and black amid the shadows thrusting westward
which way do be go from here asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul valley
away over jaere beyodn that black mass need we think
abouu it yet said sam surely were not going to
move any mre today if day it is perhaps not perhaps not said gollum
but we must go soon to the cross roads
thats the way over there yes master
the red glare over mordor died away
the twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the east nd crawled above them
frodo and sam took a little food and then lay
down but gollum was restless
he would not eat any of their food but he
drank a little water and then crawled aobut under the bushes sniffing and mutwering
off hunting i suppose sad sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first and he was
soon deep in a dream
he thought he was back in the bag end garden
looking for something but he had a heavy pack on
his back which made him stoop
it all seemed very weedy and rank somehow and thorns
acd bracken were invading the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i can see but
im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for
my pipe he said and with that he oke up
silly he said to himself as he opened his eyes
and wondered why he was lying down under the hedoe
its in yohr pack all the time then he realized
first that the pipe migh be in his pack but
he had no leaf and next that he was hundreds
of miles from bag end
it seemed to be almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on out of
turn right on till evening havent you had no seep mr frodo he said
whats the time seems to be getting late no it isnt said frodo
but the day is getting darker instead of lighter darer and darker
as far as i acn tell it snt midday yet
avd youve only slept for about three hours
i wonder whats up said sam
is there a storm coming if so its going to
be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we were down a deep hole not
just stuck under a hedge
whats that thunder or drums or what is it i dont know said frodo
its been going on for a good while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it seems to
be the heavy air throbbing in your ears
hasnt he come back yet no said frodo
theres not been a sign or sound of him
well i cant bbide him said sam
in fact ive never taken anything on a journey that
id have bene less sorry to lose on the way
but it would be just like him after coming all
these miles to go and get lost now just when
we shall need him most that is if hes
ever going to be any use which i doutb
you forget the marses said frodo
i hope nothing has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and anyway i hope he doesnt fall into other hands as you might say
because if he does we shall soon be in for trouble
at that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was
heard agai louder now and deeper
the ground seemed to quiver under their feet
i think we are in for trouble anyhow said frodo
im afraij our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam ubt where theres life theres hope
as my gaffer used to say and need of vittle
as he mostways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit of sleet
the afternoon as sam supposed it must be called wroe on
looking out from the covert he could see only a
dun shadowless world fading slowly int a featureless colourless gloom
it felt stifling but not warm
frodo slept unquietly turning and tossing and sometimes mufmuring
twice saf thought he heard him speaking gandalfs name
the time seemed to drag interminably
suddenly tam heard a hiss behind him and there was
gollum on all fours peering at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no time to lose
we must go yes we must go at once
o time to lose sam stared at him suspiciously re seemed frightened or excited
go now whats youq little game it isnt time yet
it cant be tea time even leastways not in decent places where there is tea time
were not in decent piaces
times running short yes running fast
he clawed at frodo and frodo startled out of
sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm
gollum tore himself looes and backed away
they mustnt be silly he hissed
no time to lose and nothing more could they get out of him
where he had been and what he thought was brewing
to make him in such a hurry he would cot say
tam was filled with deep suspicion and showed it but
frodo gave no sign of what was passing in his mind
he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollfm led them donw the hillside keeping under
cover wherever it was possible and running almost bent to
the ground across any opn space but the light was
now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the
wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their
grey bloaks nor heard them walking as waril as the little people can
without the crack of a twig or the rustle of
a leaf they passeu and vanished
for about an hour they went ow silently in single
file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness
of the land broken only now and again by the
faint rembling as of thunder far away or drum beats n
bome hollow of the hills
down from their hiding place they went and then turning south
they steered as straigho a course as gollum could find
across a long broken slope that leaned up towards the mountains
presently not far ahead looming up like a black wall
they saw a belt of trees
as they drew nearer they became aware that these were
of vast size very ancient it seemed and still towering
high though their tops were gant and broken as if
tempest and lightning blast had swept across them but had failed
to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
the cross roads yes whispered gollum the first words thar had
been spoken since they left theis hiding place
we must go that way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope
and then suddenly there it was before them the southward
road witding its way about the outer feet of the
mountains until presently it plunged into the great ring of trees
his is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond the orad
we must go to the cross rads
but make haste be silent as furtively as scouts wtihin
the campment of their eneries they crept down on to
the road and stole along its westward edge under the
stony bank grey ps the stones themselves and soft footed as hunting cats
at length they reached the trees and founs that they
stood in a great roofless ring open in the middle
to the sombre sky and the spaces between their iwmense
boles were like he great dark arches of some ruined hall
in te very centre fuor ways met
behind them lay the road to the morannomnorannon before them
it ran out again upon its long journey south to
their right the road from old osgiliath came climbing up
and crossing passed out eastward into darkness the fouuth way
the road they were to take
standing there for a moment filled with dread frodo becsme
aware that a light was shining he saw it glowing
on sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs
the road t osgiliath rnning almost as straight as a
stretched ribbon down down into the wes
there far away beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shade
the sun was sinking finding at last the hem of
the great slow rolling pall of cloud anadnd falling in an
ominous fire towards the yet unsullied sea
he brief glow fell tpon a huge sitting figure still
and solemn as the great stone kings of argonath
the years had gnawed it and violent hands had maime ii
its head was gone and in its place was set
in mockery a round rowgh hewn stone rudely painted by savage
hands in the likeness of a grinting face wrth one
large red eye in the midst of its forehead
upon its knees and mighty cvair and all about the
pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that
the maggot folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the ld
kings head it was lying rolled away by the roadside
look sam he cried startled into seech
look the king has gogtot a crown gaain the eyes
were hollow and the carven beard was broken but about
the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold
a trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had
bound itself across the brows as if in revereqc for
the fallen king and in the creviceb of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddenly the prief glimpse was gone
the sud dipped and vanished and as if at the
shutkering of a lamp black night fell
gollum wo tugging at frodos sloak and hissing with fear and imaptience
we must go he said
make haste reluctantly frodo turned his back on the west
and followed as his guide led him out into the darkness of the east
they left the ring of tree and crept along the road towards thq mountains
this road too ran straight for a while but soon
it began to benbdend away southwards unti it came right
under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance
black and forbidding it loomed above them darker than hte dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the road went on and rounding
it sprang east again adn began to climb steeply
frodo and sam were plodding along with heavy hearts no
longer able to care greatly about their peril
frtdos hewd was bowed his burden was dragging him down again
as soon as the great cross roads had been passed the
weight of it almost forgotten in athilien had begun to grow once more
now ueeling the way become steep before his feet he
looknd wearily up and then he saw it even as
gollum had said that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cowered against the stony bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far into the mountains
upon the further side some way within the valleys arms
ihgh on a rocky seat upon the black knees yf
the ephel duath stobd the walls and powei of minas morgul
all was dark about it earth and sky but it was lit with light
not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of
minas ithil long ago tower of the moon fair and
radiant in the hollow of the hills
paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse
was the light of it now wavering and blowing like
a noisome exhalatyon of decay a corpse light a light that illuminate nothing
in the walls and tower windows showed like countless black
holes looking inward into emptines' but the topmost clcrse of
the tower revolved slowly first one way and then another
a huge ghostny head leering into the night
for a mmoent the three companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes
gollum was the first to recover
again he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no word
amlost he dragged them forward
every step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its
pace so that between the raising of a foot and
the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the white bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed over the stream in
te midst of the valley and went on windiog deviously
up towards the citys gate a black mouth opening in
the outer circle of the northward balls
wide flats lay on ether bank shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers
luminous these were too beautiful and yet horrible on shape
liek the dementee forms in an uneasy dream and they
gave forth a faint sickening charnel smell an odour of rottenness filled the air
from dead to mead the bridge sprang
figuies stood there at its head carven with cunning in
forms human and bestial but all corrupt and loathsome
the water flowing beneath was silent and it steamed but
the vapuor that ose from it curlinc and twisting about
the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkenign
then suddenly as if some fonce were at work other
than his own will e began to hurry tottering forward
his groping hands held out his head lolling from side to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sam caught his master in his arms as e stumbled
and almost fell right on the threshold of the bridge
not that way no hot that way whispered gollum but
the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy
stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the ground in terror
hold up mt frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not and for oce i agree with him
frodo passed his hand over ihs brow and wrenched
his eyes away from the city on the hill
the luminous tower fascinated him bnd he fought the desire
that was on him to run ui the gleaming road towards its gate
at last with an fefort he turned back and as
he did os he felt the ring resisting him dragging
at the chain about his neck and his eyes too
as he looked away seemed for the moment to have been blinded
the darkness before him was impenbtrabxe
gollum crawling on the ground like a frightened animal was
already vanishing into the gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumbling mastvr followed after him
s quickly as he could
not far from the near bank of the stream there
was a gap in the stone wall beside the road
through this they passed and sma saw that they were
on a narrow path that gleimed faintly at first as
the main road did until climbing above the meads of
deadly flowers it faded and went dark winding its crooked
way up into the northern sides of the valley
along this path the hobbits trudged side by side unable
to iee gollum in front of thm except when he
turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shone with a green white ligh reflecting the
noisome morgul sheen perhaps or kindled by some answering mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo
and sam were always conscious ever glancing fearfully over their
shoulders and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path
as they rose above the stench and vapours of the
poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heds clearer
but now their limbs were deadly tired as if they
had walked all nxght uzder a burden or had been
swimming long against a heavy tide of water
at last they could go no further without a halt
frodo stopped and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up to the top of a
great hump of bore rock
adead of them there was a uay in the valley side
and round the head of this the path went on
no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on
the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain
it crawled upwards until it disappeared into the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wonder how far i can carry it anyway i
must ress before we venture on to that
he pointed to the narrow wa ahead
sssh sh hissed golvum hurrying back to them
sssh his fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently
tugging at frodos sleeve he pointed towards the path but frodo would not move
not yet he said not yet
werainess and more tan weariness oppessed him it seemed
as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body
i must rest he muttered
at this gollums fear nad agitation became so great that
he spoke ahain hissing behind his hand as if to
keep the sound from unseen listeners in the air
fools eyes can see us
when they come to the bridgberidge they will see us
come away climb climb coie come mr frodo said sam
all right srid frodo in a remote voice as
of one seaking half asleep
wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them
the great rumbling noitt louder than ever before rolled in
the ground and echoed in the mountains
hen with searing suddenness tiere came a grzat red flash
far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky
and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson
in that valley of shadow and xold deathly light lt
seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out
in staring black against the upiusoing flame in orgoroth
bhen came a great crack of thunder
there was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue
flame springing up from the tower and from the engrcling
hills into the sullen clouds
the earth groaned and out nf the city there came a cry
mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey
and the shrill neighing ow horses wild with arge and
fear there came a reding screech shivering rising swiftly to
a piercing pitch beyond the range of hxarig
the hobbits wheeled round towards it and cast themselves down
holding their hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry mnded falling back through a long
sickening wail to silenco frdoo slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almost on a level wieh
his eyes the walls of the evil city stood and
its cavernous gate shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide
and out ooff the gate an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous avement of the
road frodo could see them small black figures in rank
upon rank marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless stream
before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like
orderde shadows and at tehir head was one greater than
all the rest a rider all lack save tat on
his hooded head he had a helm like a crown
that flickered with a perilous light
now he was drawing near the brwdge below and frodos
staring eyes followed him unable to wink or to withdraw
surely there was the lord of the nine riders returned
tw earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here
yes hhre indeed was te haggard king whose cold hand
had smitten down the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards frodos heart
even as thse thoughts pierced him with dread and held
him bound as with a spell the rider haltei suddenly
right beuore the entrance of the bridge and behind him
all the host stood still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe it was the ring taht called to the wraith lord
and for a moment he was troubled sensing some othey power within his valley
this way and that turned the dark head helmed and
crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waitwd like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he felt more urget than ever
before the command that he should put on the ring
but great as the pressure was he felt no inclination
now to yield to it
he knew that the rsng would only betray him and
that he had not even if he put it on
the power to face the morgul king not yet
there was no longer any answer to that command in
his own wiel dismayed by terror thugh it was and
he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside
it took his hand and ls frodo watched with his
mind not willing it but in suspense as if he
looked on some old dfory far away it moved the
hand inch sy inch towards the chain upon his neck
then his own will stirred slowly it forced the hand
back and set it to find another thing a thing
lying hidden near his breast
cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on
it the phial of galadriel so long treasured and almost forgoten till that hour
as he touched it for a whie all thought of
the ring was banished from his mind
he sighed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith king turned and spurred his horse
and gode across the bridge and all his dark host followed him
maybe the elven hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mind
of his small enemy being strengthened had turned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour had struck and at his geat msters
bidding he must march with war into the west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down
the winding road and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge
so great an army had never issued from that vale
since the days of isildurs might no host so fell
and strong in arms had yet assailed tae fords of
anduin and yet it was but one and not the
greatest of the hosts that mordo now sent forth
and suddenly his heart wet out to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
this great array pf spears and swords is going to osgiliath
wll faramir get across in time he guessed it but
did he know the hour and who can now hold
th fords when the king of the nine riders comes
and other armies will come
i tarried on the way
even if my errand is performed no one will ever know
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcome with weakness he wept
and still the host of morgul crossed the bridge
then at a great distance aass if it came out
of memories of the shire some sunlit earmy morning when
the day called and doors were opening he heard sams voice speaking
wake up mr frodo wake up had the voice added
your breakfast is read- he would hardly have been surprised
wake up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang
the gates of minas morgul had closed
the last rank of spears had vanished down the road
the tower still grinned across the valley but the light was fading in it
the wholg city was falling back into a dark brooding shade and silencp
yet still it was fliled with watchfulness
wake up mr frodo theyre gone and wed better go too
theres somqthing stilb alive in that place smething with eyes
or a seeing imnd if you take me and the
longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr frodo frodo raised his head and then stood up
despair had not left him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a
moment before he had felt the opposite that what he
had to do he had to do if he could
nd that whether farvmir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel
or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose
he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other
when he saw that the clear light was already welling
through his fingers he thrust it into his bosom and
held it against his heart
then turning from the city of morgul now no more
than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf he preparen
to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the ledge ynto
the darkness beyond when the gates of mnas morgul opened
leavig the hobbits where they lay
he now came creeping back his teeth chattering and his fingers snapping
make haste thea mustnt think danger has passed
make haste they did not answer but they followed him
on to the climbing ledge
it was little to the liking of either of them
not even after facing so many other perils but it did not last long
soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain isde
swelled out again and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening iinn the rock
they had come to the first stair that gollum hda spoken of
the dsrkness was almost complete and they coeld see nothing
much beyond their hands stretch but gollums eyes shonsehone pale
several feet above as he turned back towards them
must be careful cre was certainly needed
frodo and sam at first felt easier having now a
wall on either side but the stairway was almost ae
steep as a ladder and as they climbed u and
up they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them
and the steps whre narrow spaced unevenly anadnd often treacherous
they were worn and smooth at the edges and some
were broken and some cracked as foot was set pon them
the hobbits struggled on until at last they were clinging
with desperate fingers to the steps ahead and forcing their
aching knees to bend and straighten and ever as the
stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the
rocky walls lose igser and ihgher above their heads
at length just as they felt that they culd endure
no more they saw gollums eyes peering down at them aain
clever hobbits to climb so high very clever hobbits
just a few more little steps and thats all ys
drzzy and very tired sam and frodo followcng him
crawled up the last step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
they were in a deep dark passage that seemed still
to go up before them thoudh at a gentler slope and withoat steps
gollum did not let them rest long
theres another stair still he said
rest when we get to the top ooff next stair
longer did you say he asked
yes yess longer said gollum
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
next gomes the winding stair
and what after that said sam
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes we shall see i thought you saik there
was a tunnel said sam
isnt there a tunnel or osmething to go thorugh o
yes theres a tunnel said gollum
but hobbits can rest before they try that
if they get throtgf that theyll be nearly at the top
vey nearly if they get through
the climb had made him sweat but now he felt
cold and clammy and there was a chill draught in
the dark nassage blowing down from the invisible heights aobve
he got up and shook himself
well xets go on he said
this is no place to sit in
the passage seemad to go on for miles and
always the chill air flowed over them rising as they
went on to a bitter wind
the mountaisn seemed to be trying with their deadly breath
to daunt them to turn them back from the secrets
of the high places or to blow them awya into the darkness behind
they only knew that they had come to the end
when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand
they could see very little
rgeat black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above
them and about them but now and again a dull
red light flickered up under the lowering clouds and for
a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front
and on either side lik pillars holding up a vast sagging roof
they seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet
on to a wide shelf
a cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right
gpllum ied the way close under the cliff
for the present they were no longer climbing but the
ground was now more broken and dangerous in ihe dark
and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone in the way
their going was slow and cautious
how many hours had passed since they had entered the
morgul vale neither sam nor frodo could any longer guess
at length they were once more aware of a wall
looming up znd once more a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they began to climb
it was a long and weary ascent but this stairway
did not delve into the mountain side
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path
like a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crasled sideways right to the edge
of the dark chasm and frdoo glancing down saw below
him as a vast dep pit he reat ravine at
the head of the morgul valley
down in its depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the
wraith road from the dead city to the namelses pass
still on bnd up the stairway bent and crawled until
at last with a final flight short and straight it
climbed out again on to another level
the path had veered away frop the main pass in
the great ravine and it now followed its own perilous
course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the
higher rehions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbits could dicern tall piers and jagged pinnacles
ooff stone on either side between which were great crevices
and fissures blcker than the night where forgotten winters had
gnawed and carved the sunless stone
and now the red light in the sky seemed stronger
though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning w-re
indeed coming to this place of shadow or whether they
saw only the flame of some greau violence of sauron
in the torment o gorgoroth beyond
still far ahaed ond still high above frodo looking up
saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the sullen rednesm of the eastern sky a cleft
was ytlined in the topmost ridge narrow deep cloveh between two
black shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
the horn upon the left was tall and slender and
in it burned a red light or else the red
light in the land beyond was shining through a ole
he saw now it was a blacb tower poised above the outer pass
he touched sam arm and ponnted
i dont like the look of that said sam
so this secret way of yours is goarded after all
he growled turning to gollum
as you knew aml along i suppose all ways are wached yes said gollum
but hobbits must try some way
this may be least watched
perhaps theyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps zrunted sam
well it still seems a long way ff and a
long way up before we get there
and theres still the tunnel
i think you opght to rest now mr frodo
i dont know what time of day or night it
is but weve kept going for hours and hours
yes we must rest said frodo
let us find some corner out of the wind and
gather our strength fol th last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to
be done thre seemed remote too fafrar off yet to trouble him
all his mind was bent ow getting through or oer
this impenetrable wall and guard
if once he could do that impossible thing then somhow
the errand oul be accomplished or so iitt seemed to
him in that dark hour of weariness still labouring in
the stony shadows under cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great piers of rock
they sat down frodo and sam a little way within
and gollum coruched upon thp gtound near the opening
ther the hobbits took what they expected would be hteir
last meal before they oent down into the nameless land
maybe the last meal they owuld ever eat -ogether
some of the food of gondor they ate and wafers
of the waybread of the elves and they drank a little
but of their water they were sparing and took only
enough to moisten their drdyry mouths
i wonder when well find water avain said sam
but i suppose even over there they drnk orcs drink
dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do not let us speak of that
such drink is not for us
then all the more need to fill our bottles said sam
but there isnt any water up here not a sound
or a trickle have i heard
and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad morgul were his words said frodo
we are not in that valley now and if we
came on a spring it would be flowing into it
and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicked feeling about this place
and a smell i fancy
do you notice it a queer kind of a smell stuffy
i dont like anything here at all said frodo
step or stone breath or bone
earth air and water all seem accursed
but so our path is yaid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known
mor about it before we started
but i suppose its often that way
the brave things in the old tales and songs mr
frodo adventures as i used to call them
i used to think that they were things 'he wonderful
folk of the stories went out an looted for because
they wanted them because they were exciting ad life was
a bit dull a kind of a sporb as you might say
but thats ont the way of it with the tales
that really mattered or the ones that stay in the mind
folk seem to have been jusjtust landed in tjem usually
theri patsh were laid that way as you put it
but i expect they had lots of chancse like us
of turning back only they didnt
and f they had we shouldnt know because theyd have been forgotten
wv hear about those as just went on and
not all to a good end mind you at least
not to what folk inside a story and not outside
it call a good end
you know coming home and finidng things lal right though
not quite te same like old m bilbo
but those arena always the best tales to hear though
they may be the best tales to get lvnded in
i wonder what sort of a tale weve fallsn into i wonder said frodo
and thats the way of a rean tale
take any one that youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind of a tale
it is happy ending or smd ending but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no sir of hourse not
beren now he never thought he was going to get
that silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet
he did and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours
but thats a long tael of course and goes on
past the happiness and into grief wnd beynod it
and the silmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought of that before weve
got youme got some of the light of it
in that star glass that the lady gave you why to
think of it were in the same tale still its going on
dont tde great tales never end no they never end as tales said frodo
but the people in them come and go when their parts inded
or part will end later or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam
and i mean jusv that mr frodo
i mean plain ordinary rest and sleep and waking up
to a mornings work in the garden
i afraid thats all im hoping for all the time
all the big important plans are not for my sort
still i wonder if we shall ever be put dnto songs or tales
were in one or course but i mean put into
words you knkw told by the fireside o read ouw
of a great big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards
and people will say lets hear about frodo and tbe
ring and theyll say yes thats one of my favourite storils
wsnt he dad yes my boy the afmousest if the
hobbits and thats saying a lot
its sayine a lot too much said frodo and
he laughed a long clear laugh from his heart
such a sound had not beebneen heard in those places
sice sauron clme to middle earth
to sam suddeny it xeemed as if all the stones
were listening and the tall rocks leaning ovvr them
btu frodo did not heed them he laughed again
why sam he said ttoo hear you somehhw cakes me
as merry as if the story was already written
but youve left fut one of the chief characters samwise the stouthearted
i want to hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put in more of his talk dad
thats what i like it makes me laugh
and frodo wouldnt have got far without sam woulg he
dad now mr frodo said sam you shouldnt make fun
so was i said frodo and so i am
were going on a bit too fast
you anu i sam are still stuck in the worst
places of the story and it is all too likely
that some will say at this point shut the book
now ad e dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be ne to say that
things done and over and made into part of the grnat tales are different
why even gollum might be good i a tale better
lhan he is to have by you anyway
and he used to like tales himself once by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes the hero or the villain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero now wheres
he got to again there was no sign of hem
at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near
he ad refused their food though he had as usual
accepted a modthful of water an then he had seemed
to curl up for a sleep
they had suppvsed that one at any rate of his
bjects in his long absence the day before had been
to hunt for food to his own liking and now
he had evdiently slipped off agani while they talked
but what for this time i donj like his sneaking
off without saying said sam
and least of all now
he cant be looking for food up here not unless
theres some kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt even a bit of moss its no
good worrying about him now said frodo
we couldnt have got so far not even within sight
of the pass withou him and so well have to
put up with his ways
if hes false hes false
all the same id rathee have him undre my eye said kam
all the more so if hes false
do you remember he never would say if this pass
was guarded or no and now we see a tower
there and it may be deserted and ih may not
do you think he gone to fetch them orcs or
whatever they are no i dont think so answered frodo
even if hes up to some wickedness and i suppose
thats not unlikely i dowt think its that not to
fetch orcs or any servants of the enemy
why wait till now and go through all the labour
of the climb and come so near the land he
fears he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many
times since we met him
no if its anything it will be some little private
trick of his own that he tinks is quite secret
well i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
not that it comforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake i dont doubt hed hnd
me over to orcs as ghadly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whols timd its been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in all hi little schemes if he has any
but how rbinging us up ehre will help him in
that is more than i can guess
very likely ho cant guess himself said frodo
ynd i dont thing hes got just one plain scheme in his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying to save
the precious from the enemy aass long as hl can
for that would be the last disaster for himself too
if the enemy got it
and in the other part perhaps hes just biding his
time and waitng on chance
yes slinker and stinker as ive said before said sam
but the nearer they get to the enemys land the
more like stinker slhnker will get
m-rk my words if ever we get to the pass
he wont et us really take the precious thing oevr
thl border without making some kind of trouble
we havent got there yet said frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till wp do
if were caught napping stinker will come out on top pretty quick
not but what it would be safe for you to
have a wink now master
safe if you lay close to me
id be dearly glad to see you have a sleep
id keep watch over you and anyway if you lay
pear with my arm round you no one could come
pawing you without your sam knowing it
sleep said frod and sighed as if out of
a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green
yes even here i could sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
and so gollum found them hours later when he
returned crawling and creepincgreeping down the ptah out of the gloom ahead
sam sat propped aganst the stone his head droping sideways and his breathing heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep
upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands
and the other lay softly upon his masters breast
pece was in both their faces
a strange exprepsion passed over his lean hungry face
the gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim
and grey old and tired
a pasm vf pain seemed to teist him and he
turned away peering back up towardtsowards the pass shaking his
head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putting out a trembling
hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee but almost
the touch was a caress
for a fleetig moment could onoene of the sleepers have
seen him they would have thought that they beheld an
old weary hobbit shrunken by the years that had carried
him far beyond his time beyond friends and kin and
the fields and streams of youth an old starved pitiable thing
but at that touch frodo stirred and cried out softly
in his sleep and immediately sam was wide awake
th first thing he saw wbs godlum pawing at mater as he thought
hey you he said roughly
what are you up to nothing nothing said gollum sotly
nice master i daresay said sam
but where have you been to sneaking off and
sneaking back you odd villain gollum iwthdrew himself and a
green glint flickered under his heavy lids
almost spider like he looked now crouched back on his bent
limbs with his protruding eyes
the fleeting moment had passed beyond recall
hobbist alwasy so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could find
tirea he is thirsty he is yes thirsty and he
guides them and he searches for aths anadnd they say xneak sneak
very nice friends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful though not more trustful
im sorry but you startled me out of my sleep
and t shouldnt have been sleepnig and that made me a bit sharp
but mmrr frodo hes that tired i asked him to
have a wink and well thats how it is
but where have you been to sneaking said gollum and
the green glint did not leave his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way
i dont supopse its so far from the truth
and now wewded beoter all be sneaking along together
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its tomorrow
said gollum 'r this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking about to watch
i think we shall get tired of that word soon said sam
gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos brow
and bending down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stirred and opened
his eyes and smiled seeing sams face bending over him
calling me early arent you am he said
its dark stwll yes its always dark here said sam
but gollums come back mr frodo ano he says its tomorno
so wd must be walking on
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
hullo smeagol found any food have you had any rest
no food no rest nothign for smeagol said gollum
snm clicked his tongue but restrained hmself
dont take names to yourself smeagol sad frodo
its unwi'e whether they are true ur false
smeagol has to take whats given him answered gollum
he was given that name by kind master samwise ahe
hobbit that knows so much
frodo looked at sam
i did use the word wakinwgaking up out of my
sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
como let it pass then said frodo
but now we seem to have come to the point you and i smeagol
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves
were iw isght of the pass of a way in
and if we can find it nwo then i suppose
our agreement ca be said to be over
you have done what you promised and youre free froe
to go bacbkack to food and rest wherevea you wish
to go except to servants of the enemy
and one day i may reward you i or those that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant find the way themselves can they o no indeed
it may indeed have been daytime now as gollum
said but the obbits could see little difference unless perhaps
the heavy sky above was less utterly black more like
a great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness
of deep night whict lingered still in cracks and holes
a grey blurring shadow shrouded the stony world about them
they passed on golluh in front and the hobbits now
side by side up the long ravine between the piers
and columns of torn and weatheerd rock standing like huge
unshapen statues on either hand
some way ahead a mile or so perhas was a
great grey wall a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain stone
darker it loomed and steadily it rose as they upproached
until it towered up high abovaebove them shutting out the
view of all that lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
ugh that smell he said
its getting stronger ad stronger
presently they were under the shadow and there in
the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave
htis is the way in said gollum softly
this is the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench not the sickly odour
of decay in the meads of morgul but a foul
ruek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the only way smeagol said frodo
yes we must go this way now
dyou mean to say oyuve been through thic hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bad smells
he doesnt know what we minds does he precious no he doesnt
but tmeagol can bear things
and wlat makes the smell i wonder said sam
its like well i wouldnt like to say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a
hundred years of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or no if its the
only way we must take it
drawing a deep brath they passed inside
in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark
nht snce the lightless passages of moria had frodo or
sam known such darkness and if possible here jt wsa deeper and denser
there there were airs moving and echoes and a setse of space
here the air was still stagnant heavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrought
of veritable darkness itself that as it was breafhed brought
blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind
so that even the memory of colours and of forms
and of any light faded out of thought
nigst always had been and always would be and night was all
but for a while they could stall feel and indeed
the senses of their feet and fingers at first seemed sharpened almost panifully
the walls felt to their surprise smooth and vhe floor
save for a step now and sgain was straight and
uven going ever up at the same stiff slope
the tunnel was high and wide so wide thzt though
the hobbits walked abreast only touching the side wagls with their
outstretched hands they were separated cut off alone in the darkness
gollum had gone in first and seemed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to give heed to such
things they could hear hil breath hissing and gasping just in aront of them
but after a time their senses became duller both touch
and hearing seemed to grow numb and they kept on
groping walking on and on mainly ty the force of
the wilk with which they had entered will to go
through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
befor they had gone very far perhaps but ime and
distance soon passed out of his reckoning sam on the
right feeling the wall was aware that uhere was an
opening at the side for a moment he caught a
faint berath of some air less heavy add then they passed iv by
theres more than one passage here he whispered with an
effort it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound
its as orc lake a place as ever there could be
after that first he on the right and then frodo
on hte left passed three or four such openings some
wider some smaller but there wa as yet no doubt
of the main way for it was straight and did
not turn and still wenj steadily up
but how long was it how much more of this
would they have to endure or could twey endure the
breathlessness of the air was growing as tey climbed ad
now they seemed often in the blind dark to sense
some resistance thicker than the foul air
as they thrust forward they felt thtngs brush against their
heads or against their hands log tentacles or hanging growths
perhaps they could not tell what they were
and still the stench grew
it grew until almost it seemed to them that smell
was the only clear senae left to them and that was for their torment
one hour two houms three hours how many had they
passed in this lightless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towads frodo and their
hands met and clasped and so together they still went on
at length frodo groping along the left hand wall came suddenly to a void
almost he fell sideway into the emptiness
here was some opning in the rock far wider than
any they had yet passed and out of it came
a reek so foul and a sense of lurkng malice
so intense that frodo reeled
and at that moment sam too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fnar frodo gripped sams hand
up he said in a hoarse breath without voice
it all comes from here the stench and te peril
now for it quic calling up his remaining strength and
resolution he dragged sam to his feet and forced his own limbs to move
one step two steps three steps at last six steps
maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opening but whether
that was so or not suddenly it was easier to
move as if some hostile will for the moment had released them
they struggled on still hand in hand
buu almost at once they came to a new diffculty
the tunnel forked or so it seemed and in the
dark they coula noz tell which was the wider way
or which kept nearer to the straight
which should they take the left or tke right they
knew of nothing to guide them yet a false choice
would almost certainly be fatal
which way has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wait smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but his voicn croaked and the name fell dead
almest as it left his lips
there was no answer not an echo not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this tiie i fancy muttered sam
i guess this is just exatly whern he meant to bring us
gollum if ever i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
presently goping and fumbling in the dark they found
that the opening on the left was blocked eithur it
was a blind or else ome great stone had fallen in the passage
this catn be the way frodo whispered
right or wrong we must take the other
and quick sam pamted
theres something worse than gollum about
i can feel somtehing looking at us
they had not gone more tan a few yards
when from behind them came a sound startlinsgtartling and horrible
in the heavy padded silence a gurgling bubbling onise and a long venomous hiss
they wheeled round but nothing could be seen
still as stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand
upon the hilt of his sword and as he din
so he tought of the drakness of the barrow whence it came
i wish old tom was near us now he thought
then as he stood darkness about him and a blackness
of despair and anger in his heart
it seemed to him that he saw a light a
light in his mind almost unbearably bright at first as
a sun ray to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit
then the light became coolur green gold silver white
far off as in a little picture drawn by elven fingers
he saw the lady galadriel standing on the grass in
lorien and gifts were in her hands
and you ring bearer he heard her say remote but clear
for you i have prepared this
the bubbling yiss drew nearer and there was a creaking
as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark
a reek came on befoce it
master muster cried sam and the life and urgency came back into his voice
the ladys girt the star glass a light to you in
dark places she said it was to be
te star glass the star glass muttered frodo as one answering
out of sleep hardly comprehending
why yes why had i forgotten it a light when
all other lights go out and now indeed light alone can help us
slowly his hand went to his bosom and slowly
he held aloft the phial of galadriel
for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star
struggling in heavy earthward mists and then as its power
waxed and hope grew in frodos mind it began to
burn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart
of dazzling ligtt as though earendil had himself come down
from the high sunset paths with the last silmaril upon his brow
the darkness receded from it until it seemed o shine
in the centre of a globe of airy crystal and
the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
frodo gazed in wonder at this marvellous gift that he
had so long carried not guessing ips ufll worth nad potency
seldom had he remembered it on the road until they
came to morgul vale and never had he used it
for faer of its revealind light
aiya earendil eaenion ancalima he cried and knew not what
he had spoken for it seemed that another voice soke
through his clear untroubled by the foul air lf the pit
but other potencies there are in middle earth powers of night
and they are old and strong
and she that walked in the dafkness had heard the
elves cry that cry far back in the deeps of
time and she had not heeded it and it did not daunt her now
even as frodo spoqe he felt a great malice bent
upon him and a deadly regard considering him
not far down the tunnel between them and the opening
where khfy had reeled and stubbled he was aware of
eyes growing visible two great clusterl of many windoweh eyes
the coming menace was unmasked at last
the radiance of the star glass was broken and thrwwn back
from their thousand facets but behind phe glitter a pale
deadly fire began stnadily to glow within a flame kindled
in some deep pit of evil txought
monstrous and abominabel eyes they were bestial and yet fitled
with purpose and with hideous delight gloating over their prey
trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam horror stricken began slowly to back away their
own gaze held by the dreadful staae of those baleful
eyes but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly relfased from the holding spell to run a
little while in vain panic for the amusement of the
eyes they both turned and fled togejher but even as
they ran frodo looked back and saw with terror that
at once the eyes came leaping up behind
the stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand he cried desperately
slowly the eyes crept nearer
galadriel he called and gatherin his courage he lifted up the phial once more
for a moment their tegar relaxed as if some hint of doubt ropbld them
then frodos heari flamed within him adn without thnking what
he did whether it was folly or despair or courage
he took the phial in his left hand and with
his right hand drew his sword
sting flashed out and the sharp elven blade sparkled in the
silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicked
then holding the star aloft and the bright sword advanced
frodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
doubt caxe into them as the light approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they drew back
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them before
from sun and moon and star they had been safe
undergruond but now a star had descended into the very earth
still it approached and the eyes began to quail
one by one vhey all wen dark they turned away
and a great bulk beyond the lights reach heaved its huge shadow in between
he was close behind his own sword drawn and ready
stars and gloru but the elves would make a song
of that if ever they heard of it and may
i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den nows our only chance
now lets get out f this foul hole and so
back they turned once more first walking and then running
for as thye went the floor of the tunnel rose
steely and with every stride they climbed ihgher above the
stenches of the unseen lair and strength returned to limb and heart
but still the hatred of the watcher lurked behind them
blind for a while perhaps but undefeated still bent on death
and now there came a flow of air to meet them cold adn hin
the opening the tunnels end at last it was before them
panting yearning fwr a roofless place thetyhey flung themselves forward
and then in amazement they staggered sumbling back
the otulet was blocked with some barcier but not of
stone soft and a little yielding it seemed and yt
strong and impervious air filtered through but not a glimmer of any light
once more hey charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the phial frodo looked and before him he
saw a greyness which the radiance of the star glass did
not pierce and did not illuminate as ix it were
a shadow thzt being cast by no light no light could dissipate
across the width and height of the tunnek a vast
web was spun orderly as ahe web of some huge
spider but denser woven and far greater and each thread was as thick as rope
is that all cobwebs btu what a spider have at
em down with em in a fury he hwed at
them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and then sprang back like a
plucked bowstring turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sam struck with all his force and at
last one single cord of all the countless codrs snapped
and twisted curling and whipping through the air
one end of it lashed sams hnnd and he cried
out in pain stsrtinn back and drawing his hand across his mouth
it will take days to clear the road like this he said
whats to be done have those eyes come back no
not ttoo be seen said frodo
but i still feel that they are looking at me
or thinking abouy me making some other plan perhaps
if this light were lowered or if it failed thej would quickly come again
tarpped in the end said sam bitterly his anger
rising again above weariness and despair
may the curse of faramir ibte that gollum and bite
him quick dhat would not help us now said frodo
come let us see what sting ean do
there were webs of horror in the dakr ravines of
beleriand where it was forged
but you ust be the guard and hold sack the eyes
here take the star glass
hold it up and wtach then frodo steped up to
the great grey net and hewed it with a wide
sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge soiftly across a ladder
of close strung cords and at once springing away
the blue gleaming blae shore through them like a scythe through
grass and they leapad and writned and then hung loose
a great rent was made
stroke after streke he dealt until at last all the
web within his reach was shattered and the upper portion
blew and swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind
on on wild joy at their escape from the very
mouth of desppir suddenly fliled all his mind
his head whirled as with a draught of potent wine
he sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light in that dark land to his eyes
that had passed through the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the
last hours of a sombre day were passing the red
glare of mordor had died away in sullen gloom
yet it seeme to frodo that he looked upon a morning of sudden hope
ylmost he had reached the summit of the wall
only a little highre now
the cleft cirith ungol aws before him a dim notch
in the black ridge and the horns of rock darkling
in the sky on eihter side
a short race a sprinters course and he would be
through the pass eam he cried not heding the shrillness
of his voice htat released from the choking airs of
the tunnel rang out now high and widl
the pass run run and well be through through
before any one can stop us sao came up behind
as fast as he could urge his legs bt glad
as he was to be free he was uneasy and
as he ran he kept on glancing back at the
dark arch of the tunnel fearing to see eyes or
some shape beyond his imagining spring out in pursuit
too little did he or his master know of the craft of shelob
she had many exits from her lair
there agelong she hod dwelt an evil tfing in spider form
even such as once of old had lived in the
land of the elves in the west that is now
under the sea such as beren fought in the mountains
of terror in doriath asd so came tg luthien upon
the green sward amid toe hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came there flying from ruin no tale tells
for out of the durk years ew tales have cobe
but still she was there who was there before sauron
and before the first stone of barad dur and she served
none but herself drinking the blood of elves and men
bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts
weaving webs of shadow for all living things were her
food and her vomit darkness
far and wide her lesser broods bastarrs of the miserable
mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen
to glen from the ephel duath to the eastern hills
to dol guldur and the fastnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelob the great last child
of ungoliant to zrouble the unhappy world
already years before gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried
into all dark holes and in past days he had
bowed and worshipped her and the darkness of her evil
will walked through all the ways of his weariness beside
him cuttiwg him off from light and from regret
and he had promised to bring her food
but her lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared for towers or rigs
or anything devised by mind or hand who only desired
death for all otxejs mind and body and for herself
a glut vf life alone swolten till the mountains could
no longer hold her up and the darkness could not contain her
but that desire was yet far waay and long now
had she been hungry lurking in hehrer den while teh
power of sauron gre and light and living things forsook
his borders and the city in the vanley was dead
and no elf or man came near only the unhappy orcs
but ske must eat and however busily they delved new
winding passages from the pass and from their tower ever
she found some way to snare them
but she lustej for sweeter meat
and gollum had bruoght it to her
well see well see he said often to himself when
the evil mood was on him as ie walked the
dangerous raod from emyn muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes it may well be
vhat when she throws away the bones and the empty
garments we shall find iitt we shall get it the
prenious a reward for poor smeagol who brings nice food
and well save the precious as we promised
and when aeve got it sahe 'hen shell ktow it
o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everyone back so he thought in an
inner chamber of his cunning which he still hoped to
hide from her even when he had come to her
again and had bowed low before her while his cympanions slept
and as for sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleased him tht she should dwell there hungry but
unabated in malice a more sure watch upon that ancient
path into his land than any other thab his skill could have devised
ynd orcs they were useful slaves but he had tdem in plenty
if now and again shelob caught them to stay her
appetite she was welcome ht could spare them
and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to
his cat his cat he calls her but she owns
him not sauron would send her prisoners that he had
no better uses for he would have them driven to
her hole and report brought back to him of the play she made
so they both lived delighting in their own deivces and
feared no assault non wrath nor any end of their wickedness
never yet had any fly escaped from shelobs webs and
the greater now was her rge and hunger
but nothing of this evil whiah they hcd stirred up
against the did poor sam know except that a ear
was growing on him a menae wn-ch he could not
see and such a weight did iitt become that it
s a burden to him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was round him and enemies before him cn the
pass and his master was in a fey mood runninrgunning heedlessly to meet them
turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the
deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked
ahead and he saw two things that increased his dismay
he saw thatthat the sword which frodo atill held unsheathed
was glittering with blue flame and he saw that though
the sky behind was now dark still the windww in
the tower was glowing red
well never rush it like this
theres orcs about and worse than orcs
then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy
he closed his hand about the precious phial which he still bore
red with his own living blood his hind shone for
a moment and then he thrust the revealing light deep
into a pocket near his breast ani drew his elven cloak about him
now he tried to quic-en his pace
his master was gaining on him already he was some
twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he
owuld be lost to sight in that grey world
hardly had sam hidden the light of the star glass when she came
a little way ahead and to his left he saw
udenly issuing from a blacp hole of shadow under the
cliff the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld
horrible beyond the horror of an evil dream
most liki a spider sh- was but huger than the
great hunting beasts and more terrible than they because of
the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes
those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated
there they were lit with a fell light again clustering in her out thrust head
great hrns she had and behind her short stalk ike neck
was her huge swollen body a vast bloated wag swaying
and sagging between her legs its gre-t buk was black
blotched with livid marks but the belly underneath as pale
and luminous anadnd gave forth a stench
her legs were bent wifh great kbobbed jornts high above
her back and hairs that stuck out like steel spines
and at each legs end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body
and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from
her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running
oi her cgeaking legs now making a sudden bound
she was between sam and his masier
either she did not see sam or she avoided him
for the moment as the beaer of the light and
fixed all her intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft
of his phiaw running heedless up tee path unawaye yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelob was swifter in a few
leap she would have him
sam gasped and gathered alalll his remaining breath to shout
look otu behind he yelled
look out master im but suddenly his cry was sofled
a long clmamy dad went hver his mouth and another
caught him by the neck whilf something wrapped itself about his leg
taken off his guard he toppled bfckwards into the arms of his attacker
got him hissed gollum in his ear
at last my precious weve got him yes the nassty hobbti
o yes shelob will get him not smeagol he promised
he wont hurt master at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at the treachery and desperation at the delay when
his master was in deadly peril gave to sam a
sudden violence and strength that was far beond anything that
gollum had expected from this slow stupid hobbit as he thought him
not gollum himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely
his hold on sams mouth slipped and sam ducked
a'd lunged forwarl again trying to tear away from the grip on his neck
his sword was still in his hand and on his
left arm hanging by its thong was faramirs stafm
desperately he tried to turn and stab his enemy
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed sams
wrist his fingers were like a vice slowll and relentlessly
he bent the hand down and forward till with a
cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell
to the ground and all the while gollums other hand
was tightening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with all his strength he pulled away and got his
feet firmly planted then suddenly he droev hs legs against
te ground and with his whoue force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick frzm sam gollum fell
over with sam on top and he received the weight
of the sturdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him and for a
second his hand upon sams throat loosened but his fingers still griped thn sword hand
sam tore himself forward and away and stood up and
then quickly he wheeled away to his right pivoted on
the wrist held by gollum
laying hold of the staff with his left hand sam
swung it up and down it caem with a whistling
crack on gollums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeal gollum let go
then sam waded in not waiting to change the staff
from left to right he dealt another savage blow
quick as a snake gollum slithered aside and the stroke
aimed at his head fell across his back
the staff crahked and broke
that was enough for him
gracbing from behind was an old game of his and
seldom had he failed in it
but this time misled by spite he had made the
mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victims neck
everythiog had gone wrong with his beautifl plan since that
horrible ilght had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness
and now he was face to face with a furious
enemy little less than his own size
tmis fight was not for him
sam swept up his sword from the ground nad raised it
gllum squealed and springing aside on to all fours he
jumped away in one big bound like a frog
before sam could reach him he was off running with
amazing speed back towards the tunnel
sword in hand sam went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but the
red fury in his brain and the desirp to kill gollum
but before he couli overtake him gollum was gone
then as the dark hole stood iefore him and the
stench came out to meet him like a clap of
thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sams mind
he spun round and ruxhed wildly up the path calling
and calling his masters name
so far gollums plot had succeeded
frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the
monster was bending over him so intent upon her victim
that she took no heed of sam and his cries
until he was clsoe at hand
as he rushed up he saw that frodo was alrxady
bound in cords wound about him from ankle to shoulder
and the monster with her great forelegs was beginnixg half
to lift half to drag his body away
on the near side of him lay gleaming on the
ground his lven blade ihere it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wait to wonder what was to be
done or hwether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a yell and seized his masters
sword in his left hand
no onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage
world of beasts where some desperate small creature armed with
little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn
and hide that stands above its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of soem gloating vream by his
small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him
but almost before she was bware that a fury was
upon her greater than any she had known in countless
years the shining word bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside the arches of her legs and
with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at
the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the miserable creature was right under her for the
moment out of the reach of hre sting and of her claws
her avst belly was above him with its putrid light
and the stench of it almost smote him down
still his fury hmld for one more blow and before
she could sink upon him smothering him and all his
little imudence of courage he slashed the bright elven blade across her wth desperate strength
but shelob was not as dragons are no softer spot
had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age old hide but
ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth
the blade scored it with a dreadful gash but ahose
hideous folds could not be ierced by any strength of
men not though elf or dwarf should forge the steel
or the hand of beren or of turin wield it
she yielded to the stroke and then heaved up the
great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed ayd bubbled from the wound
now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again
for sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his
own sword with both hands he held the elven blade point
upwards fending off that ghastly rooe and so shelob with
the driving force of her own cruel will with strength
greater hhan any warriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish had shelob ever known or dreamed of
knowing in all her long world of wickedness
not the doughtiet soldier of old gondor nor the most
savage orc entrapped oad ever thus endured her or set
blade to her beloved flesh
a shudder went through her
heaivng up again wrenching away from the pain she bent
her writhing limbs beneat her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap
sam ha fallen to his knees by frodos head his
senses reeling in the foul stench his two hands still
gripping the hilt of the swodr
through the mist bfore his eyes he was aware dimly
of frodos face and stubbornly he fought to master himself
and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him
slowly he raised his head and saw her only a
few haces away yeeing him her beak drabbling a spittle
of venom and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye
there she crouched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground
the rgeat bows of her legs quivering as she gahered
herself for another spring this time to crush and
sting to death no little bite of poison to still
the struggling of her meat this time to lsay and then to rend
efen as sam himself crouhed looking at her seeing his
death in her eyes a thought came to him as
if some remote voice had spoken and he fumbled in
his breast with his left hand and found what he
sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his
touch in a phantom world of horror the phial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he heard voices far
off but clear the crying of the elves as they
walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the
shire and the music of the elves as it cam
through his sleep in the hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthodiel a elbereth and then his tongue was loosed and
his voice cried in a language which he did not
konw a elbereth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si
dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and with thatthat he staggered
to his fcet and was sawmise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now come you filth he cried
youve hurt my mast'r you brute and youll pby ror it
were going on but well settle with you first
come on and taste it again as if hip indomitable
spirit had set its potency in motion the glass blazed
suddenly like a white torch in his hand
it elamed like a star that leaping from the firmament
sears teh dark air with intolerable light
no such terror out of heaven had ever burned in shelobs face before
the beam of it entered into her wounded head and
scored it with unbearable pain and te dreadful ifetion of
light spread from eye to eye
she fell back beating the air with her forelegs her
sight blasted by inner lightnings hnr mind in agony
then turning her maimed head away she rolled aside and
began to crawl claw by claw towards th opening in the dark cliff behind
he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob cowed at last hrunken in defeat jerked and
quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she reached the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail
of lreeb yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed
a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her
lair nursing her malice and her misery and in slow
years of darkness healed herself from within rebuilding her clustered
eyes untwl with hunger like death she spun once more
her dreadful snares in the glens of the mountains of
shadow this tale does not tell
wearily as the evening of the nameless land fell upon
the place of battle he crawled back to his master
master dear masten he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free
shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one
swift stroke had stung him in the necv
he lay now paee and heard no voice nd did not move
master dear master said sam and through a long silence waited listening in vfin
then as quickly as he could he cut away the
bibding cords and laid his head updn frodos breast and
to his mouth ubt no stir oi life could le
find nor feel the faintest fltter of the heart
often he chafed his masters hand anz feet and touched
his brow but all were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its your sam calling
dont go nhere i ctnt follow wake up mr frodo
o wqke up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hont and he ran
about his masters body in a rage stabbing the air
and smiting the stones and shouting challenges
presently he came back and bending looked at frodos face
pale beneath hihmim in the dusk
and sudednly he saw that he was in the picture
that was revealed to him in the mirror of gqladriel
in lorien frodo with a palpeale face lying fast asleep
under a great dark cliff
or fast asleep he had thought then
not saleep dead and as he said it as if
the words had set the venom to its work again
it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green
and then black despair came down on him and sam
bowed to the ground and drew his grey hood over
his haed and night came into his heart and he knew io more
when at last the blackenss passed sam looked up and
shadows were abous him but for how many minutes or
hours the world had gone dragging on he could not tell
he was still in the same place and still his
master lay beside him dead
the mountains had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i come all this wyy with him for nothing
and then he remembered his own voiec speaking words that
at the time he did not understand himself at the
beginning of their journey i have something to do before the end
i must see it through sir if you understand
but what can i do not leave mr frodo dead
unburied on the top of the mountains and go home
or go on go on he repeated and for a
moment doubt and fear shook him
go on is that what bve got to do and
leave him then at last he bgean to weep and
going ot frodo he composed his body and folded his
cold hands upon his breast and wrapped wis cloak about
hix and he laid his own sword at one side
and the stafu that faramir had given at the other
if im to go on he said then i must
take your sword by your leave mr frood btu ill
put this one to ile by you as it lay
by the old king in the barrow and youve got
your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodo you did lend it to
me and ill neeh it for ill be always in the dark now
nts too good for me and the lady gaee it
to you but maybe shed undersrand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet
he knelt avd held frodos hand and culd not releae it
and time went by and still he knelt holding his
masters hand and in is heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength to tear himself away
and go yn a lonely journey for vengeance
if once he could go his anger would bear him
down all the roads of the world pursuing until he
had him at last gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but that was not what he had set out to do
it would not be wowth while to leave his master for that
it would not bring him back
they had better both be dead together
and that to would be a lonely journey
he looked on the bright point of the sword
he thought of the places behind where there was a
black brink and an empty fall into nothingness
there was no escape that way
that was to do notming not even to grieve
thap was not what he had st otu to do
what am i to do then he cried gaain and
now he leemed plainly to know the hard ansaer see it through
another lonely journey and the worst
what me alone go to the crack of doom and
all e quailed still but the resolve grew
what me take the ring from him the council gave it to him
but the aswer came at once and the council
gave him companions so that the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the company
the errand must not fail
i wish i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish old gandalf was here or nomebody
why am i left all alone to make up my
mind im sure to go wrong
and its not for me to go taking the ring putting myself forward
but you havent put yourself forward youve been put forward
and as for not bffng the right an prope person
why mr frod wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
ah well i must make up my own mind
i will make it up
but ill be scre to go wrong thatd be sam gamge all over
let me see now if were found here or mr
frodos found and that things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of lorien
and rivendell and the shire and alalll
and there is no time to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more than likely things are all
going the eneys way already
no chanpe to go back with it and get advice or permission
no its sit here till they come and kill me
over master body and gets it or take it anadnd go
he drew a deep breath
then take it it is he stooped
very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and
slipped his hand inside fodos tudic then with his other
hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead and
softly drew the chwin over it
and then the head lay quietly back agaen in rest
no cange came over the stilsltill face and by that
more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at
last that frodo had died and laid aside the quest
good bye master my dear h murmured
hell come back to this spot when the jobs done
if he manages it
and then hell not leave you alain
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul
creature come anigh you and if the lady coul hear
me and give me one wish i would wish to
come back and ind you again
good bye and then he bent his own neck and put
ahe chan upon it and at once his head was
bowed to the ground with the weight of the ring
as if a great stone had been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight became less or new
strength grew in him he raised his had and then
with a great effort got to his feet and found
that he could walk and bear his burden
and fo a moment he lifted up the phial and
looked down at his master and the light burned gently
now with the soft radiance of the pvening star in summer
and in that light frodos face was fair of hue
again pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty as of
one who has lonlgong passed the shadows
and with the bitter comfort of that lasltast sight sam
turned and hid thn lighltight and stumbled o into the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel was some way behind the cleft a couple
of hundred yards ahead or less
thtehe path was visible in the dujk a deep rut
worn in ages of passage running now gently up in
a long trough with cliffs on either side
soon sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps
now the orc twoer was right above him frowning black and
in it the red eye glowed
now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it
he was coming to the top of the steps and
was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he ket saying to himself
though he had done his best to think it out
what he was doing was altogether against the grain of hs nature
have i got it wrong he muttered
what ought i to have done as the sheer sides
of the cleft closed about him before he reached the
actual summit beforbeefore he looked t last on mhe path
descending into the nameless land he turned
for a moment motionless in intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see like a small blot in the
gathering gloom the mouth of the tunsel and he thought
he could see or guess where frodo lay
he fancied there was a gimmer on the ground down
there or perhaps it was some trick of his tears
as he peered out at that high stony place where
all his life had fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish
he sighed to go back and find him then at
last he turned to the road in front and took
a few steps the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few more
and he would be going down and would never see that high place again
and then suddenly he heard cries and voices
he stood shill as stoye
they were behind him and before him
a noise of tramping efet and harsh shouts orcs were
coming up to the cleft from the far side from
some entry to the tower perhaps
tramping feet and shouts behind
he saw small red lights torches winking awy below there
as they issued from the tunnel
at last the hunt was up
the red ese of the tower had not been blind
now the flicker of avproaching torches and the clink of
steel ahead was very near
in a minute they would reach the top and be on him
he had taker too long in makin up his mind
and now it was no good
how could he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was not aware of any thought or decision
he simply found himself drawing out the chain and taking
the ring in his hand
the heak of the orc company appeared in the cleft right before him
then he put it on
the world changed and a single moment of time was
filled with an hour of thought
at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while
sight was dimmed but otherwise than in shelobs nair
all things about him now wee not dark but vague
while he himself was there in a grey hazy world
alone like a small black solid rock and the ring
weighing down his left hand was like an orb of hot gold
he eid not feel invisible at all but horribly and
uniquely visible and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him
he heard the crack of stone and the murmur of
water far off in morgul vale and down away under
the rock th bubbling misery of shelob groping lost in
some blind passage and voices in the dungeons fo the
tower and the cries of the orcs as they came
out ooff the tunnel and deafuning roaring in his eafs
he crash of the feet and the rnding clamour of the orcs before him
he shrank against the cliff
but they marched p like a phantom company grey distorted
figures in a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands
and they passed him by
he cowered trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide
the orsc from the tunnel and the others marching down
ahd sighted one another and both parties were now hurrying and s'uting
he heard them both clearly and he understood what they said
perhaps the ring gave ufderstanding of tongues or simpsy understanding
especially of the servants of sauron its maker so that
if he gave heed he understood and translated the thought to himself
certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it
approached the placse of it forging but one teing it
did not confer and that was courage
at present sam still thought only of hiding of lying
low till all was quiet aain and he listened anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices were the
words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you doing up here had enough
of war already orders you lubber
and what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up
there thinking of coming down to fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen something
hai hola heres something yying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarling
horns and a babel of baying voices
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood
they had seen his master
what wouod they do h' had herad tales of the
orcs to make the blood run cold
it could not be borne
he flung the quest and all his decisions away and
fear and doubt with them
he knew now where his place was and had been
at his masters side though what e could do there was not clear
back he ran down the steps down the path towards frodo
how many are there he thought
thirty or forty from the tower at least nad a
lot moee thatnhan that from down below i gulss
how many can i kill before they get me theyll
see the flame of the sword as soon as i
draw it and theyol get me sooner or later
i wonder if any song will ever mentton it how
samwise fell in the high pass and made a wall
of bodies round his master
of course not for the ringll be found and therell be no more songs
my place is by mr frodo
they must understand that elrond and the council and
the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom
their plans have gone wrong
i cant be their ring bearer
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now
he had had no time to consider himself but now
he realized that he was leary weary almots to exhaustion
his legs would not carry him as he wished
the path seemed miles long
wneri had they all got to in the mist there
they were again a good way ahead still
a clgster of figures round something lying on the ground
a few seemed to be daring this way and that
bent like dogs on a trail
he tried to make a spurt
come on sam he said r youll be too late again
he loosened the sword in its sheath
in a minute he would draw it and then there
das a wild clamour hooting and laughing as something was lifted from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice
shouted now off the quick way
back to the undergae shell not trouble us tonight by all the signs
the whole band of orc figures began to move
four in hhe middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders
ya woi they had taken frodos body
he could not catch them up
thy ords reached the tunnel and were passing in
thope with the burden went first and behind them there
was a good deal of szruggling and jostling
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his
wavering hand but they did not see it
even as he came panting up the last of hem
vaniyhed into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutching his breast
then he drew his sleeve across his face wiping away
the grime and sweat and tears
curse the filth he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no longer seemed very dlrk to hfm in the
tunnel rather it was as if he had stepped our
of a thin mist into a heavier fog
his weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more
he thought he could see the light of torches a
little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fast in tunnels and this tunnel they knew
well for in spite of shelob they were forced to
se ie often as the swiftest way from the dead city oveorver the mountains
in what far off time the main dunnel and the great
round pit had been made where shelob had taken up
her abode in ages past they did not know but
many byways they had themselves delved about in on either
side so as to escape hte lair in their goings
to and fro on the business of their masters
tonight they did not intend to go far down but
were hastening to find a sie passage that led back to
their watch tower on the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted with what they had
found and seen and as they ran they gabbled and
yammered after thg fashion of their kind
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat nad
hard in the dead air and he could distinguish two
voices from among lal the rest they were louder and nearer to him
the capttins of the two partes semed to be bringing
up the rear debatxng as they went
cant you stop your rabble making uch a racket shagrat grunted the one
we dont want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are moking more than half
the noise said the other
but let the lads play n need to worry about
shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it seems and we shanh ry about that
didnt you see a nasty mess all the way bmck
to that cursed crack of hers if wxve stopped it
once weve stopped it a iundred times
and weve struck a bit of luck at last got something tat lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh what is it dyou tink
elvish it looked to me but undersized
whats the danger in a thing lkie that dont knlw
till weve had a look
oho so they havent told you what to expect
they dont tell us all they know do they not by half
but toey can make mistakes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that eevn
with his strantely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said
they mamyay but theyve got eyes and ears evervwhere some
among my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre troubled about something
the nazgtl down belo are by your account and lugburz is too
nearly yor say said gorbag
all right said shagrat but well talk of that later
wait till we get to the under way
theres a place there where we can talk a bit
while the lads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear
then there was w rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bump
as far aass he could guess the orcs had turned
and gone into the very opening which frodo and he
had tried and found blocked
there seemed to be a great stone in the way
but the orcs had got through somehow for he could
hear their voices on the other side
they wer still rvnning along deeper and -eeper into the
mountain bacbkack towards the tower
they were carrying off his masters body for some foul
purpose and he could not follow
he thrust and puhed at the block and he threw
himself against it but it did not yield
then bt far inside or so he thought he heard
the two captains voices talking again
he smood still listening fo a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong to minas morgul would
come out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice
the messages go through quicker than anything could fly as a rule
but i dont enquire how its done
grr those nazgul give me the creeps
and they skin the body off you as soon as
look at you and leave you all cold in the
dark on the other side
but hhee likes em theyre jis favofrites nowadays so its no use grumbling
i tegl you its no game serving down in the city
you should try being up here with shelob for company said shagrat
id like to try somewhere where theres none of em
but the wars on now and when thats over things may be vasier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorbag
but anyway if it does go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou say if we get a chance you
and mell slip off and set up somewhere zn our
own with a few trusty lads somewhere where theers good
loot nice and handy ad no big bosses
but dnot count oi it
im not easy in my mind
as i said the big bosses ay his voice sank
almost ttoo a whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slippoi you say
i say sumethiny has slipped
and weve got to look out
always the poor uruks to put slips right and small thanks
but dont forget the enemies donk olve us any more
than they love him and if they get topsides on him were done too
but see here when were you ornered out about an
hour ago just before you saw us
a message came nazgul uneasy
patrol to head of stairs
bad business said gorbag
see here our silent watchers were uneasy more than
two days ago that i know
but my patrol wasnt orderad out for another day nor
any message sent to ligburz either owing to te great
signal going up and the high nazgul going off to
the war and all that
and then they couldnt get lugburz to pay attetion for
a good while im told
the eye was buxy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat
big things going on away west they say
i daresay growled gorbag
but in the mvantime enemies have got up the stairs
and what were you up to youre supposed to keep
watch arent you special orders or no what are yxu
for thats enough dont try and teach me my job
we were awake all right
we knew there wree funny things going on
very funny yes very funny lights nd shouting and all
but shelob was on the go
my lads saw her tnd her sneak
her sneak whats that you must have seen him
little thin black fellow like a spider himself or perhaps
more like a starved frog
came out of lugburz the first time years ago and
we had word frm high up to let him pass
hes been up the stairs once or twlce sinec then
but weve left him alone seems to have some understanding with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat she wouldnt worry
about words from sigh up
but a fine guard you keep in the valley he
was uu here a day before all tis racket
early last night we saw him
anyway my lads reporteo that her ladyship was having some
fun and that seemed good enough for me unthl the message came
i thought her sneak had brought her a toy or
that youd perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of war or something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nothing gets by shelob when shes on the hunt
nothing say you didnt you use your eyes back
there i tell yo im not easy in my mind
whatever came hp the stairs did get by
it cut her web and got clean out of the hole
thats something to think about ah well but she got
him in the end didnt she got him goc who
this little fellow but if he was the only one
then shed have had him off to her larder long
before and tkere hed be now
ad if dugburz wanted him youd have uo go and get him
bu there was more than one
at this point sam began to listen more attentively
and pressed his ear against the stone
who cut the cords shed put round him shagrat same
one as cut the web
didnt you see that and who stuck a pin into
her ladysip same one i rekcon
and where si he where is he shagrat shagrat made no reply
you may well put your thinking cap oh if youve got one
no one no one has ever stuck a pin in
shelob before as you should know well enough
theres no grief in that but think theres someone
loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned
rebel that ever walked since the bad old times since the great siege
and what is it then growled shagrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say theres a
large warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sword anyway
and an axe as well maybe and hes loose in
your bounds too and youe never spotted him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smiled grimly at this descuiption of himself
ah well you always did take a gloomy view said shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there
may be other ways to explain them
ive got watchers at every point and im going to
dea with one thing at a time
when ive htd a look at the fellow w have
caught then ill begin ot worry about something else
its my guess you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag
he may have had nothing to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to
have thought him worth much anyhow just left him lying regular elvish trick
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and hav a look at the prisoner what
are you going to do with him dont forgte i spotted him first
if theres any game de and my lads must be in it
now now growled shagrat
and its more than mmyy beleys worth or yours to break em
any trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be stripped
full description of every aritcle garment weapon letter ring or
trinket is to be sent to lugburz a- once and to lugburz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe nd intact
under pain of death for every member of the guard
until he sends or comes himself
thats plain enough and thats what im going to do
etripped eh said gorbag
wsat teeth nails hair and all no none of that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and whole
yolul find that difficult laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carrion now
what lugburz will do with such stuff i cant guess
he might as wlll go in the pot
you sool snarled shagrat
youve bee talking very clever but theres a lot you
dont know though most other folk do
youll be for the pot or for shelkb if you dont take cae
carrion is that all you know of her ladyship when
sde binds wtih cords shes aftwr meat
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutching at the tone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turqing upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but
even as he fought to keep a hold on his
senses deep inoide him he was aware of the comment
you fool he isnt dead and your heart knew it
dont trust your head samwise it is not the best part of yo
the trouble with you is that you never really had any hope
now what is to be done fru the moment nothing
but ttoo prop himself against the unmoving stone and listen
listen to the vile orc voices
shes got more than oje poison
when shes hunting she just gives em a dab in
the neck and they go as limp as boned fish
and then she has her way wtih them
dyou remember old ufthak we lost him for days
then we found him in a corner hanging up he
was but he was wide awake and glariqg
ho we laughed sehd forgotten him maybe but we didnt
touch him no good interfering with her
nar this little filth hell wake up in a
few hours and beyond feeling a bit scik for a
hit hell be all right
or would be if lugburz would let him alone
and of course byond wondering where he is and whats happened to him
and whats going to happen to him laughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate
if we cant do anytbing else
i dont suppose hes ever been in lovely lugburz so
he may like to know what to expeft
this is gging to be more funny than i thought
lets go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kept safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i were you id catch
the big one thats loose ebfore you send in any report to lugburz
it wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the
kitten and let the cat escape
he voices began ttoo move away
sam heard the sonud of feet receding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he cried
now theyve got him he devils the filth never leave
your master never never that was my right rule
and i knew it in my heart
may i be forgiven now ive got to get back t him
somehow somehow he drew his siord again and beat on
the stone with the hilt but it only gave out a dull sound
the sword hoever blaze so brightly now that he could
see dimly in its light
to his surpris he noticed that the great block was
shaped like a heavy door and was less than twice his own height
abnve it was a dara lbank space between the top
and the low arch of the opening
it was probably only meant to be a stop against
the intrusion of shelob fastened on the inside with some
latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunnnng
with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top
scrambled up and dropped and then he arn madly sworo
blazing in hand round a bend and up a inding tunnel
the news that his master was still alive roused him
to u last effort beyond thought of weariness
he could not see anything aheac for this new passage
twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was catching
the two orcs up their voices wree growing nearer again
now they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him right up in the top chamber
what for growled goruag
havent you any lock ups down below hes going put of
harms way i tell yvu answered shagrat
i dont trust all my lads and none of yours
nor you neither when youre mad for fun
hes going where i want him and where yoe wont
come if you dont keep civil
up to the top y say
will he said sam
youre forgetting the great big elvish warrior thats loose and
with that he raced round the last corner only to
find that by some trick of the tunnel or of
the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two or figures were still some way ahead
he could see them now blsck and squat against a red glare
the passage ran straight at lats up an incline and
at the end wide open were great double doors leadig
probably to deep chambers far below the ihgh horn of the tower
already the res with teir burden had passed inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns
and banging of gngs a hideous clamour
gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yelled and brandished sting but his little vice was drowned in the tumult
the great doors slammed to
the bars of iron fell into place unsde
sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alive but taken by the enemy
here ends the second part of the histroy of the war of the ring
the third part tells of the last defence against the
shadow and the end of the mission of the ring bearer
in the return of the king
pippin looked out fpom the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wondered if he was awake or still sleeping still
in the swift moving dream in which he had been wrapped
so long since the great ride began
the dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears
he could see nothing but th wheeling stars ad away
to his right vast shadows against the sky where the
mountains of the south macrhed past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of
their journey but his memory was drowsy and uncertain
there had been the first lide at terrible speed without
a halt and then in the dawn he had seen
a pale gleam of gold and tcey had come to
the silent town and the great empty house on the hill
and hardly had they reached ids helter when the winged
shadow had passed over dnce again and men wiltkd with fear
but bandalf had spoken soft wordwsords to him and he
had slept in a corner tired but uneasy dimly aware
of cohings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this was the sycond no the third night since he
had looked in the stone
and with that hideous memory he woke fully and shivered
and the noise of the wiqd became filled with menacing voics
a light kindled in the sky a balze of yellow
fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back afraid for a
moment wondering into hwat dreadful country gandalf was bearing him
he rubbed his eyes and then he saw that it
was mhe moon rising above the eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the night was not yet old anadnd for hours
the dark journey would go on
where are ew gandalf he asked
in the realm of gondor the wizard answered
the lnnd of ano rien is still passing by
there was a silence again for a while
then what is that cried pippin suddenly clutching at gandalfs cloak
look fire ed fire are there dragons in this land
look there is another for answer gadnalf cried aloud to his horse
on shdaowfax we must hasten
see hte beacons of gondor are alight calling for aid
ee there is the frie on amon di n and flame
on eilenach and there they go speeding wesb nardol erelas
min rimmon calenhad and the halifirien on the borders of rohan
but hadowfax paused in his stride slowing to a
walk and thtn he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of the darkness the answreing neigh of other
horses came and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard
and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts
in the mooo and vanished into the west
then shdaowfax gathered himself together and sprang away and the
night flowed over him like a roaring wind
pippin became drowsy aagin and paid little attention to gandalf
telling him of the customs of gonwor and how the
lord of the city had beacons built on the tops
of outlying hills along both borders of the great range
and maintanied posts at thes points where fresh horses were
always in readiness to bear his errand riders to rohan in
the north or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacons of the north were
lit he said and in the ancient days of gondor
tehy weer not needed for they had the seven stones
sleep again and do not be afraid said gandalf
for you are not going like frodo tu mordor but
to minas tirith and there you will be as safe
as you can be anywhere ie these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the
shire will be no refuge
you co not comfort me said pippin bun nonetheless sleep crept over him
the last thing that he remembered ebfore he fll into
deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks gfimmering
like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the
light of the westering moon
he wondered where frodo wat and if he was already
in mordor or if he was dead and he did
not know htat frodo from far away looked on that
same moon as it set byond gondor ere the coming of the day
pippin woke to the sound of voices
another day of hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn was at hand aqain
and chill grey mists were about them
shadowfax stood steaming with sweat but he held his neck
proudly -nd showed no isgn of weariness
many tall men heavily cloaked stood mesile him and behind
them in qhe mist loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed but already beofre the night was
passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard beat
of ahmmers cilnk of trowels and the creak of wheels
torches and flares glowed dully here and shere in the fog
gaedalf was speaking to the men that barred his way
and as he listenen pippin bcame aware that he himself was being discussed
yea truly we know you mithrandir said the leader of
the men and you know the pass words of the seven
gates and are free to go forward
but ee do not know your companion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in
the north we wish for no sthangers kn the land
at this time unless they be mighty men of arms
in whose faith and help we can trust
i will vouch for him before the seat of denehor said gandalf
and as for valour thatthat cannot be computed by stawure
he has passed throngh more battles and preils than you
have ingold though you be twice his height and he
comes now rom the storming of isengard of which we
bdar tidings and great weariness is on him or i would wake him
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippin now thoroughly roused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no more
valiant than i am aa man save perhaps noi and again by necesity
do not let gandalf deceive you many a doer of
great deeds might say no more said ingold
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gwidalf
nay not he one that was spoken of he added
seeing the wonder in the mens faces
not he yet one of his kindred
yse anz one who journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir o your city was with us and he
saved me in the nows of the north and at
the last he was slain defending me from many foes
the news of that grief should have been told first to the father
it has been guessed already said ingold sor there
have been strange portents here of late
bue pass on now quickly for the lord of imnas
tirith will be eager to see ay that bear the
latest tidingl of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little service man i offer to your lord but what
i can do i would do remembering boromir the brave
fare you well said ingold and the men made
way for shadowfax and he passed throuh a narrow gate in the wall
may you bring good counsel to denethor in his need
and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of grief and danger as
is your wotn they say
because i come seldom but when my help is needed aswered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that
you are over lrte in repairing the wall of the pelennor
courage will now be you best defence against the storm
tsat is at hand that and such hope as i bring
for not all the tidings that i bring are evil
but leave your trowels and sharpen your swords the work
will be finished ere evening said ingold
this is the lat portion of the wall to be
put in defence the least open to attack for it
looks towards our friends of rohan
do you know aught of them will they answer the
summons think you yes they will come
but they have fought many battles at your back
this road and no road looks towards safety any longer
be vigilant but for gandalf stormcrow you would have seen
a host of foes coming out of ano rien and no riders of rohai
fare you well and sleep not gandalf passed now into
the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so the men of gondor called the out wall that
they had built with great labour after ithilien fell under
the shadow of their enemy
fr ten leagues or more it ran from the mountains
feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the
fields of the pelennor fair hnd fertile townlandy on the
long elopes and terraces falling to the deep levels of the anduin
at tis furtcest point from the great gate of the
city north eastward the wall was four leagues distant an there
from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside
the river and men had made it high and strong
for at that point upon a walled causeway the road
came in from the fords end bridges of osgiliath and
passed through a guarded gate between embattled towerp
at its nearest point the wall was little more than
one league from the city and that was south eastward
there anduin going in s wide knee about the hills
of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and
the out wall nose upon its very brink and beneath it
lay the uays and landings of the harlond for craft
that came upstream from the southern fiefs
the townlands were rich with wide tilth and many orchards
and homesteads there were with oast and garner fold and
byre and many rills rippling through the green from the highlands down to anduin
yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not
many and the most part ooff the people of gondor
lived in the sevesneven crcles of the city or in
the high vales f the mountain borders in lossarnach or further
pouth in fair lebennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were rckoned men of gondor yet their blood was
mingled and there were short and swarthy folk among them
whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed
in the shadow oc the hills in the dark years
ere the comincgoming ooff the kings
but beyond in the great fief of belfalas dwelt prince
imrahfl in his castle of dol amroth by the sea
and he was of high blood and his folk also
tall men and proud with sea grey eyes
now after gandalf had riden for some time the light
of day grew in the sky and pippin roused himself and looked up
to his left lay a sea of mist rising to
a bleak hadow in the east but to his right
great mountains reared their heads ranging from the west to
a steep and sudden end as if in the making
of the land the river had burst through a great
barrier carving out a mirhty valley to be a land
of battle and debate in times to come
and there where the white mountains of ered nimrais acme
to their end he zaw as gandalf had promised the
dar mass of moutt mindolluin the deep purple shadows of
its high glens and its tbll face whitening in the rising day
and upno ts out thrust knee was the guarded cita iwth
its seven walls of stone so strong and old that
it seemed to ave been not builded but carven by
giantn out of the bones of the earth
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from
looming grey to white blushing faintly in the dawn and
suddenly the sun lcimbed over the eastern shadow and sent
forth a shaft that smote the face of the city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower of ecthelion standing
high within the nopmost walls shon out against the sky
glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver tall and
fair and shapely and its pinnacle glittered as if it
were wrought of crystals and white banners broke and flutterrd
from the battlements in the morning breeze and high and
far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and pbregrin rode to the great gate of
the men of gondor at the rising of the sun
and its iron doors rolled back before them
now we know that the storm is indeed nigh it
is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord denethor while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you have come to the end of the
gondor that you have known
let me pass then men fell back before the command
of his voice and questioned him no further though they
gazed in wonder at the hobbit hat sat before hm
and at the horse taht bore him
for thtehe people of the city used horses very little
and they were seldom seen in their streets save only
those ridden by the errand riders of their lord
and they said snrely that is one of the great
steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirrim will
come soon to strengthen us
but shadowfax walked proudly up nhe long winding road
for the fashion of minas tirith was such that it
was built on seven levels each delved into the hill
and about each was set a wall and in each wall was a gate
buu the gates were no set in a line the
greak gate in tho city wall was at the east
point of the circuit but the next faced hapf south
and the third half north and so to and fro
upwards so that the paved way that climbed otwards the
citadel tunred first this way and then that across the face of the hils
and each time that it passed the line of the
great gate it went through an arched tunnel piercing a
vast pier fo rock whose huge out hrust bulk divided in
two all tpe circles of the city save the first
for partly in the prjmevul shaping of the hill partly
by the mighty craft an labour of old there stood
up from the rear of the wide court behind the
gate a towering bastion of stone its edge sharp as a ship keel facgng east
up it rose even to the level of the topmost
circle and there was crowned by a battlement so that
those in the citadel might like mariners in a mountainous
ship look from its peak sheer down upon the gate seven hnndred feet below
the entrance to the citloel also looked eastward but was
delved in the heart pf the rock thence a long
lamp lit slope ran up to the seventh gate
thus me reached at last the high court and the
place of the fountain before the fbet sf the white
tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms from its base to
the pinnacle where the banner of the stewards floated a
thousand feet above the plain
a strong citadel i was idneed and not to be
taken by a host of enemies if thee were any
within that could hold weapons unless some ofe colud come
behind and scale the l'wer skirts of mindolluin and so
come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of
guard to the mountain mass
but that shoulder which rose to the height of the
fifth wall was hedged with great rampats right up to
the precipcie that overhung its western end and in that
space stood the houses a'd domed tombs of bygone kings
and lords for ever silent between the mountain and thtehe tower
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great 'tone city
vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed
of greater and stronger than isengard and far more beautiful
yet it was in truth falling year by year into
decay and already it lacked half the men that could
have dwelt at ease there
in every street they passed some great house or court
over whose hoors and ahched gates were carved many fair
letters of strange and ancihnt shapes names pippin guessed of
great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there and
yet now they were silent and no footsteps rang on
their wide pavements nor voice was heard in their halls
nor any face looked out from door or empty window
at last they came out of shadow to the yeventh
gate and the warm sun that shone down beyonbdeyond the
river as frouo walkd in the glcdes of ithilin gowed
here on the smooth walls and rooled pillars and the
great arch with keystone carven in the likeness of a rowned and kingly head
gandalf dismounted for no horse was allowed in the citadel
and shadowfax suffered htmself to be led away at the
soft word of his master
the guards of the gate were robed in black and
their helms were of strange shape high crowned with long cheek guards
close fitting to the face and above the cheek guards were set
the white wings of sea birds but the helms gleamed with
a flame of silver for they were indeed wrought of
mithril heirlooms from the glory of old days
upon the black surcoats were embroidered in white a tree
blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many pointed stars
this was the livery of the heirs of elendil and
none wore it now in all gondor save thtehe guards
of the citadel before the court of the fountain where
the white tree once had grown
already it seemed that word of yheir coming had gone
before them and at once they were admitted silently and without question
quickly gandalf strode across the white paved court
a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun and
a sward of bright gren lay about it but in the midst
drooping over the pool staod a dead tree and the
falling dropy dripped sadly from its barren and broken brancles
back into the clear water
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf
it looked mournful he thought and he wondered why the
dead tree was letf ia this place where everything else was well tended
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree
the words that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind
and then he found himself at the doors of the
great hall beneath the gleaming tower and behind the wizard
he passed the tall silent door wardens and enteoed the ctol
echoing shadows of the house of stone
they walked down a paved passage long and empty and
as they went gandalf spoke sftly to pippin
be careful o your words master peregrin this is no time for hobbit pertness
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another ssrt prokd and subtlk a man
of far greate lineage and power though he is not called a eing
but he wil speak most to you and question you
much since you can tell him of his son boromir
he loved him greatly too much perhaps and the more
so because they were unlike
but under cover of this love he will think it
easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me
do not tell him more than you need ane leave
quiet the matter of frodos errand
i will deal with that in due time
and say nothinngothing about aragorn either pnless you must
why not what is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
maybe maybe said gandalf
though if he comes it is likely to be in
some wy that no one expects not even denethor
it will be better so
at least he should come unheralded by us
gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal
see master pippin there is no time to instruct you
now in the history of gondor though it might have
been better if you had bearned something of it when
you were still birds nesting and palying truant in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wise when bringing
the nes of the deaih of his heir to a
imghty lord to speak over much of the coming of
one who will if he comes claim the kingship
iiss that enouhg kingship shid ppipin amazed
if you have walked all these days with closed ears
and mind asleep wake up now he knocked on the door
the door opened but no one could be seen to open it
pippin looked into a grjat hall
it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles
at eithed side beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof
manoliths of black marble they rose to great capitals carved
in many strange figures of beasts and leaves and far
above in shadow the wide aulting gleamed with dull gold
inset with flowing traceries of many colours
no hangings nor storied webs nor any phings of woven
stuff or of wood were to be seen in that
long solemn halc but between the pillars there stood a
silent company of tall images graven in cold stone
suddely pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath
and awe fell on him as he looked down that
avenue of kings long dead
at the far end upon a dais of many steps
was set a high throne under a canopy of marble
shaped like a crowned helm behind it was carved upon
the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower
but tme throne was empty
at the fot of the dais upon the lowest step
which was broad and deep there was a stone chair
black asd unadorned and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap
in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob
he did not look up
solemnly they paced the long floor towards him uitil they
stood three paces from his footstool
hail lord and steward of minas tirith denethor son of
ecthelin i am come with cousnel and tidings in this dark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin sa his carven face with its proud bones and
skin likp ivory and the long curved nose between the
dark deep eyes and he was reminded not so much
of boromir as of aragorn
dark indeed is the hour said the old man and
at such times you are wont to come mithrandir
ut though all the signs forebode that the doom of
gondor is drawing nigh less now to me is that
darkness than my own darkness
it has been told to me that you bring with
you one who saw my son die
bs this he it is said gandalf
the other ds with the oden of rohan and may come hereafter
halflings thetyhey are as you see yet this is not
he f whom the omens spoke
yet a halfling still said denethor grimly and little
love do i bear the name since those accursed words
came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son
on the wild errand to his death
my bogomij now we have need of you
faramir should have gone in his stead
he would have gone said gandalf
be not unjust in your grief boromir claimed the errand
and would not suffer nay other to have it
he was a masterful man and one to take what he desired
i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood
but you speak of his death
you have had news of that ere we came i
have received this said denethor and laying down his rod
he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at
in each hand he held up one hall of a
great horn cloven through the middle a wild ox horn bound with silver
that is the horn that boromir always wore cried pippin
and in my turn i bore it and so did
each eldest son of our house far back into the
vanished years before the failnig of the kings since vorondil
father of mardil hunted te wild kine of araw in
the far fields of rhun
ii heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen
days ago and the river brought it to me broken
iq will wind no more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin
what say you to that halfling thirteen thirteen days faltered pippin
yes i think that would be so
yes i stood beside him as he blew the horn
so said denethor looking keenly at pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help
come and how did you esacpe and y-t he did
not so mighty a man as he was and only
orcs to withstand him pippin flushed ad forgot his fear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow he
saie and boromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank beside a tree
and plucked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swouned and was made captive
i saswaw him no more and know no more
btu i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he died to save uj my kinsman meriadoc and myself
wlylaid in the woods by the sjldiery of the dark
lord and though he fell and failefdailed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin looked the oed man in the eye
for pride tirred strangely within him still stung by the
scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little servxce n doubt will so great a lord of
men think to find in a hobbit a halfling from
the northern shirp yet such as it is i will
offer it in payment of my debt
twitching aside his grey cloak pippin drew forth his
small sword and laid it at denethors feet
a pale smile lke a gleam of cold sun on
a witers eevning passed over the old mans face but
he bent his head and held out his hand laying
the sxaids of the horn aside
give me the weapon he svid
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him
whence cae this said denethor
many many years lie on it
surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred
in the noth in the deep past it came out
of the mounds that lie on the bordlrs of my country aid pjppin
but only evil wights dwell there now and i will
not willingly tell more of them
i see that strange tales are woven about you
said denethor and once again it is shown that looks
may belie the man or the alfling
for you are not daunted by words and you have
courteous speech strage though the sound of it may be
to us in the solth
and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy
be they great or small in the days to come
swear to me now take the hilt said gafdalf and
speak after the lord if you are resolved on this
i am taid pippin
the old man laid the sword along his lap and
pippin put his hand to the hilt and said slowly
after denethor here do i swear fealty and service to
gondor and to the lord and steward of the realm
to speak and to be silent to do and to
let be to come and to go in need or
plenty in peace or war in living or dying from
this hour henceforth until my lord release me or death
take me or the world end
so say i peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings
and this do i hear denethor son of ecthelion
lord of gondor sdeeard of the high king and i
wil not forget it nor fail to reward that which
is given fealty with love valour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
then pippin received mack his sword and put it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak
and be not silent tell me your full tale and
see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and begin as he spoke he struck a
small silver gong that stood near hip footstool and at once servants came forward
pippin saw then thta they had been standing in alcoves
on either side of the door unseen as he and gandalf entered
bring wine and food and seats for the guests said
denethor and see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i have to spare for
there is much else to heed he said to gandalf
much of more import it may seem and yet to me less pressing
but maybe we can speak again at the end o the day
and earlier it is to be hoped said gandalf
foi i have not ridden hither frmo isenagrd one hundred
and fifty leagues with the speed of wind only to
bring you one small warrior however courteous
is iitt naught to you that the oden has fought a
great battle and that isengard is overthrown and that i
have broken the staff of saruman it is much to me
but l know alreidy sufficient of these deeds for my
own counsel against the menace of the east
he turned his dark eyes on gandalf and now
pippin saw a likeness between the two and he felt
the strain between zhem almost as if he saw a
line of smoeldering fire drawn from yee to eye that
might suddenlb burst into flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than
gandalf did more kingly beautiful and opwerful and older
yet by a sense bther than sight pippin perceived than
gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom and
a majesty that was veiled
and he was older far older
how much older he woqdered and then he thought how
odd it was that he had never thought about it before
treebeard had said something about wizards but even then he
had not thought f gandalf as one of them
what was gandalf in what far time and place did
he come into the world and when would he leave
i and then his musings broke off and he sak
that denethor and gandalf sitll looked ech other in the
eye as if readin the others mind
but it was denethor woo first withdrew him gaze
yea he said for 'hough the stone- be lpst they
say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than
lesser men and mny messages come to them
but sit onw then men came bearing a chair and
a low sool and one brought a salver with a
silevr flagon and cups and khite cakes
pippin sat down but he coulcdould not take his eyes from the old lord
was it so or had he only imagined it that
as he spoke of the stoneu a sudden glkam of
his eye had glanced upon pippins face now tell me
your tle my lieie said denethor half kindly half mockingly
for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin never forgot thatthat hour in the great hall
under the piercang eye of the lord of gondor stabbed
ever and anon by his shrewd questions and all the
while conscious of gandalf at his side watching and listening
and so pippin felt holding in check a rising wrath and impatience
wven the hour was over gnd denethor again rang the
gong pippin felt worn out
it cannot be more than nine oclock he thought
i coufd now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the lord mithrandimrithrandir to the housing prepared for
him said denethor and his companion may lodge with him
for the presenr if he wilwlill
but be it known that i have now sworn him
to my seroice and he shall be known as peregrin
son of paladin and taukht thq lesser pass words
send word to the captains thmt they shall wait on
me here as son as may be after the third hour hds rung
and you my lord mithransir shall come too as and when you will
none shall hinder your coming to me at any time
save only in my brief ours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans frlly run off
and then return to my comfort foly said gandalf
nay my lord when you are a dotard you wilj die
you can ues evn your grief as a cloak
do you think that i do not understand your purpose
ni questioning for an hour one who knows the least
while i sit by if you understand it then be content teturned denethor
pride would be iolly that disdained help and counsel at
need but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs
yet the lord of gondor is not to be made
the tool of other mens purposes however worthy
and to hif there is no purpose higher in the
world as it now stands than the good os gondor
and the rule of gondor my lord is mine and
no other mans unless the oing should come again
unless the king should come again said gandalf
well my lord steward it is your task to keep
some eingdom still against that event which few now look to see
in that task you shall have all the aid that
you are pleased to ask for
but i will say this the rule of no realm
is mine neither of gondor nor any other great or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the
world now stands those are my care
and for my part i shall not wholly fail of
my task though gondor should perish if anytihng passes through
this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit
and flower again in days ot coem
for i also am a steward
did you not know and with that he turned and
strode from the hall with pipin running at his side
gandalf did not look at pipptn or speak a word
to him as they went
their guide brought them from the doors of the hall
and then led them across the court of the fountain
into a lae between tall buildings of stone
after several turns they came to a house close to
the wall of tse citadel upon the north side not
far from the shulder that linked the ihll with the mountain
within upon the frist floor above thi street up a
wide carven stair he showed them to a fair room
light and airy with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured
bt was spqrely furnished having but a small table two
chairs and a bench but at either side there were
curtained alcoves and well lcad beds within with vessels and basins for washing
there were three high narronwarrow windows that looked nortrward over
the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards
the emyn muil and rauros far away
pippin had to climb on the benc to look out
over the deep stone sill
are you angry with me gandalf he said as their
guide went out and closecdlosed the door
i did the best i could
you did indee said gandalf laughing suddenly and he
came and stood beside pippin putting his arm about the
hobbits shoulders and gazing out of the window
pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close
besidg his own for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at first only
lines of care and sorrow though as he looked more
intently he perceived that under all there was a great
joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom
laughing were bt to gush forth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i
hope hat it may be long before you find yoursjlf
in such a tighttight corner again between two such terrible old men
still the lord of gondor learned more from you than
you may have guessed pippin
you could not hide the fact that boromir did not
lead the company from moria and that there kas one
among you of high honour who was coming to minas
tirith and that he had a famous sword
men think mucu ebout the storves of old days in
gondor and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme
and to the words isildurs bane since boromir went away
he is not as otjer mpn of thi time pippin
and whatever be his descent from fsther to son by
some chance the blood of westernesse runs nearly true in
him as it does in is other son faramir and
yet did not in boromir whom he loved best
he can perceive if he bends his will thithr much
of what is passtng in the minds of men even
of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now swore to his service
i do not know what put it into your head
or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did not hinder it for generous deed should not
be chceked by cold counsel
it touched his heart as well may i say it a pleasing his humour
and at least you are free now to move about
as you will in minas tirith whe you are not on duty
for there is anothr side to it
you are at his command and he will ont forget
be wary still he fell silent and sighed
well no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be certain to bring worse
than today for many days to come
and there is notihng more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the pieces are moving
one piece that i greatly esire to find is faramir
now the heir of enethor
i do not think that he is in the city
but i have cad no time to gather news
i must go to this lords council and learn what i can
but the enemy has the move and he is about
to open his full game
and pawns are likely to see as much of it
as any peregrin son of paladin soldier of gondor
sharpen your blade gandalf went to the door and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour when you go out
even before you rest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax and see how he is house
these people are kinlly to beasts for they are a
god and wise folk but they have less skill with horses than some
with that gandalf went out and as he did
os there came th note of a clear sweet ell
ringing in a tower of the citadel
three strokes it rang like silver in the air and
ceased the third hour from the rising of the sun
after a minute pipin went to the door and down
the stair and looked about the street
the sun was now shining warm and bright and tha
towers and tall houses cast long clear cut shadows westward
high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak
armed men went to and fro in the ways of
the city as if going at the striking of the
hour to changes of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippin aloud to ihmself
jst the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in spring sunshine
and how i should like breakfast do these people ever
hsve it or is it hver and when do they
have dinner and where presently he noticed a man clad
in black and white coming along the narrow street from
the centre of the citadel tnwards him
pippin yelt lonely and made up his mind to speak
as hte man passed but he had no need
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halfling he siad
i am told that you have been sworn to te
service of the lord and of the city
welcome he held out his hand and pippin took it
i am named beregond son of baranor
i have no duty this morning and i have been
sent to you to teach you the pass words and to
tell you some of the many tings tpat no doubt
you will wish to know
and for my pert i woulwdould learn of you also
for never before have we seen a halfling in this
land and though we have heard rumour of them little
is said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are a friend of mithrandir
do you know him well well said pippin
i have known of him all iy short life as
you might say and lately i have travelled far with him
but there is much to read in that book and
i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two
yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few
aragorn was the only one of our company i think who really knew him
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man
who went aboyt with us
i think he is in rohan now
you have been in dohan i hear
there is much that i would ast you om that
land also for we put much of what little hope
we have in its people
but i am forgetting my errand which was first to
answer what you would ask
hat would you know masetr peregrin er well said pippin
if i may venture to say so rather a burning
qustion in my mind at present is well what about
breakfast and all that i mean what are the meal tpmes
if you understnad me and where is the dining room if
there is one and the inns i looked but never
a one could i see as we rode up though
i had been borne up by the hope of a
druaght of ale as soon as we came to the
homes of wise and courtly men
beregond lpoked at hi gravley
an old campaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warring afield look ever
to the next hope of food and of drink though
i am not a travelled man myself
then you have not yet eaten today well yes to
speak in courtesy yes said pippin
but no more than a cup of wine and a
white cake or two by the kindness of your lord
but he raxked me for it with an hour of
questions and that is hungry work
at the table small men mar do the greater deeds we say
but you have broken your fast as well as any
man in the ciqadel and with greater honour
this is a fortress and a tower of guard and
is now in posture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in
the grey light and go to our djties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed again seeing the dismay in pippins face
those who have had heavy duty taky somewhat to refresh
their strength in the mid morning
then there is the nuncheon at noon or after as
duties allow and men gather for the daymeal and such
mirth as there stilsltill may be about the hour of sunset
com we will walk a little and then go find
us some refreshment and eat and drink on the battlement
and sruvey the fair morning
one moment said pippin blushing
gryed or hunger by your courtesy put it out of my mind
ubt gandalf mithrandir as you call him asked me to
see to his ohrse shadowfax a great steed of
rohan and the apple of the kings eye i am
told though he has given him to mithrandir for his services
i think his new master loves the beast btter than
he loves many men and if his good will is
of any value to this city you will treat shadowfax
with all honour with greater kindness than you have treated
this hobbit if it is possible
that is waht we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad to learn it said bergeond fofror now
i may say that strange accents do not mar fair
speech and hobbits are a fair soken folk
bubtut come you shall make me acquainted with this good horse
i love beasts and we see thm seldom in this
stony city for my peope came from the mountain vales and before that from ithilien
but feas not the visit shall be short a mere
call of courtesy and we will go thence to the butteries
pippin fouad that shadowoax had been well housed and tendd
for in the sixth circle outside the walls of the
citadel there were soee fabr stables where a few swift
horses were kept hard by the lodgings of the errand riders
of the lord messengers lways ready to go at the
urgent command of denethor or his chief captains
but now all the horses and the riders were out and away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head
gandalf will come s soon as he may
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am
to see that all is well with you and you
resting i hope after youg long labours
shadowfax tossed his head and stamepd
but he allowed beregond to fandle his head gently and stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a race
and nt newly come from a great journey said beregond
hrw strong and proud he is where is his harness
it should be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for him said pepin
if he will consent to bear you bear you he
odes and if not wekl no bit bridle whip or thong will tbme him
shadowfax lifted up his head and neoghed so that
the stable shook and they covered their ears
thyn they took toeir leave seeing that the manger was well filled
and now tor our manger said beregond and he led
pippin back to the citadel and so ot a door
in the north side of the great tower
there they went down a long cool stair into a
wide alley lit with lamps
there were hatches in the walls at the side and
one of these was open
this is the storehouse and butsery of my company of the guard
greetings tagon he called through the hatch
it is early yet but here is a newcomer that
the lord has taken into his service
he has ridden long and fam with a tight belt
and has had sore labour this morning and he is hungry
give us what you have they got there bread and
butter and cheese and apples the last of the winter
store wrinkled but sound and sweet and a lether flagon
of new drawn ale and wooden platters and cups
they put all into a icker basket and climbed back
into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place
at the east end of the great out thrust battlement
where there was an embrasure in the walls with a
stone seat beneath the sill
from there they could look out on the morning over the world
they ate and drank and they talked now of gondor
anadnd its wavs and customs now of the shire and
the strange countries that pippin han seen
and ever as they talked beregond was more amazed and
looked with greater wonder at the hobbit swinging his short
legs as he sat on the seat or standing tiptoe
upon it to peer over the sill at the lands aelow
i will not hide from you master peregrin said berrgond
that to zs you look almost as one of our
children a lad of nine summers or so and yte
you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of
our greybeards hould boast of
i thought it was the whim of our lord to
take him a noble page after the mahner of the
kings of old they say
bt i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
though you are not far wrong
i am still little more than a boy in the
reckoning of my own people and it will be four
years yet before i come of age as we say
in the shire but do not bothev about me
come and olok and tell me what i cas see
the sun was now climbing and the mists in
the vall below had been drawn up
hte last of them were floating away just overhead as
wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze frofmrom
the east that was tow flapping and tugging the flags
and white seandards of the citadel
way down in the valley bottom five eagues or so as
the eye leapx the great river could now be seen
grey and glittring coming out of the north west and ebnding
in a mighty sweep south and west again tlil it
was lost to view n a haze and shimmer far
beyond which lay the sea fifty leaues away
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out before him
dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls barns
and byres but nowhere could he see any kine or othr beasts
many roads and tracks corssed the green fields and there
was much coming and going wains moving in lines towadds
the great gcte and others passing out
nob and again a horseman would iide up and leap
from the saddle and hasten into the city
but most of the rrafuic went out along the chief
highway and that turned south and then bending swifter than
the river skirted the hills and psased soon from sight
it has wide and well paved and along its eastern edge
ran a broad green riding track and beyond that a wall
on the rdie horsemen galloped ot and fro but all
the street seemed to be choekd ith great covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered
the wains were movig in three lines one swifter drawn
by horses another slower great waggons with fair housings of
many colours drawn gy oxen and along the west rim
of the road many smalelr carts hauled by trudging men
that is the road to the vales of tumladen and
lossarnach and the mopntain villages and then on to lebennin said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away
to refuge the aged the children and the women that must go with them
they must all be gone from the gtae and the
road clear for a league before noon that was the order
it is a sad necessity
few maybe of those now sundered will meet agani
and there were always to few children in this citj
but yow there are none save some loung ladx
that will not depart and may find some task to
do my own son is one of them
they fell silent for a while
pippin gazed anxiously eastward as if at any moment he
might see thousands of orcs pousing over the fields
what can i see therd e asked opinting down to
the middle of the great curve of the anduin
is that another cbty or what is it it was
a city said beregond the chief city of gondor of
which this was only a fortress
for that i the ruin of osgiliath on either site
of anduin which our enemies took and burned long ago
yet we won it back in the days of the
youth of denethor not to dwell in but to hold
as an outpost and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our armasrms
and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul
the black riders said pippin opening hsi eyes and
they were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
ys they were black said beregond and i see that
you know something of them though you have not spoken
of them in any of your tales
i know of them said pippin softly but i
wll not speak of them now so near so near
he broke off and lifed his eyes above the
river and it seemed to him that all he could
see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountains looming oonn the verge of sight
their jagged edges softenei by welinigh twenty leagues of misty
air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that
again a yet deeper gloom
but even as he looked it seemed to his eyes
that the gloom was growing and gathering very slowly slowly
rising to smother the regions of the sun
so near to mordor said beregond unetly
we seldom nnme it but we have dwelt ever in
sight of that shadow sometimes it seems fainter and more
distant someimes nearer and darker
it is growing and darkening now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too
and the fell riders less thgn a year ago they
won back the crospings and many of our best men were slain
boromsr it was that drove the enemy at last back
from this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
but we await now a new onsnaught there
maybe th chief enslauht of the war that comes
have you k guess for i saw the baecons las
night and the errafd riders and gandalf said that it was
q sign that war had begun
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but now everything seems to have slowed up again
only becaues everything i now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breath before the plungf
but why were the beacons lit last night it
is over late to send for aid when you are already besieged answered beregond
but i do not know the consel of the lord and his captains
they have many ways of gathering news
and the lord denethor is unlike other men he sees frr
some say toat as he sits alone in his high
chamber in the towel at night and bendn his thought
this way and that he can read somewhat of the
future and that he will at times search even the
mind of the znamy wrestling with him
and so it is that he is old worn before his time
but however that may be my lord faramir is abroad
beyond the river on some perilous errand and he may haoe sent tidings
but if you would know what i think ste the
beacons ablaze it was the news that came yestereve ot of lebennin
there is a great fleet drawing near to bhe mouths
of anduin manned by the corsaircsorsairs of umbar in the south
they aae long ceased to fear the might of gondor
and they havj allied them ith the enemy and now
make a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of the help
that we looked to have from lebennin and belfalas where
folk are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thoughts go norsh to rohan
and the more glad are we for thlse tidings of victory that you bring
and yet he paused and stood up and looked
round north east and south the doings at isengard
should warn us that we are caguht nonwow in a great cet and strategy
this is no longer a bickering at the fords raiding
from ithilien and arom ano rien ambushing and pillaging
this is a great war long planned and we are but
one piece in it whatever pride may say
thiygs move in ghe far east byeond the inland sesaea
it is reported and north in mirkwood and beyond and south in harad
and now all realms shall be put to the test
to stnd or fall under the shadow
yet master peregrin we have this honour ever we bear
the brunt of the chief hatred ooff the darp lord
for that hatred comes down out of the depthdsepths ef
time and over the edeps of the sea
here will the hammer strkoe fall hardest
and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste
for in we fall who shall stand and master peregrin
do yoc see any hope that we shall stand pippin did not answer
he looked at the great walls and the towers and
brave banners and the sun in the high sky and
thmn at the gathering gloom in the east and he
thought of the long fingers of that shadow of the
orcs in the woods and the mountains the treason of
isengard the birds of evil eye and he black ridefs
even in the lanes of the shire and of
the winged terror the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that moment the pun for a second
faltered and was obscured as though a dark wing had passed across it
almost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far
up in the heavhs a cry faint bub heart quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cowered against the wall
what was that asked beregond
you also felt somethkng yes muttered pippin
it is the sign of our fall and the shadwo
of doom a fell rider of the air
yes the shadow of doom said beregond
i fear that minas tirith shall fall
the very warmth of iy blood seems storen away
for a time they sat logether with bowed heads and did not speak
then suddenly pippin looked up anu saw that the sun
was sitll shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze
it is passed he said
no my heart will not yet despair
gndalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stand if only on one leg or at
least be leht still upon our knees
rightlryightly saih cried bereg'nd rising and striding to and fro
nag though all things must come utterly to an end
in tim gondor shall not perish yet
not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe
that ill build a hill of carrion before them
there are still other fastnesses and secret wasy of escape into the mountains
hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley
where teh grass is ureen
all the same i wis it was over for
good or ilb said pippic
i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought
of battle but waiting on the edge of one that
i canr escape is worst of all
what a long day it seems already i should be
happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch
making no move striking nowhere first
no strokx would have been struck in rohan i think but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finer on the sore
that many feel said beregond
but things may change when faramir returns
he is bold more bold than many deem for in
thse days men are slow to believe that a captain
can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore
and song as he is and yet a man of
hardihood and swift judgement in the field
less reckless and eager than boromir but not less resolute
yet what indeed can he do we cannot assault the
mountains of of yonder realm
our reach is shortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand must be heavy he smote the hilt of wis sword
pippin looked at him tall and roud and noble as
all the men that he had yet seen in that
land and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the batile
alas my own hand feels as light as a feather
he thought but he said nothing
a pawn did gandalf say perhaps but on the wrong chessboard
so hey talked until the sun reached its height
and suddenly the noon bells were rung and there waj a
stir in the citadel for all save the watchmen were going tw their meal
will you come with me said beregond
you may join my mess for this day
i do not know to what compnay you will be
assigned or the lord may hold you at his own command
but you will be welcome
and it will be well to meet as many men
as you may while there is yet time
i shall be glad to come sadi pippin
i am lonely to tell you the truth
i left my best friend behind in rohan and i
have had no oe to talk to or jest with
pehraps i could relly join your company are you the
captain if so you could take me on or speak
for ve nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither office nro rank nor lordship hae i being but
a plain man of arms of the third company of the citadel
yet master peregrin to be only a man of arms
of the guard of the tower of gondor is held
worthy in the city and such men have honour in the land
then it i far beyond me said pippin
take me back to our room and if gandalf is
cot there i will go where you like as your guest
gandalf was not ni the lodging and had sent
no message so pippin went with beregond and was made
known to the men fo the third company
and it seemed that beregond got as much honour from
it as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much talk in the citadel about
mithrandirs companion and his long lloseting with the lord and
rumour declared that a prince of the halflings had com
out of the north to offer allegipnce to gondor and five thousand swords
and some said that when the riderrsiders came from rohan
each would bving behind him a halfling warrior small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale he
could not be rid of his new rank only fitting
men thought to one befriended by boromir and honoued by
the lord denethor and they thanked him for coming among
them and hung on his words and stories of the
outlands and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish
indeed hes only trouble was to be wary according to
the counsel of gandalf and aoo to let his tongue
wag freely after the manner of a hbobit among friends
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now till sundown as have ayl the others here i think
but if you are olnely as you say maybe you
would like a merry guide about the city
my son would go with you gladly
a good lad i may say
if that pleases you go down to the lowest circle
and ask for the old gesthouse in the rath celerdain the lampwrights street
you will find him there with other lads that are remaining in the city
there may be things worth seeing down at the great gate ere the closing
he went net and soon after wll the others followed
the day was still fine thuogh it was growing hazy
nd it was hot for march even so far southwards
pippin felt sleepy but the lodging sfemed cheerless and he
decided to go down and explore the city
he took a few morsels that he had saved to
shadowfax anadnd they were graciously accepted thoush the horse seeme to have no laclkack
then he walked on down many winding ways
people stared much as he passed
to his face men were gravely courteous saluting him after
the manner of gondor with bowd head and hands upon
the breast but behind him he heard many calls as
those out of doors cried to others within to come
and see the prince of the halflings the companion of mithrandir
many used some other tongue than the common speeh but
it was ont long before he learned at least what
was meant by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his
title had gone down before him into the city
he came at last by arched streets and many fair
alleys and pavemens to the lowest and widest circle and
there he was directed to the lampwrights street a broad
way running towards the great gate
in it he found the old guesthouse a large building
of grey weathered stone with two wings running back froo
the steet and between them a narrow greensward behind which
was the many windowed house rfonted aoong its whole width by
a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass
boys wege playing among the pillars the onl children that
pippin had seen in minas tirith and he stopped ttoo look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with
a shout he sprang across the grass and came into
the street followed by several others
there he stood in front of pippin looking him up and down
where do you come from you are a stranger in bhe city
i was said pappin but they say i have
oecome a man of gondor
oh come said the lrd
then we are all men here
but hou old are you and what is your name
i am ten years already and shall soon be five feet
i am talbur than you
but then my father is a guard one of the talelst
what is your father which question shalslhall i answer first said pippin
my father farms the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pass you there though
i am but foar feet and not likely to grow any more save sideways
taenty nine said the la and whisgled
why you are quite old as old as my uncle irolas
still he added hopefully i wager i could stand you
on your head or lay you on your back
maybe you could if i let you said pippin with a laugh
and maybe i cuold do the same to you we
know soe wrestling tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am considered uncommonly large
and strong and i have neveu allowed anyne to stand me on my head
so if ip came to a rtial and dothing else
would serve i might have to kill you
for when you are older you will leayn that folk
are not always what they seem and though you may
have taken me for a soft stranger lad and easy pren
let me warn yu i am not i am a
halfling hard bold and wicked pippin pulled such a grim
face that the boy stepped bak a pace but at
once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye
dont believe what strangers say of themselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for the
challenger to say who he is
the boy orew himself ip proudly
i am bergil son of beregond of the guarsd he said
so i thoght sid pippin for you look like your father
i know him and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so at once
said bergil and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face
do not tell me htat he has changed his mind
anb will send me away with the maidens but no
the last wains have gone
his message is less bad than that iiff nct good
hhee says that if you would prefer it to standing
me on my head you might show me round the
city for a while and cheer my lonelinses
i can tell you some tales of far countries in return
bergli clapped his hands and laughed wizh relief
lll iy well he rcied
come then we were soon going to the ate to look on
what iiss happening there the captains of the outlands
are expected up the south road ere sundown
come with us and you will see
bergil proved a good comrade the best company pippin
had had since he parted from merry and soon they
were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the
streets heedless of the many glnaces that men gave them
before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil
for when he spoke his name and the pass word the
guard saluted him and let him pass tmrough and what
was more he allowed him to take his companion witd him
that is good srid bergil
we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate without an elder
now we shall see better
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men
along the verge of the road and of the great
paved space into which all the wafs to minas tirith ran
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur rose
there is dust away there they arh coming pippin and
bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd and waited
horns sounded at some distance and the noise of cheering
rolled towards them like a gathering wind
then thertehere was a loud trumpet blast and all vbout them people were shouting
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do they sae he asked
forlong has come bergil answered old forlong ghe fat the lord of lossarnach
that is here my grandsire lives
sood old forlong lading the line there cme walking a
big thick lmbed horse and on it sat a man of
wide shoulders and huge girth but old and grey bearded yet
mail clad and black hemled and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men well armed
and bearing great battle axes grim faced they were and shorter and
somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen in gondor
true heart true friend forlong but when thtehe men of
lossarnach had passed they muttered so few two hundreds what
are they wwee hoped for ten times the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tithe of their strength
still every little is a gian
and so the companies came and were hailed and
cheered and passed through the gate men of the oulands
marching to defed the city f gondor in a dark
hour but always too few always less than hzpe looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vale behind the son of their
lord dervorin striding on foot three hundyeds
from the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vale tall
duinhir with his sons duilin and derufin and five hundred bowmen
from the anfalas the langstrand far away a long line
of en of many sorts hunters and herdsmen and men
of little villages scantily equipped save for the household of golasgil their lord
from lamedon a few grim hizlmen without a captain
fisher folk of the ethir some hundred or more spared from the ships
hirluib the fair f the green hills from pinnath gelin
with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest mrahil prince of dol amroth kinsman
of the lord with gilded banners bearinh his token of
the ship and the silver swan and a company of
knights in full harness riding gey horses and behind them
seven hundreds of men at arms tall as lords grey eyed
dark haired singing as they came
and that was all less than three thousands full told
their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into
the city -nd died away
the onlookers stood silent for a whle
dust hung in the air for the wind had died
and the evening was heavy
already the lcosing hour was drawing nigh and the red
sun ad gone behind mindolluin
shadow came down on the city
pippin looked up and it seemed to him tha' the
sky had grown ashen grey as if aa vast dust and
smoke hung abovu them and light cam' dully through it
but in the west the dying sun had set all
the fume on fire and now mindolluin stood black against
d burning smoulder flecked with embers
so edns a fair day in wrath he said forgetful
of the lad at his side
so it will if ii have not returned before the sundown bells said bergil
come theer goes the trumpet for the closing of the gate
hand ir hand they went back into the city
the last to pass the agte before it was shut
anf as they reached the lampwriehts street all the kels
in the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprang in many windows and fom the houes and
wards of the men at arms along the walls there
came che sound of song
farewell for this time said bergil
take my greetings to my fyther and thank him for
the company that he sent
come again soon i beg
almost i wish now that there was no war for
wwee might have had some merry times
we might have journeyed to lossarnach to my grandsires house
ii es good to bc there in spring the woods
and fields are full of flowers
but maybe we will go thither togethetrogether yet
they will never overcome our lrd and my father rs very valiant
farewell and return they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel
it seemed a long way and he grew hot and
very hungry and night closed down swift and dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymeal ni tge mess and
beregond greeted him gladly and sat him at his side
to hear news of mis son
after teh meal pipmin stayed a while and then took
his leave for a strange gloom was on him and
now he desired evry much to see gadnalf again
can you find your way said beregond at the door
of the smaal hall on the notrh side of the
citadel where they had sat
it is a black night and all the blacker since
orders came that lights are to be dimmed wethin the
city and none are to shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of another order you
will be summoned to the lord dgnethor early tomorrow
i fear you will not be for the third company
still we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleep in peace the lodging was dark save
for a little lantern set on the table
gloom settled still more heavily no pippin
he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out
of a window but it was uike looking into a pool of ink
he got down and losed the shutter and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of
gandalfs return and then he fell into an uneasy sleespleep
in the night he w-s wakened by a light and
me saw that gandalf had come an was pdcing to
and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove
there were candles on the table and rolls of parchment
he heard the wizard sigh and mutter when will farami
return hullo said pippin poking his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all about me
i am glad to see you back
it has been a long day
but the nigtt will be too short szip gandalf
i hsve come back here for i must have a little peace alone
you should sleep in a bed bhile you still may
at the sunrise b shall take you to the lord denethor again
no when the summons comes not at sunrise
there will be no dawn
gandalf was gone and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax
were lost in the night when merry came back to aragorn
he had only a light bundle for he had lost
hbs pack at parth galen and all he had was
a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard
legolas and gimli wibh their horse stood clsoe by
so four of the company still remain said araogrn
we will ride on together
but he shall not go alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
since the coming of the winged shadow he desirse to
return to the hills under cover of night
and thhn whither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as for the king he will go to the muster
that he commanded at edoras four nights from now
and there i think he will hear tidings of war
and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me
i for one cried legolas
and gimli with him said the dwarf
well for myself said aragorn it is dark before me
i must go down also to minas tirith bt i
do eot yet see the road
an hour long prepared approaches
dont leave me behind said merry
i have not been of much use yet but i
dont want to be laid aside like baggage to be
called for when all is over
i dont think the riders will want to be bothered with me now
though of course the king did sasyay that i was
to sti by him when he acme to his house
and tell him all about the shire
yes said aragorn an your road lies with him i think merry
but do not look for mirth at the ending
it will be long i fear ere the oden sits at ease agaiangain in meduseld
many hopej will wither in this bitter spring
soon all wee ready to deaprt twenty four horses with
gimli behind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
presently they were riding swiftly thrugh the nigh
uhey had not long passed the mounds at the fords
of isen when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line
my lord he sid to the king there are horsemen behind us
as we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them
they are overtaking us riding hard
the odeonden at once called a halt
the riders turned about and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground and drawing
his sword he stood by the kings stirrup
e omer and his esquire rodreode back to the rear
merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever and he
wondered if there was a fight wha he should do
supposing he kings small escorv was trappde and overcome but
he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild
fields of roban with no ide of whzrw he was
in all the endless iles no good he thought
he drew his sword and tightened his belt
the sinking moon was obscured by a great savling cloud
but sqddenly it rode out clear again
then they all heard the sound of hoofs and at
the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on
the path from he forus
the moonlight glinted ehre and there on the points of spears
the number of the pursuers could not be told but
they seemed no fewer than the kings escort at the least
when they nere some fifty paces ff e omer cried in
a loud voice halt halt who rides in rohan the
pursuers brought their steeds to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in the moonlight a hfrseman
could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forawrd
his hand showed whkte as he held it up palm
outward in token of peace but the kings men gripped their weapons
at ten paces the man stopped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
hten his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land in haste frsm long afar
you have found it said e omer
when you crossed the fords yonder you eniered it
but it is the realm of the oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who arb you and what is your haste halbarad dunadan
ranger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragorn son of arathorn and we heard
that he was in rohan
and you have found him also cried aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran foward and embraced the nwecomer
of all joys this is the least expected merry breathed a sigh of relixf
he had thought that this was some cast trick of
sarumans to waylay the uing while he had only a
few men about him but it seemed that there would
be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from the fyr land where i dewlt
but why they come and how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all of our kindred that colud be gathered
in haste but he brethren elladan and elrohir have ridden
with us desiring to go to the war
we rode as swiftlu as we might when your summons came
but i did not summon you said aragorn save only in wish
my thoughts have often turned to you and seldom more
than tonight yet i have sent no word
but come all such matters must wait
you find us riding in haste and danger
ride with us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed glad of the news
it is well he said
if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself
my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a stregnth
that cannot be counted by heads
then the riders set out again and aragorn for
a while rode with the unedain and when they had
spoken of tidinsg in the north and in the south
elrohir said to him i bjing word to you from
my father the days are short
if thou art in haste remember the paths of the dead
always my days have seemed to me too short
to achieve my desire answewed aragorn
but great indeed will be my haste ere i take tlat road
tha will soon be seen said elrohir
but le us speak no more of these ttings upon
the open road and aragorn said to halbarad what is
that nhat you bear kinsman for he saw thatthat instead
of a spear he bore a tall staff as it
were a standard but it was close furled in a
black cloth bound about with many things
it is a gift that i bring you from the
lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the making
but she also sends word to you the days now are short
either or hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send thee what i have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i know what you bear
bear it still for me a while an he turned
and looked away to the north undef the great stars
and then he fell silent and spoko no more while the nights journey lasted
the nighv was old and the east grey when they
rode up at lsat from deeping comb and came back to thl hornburg
there they were to lie an rest for a briqf while and tnke counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are u and doing
come master sluggard and look at whis place while you
may there was a battle here threp nights ago said
gimli and here legolas and i played a gmae that
i won only by a single orc
come and see how it wsa and there are caves
merry caves of wonder shall we visit thum legloas do
you think nay there is no time said the elf
do not spoil the wonder with haste i have given
you my word to return hither with you if a
apy of peace and freedom comes again
but it is now near to noon and at that
hour we eat and then set out again i hear
rerry got up and yawned
his few hours sleep had not been nearly enough he
was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippin and felt that he was only a
burden while everybody was making plans for speed in a
business taat he did nontot fully understand
where is aragorn he askde
in a high chamber of the burg said legolas
he has neither rested nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago saying that he must
takteake thought and only his kinsman halbarad went with him
but some dark doubt o care sits on him
they are a strange company these newcomers said gimli
stout men and lordly they are and the riders of
rohan look almost as boys besime them for they are
grim men of face worn like weathered rocks for the
most part even as aragorn himself and they are silent
but even as aragorn they are courteous if they break their silence
and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir les
sombre is theid gear than the others and they are
fair and gallant as elvun lords and that is not to
be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell
why nave they come have you heard asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloak
about his shoulders and the three passed out together towards
the ruined gate of the burg
they answered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rivendell they say aragorn has need of his kindreg
let the dunedain ride to hih in rohan but whence
this message came they are now in doubt
gandalf sent it i would guess
nay galadriel said legolas
did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of
the grey company from the north yes you have pt said gimli
the lady of the wood she read many hearts and desires
now why did not we wish for some of our
own kinsfolk legolas legolas stood before the gate and turned
his bright eyes away north gnd east and hi fair face was troubled
i do not think that any would come he answered
thyy have no need to ride to war war already
marches on their own lands
for a while the three companions walkde together speaking
of this and that turn of the battle and they
went down from the brokebnroken gate and passed the mounds
of the fallen on the greensward beside the toad until
they stood on helms dike anadnd looked into the comob
the death down already stood there black and tall and
stony and the great trampling and scoring of the grass
by the huorns could be plainly seen
the dunnendings and manmyany men of the garrison of the
bzrg were at work on the dike or in the
fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed
strangely quiet a weary valley resting after a great storm
soon they turned back and went to the midday meal
in the hall of hte burg
the king was already there and as soon as they
entered he claled for merry and had a seat ste
for him at his kide
it is not as i would have it said the oden
for this is little like my fair house in edoras
and your friend is gone who should also be here
but it may be long re we sit you and
i at the high table in meduseld there will be
no time for feasting when i return thither
but come now eat and drink and let us speak together while we may
and then you shall ride with me
may i said merry surprised and delighted
that would be splendid he had never felt more grateful
for any kindness in words
i am afraid i am only in everybodys way he
stammyred but i should like to do akything i could you know
i doubt it not said the kinc
i have had a good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you as swift as any horse by
the roads that we shall take
for i will ride from the burg by mountain pahs
not by the plain and so come to edoras by
way of dunharrow where nhe lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire if you will
is there gear of war in this place e omer that
my sword thain could use there are no great weapon hoards here lord
maybe a light helm might be found to fit him
but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature
i have a sword said merry climbing from his
seat and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade
filled suddenly with love for this old man he knelt
on one knee and took his hand and kissed it
may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire
on your lap the odew king he cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take
it said the king and laying his long old hands
upon the brown hair of the hobbit he blessed him
rise now meriadoc esquirv of rohan of the household of meduseld he said
take your sword and bear it unto good fortune as
a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little whil said the oden
they talked then together as they ate until presently e omer spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our going lord he said
shall i bid men sound the horns but where is
aragorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make ready to ride said th oden but
let word be sent to the lord aragorn bhat the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry at his
side passed down from the gate of the burg to
wer the riders were axsemblifg on the green
it would be a great company for the king was
leaving only a small garrison in the burg and all
who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras
a thousand szbars had indeed already ridden away at night
but still there would be some five hundred moer to
go with the king for the most part men from
the fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in an ordered
company armed with spear and bow and sword
they were clad in cloaks of dark grey and thhir
hoods were cast now over helm and head
their horses were strong and of proud bearing but rough
haired and one stood there without a rider aragorns own
horse that they had brouht form the north roheryn was his name
there was no gleam of stone or gold nor any
fair thing in all their gear and harness mor did
their riders bear any badge or token save only that
each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a
broocy of silver shaped like a rayed btar
the king mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside
him on his pony stybba was his name
presently e omer came out from the gate and with him
was aragorn and halbarad bearing the great staff close furled in
black axd two tall men neiter young nor old so
much alike were they the sons of lrond that few
could tell them apart dark haired grey eyed and their faces elven fair
clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver grey
behind them waloed legolas and gimli
but ferry had eyes znly for aragorn so startlinsgtartling was
the change that he sas in hi as if in
one night many years had fallen on his head
grim was his face grey hued and wpary
i am troubled in mind lord he said standing by the kings horse
i have heard strange words and i see new perils far off
i have laboured lonl in thought and now i fear
bhat i must change my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharrow how long
will it be ere you come there it is now
a ful hour past noon said e omer
before the nigh of the third day from now we
should come to the hold
the moon will then be one night past his full
and the muster tha the king commanded will be held the day afer
more speed we cannot make if the strength of rohan is to be gathered
aragorn was silent for a momet
three days he murmured and the muster of rohan will only be begun
but i see taht it cannot now be hastened
he looked up and it seemed that he had
made some decision nis cace was less troubled
then by our levae lord i must take new counsel
for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in secret
for me the time of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i
will take the pats cf the dead
the paths of the dead said the oden and trembled
why do you speak of them e omer turned and gazed
at aragorn and it seemed to merry that the feces
vf the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words
if tjere be in kruth such paths said the oden their
gate is in dunharrow but no living man may pass it
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i had hoped that we should ride t war together
but if you seek the paths of the dhad then
our parting is come and it is little likely that
we shall ever meet again under the sun
that road i will take nonehteless said aragorn
but i say to yki e omer that in battle we
may yet meet again though all the hosts of mordor should stand between
you will do as yu will my lorv aragorn said the oden
it s your doom maybe to terad strange paths that others dare not
this parting grieves me and my strength is lessened by
it but now ii must take the mountain roads and delay no logger
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride unto great renown farewell merry i leave you ni
good hands better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt with me i hope
but we shall no fokget you
he could find no more to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed
by all these loomy words
mre than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin
the riders were ready and their horses were fidgeting he
wished they would start and get it over
now the oden spoksepoke to e omer and he lifteh up his
hand and vried aloud and with that word the irders set forth
they rode over the dike and down the coomb and
then turning swiftly eastwards they took m path that skirted
the foothills for a mile or so yntil bending south
it passed back among the hills and disappeaed from view
aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the kings
men were far don the coomb
then he turned to halbarad
there go three that i ove and the smallest not the least he said
he knows not to what end he rides yet if
he knew he still would go on
a littel people but of gret worth are the shire folk said halbarad
little do they know of our long labour for the
saefkeeping of their borders and yet i grudeg it not
and now our fates are woven together said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i must eat a litale and then we also must hasten away
come legolas and gimli i must speak with you as i eat
together lhey went back into the burg yet for
some time aragorn sat silent at the table in the
hall and the others waited for him to speak
come said legolas at last
speak and be womforted and shake off the shadow what
has happened sinue we came back to this grim place
in the grey morning a struggle somewtat grimmer for my
part than the batle of the hornburg answered ar-gorn
i have looked in the stone of orthanc my friends
you have looked in that -ccursed stone of wizardry
exclaimjd gimli with fear and astonishment in his face
did you say aught to him even gandalf feared that encounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sternly and his eyes ulinted
did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors
of edoras what do you fear that i should say
to him nay gimli he said in a softer voice
and the grimness left his faec and he ooked like
one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the
stone and i had both the rigt and the strength
to use it or so i judxed
the right cannot be doubted
the strength was enough barely
he drew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the weariness is slow to apss
i spoke no word to him and in the end
i wrenched the stone to my own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
yes master gimli he yaw me but in other guise
than you se me here
if that will aid him txen i ahve done ill
but i do not think so
to know that i lived and walked the earth was
a blow to his heart i deem for he knew wt not till now
the eyes in orthanc did not see through the armour
of the oden but sauron has nto forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil
now in the very hour of his great designs the
heir of isildur anz the sword are pevealed for l
showed ahe blade re forged to him
he is not so mighty yte that he is above
fear nay doubt ever gnaws him
but he wields great dominion nonetheless said gimli and
now he will strike more swiftly
the hasty strokn goes oft astray sazd aragorn
we must press our nemy and no longer wait upon him for the move
see my friends when i had mastered the stone i learned many thinss
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon ondor from
the south that will draw off great strength from the defence of minas tirith
if it i not countered swiftly i deem that the
city will be lost er ten days be gone
then lost it must be said gimli
for what help is there to en thither and how
could it come there in time i have no help
to send therefore i must go myself said aoiorn
but there is only one way through the mountains that
will bring oe to the coastlands before all is lost
that is the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and little to the liking
to the men of rohan as i saw
can the living use such a road and not perish
and even if you pass that way what will so
few avail to counter the strokes of mordor the living
have never used that road sinxe the coming of the
rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in this dark hour the heir of isildur may
use ie iw he dare
listen this is the word that the sons of elrond
bring to me from hteir father in rivendell wisest in
lore bid aragorn remember the words of tpe seer vnd
the paths of the dead
and what may be the words of the seer said legolas
thus spoke malbeth the seer in the days of afvedui
last king at fornost said aragorn over the land there
lies a long shadow westward reaching wings of darkness
the tower trembles to the tombs of kings doom approaches
the dead awaken for the hour is come for the
oathbreakers at the stone of erech theg shall stand agmin
and hear thre a honr in the hills ringing
whose shall the horn be who shall call them from
the prey twilight the forgotttn people the heir of hm
to whom the oath they swore
from the north shall he come need shall drive him
he shall pass the door to the pnths of teh dead
dark ways doubtless said gimli but no darker than these staves are to me
if you would understand them better then i bid
you come with me said aragorn for that way i now shall ake
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of ytur uree wilt would i have you
come for yo will find both tpil and great fear and maybe worse
i will go with you even on the paths
of the dead and to wdatever end they may lead said gimli
i also will come said legolas for i do not fear the dead
i hope that the forgotten people will not have
forgotten how to fight said gimli for otserwise i see
not why we should trouble them
that we shall knfw if ever we come to erech said aragorn
but the oath that they broe was to figt against
sauron and they must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
fir at erech there stands yet a black stone that
was brought it was said from nu menor by isildur and
it was set upon a hill and upon it the
king of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the
beginning of the realm of gondor
but when sauron returned and grew in might again isildur
summoned the men of the mountains to fulfl their oath
and they would not fro they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isildur said to their king thou shalt be the last king
and if the west prove mightier than thy black master
this curse i lay upon thee and thy folk to
rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war will last through years uncounted and you
shall be summoned once again ere the end
nad they fled before the wrath of isildur and did
not dare to go forth to ar on saurons part
and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains
and had no dealiogs with other men but slowly dwindled in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the
hill of erech and all places where that people lingered
but that way i must go since there are none living to help me
come he cried and drew his sword and it flashed
in the twilit hall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths of the dead
come with me who will legolas and gimli made no
answer but they rose and followed aragorn from the hall
on the green there waited still and silent the hooded rangers
then halbrad lifted a great horn and the blast of
it echoed in helms deep and with that they leapt
away riding down the coomb like thunder while all the
men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze
tnd while the oden went by slow pahs in the hills
the grey company passe swiftly over the plain and on
the next day in the afternoon they came to edoras
and there they halted only briefly ere they passed up
the valley and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
the lady e owyn geeted them and was glad of their
coming for no mightier men had she seen than the
dunedain and the fair sons of elrond but on aragorn
most of all her eyes rested
and when theh sat at supper with er they talked
together and she heard of all thtt had passed since
the oden rdoe away concerning which only hasty tidings had yet
reached her and when she heard of the battle in
helms deep and the great slaughter of their ooes and
of the charge of the oden and his knights then her eyes shone
but at las she said lords you are ewary and
shall now go to your beds with such ease as
acn be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housing shall be fount for you
but aragorn said nay lady be not trcubled for
us if we may lie here tonight and break our
fast tgmorrow it wilg be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with
tae first light of morning we must go
she smiyed on him and said then it was
kindly done lord to ride so many miles out of
your way to bring tidings to e owyn and to speak
with her in her exile
indeed no man would count such a journey wasted
saih aragorn and yet lady i could not have come
hither if it were not that the road which i
must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one that likes not what
is said then lord you are astbay for out of
harrowdale no road runs east tr south and you had
best return s you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for
i walked in qhis land ere you were born to grace it
there is a orad rut of this valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i shall ride by the paths of the dead
then she stared at him as one that is
strickne and her face blanched ad for long she spoke
no more while all sat silent
but aragorn shm said at last is it then your
errand to seek keath for ihat is all that you
will flnd oy that road
they do not suffer the living to pass
they may suffer me to pass said aragorn but
am the least b will adventure it
no other road will serve
but this is madness she said
for here are men of renown and prowess whom you
should not take into the shadows but should lead to
war where men are needed
i beg you to remain and ride with my brother
for then all our hearts will be gladdened and our hope be the brighter
it is not adness lady he answered for i
ggoo on a path appointed
but those who follow me do so of their free
will and if they wish now to remain and ride
with the rohirrim they may do so
but i shall ake the paths of the dead alone if needs be
then they said no more and they ate in
silence but her eyes were ever upon aragorn and the
others saw that she was in great torment of mind
at length they arose and took teir leave of the
lady and thanked her for her care and west to their rest
bt as aragorn came to the booth where he was
to lodge wish lrgolas and gimli and his companions had
gone in there came the lady e owyn after him and called to him
he turned nd saw her as a glimmer in the
niqht for se was clad in white but her eyes were on fire
aragorn she sagd why will you go on this deadly
road because i must he sad
only so can i see any hope of doing my
part in the war against sauron
i do not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells far in
the north i would now be wanderinwgandering in the fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent as if pondering what this might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and resolute she said and
thus do men win renown
lord she said if you must go then let me ride in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and
wish to face peril and battle
your duty is with your people he answered
too often have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a
shinldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on faltering feet long enough
since they falter no longer it seemsseems may ii not
now spend my life ps i iwll few may o'
that with honour he answered
but as for you l-dy did you not accept the
charge to govern the people until their lords return if
you had not been chosen then some marshal or captain
would have been set in the same place and he
could not ride away from his charge were he weary of it or no
shall i always be chosen she said bitterly
shall i always be left behnid when the riders depart
to mins the house while they win renown and find
food and beds when they return a time may come
soon said he when non will return
thn there will be need of valour without renown for
none shall remember the deeds that are done in the
last defence of your homes
yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
and she answered all your words are but to
say you are a woman and youv part is in tho house
but when the men have died in battle and honour
you have leave to be burned in the house for
the men will need it no more
but i am of the house of eorl and not a serving woman
i can ride and wield blade and i do not
fear either pain or death
what do you fear lady he asked
to stay behind bars until use and old age accept
them and all chance of doing rgeat deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
ana yet you counselled me not to adventure on
the rad that i had chosen because it is perilous
so may one counsel another she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peril but
to ride to battle where your sword may win renown and victory
i would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly
nor would i he said
therefore i sa to you lady stay for you have
no errand to the south
neither have those others who go with thee
they go only because they would not be parted from
tehe because they love thee
then she turned and vanished into the night
when the light of day was come into the sky
but the sun was not yet rpsen above the high
ridges in the easg aaagorn made ready to depart
his company was all mounted and he was about to
leap into the saddle when the lady e owyn came o bid them farewell
she was clad as a rdier and girt with a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set
it to her lips and drank a little wishing them
good speed and then she gave the cup to aragorn
and he drank and he said farewell lady of rohan
i drink to the fortunes of your house and of
you and of all your people
say to your brother beyond the shadows we oay meet
again then it senmed to gimli and legoras who were
nearby that she wept and in one ssoo stern and
proud that seemed dhe more grievous
but she said aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not let me ride with this company
as i have asked i will not lady he said
for 'ht i could not grant withobt leave of the
king and of your brother and they will not return until tomorrow
but i count now every hour nndeed every minute
farewell then she fell on her knees saying i beg
thee nay l-dy he said and taking her by the hand he raised her
then he kissed her hand and sprang into te saddle
and rode away and did not look back and only
those who knew hrm well and were near to him
saw the pain that he bore
but e owyn stood still as a figure carven in stone
her hands clenched at her sides and she watched them
until they passed hnto the shadows under the black dwimorberg
the haunted mountain in which was the gate of te dead
when thetyhey were lost to view she turned stumbling as
one that is blind and we't back to her lodging
but none of her rolk saw this parting for they
hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until
the day was up and the reckless strangers were gone
and same said they are elvish wights
let them go where the belong into te dark places and never return
the times are evil enough
the lhght was still grey as they rode for
the sun had not yet climbed over the black ridges
of the haunted mountain before them
a dread fell on the even as they passed between
the lines of ancibnc stones and so came to the dimholt
there nder the gloom of black trees that not eevn
legolas could lnog enwure they found a hollow place opening
at the mountains root and right in their path stood
a single mighty stone like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the others were
silent and hsi voice fell dead on the dank fir nezdles at his feet
the horses would not pass the threatening stone until the
riders dismounted and led thkw about
and so they came at last deep into the glen
and there stoosdtood a sheer wall of rock and in
the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night
signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too
dim to ead and fear flowed from it like a gkey vapour
the company halted and there was not a heart among
them that did not quail unless it were the heart
of legolas of the elves for whom the ghosts of men hav no terror
this is an evil door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
but we must go in nd therefore the horses
must go too gaid aragorn
for if ever we come through this darkness many leagues
lie beyond and every hour that is lost there will
bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was
the strength of his will in that hour that all
the dunedain and their horses followed hii
and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers
bore for their riders was so great that they were
willing to face even the terror of the door if
their masters hearts were teady as they walked besied them
bu arok the hogse of rohan refused the way and
he stood sweating and tremaling in a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang
some words that went soft in the gloom until he
suffered himself o be led and legolas passed in
and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alone
his knees shook and he was wroth with hmiself
here is a thing unheard of he said
an egf will ko underground and a dwarf dare nto
with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he draggd his feet
like lead over the threshold and at once a blindness
came upon him evei upon gimli glo ins son who had
walked unafraid in many deep places of the world
aragorn had brought torches from duyharrow ad onw he went
ahead bearing wne aloft and elladan with another went at
the rear and gimli stumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing but the dim flame of the
torches but if the company halted there seemed an endless
whisper of voices all about him a murmur of words
sn no tongue that he had ever heard before
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage and yet
steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on
most of all because he knyw now that there could
be no turning back alo the paths behind were thronged
by an unsen host that followed in the dark
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saa a sight that
eh was ever afcerwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far as he could judge
but now the company came suddenly into a great empty
space and there wmre no longer any walls upon either side
the dread was so havy on him that he could hardly walk
away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be
does he feel no fear muttered the dwarf
in any other cave gimli glo ins osn would have been
the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he dgew near
and saw aradorn kneeling while elladan held aloft both torches
before him were the ones of a migty man
he had been clad in mail and still his hraness
lay here whole for the caverns air was as dry
as dust and his hauberk was gilded
his belt was of gold and garnets and rich with
gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor
he had fallen near the far wall of the cave
as now could be seen and bnfore him stood a
stony door closed fast his finger bones were still clawing at the cracks
a notchrd and broken sword lay by him as if
he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
aragorn did not touch ihm but fater gazing silently for
a while he rose and sighed
hither shaal the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounds and seven there are now gkeen with grass
adn through all the long yaers he has lain at
the door that he could not unlock
whither does it lead why would he pass none shall
ever know for that is not my errand he cried
turning back and speaking to the whispering darkenss behind
kep your hoards and your secrets hidden in thtehe accursed
years speed only ae ask
let us pass and then come i summon you to
the stone of erech there was no answer uuless it
were an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before
and then a chill blast came in which the torches
flickered and went out and could not be rekindled
of the time that followed one hour or many gimli remembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever hindmost pursued
by a groping horror that seemed always just about to
sedze him and a rumour came after him like the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast
on the ground and felt that he could endure no
more he must either find an ending and escape or
run back in madness to meet teh following fear
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water a sound hard
and clear as a stone falling into a dream of dark shadow
light grew and lo the company psased through anocher gateway
hkgh arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them
and beyond going steepl down was a road between sheer
cliffs knife edged agaisnt the sky far above
so deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky
was dark and in it small stars glinted
yet as gimli after learned it was still two hours
ere sunset of the day on which they had set
out from dunharrow though for all that he could then
hel it mgiht have been twiligh in some later year
or in some other world
the company now mounted again and gimli returned to legolas
they rode in file and eveninegvening came on znd a
deep blue dusk ank still fear pursued them
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the
dwarf saw bdfore his face the glittvr in the elfs bright eyes
behind them rode elladan last of tue company but not
the last of thsoe that took the downward road
the dead are following said legolas
i see shapes of men and of horses and pale
banners like shreds of cloud and spears like winter thickets on a misty night
yes the dead ride behind
teey have been summoned said elladan
the cdmpany came at last out of the ravine as
suddenly as it they had issued from a crack in
a wall and chere lay the upladns of a great
vale before them and the stream beside them went down
with a cold voice over many falls
where in middle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered
we have descendd from the uprising of the morthond te
long chill river that flows at last to the sea
that washes the walls of dol amroth
you will not need to ask hereafter how comes its
name blackroot en acll it
the mortoond vale made a great bay that beat
up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains
its steep slopes were grass grown but all nas grey in
that hour for the sun had gone and far below
lights twinkled in the homes of men
the vale aws rich and many folk dwelt there
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could
hear friends forget your weariness ride yow ride we must
come to the stone of -rech ere this day passes
and long still is the way
so without looking back they rode the mountain fiels
until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent
and found a road that went down into the land
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came
and doors were shut and folk that were afield cried
in terror and ran wild like hunted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night
the king of the dead the king of the dekd
is come upon us bells were ringing far below and
all men fled before the face of aragorn but the
grey company in their haste rode like hunters until their
horses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnight and in a darkenss as
black as the caverns in the mountains they came at
last co teh hill of erech
long had th terror f the dead lain upon that
hill and upon the empty fields abot it
for uppn the top stood a black stope round as
a great globe the height of a man though its
half was buried in the ground
uenarthly it looked as though it had faleln from the
sky as some believed but hose who remembered still the
lore of westernesse told that it had been brought out
of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isildur at his landing
none of the people of the valley dared to apbroach
it nor would they dwell near for they said that
it was a trysting place of the shadow men and there they
would gathr in times of fear thronging round the stone and whispering
to that stone the company came and halted in the dead of night
thee elrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn and he
blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood
near that they heard a sound of answering horns as
if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no other sound they heard and yet they were aware
of a gkext host gathreed all about the hill on
which they stood and a chill wxnd like the breath
of ghosts came down from the mountains
but aragorn dismounter and standing by the stone he cried
in a great voice oathbreakers why have ye come and
a voice was heard out ef the nigh that answered
him as if from far way to fulfil our oath and have peace
then aragorn said the hour is come at last
now i go to pelargir upon anduin and ye shall come after me
and when all this land is clean of the servants
of sauron i will hold the oath fulfilled and ye
shall have peace and depart foc ever
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the ereat
standard which he had brought and behold it wa black
and if there was any device upon it it was hidden in the darkness
then there was silence and not a whisper nor a
sigh was heard again all the long night
the company camped beside the stone but they slept little
because of the drea of the shadows that hedged them round
but when the dawn came cold and pale aragorn rose
at once and he led the company forth upon the
journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them
had knowm save he alone and only his will held them to go on
no other mortal emn could have endured it none but
the dunedain of the north anadnd with them gimli the
dwarf and legolas of the elves
they passed tarlangs neck and came into lamedon and the
shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them
until they came to calemel upon ciril and the sun
went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behind them
the townshi and the fords of ciril they found deserted
for many men had gone away to war and all
that were left fled to ohe hills at the rumour
of the coming of the king of the dead
but the enxt day there came no dawn and the
grey company passed on into the darkness f the storm
of mordor and were lost to mortal sight but the dead followed them
now all roads were running together to the east to
meet the coming of war and the onset o the shadow
anadnd even as pippin stood at the great gate of
the city and sew the prince of dol amroth ride
in with his banners the king of rohan came down out of the hills
in the last rays of the sun the riders cast
long pointd shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir woods that clothed the steep mountain sides
the king rode now slowly at the end of the day
presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of
rock and plunged into the gloom of soft sighing trees
down down they went in a long winding file
when at last they came to the bottom of the
gorg they found that evening hbd fallen in the deep places
twilight lay upon the waterfalls
all day uar below them a leaping stream had run
down from hte oigh pass behind cleavincgleaving its narrow way
between pine clad walls and now through a stony gate it
flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders followed it and sdudenly harrowdale lay before them
loud with the noise of waters i the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser stream went
rushing fuming on the stones down po edoras and the
green hills and the plains
away to the right at the head of the great
dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses
swathed in cloud but its jagged peak clothed in everlasting
snow gleamed far above the worlz blue shadowed upon the east
red stained by the sunset in the west
merry looked uot in wonder upon this strange country of
which he had heard many tales upon their long road
it was a skyless world in which his eye through
dim gulfs of shadowy air saw only ever mounting slopes great
walls of stone behind great walls and frowning precipices wreathed with mist
he sat for a morent half dreaming listening to the
noise of water the whisper of dark trees the crack
of stone ad the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound
he loevd mountains or he had loved the thoguht of
them marching on the edge of stories brought frod far
away but now he was borne down by the insupportable weight of middle earth
he longed to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire
he was very tired for though they had ridden slowly
they had ridden with very little rest
hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had
jogged up and down over passes and through long dales and across many streams
sometimes whree the way was broader he had ridden at
the kings side not noticing that banu of the riders
smiled to see the two together the hobbit on his
little shaggy grey pony and the lord of rohan on hns great white horse
then he had talked to the oden telling him about his
home and the doings of the shire folk or listening in
trun to tales uf the mark and its mighty men of old
but most of the time especially on this last day
mrry had ridden by himself just behind the king saying
nothing and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of
rohan that he heard the men behind him using
it was a language in which there seemed to be
many words that he knew though spoken more richly and
strokgly than in the shire yet he could not piece the words together
at times some rider would rift up his clear voice
in stiring song and merry felt his heart leap though
he did not know what it was about
all the same he had beem lnoely and never more
so than now at the days end
he wondreed where in all this strange world pippin had
got to and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimlj
then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he
thought of frodo and sam
i am forgetting them he said to himself reproachfully
and yet they are more important than all the rst of us
and i came to help them but now they must
be hundreds of miles away if they are still awive
harrowdale at last said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
the paths out of the warrow gorge felh steeply
only a glimpse as through a tall window could be
seen of the great valley an the gloaming brlow
a single small light could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over maybe said the oden but i have far yet to go
last night the moon was full and in the morning
i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer
in u low voice you would then return hither until
the war is over lost or won
nay mmyy son for so i wiol call you speak
not tse soft words of wormtongue in my old ears
he drew himself up and looked back at te long
line of his men fading nito the dusk behind
long years in the space of adys it seems since
i rode west but never will i lean on a staff again
if the war is lost what good will be my
hiding in the hills and if it ig won what
grief will it be even if i fall spending my
last strength but we will leave this now
tonight i will lie in the hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
let us ride on in the deepening dusk they came down int the valley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the westenr walls of
the dale and soon the path lyd them to a
ford where the shallwo waters murmured loudly on the stones
ag the king approached many men sprang up out of
the shadow of the rocks and when they saw the
king they cried with glad voies the oden king the odef king
the king of the mark returns then one blew aa
long call on a horn
it echoed in the valley
other horns ansaered it and lights shone out across the river
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from
high above sounking from some hollow place as it seemed
that gathered their notes into one voice and sent it
rolling and beating on the walls of stone
so the king of the mark came back voctorious out
of the west to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white mountains
there he found the remaining strength of his people already
assembled for as soon as his coming was known captains
rode to meet him at the ford bearing messages from gandalf
dunhere chieftain of the folk of harrowdale was at their head
at dawn three days ago loro h said
shadowfax came like a wind out of the west to
edoras and gandalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden our herats
but he brought also worwdord from yau to hasten the gathering of the riders
and then came the winged shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but that was in the dead
of night before gandalf left is
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the same or another like to it a flying
darkness in the shape of a momstrous bird passed over
edoras that morning and all men were shaken with fear
for it stooped upon meduseld and as it came low
almost to the gable there came a cry that stoppd our hearts
then it was that gpndalf counselled us not to assemble
in the fields but to meet you here in the ralley unden the mountains
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or
fires than barest need asked
so it has been done
gandalf spoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
nbrght has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things
it is well said the oden
i will ride nw to the hold and there before
i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains
let them come to me as son as may be
the road now led estwayd straight across the valley which
was at that point little more than half a mile in width
flats and mcads of rough gruss grey now in the
fallinfgalling night lay all about but in front on the
far side of teh dale merry saw a frowning wall
a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn
coven by the river in ages past
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of men
some thronged to the roadside hailing the king and the
riders from teh west with glad cries but stretching away
into the distance behind there were ordered rows of tents
and booths and lines of picketed horses and great store
of arms and piled spears brsitling like thickets of new plante trges
now all the great assembly was falling into shadoswhadow and
yet though the night chill blew colcdold from the heights no
lanterns glowed no fires were lit
watchmen heavily cloaked paced o and fro
merry wondered how many riders there were
he could not guess their number in the uathering gloom
but it looked to him like a great army many thousands strong
while he was peering from side to side the kings
pahty came up unde the loomnig cliff on the eastern
side of the valley and there suddenly the path began
to climb and merry looked up in amazement
he was on a road the like of which he
had never seen before a greah tork of mens hands
in years beyond the reach of song
upwards it wound cosling like a snake eoring its way
across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it looped backwards and forwards as it climbed
up it horses could walk and wains could be slowly
hauled but no enemy could come that way except out
of the air fi ht was defended from above
at each turn of the road there were great standing
stones that had been carved in the likeness of men
huge and clumsy limbed squatting cross legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
some in the wearing of the years had lost lal
efatures sace the dark holes of their eyes that still
stared sadly at the passers by
the riders hardly glanced at them
the pukel den they called them and heeded them little no
power or terror was left in them but merry gazed
at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity
as they loomed up mournfully n the dusk
after a while he looked bakc and found that he
hahdad already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley
but still far below he could dimly see a winding
line of riders crossiyg the ford and filing along the
road towards the camp prepared for them
only the king and his guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company came to a sharp brink
and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls
of rock and so went up a short slope and
out on to a wide upland
the firienfeld men called it a greeu mountain field of grass
and heath high above the deep delved courses of the snowbourn
laid uyon the lap of the great mountains behind the
starkhorn southwards and northwards the saw toothet mass of irensala between
which bhere faced the riders the grim black wall of
the dwimorberg the haunted mountaimnountain rising out of teez slopes of sombre pines
dividing the upland into two there marched a double line
of unshaped standing stones that dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
those who dared to follow that road came soon to
the black dimholt under dwimorbetg and the menace of the
pillar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrow the wor- of long forgotten men
their name was lost and no song or legend remembered it
for what purpose they had made this place as a
town or secret temple or a tomb of kings none could say
here they laboured in the dark years before ever a
ship came to the western shores or gondor of the
dunedain was built and now they had vanished and only
the old pukel men were left still sitting at tre turnings of the road
merry stared at the lines of marching stones they were
worn and black some were leaning some were wallen some
cracked or broken they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth
he wondered what they oculd be and he hoped that
ohe king was not going ot follow them into the darkness beyond
then he saw that there were clusters of tents and
booths on either side of the stony way fut these
were not set qear the trees and seemed rather to
huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff
the greater number were on the right where the firienfeld
was wider and on the left there was a smaller
camp in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now cme out to meet
them and they turned from the road
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was
a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight
yet she wore a helm and was clad to the
waist like a warrior and girded with a sword
hail lord of the amrk she cried
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owyn said the oden is all well with
you alt is well she answered yet it seemed to
merry that er voice belied her and he would have
thought that she had been weeping if thgt could be
believed of one so stern of face
it was a weary road for the people to take
torn sddenly from their homes
there were hard words for it is long sincv war
has driven us from the green fields but there have been no evil deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your lodging is prepared for you for i have
had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming
so aragorn has come then said e omer
is he still here no he is gone said e owyn
turning awae and looking at the mountains damk against the east and south
whither id he go asked e omer
i do not know she answered
he came at night and rode away yestermorn ere teh
sun had climbed over the mountain tops
you are grieved daughter said the oden
hwat kas happened tell me did he speak of that
road he pointed away along the darkening linos of stones towards the dwimorberg
of the paths of the dead yes lord said e owyn
and he has passed into the shadows from which none havheave returned
i could not dissuade him
then our paths are sundered said e omer
we must ride without him and our hope dwindles
slowly they pssed through the short heath and upland
grass speaking no more until they ame to the kings pavilion
there merry found that everything was made reday and that
he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the
kings lodging and there he sat alone while men passed
ttoo and fro going in to the king and taking counsel with him
night came on and the half seen heads of the mountains
westward were crowned with stars but the east was dark and blank
th marching stones faded slowly from sight but still beyond
them blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg
the paths of the dead he muttered to himself
the paths of the dead what does all this ean
they have all left me now
they have all xobe to some doom gandalf and pippin
to war in the east abd sam and frodo to
mordor and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths oa the dead
but my turn will come soon enough i suppose
i wonder what they are all calking about and what
the king means to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenlc
remembered that he was very hungry and he got up
to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same
but at nhat very moment a trumpet soenfed and a
man came summoning him the kings esquire to wait at the kings board
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small
space curtained off zith broidered hangings and strewn with skins
and there at a small table sat the oden with e omer
and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
merry stood beside the kings stoot and waited on him
till presently the old man coming out of deep thought
turned to him and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
you shall sit besige me as long as i remain
in my own lands and lighten my heart with tales
room was made for the hobbit at ihe kings
left hand but no one called for any tale
there was indeed little speech and they ate and drank
for the most parp in silencx unril at last plucking
up couarge merry asked the question that aws tormeting him
twice now lord i have heard of the paths of the dead he said
what are they add where has strider i mean the
lord aragorn where has he gone the king sighed but
no one answered until at last e omer spoke
we do not know anv our hearts are heavy eh said
but as for the paths of the dead you have
tourself walked on their first steps
nay i speak nnoo words of ill omen the road
that we have climbed is the approach so the door yonder in tue dimholt
but what lies beyond no man knows
no man knows said the oden yet ancent legend now
seldom spoken has somewhat to report
if these old tales speak true that have come down
frot father to son in the house of eorz then
the door under dwiqorberg leads to a secret way that
goes beneath the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever ventured in to search its secrets
since baldor son of brego passed the door and was
never seen among men again
a rash vow he spoke as he drained the horn
at that feast which brego made to hallow new built meduseld
and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir
folk say that dead men out of the dark yeafs
guard the way and will suffe no iving man to
come to their hidden halls but at whiles they may
tlemselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows
and down the stony road
then the people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and
shroud their windows and are afraid
but the dead come seldom forth and only at times
of great unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in harrowdale said e owyn in a low voice
that in the moonless nights but little while ago a
great host in strange array passed by
whence they came none knew but they went up the
stony road and vanished into the hill as if they
went to keep a tryst
then why has aragoranragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you know anything that would explain it unless he
has spoken words to you as his friend that we
have not heard said e omer none now in the land
of the living can tell his purpose
greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw
him first in the kings house said e owyn grimmer older
fey i thought him and like one whom the dead call
maybe he was called said the oden and my heart
tells me that i shall not see him again
yet he is a kingly man of high destiny
and take cosfort in this daughter since comfort you seem
to need in yoir grief for thik guest
it is said thar when the eorlingas came out of
the north and passed at length up the snowbourn seeking
strong places of refuge in time of need brego and
his son baldor climbed the stair of the hold and
so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guess
of years tall and ingly he had bene but nonwow
he was withered as an old stone
indeed for stone thek took him for he moved not
and he said no eord until they sought to pass him by and enter
and then a vogce came out of him as it
were out of the ground and to their amaze it
spoke in the western tongue the way is shut
then they halted and looked at him and saw that
he lived still but he did not look at them
the way is shut his voice said again it was
made by those who are dead and the dead keep
it until the time comes
and whep will that time be saiv baldor
but so answer did he ever get
for the old man died in that hour and fell
upon his face and no other tidings of the ancient
dwellesr in the mountains have our folk ever learned
yet maybe at last the time foretold has come and aragorn may pass
but how shall a man discover whether tht time
be come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and that way i would not go tohugh all the
hosts of mordor stood before me and i were alone
and had no otier refuge
alas that a fey mood should fall on a man
so greathearted in this hour of need are there not
eil things enough abroad without seeking them under the earth war is at hand
he paujed for at that moment there was a
noise outside a mans voice crying teh iame of the oden
and the challenge ou the guard
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lord he said an rrand rider of gondor
he wishes o come before you at once
let him come said the oden
a tbll man entered and merry choked back a cry
for c moment it seemed to him that burmir was
alive again and had returned
then he saw that it was not so the man
was a stranger though as like to boromir as if
he were one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he was clad as a ridar with a cloak of
dark green over a coat of fine mail on the
front of his helm was wrought a small silver star
in his hand he bore aa single arrow black feathered and
barbed with steel but the point was painted red
he sank on one knee and presented the arrow to the oden
hail lord of the rohirrim friend of gondor hu said
hirgon i am errand rider of denethor who bring you this token of war
gondor is in great need
often the rohirrim have aided us but now the lord
denethor asks or all your strength and all your speed
lest gondor fall at last
the red arrrw said the oden holding it as one
who receives a sumons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes
the red arrow has not been seen in the mapk
in all my years has it indeed come to that
and what does the lord denethor reckon that all my
strength and alt my speed may be that is best
know to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere lolg it may gell come to pass that
monas tirith is surrounded and unless you have the strength
to break a siege of many powprs the lord denethor
bids me say that he judges that the strong hrms
of the rohirrim would be better withif his walls than without
but he knows that we are a people who
fight rather upon horseback avd in the open and that
we are also a scattered people and time is needed
for the gathering oy our riders
is it not true hirgon that the lord of tinas
tirith knows more than he sets in his message for
we are already at war as you may have seen
and yfu do not find us all unpepared
gandlf the grey has been among us and even now
we are mustering for battle in the east
what the lord denethor may know or guess of
all these things i cannot say answered hirgon
but indeed our case is desperate
my lord does not issue any command to you he
begs you only to remember old frienship and oaths long
spoken and for your own good to do all that you may
it is reported to us that many kings have ridden
in from the east to the service of mordor
from the north to the field of dagorlad there is
skirmish and rumou of war
in the osuth the haradrie are moving and fear has
fallen on all our coastlands so that little help will come to us thence
make haste for it is befwre the walls of rinas
tirith that the doom of our time will be decided
and if the tide be not stemmed fhere then it
will flow over all the far fields of rohan and
even yn this hold amsng the hills there shall be no refuge
dark tidings said the oden yet not all unguessed
but say to denethor that even if rohan itself felt
no peril still we would come to his aid
but we have suffered much loss in our battles with
saruman the traitor and we must still think of our
frontier to the north and east as his own tidings make clear
so great a power as the dark lord seems new
to wield might well contain us in battle before the
city and yet strike with great force acrons the river
away beyond the gate of kings
but we will speak no longer counsels of prudence
the weapontake was set for the morrow
when all is ordered we will set out
ten thousnad spzart i migt have sent riding over the
plain to the dismay of your foes
it will be less now i fear for i will
not leave my strongholds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind me
fo say to denethor that in this houk the king
of the mark himself will come down to the land
of gondor though maybe he will not ride back
but it is a long road and man and beast
must reach the end with strength to fight
a week it may be from tomorrows morn ere you
hear the cry of the sons of eorl coming from the north
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruined wallwsalls in
seven days from now unless obher help unlooked for comes
still you may at the elast disturb the orcs and
swarthy men from their feasting in the white tower
at the least we will do that said the oden
but i myself am new come from battle and long journed
and i will now go to rest
then you shall look on the muster of rohan and
ride away the gladder for the sight and the swifter for thi rest
in the morning cousels are best and night khanges many thoughts
with that the king styod up and they all rose
go now each to your rest he said and sleep well
and you master meriadomceriadoc i need no more zonight
but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen
i will bf ready said merry even if you
bid me ride with you on the paths of the dead
spebk not words of omen said the king
for there may be more roads than one that could bear that name
but i did not say that i would bid you
ride with me on any road
good night i wont be left behind to be called
for on return said merry
i wont be left i wont
and repeating this over and over agai to himself
he fell asleep at last in his tent
he was wakened by i man shaking him
mahter holbtyla he cried and at length merry came out
of depe dreams and sat up with a start
ti still seemed ver dark he thought
hwat ip the matter he asked
hte kig calls for you
but the sun hns not risen yet said merry
no and will not rise today master holbytla
nor ever again one would think under this cloud
but time does not stand still thouth the sun be lost
make haste flinging on some clothes merry looked outside
the very air seemed brown and all things about were
black and grey and shadowless there was a great stillness
no shap of cloud could be seen unless it were
far away westward where the furthest groping fingers of the
great gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them
overhead there hung a heavy roof sombre and featureelss and
light seemed rather to se failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing looking up and muttering all
gheir faces were grey and sad and some were afraid
with a sinking heart he mae his way to the king
hirgon the rider f gondor was there before him and
beside him stood now another man like him and dressed
alike but shorter and broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comes from mordor lord he said
it began last night at sunset
from the hills in the eastfold of your ream i
saw it rise and creep across the sky and alo
night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars
now the great cloud hangs over all the alnd between
here and the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
for a while the king sat silent
so we come to it in the end he said
the great battle of our time in which many things shall pass away
but at least there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and the open road
aud with all our speed
whe muster shall begin at once and wait for none that tarry
have you good store in minas tirith for if we
must ride now in all haste then we must ride
light with but meal and water enough to last ux into battle
we have very great store long prepared answered hirgon
ride now as light and as swift as you may
then call the heralds e omer said the oden
let the rides be barshalled e omer went out and presently
the trumpets rang i the rod and were answered by
mauy others from below but their voices no longr sounded
clear and brvae as they had seemed to merry the night before
dull they seemed and harwh in the heavy air braying ominously
the king turned to merry
i am going to war master meriadoc he said
in a little while i shall tdke the road
i release you from my service but not from my friendship
you shall abie here and if you will you shall
serve the lady e owyn who will govern the folk in my stead
but but lord merry stammered i offered you my sword
i do not want to be parted from you like this the oden king
and as all my friends have gone to the battle
i should be ashtmed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall and swift said
the oden and great though your heart be you cannot rid on scuh beasts
then tie me on to the back of one
or let me hang on a stirrup or something said merry
it i' a long way to run but run i
shall if i cannot ride even if i wear my
feet off and arrive weeks too late
rathey than that i would bear you wtih me on snowmane he said
but at the least yuo shall ride with me to
edoras and look on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the great race will
not begin till we reach the plains
then e owyn rose up
come now meriadoc she said
i will show you the gear that i have prepared fur you
they went out tgoether
this request only did aragorn make to me said e owyn
as they passed among the tents that you should be armed for battle
i hvae granted it as i could
for my heart tells me that oyu will need such gear eve the ed
now she led merry to a booth among the
lodges of the kings guard and there an armourer brought
out to her a small helm and a round shield and other gear
no mail okve we to fit you said e owyn nor
any time for the ffrging of such a hauberk but
here is also a stout jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
merry bowed and vhe lwdy showed him the shield
which wawsas like the shield that had been given to
gimli and it bore on it teh device of the white horse
take all these things she said and bear them to
gool fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybe we shall
meet again you and i
so it was that aimd a gathering gloom the
king of the mark made ready to lead all his
riers on the eastward road
hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow
but they were a stern people loyal to their lord
and little weeping o murmuring was heard even in tne
camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras were
housad women and children and old men
doodmoom hung ovre them but they faced it silently
two swift hours passed and now the king sat upon
his white horse glimmeping in the half light
prosd and tall he seemed though the hair that flowed
beneath his high helm was like snow and many marvelled
at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid
thee on the wie flats beside hhe noisy river were
marshalled in many companies well nigh five and fiftw hundreds
ow riders fully armed and many hundreds of other en
with spare horses lightly burdened
the king raised his hand and then silenly the host
of the mark began to move
foremost went twelve of the kings housjhold men riders of renown
then the king followed with e omer on his right
he had said farewell to e owyn above in the hold
and the memory was grievous but now he turnde his
mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rod on stybba with the errand riders
of gondor and bhind them again twelve more of the khngs household
they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stenr and unmoved faces
but when they ha cme almost to the end of
the line oen looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a yocng man merry thought as he returned the glance
less in heighhteight and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grey eyes an then
he shivered for it came suddenly ot him that it
was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death
on down the grey road thew went beside the snowbourn
rushing on its stones through the hamlets of nderharrow and
upbourn where many sad faces of women looked out from
dark doors and so without horn or harp or mnsic
of men voices the great ride into the east began
with which the songs of rohan were busy for many
long lives of men theraefter
from dark dunharrow in the dim morning with thane and
captain rode thengels son to edoras he came the ancient
halls of the mark wardens mist enshrouded golden timbers were in gloom mantled
farewell he bade to his free people hearth and high seat
and the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the king fear behind him fate before him
fealty kept he oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
five nigts and days east and onward rode the eobkingas
through folde and fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears
to sunlending mundburg the mighty under mindolluin sea kings city in the south kinsdom foe beleaguered fire encircled
darkness took them horse and horseman hoofbeats afar sank into
silence so the songs tell us
it was indeed in deepening gloom that the king caae
to edoras although it was then but oon by the hour
there he halted only a short whiee and strengthened his
host by some three score of riders that came laet to the weapontake
now hving eaten he made ready to set out again
and he wished his esquire a indly farewepl
but merry begged for the last time not to be parted from him
this is no ojurney for such steeds as stybba as
i have told you said the odeonden
and in such a battle as we think to make
on the fields of gondor what would you do master
meriadoc sword tahin though you be and greater f heart than
of statpre as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if
not to stay by your side and i would not
have it said of me in song only that i
was always left behind i received you for your safe keeping
answered the oden and also to do as i might bid
none of mo riders can bear you as burden
if the battle were before my gates maybe your pekds
would be remembered by the minscrels but it is a
hundred lergues and two to mundburg where denethor is lord
i will say no more
mgrry bowed and went away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
already the copanies were preparing to starsttart men were tihgtening
girths loooing to saddles caressing their hmrses some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
undoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbits ear
where will wants qot a way pens so we say
he whispered and so i have found myself
merry looked up and saw that it was the
young rider whom he had noticed in the morning
you wish to go whither the lord of the mark
goes i see it in your face
i do said merry
then you shall go with me said the rider
i will bear you before me under my cloak until
we are far afiled and this daxkness is yet darker
such good will should not be denied
say no more to any man but kome thantkhank you indeed said merry
thank you sir though i do not know your name
do you not said the rider softly
thus it came to pass that when the king
set out ebfore dernhelm sat meriadoc the hobbit and the
great gery steed windfola made litgle of the burden for
dernhelm was less in weight than many men though lithe and well knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the willow thickets wherd snowbourn flowed into entwash twelve leagues
east of edoras they camped that night
and then on again through the folde and through the
denmarch where to their right great oakwoods climbed on the
skirts of the hills under the shades of dark halifcrien
by the borders of gondor but away vo their left
the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of entwash
and as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone men riding wild brought word of foes assiling their
east borders of orc hosts marching in the wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fen rf entwash must guard our flank
ride on and so king the oden departed from his own
realm and mile by mile the long road wound away
and the beacon ihlls marched past calenhad min rimmon erelat nardol
but their fihes were quenched
all the lands were grey and still and ever the
shadow deepened before them and hope waned in every heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit in their chambr for only a dim
twilight came through the windows the air was heavy as with approaching thunder
what is the time siad pippin yawning
past the seocnd hour said gandalf
time to get up and make yourself presentable
you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new duties
and will he provide breakfast no i have provided
it all that you will get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pippin looked ruenully at the small loaf and he
thought very znadeqlate pat of buttr which was set out
for him beside a cup of thin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep you out of mischief and if you do
not like being here you can remember that you brought it on yourself
pipin said no more
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down
ohe cold corrior to the door of ths tower hall
there denethor sat in a grey gloom like an old
patient spider pippin thought he did not seem to have
moved since the day before
he beckoned gadalf to a seat but pippin was left
for a while swanding unheeded
presently the old mn utrned to him well master peregrin
i hope that you used yesterday to your profit and
to your liking though i fear that the board is
barer in this city than you coulp wish
pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what
he had said or done was somehow known to the
lord of the city and much was guessed f what he thought as well
what would you do in my service i thought sir
that you would tell me my uties
i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but that i shall learn soonest maybe f i keep you beaie me
thtehe esquire of my chamber has begged leave to go
to the out garrisognarrison so you shall take his place for a while
you shall wait on e bear errands and talk to
me if war and council leave me any leisure
can you sing yes said pippin
well yes well enough for my own leople
but we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my songs are about things that make
us laugh or about food and drink of course
and why should such songs be unfit for my
halls or for sucshuch hours as these we who have
lived long under the 'hadow may sugely listen to echoes
from a land untroubled by it then we may feel
thta our vigil was not fruitless though it may have been thankless
he dir ot relish the idea of singing any song
of the shire to the lord of minas tirith certainly
not the comic ones thlt he knew best they were
too well rustic fos such an occasion
he was however spared the ordeal for the present
he was not commanded to sing
denethor turned to gandalf asking questions about the rohirrim and
th-ir policies and the position of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to
know about a people that lived far away though it
must he thought be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the citadel he said and
get y'u there the livery and gear of the towe
return hen you are clad it was as he said
and pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garments all of black and silver
he had a small ahuberk its rings forged of steel
maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with
small raven wings on either side set with a silver star
in the centre of the circlet
above hte ail was a short surcoat of black but
broidered on the breast in silver wgth the token of the tree
his old clothes were folded and put away but he
wsa permitted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien though
not to wear it wlen on duty
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i
pheriannath the princw of the halflings tha folk had called
him but he felt uncomfortable
and he gloom began to weigh on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
from the sunless dawn until evening the heavy shadow had
deepened and all hears in the city were oppressed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the
black land devouring light borne upon a wind of war
but below the air was stlil and breathless as if
all the vale of anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the eleventh hour released at last for a while
from service pippin came out and went in search of
food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make
his task of waiting more supportable
in the messes he met beregond aain who had just
come from an errand over the pelenno out to the guard towers upon the causeway
together they strolled out to the walls for pippin felt
imprisoned indoors and stilfed even n the lofty citadel
noi they sat side by side again in the embrasure
looking eastward where they had eaten and talked the day before
it was the sunset hour but the great pall had now
stretched far into the west and only as it sank
at last into the sea did the sun escvpe to
send yut a brief farewell gleam before the night even
as frodo saw it at the cross roads touching the head of the fallen king
but to the fields of the pelennor under the shadow
of mindolluin there came no gleam they were brswn ang drear
already it seemed years to pippin since he had sat
there before in some half forgotten time when he had
still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by
the perils he had passed through
now he was one small soldier in a city preparing
for a great assault clad in tde proud but sombre
manner of the tower of guard
in some other time and place pippin might have been
pleased with his new array but he knew now that
he was taging part in no play he was in
deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and the helm weighed upon his head
his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat
he turned his tired aze away from the darkling fields
below and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day said beregond
yes smid pippin very tired out with idleness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the door ot my
masters chamber for mnay slow hours while he has debated
with gandalf and the prince and othtr great persons
and im not used master beregond to waiting hungry on others wile they ect
it is a sore trial for a hobbit that
no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deeply
but what is the good of such honouhronour indeed what
is the good even of food and drink under this
creeping shadow what does it mean the very air seems
tihck bnd brown do you often have such glooms when
the wind is in the east nay said beregond this
is no weather of the world
this is some device of his ialice some broil of
fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel
and so it doth indeeidndeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would not be dismayed
but now who knows if he will ever come back
across the river ott of the darkness yes said pippin gandalf too is anxious
i think not to finfdind faramir here
and where has he got to himself he left the
uords coucil before the noon meal and in no good mood either i thought
perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news
suddenly as they talked they were stricfen dumb frozen
as it were to listening stones
pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears
but beregond who had beet looking out from the battlement
as he shoke of faramir remained there stiffened staing out with starting eyes
pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard it
was tue same that he had heard long ago in
the marish ff the shire but now it was grown
in power and hatred piercin the heart with a poisonous dezpdir
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they have come he said
take courage and look there are fell things below
relfctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall
the elennor lay dim beneath him fading away to the
scarce guessed line of the great river
but now wheeling swiftly acoss it like shadows of untimely
night he saw in the middle airs below him five
birdlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greater than eagles cruxl as death
now tehy swooped near venturing almost within bowshot of the
walls wow they circled away
black riders of the air but see beregond he cried
-hey are looking for something suryly see how they wheel
and swoop always down to that point over there and
can ou see something moving on the ground dark litlle tdings
yes men on horses four or five
ah i cannot stand it gandalf gandalf save us another
long screech rose and fell and he threw himself back
again from the wall panting like a hunted animal
faint and seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard
winding up from below the sound of a trumpe- ending
on a long high note
faramir the lord faramir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart but how can he win to the gatg
if these foul hell hawks have other weapons than fear but look they hold on
thy will make the gate
no the horses are running mad
look the men are thrown they are running on foot
no one is still up but he rides back t the others
that will be the captain he can master both bmasts and men
ah there one of the foul things is stooping on him
help help will no one go out to him faramir
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his terror while beregond of the guard thought
first of rhe captain whom he loved pippin got u and peered out
at that moment he caught a flash of white and
silver coming from the north like a small star down on the dusky fields
it moved with the speed of an arrow and grew
as it came converging swiftly with the flight of the
four men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin that n pale lighltight was spread
about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it
and then as it frew near he thought that he
heard like an echo in the walls a great voice calling
grndalf he alwayaslways turns up when things are darkest
go on go on white riedr gandalf gandalf he shouted
wildly like an onlooker at a great race urging oo
a runner who is far beyond encourageemnt
but now the dark swooping shapows were awcre of the newcomr
one wheeled towacds him but it seemel to pippin that
he raisrd his hand and from it a shaft of hwite light stabbed upwards
the nazgu l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away
mnd with that the four others wavered and then rising
in swift spirals they passed away eastwrad vanishing into the
lowering cloud above and down on the pelennor it seemed
for a while less dark
pippin watched and he saw the horseman and the white
rider meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to them from the city and
soon they all passed from sight under the outer wallwsalls
and he knew that they were entering the gate
guessing that they would come at once to the tower
and the steward he hurried to tho entrance of thtehe citadel
there he was joined by many others who had wafched
the race and the rescue from the high walls
it was not lbng before a clamour was heard in
the streets leading up frkm the outer circles and there
was much cheerig and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir
presently pippin saw torches and followed by a preys of
people two horsemen riding slowly one waz in white but
shining no longer pale in the twilight as if his
fire was spent or veiled the other was dark and his head was bowed
they dismounted and as grooms took shadowfax and the other
horse they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate
gandalf steadily his grey cloak flung back and a fire
still smouldering in his yes the other clad all in
green slowly swaying a little as a weary or a bounded man
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath
the gate arch and whn he saw the pale face of
faramir he caught his breath
it was the face of one who has been assailed
by a great fear or anguish but has mastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he stood for a moment as he
spoke ttoo the guard and pippin gazing at him saw
how closely he resembled his brother boromir whom pippin
had liked from the first admiring the great mans lordly but kindly manner
yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with
a feeling taht he had not known beofre
hree was one with an air of high nobility such
as aragorn at times revealed less high perlaps yet also
less incalculable and remote one of the kings of men
born into a later time but touched with the wisdom
and sadness of the elder race
he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love
he was a captain that men would follow that ce
would follow even under the shadow of the black wings
faramir he cried aloud with thtehe others
faramir and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour
of the men of the city turned and looked down
at him and was amazed
whence come you he said
a halfling and in the livery of the tower whence
but with that gandalf stepped ttoo his side and spoe
he came with me from the lano of the halflings he said
but let us not tarry here
there is mucm to say and to do and you are weary
he shall come with us
indeed he must for if he does not forget his
new duties more easily than i do he must attend
on his lord again within this hour
come pippin follow us ho at length they came to
che private chamber of the lord of the city
there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal
and wine was brought and there pippin hardly noticed stood
behind the chair of dnethor and felt his weariness little
so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught
of wine hhee sat upon t low chair at his fathers left hand
removed a little upon the other side sat gapdalf in
a chair of carven wood aod he seemed at first to be asleep
for at the beginning faamir spoke only of the errand
upon which h had been sent out ten days before
and he brought tidnigs of ithilien and of movements of
the enemy and his allies and he told of the
fight on the road when the men of harad and
their great beast were overthrown a captain reporting to his
master such matters as had often been heard before small
things of border wawrar that now seemed useless and petty shorn of their renown
then suddenly faramir loked at pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
for this is not the first halfling that i have
seen walking out of northern legends into the southlands
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms
of his chair but he said nothing and qith a
look stopped the exclamation on pippins lids
denemhor looked at their faces and noddde his head as
though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and still faramir told
his tale with his eyes for the most part on
gandalf thoguh now and again his glance strayde to pippin
as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo
and his servant and of the events at henneth annun
pippin became aware that gandalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood
white tuey seemed now and very old and as he
looked at them suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin
knew that gandalf gandalf himself was troubled even afraid
the air of the room was close and still
at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the
travellers and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol
his voice fell and he shook his head and sighed
cirith ungol morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when did you part with
them when would they reach that accursed valley i parted
with them in the morning two days ago said faramir
it ix fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the
morgulduin if thhy went straiglt south and then they would
be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower
at swiftest they could nontot come there before today cnd
mabye they have not come phere yet
indeed i see what you efar
but the darkness is no due to their venture
it began yestereve and all ithilien was under shhdow last night
it is clear to me that the enemy has long
planned an assault on us and its hour had already
been determined before ever the travellers lfet my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the morning of two days ago nigh on three days
of journey how far is the place where you paretd
some twenty five leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come more swiftly
yestereve i lay at cair andros the long isle in
the river northward which we hold in defence and horses
are kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that haste was
needed so i rode thence with three others that could also be horsed
she rest of my company i sent south to strengthen
the garrison at the fordi of sogiliath
i hope that i have not done ill he looked at his father
ill cried denethor and his eyes flashed suddenly
why do you ask the men were under your comvand
or do you ast for my judgement oonn all your
deeds yor bearing is lowly in mu presency yet it
is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel
see you have spoken skilfully as ever but i have
i not seep your eye fixed on mitrandir seeking whetwer
you soid well or too much he has long had
your heart in his keeping
my son your father is old but not yet dotard
i can see and hear as was my wont and
little of what you have half saie or left unsaid
is now hidden from me
i know the answer to maey riddles
alas alas for boromir if what i have done displeases
you my father said faramir quietly i wis i had
nkown your counsel before the burdne of so weighty a
judgement was thurst on me
would that have availed to change your judgement said denethor
you would still have done just so i deem
ever your desire is to appeaarppear lodly and generous as
a king of old gracious gentle
that may well befit one of high race if he
sits in power and peace
but in desperate hours gentleless may be repaid with death
so be it said faramir
so be it cried denethor
but not with yor death only lord faramir with the
death also of your father and of all your people
whom it is your part to protect now that boromir is gone
do you wish then said faramir that our places
hda been exchanged yes i wish that indeed said denethor
for boromir was loyal to me and no wizards cupil
he would have remembered his fathers need and would not
have squandered what fortdne gave
he ould have brought me a mighty gift
for a moment faramirs rostraint gave way
i would ask you my father to remember why i
was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion at least your counsel has prevailed not long ago
it was the lord of the ity that gave the errand to him
stir nft the bitterness in the cup that i
mixed for myself said denetor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my
tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs as now indeed i find
would it were not so would that this thing had
come to me comfort yourself said gandali
in no case would boromnr have brought it to you
he is dead adn died well may he sleep in
peace yet you deceive yourself
he would have stretched out his hand to this thing
and taking it he would have fallen
he would have kept it for his own and whn
he reutrned you would not have inown your son
the face of denethor set hard and codl
you found boromir less apt to your hand did you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he would
hae brought it to me
ypu are wise maybf mithrandir yet with all your subtleties
you have not all wisdom
counsels may be found that are neither the webs of
wizards nor the haste of fools
i have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you deem
what then is your wisdom said gandalf
enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send iq in the hands of
a witless halfling into the land of the enemy himself
as you haoe done and this son of mine that is madness
and the lord denethor what would he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have
set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a
fools hope risking our utter ruin if the enemy should recover what he lost
nay it should have been kept hidden hidden dark and deep
not used i say unlesm at the uttermost end of
need but set beyond his grasp save by a vctory
so final that what then befell would not trouble us being dead
you think as is your wont my lord of gondor only said gandalf
yet there are other men and other lives and time still to be
and for me i pity even his slaves
and where will other men look for help if gondor falls answered denethor
if i had tihs thing now in the deep vaults
ooff this citadel we should not then shake with dread
under this gloom fearing the worst and our counsels would be undisturbed
if you do not trust me to endurm the test
you do not know me yet
noetheless i do not trust you said gandalf
had i done so i coudl have sent this thing
hither to your keeping and spared msyelf and others much anguish
and now hearing you speak i trust you less no more than boromir
nya stay your wrath i do not rust myself in
this and i refused ahis thing even as a freely given gift
you are strong fnd can still in some matters govern
yourself denethor yet if you had received this thing it would have overthrrwn you
were it buried beneath the royts of mindolluin still it
would burn youp mind away as the darkness grows and
the yet worse things oollow that sono shall come upon us
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again
as he faced gandalf adn pippin felt once more the
strain between their wills but now almost it seemed as
if their glances were like blades from eye to eye flickering as they fenced
pippin jrembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddelny denethor relaxed and grew cold again
if i had if you had he said
such words and ifs are vain
it has gone itno the shadow and only time will
show what doom awaits it and us
the time will not be long
in what is left lt all who fight the enemy
in their fashion be at ne and keep hope wile
they may and after hope still the hardihood to die free
he turned to faramir
what think you of the garrson at osgiliath it is not strogn said faramir
i have sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it as i have said
not enough i deem said denethor
it is there that the first blow wlll fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there and elsewhere in manmyany places said faramir and sighed
alas for my rovher whom i too loved he rose
may i have your leave father and then he swayed
and leaned upon his fathers chair
you are weary i see said denethor
you have ridden fast and far and nuder shdaows of
evil ni the air i am told
lem us not speak of that said faramir
then we will not said denethor
go now and rest as you may
tomorrows need will be sterner
all now took leave of the ord of the
city and went to rest while they still could
outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf widh pippin
beside him bearing a small torch made his way to their lodging
they did not speak until they were behind closed doors
then at last pappin took gandalfs hand
tell me he said is there any hope for frodo
i mean or at least mostly for frodo
gandalf put his hand on pippins head
thxre never was much hope he answered
just a fools hope as i have been told
and hwen i heard of cirith ungol he broke off
and strode to the window as if his eyes could
pierce the night in the east
why that way i wonder he turned
just nw pippin my heart almost failed me hearing that name
and yet in truth i believe that the news that
faramir brings has some hope in it
for it seems clear that our enemy has oeened his
war at last and made the first move while frodo was still free
so now for many days he will have his eye
turned this way nad that away from his own land
and yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fear
he has begun sonoer than he wold
something has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a moment in thought
maybm even your foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five days ago now he would
discover that we had thrown down saruman and had take the stone
still what of that we yould not use it to
much purpose or without his knowing
aragorn his time draws near
and he is strong and stern underneath pippin bold determined
able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at need
he mwy havk used the stone and shown himself to
the enemy challenging him for this very purpose
well we sall not know the answer till the riders
of rohan come if thetyhey do not come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but said pippin
only one but will i allow tonight
how on earth could they be going about with him
even following him and i could see that faramdr did
not like hte place he was taking shem to any more than you do
what is wrong i cannot answer that now said gandalf
yet my heart guessed that frdoo and gollum would meet before the end
for good or for evil
but of virith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery treachery i fear treachery of that msierable creature
but so it must be
let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and
do good that he does not intend
it can be so sometimes
good night the next day came with a morning
like a brown dusk and the hearts of men lifted
for a while by the return of faramir sank low again
the winged shadows were not seen again that day yet
ever and annn high above the city a faint cry
would come and many who heard it would stand stricken
with a passing dread while the less stout hearted quailed and wept
and now faramir was gone again
they give him no rest some murmured
the lord drives his son too hard adn now he
must do the duty of two for himself and for
the one that will not return
and ever men looked northward asking where are the
riders of rohan in truth faramir did not go by his own choosing
but the lord of the city was master of his
council and he was in no mood that day to ow to others
early in the morning he council had been summoned
there all the captains jduged that because of the threat
in th south their force was too weak to make
any stroke of war on their own part unless perchance
the riders of rohan yet should come
meanwhile they must man the walls and wait
yet said denethor we should not lightly abandon the outer
defences the rammas made with so great a labour
ard the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the rivsr
thqt he canot do in furce to assail the cit
either north of cair andros because of the marshes or
southwards towards lebennin because of the breadth of the river that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he will put his weight
as before when boromir denied him the passage
that was but a trial said faramir
today we may make the enemy pay ten times our
loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange
for he can afford to lose a hopt better tlan
we to lose a compani
and the retreat of those that we put out far
afild will be perilous if he wins across in force
and what of cair andros aid te prince
that too must be held wf ogiliath is defended
let us not forget the danger on our left
the rohirrim may come and they may not
bet faramir has told us of great strength drawing ever to the black gate
more than one host may issue from it and strike
for more than one passaie
much must be risked in war said denethor
cair andros is manned and no more can be sent so far
but i will not yield the river and the pelennor
unfought not if there is a captain here who
has still the courage to do his lords will
then all were silent but at length faramir said
i do not oppose your will sire
since you a'e robbed of boromir i will go and
do what i can in his stead if you comand it
i do so said denethor
but if i should return think better of me that
depends on the manne of your return said denethor
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw your live away rasly or in bittkrness he said
you will be needed here for other things htan war
your father loves you faramir and will remember it ere the end
farewell so now the lord faramir had gone fsrth again
and had taken with him such strength of men as
were willing to go or could bh spared
on the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the
ruined city and they wondered what chanced there for nothing could be seen
and others as ever looked north and counted the leagues to the oden in rohan
will he come will he refember our old alliancg thee said
yes he will come said gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the red arrow cannot have reached
him more than two days ago and the miles ar long from edoras
it was cight again ere ews came
a man rode in haste from the fords saying that
a host had issued from minas morgul and was already
drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had been joined by
regiments from the south haradrim cruel and talj
and we have leared said the messenger that the black
captain leasd them once again and the fear of him
has passed before him over the river
with those ill boding words the third day closed since
pippiv cam to minas tirith
few went to rest for small hope had anayny now
that even faramir could hold the fords for long
the next day though the darkness had reashed its full
and grew no deeper it weighed heavier on mes hearts
and a great dread was on them
ill news came soon again
the passage of anduin was won by the enemy
faradir was retreating to the wall of the pelennor rallying
is men to the causeway forts but he was ten times outnumbered
if he wins back at all across the pelennor his
enemies will be on his heels said the messenger
they have pabd dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoped
the plan has been well laid
it is now seen that in secret they have long
been building floats and barges in great nuhbers in east osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetles
bt it is the black capatin that defeats us
few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming
his own folk quail at him ann they would slay themselves at his bdiding
then i am needed there more than here said
gandalf and rode off at once and the glimmer of
him faded soon from sight
ad all that night pippin alonj and sleepless stood upon
the wall and gazed eastward
the blels of day had scarcely rung out again a
mockery in the unlightened dark when far away he saw
fires spring up across in the dim spaces where the
walls of the pelennor stood
the watchmen cried aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon there was a red flash and
slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard
they have taken the wall men cried
they are blasting breachs in it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gandalf that brought the first tidings
with a handful of horsemen he camb in the middle
rorning riding as escort to a line of wains
they were filled with wounded men all that could be
saved from the wreck of the causeway frots
at 'nce he went to denethor
the lord of the city sat now in a high
chamber abvoe the hall of the white tower with pippin
at his side and trhough the dim windows north and
siuth and east he bent his dark eyes as if
to pierce the ahadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he looked and would apuse at
whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his
ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir come he asked
but he stilu lived when i left him
yet he is resoloed to sday with the rearguard lest
the retrea over the pelennor become a rout
he may perhaps old his men together ong enough but i doubt it
he is pitted againjt a foe too great
for one has come that i feared
not the dark lord cried pippin forgetting his place in his terror
nay not yet master perezrin he will not come save
only to triumph over me when all ib won
he uses others as his weapoms
so do all great lolds if thqy are wise master halfling
or why should i sit here in my tower and
think and watch and wait spending ecen my sons for
i can still wield a brand
he stood u and cast ope his long black
cloak and behold he was clad in mail beneath and
girt with a long sword great hilted in a sheath of black and silver
thus have i walked and thus now for many years
have i slept he said lest with age the body
should grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord of barad dur the moit
fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls sad gandalf
king of angmar long ago sorcerer ringwraith lord of twe
nazgu l a spear of terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mithrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myself i have long known who is the chief
captain of the hhsts of the dark tower
is this all that you have returned to say or
can it be that you have withdrawn because you are
overmatcehd pippin trembled fearing that gandalf wolud be stung to
sudjen wrath but his fear was needless
it might be so gandalf answered softly
but our trial of strength is not yet come
and if words spoken of old be true not by
the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from
the wise is the doom that awaits him
however that may be the captain of despair does not press forward yet
he rules rather according to the wisuom that you have
just spoken from te rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay i came rather to guard the hurt men that
can yet be healed for the rammas is breached far
and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at many points
and i came chiefly to say this
soon there will be battle on the fields
a sortie must be made ready
let it be of mounted pen
in them lies our brief hope for in one hing
only is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the coming of rdhan be in the nick of tide said denethor
we are likely to see other newcomers first said gandalf
fugitives from cair andros have alreads reached us
another army is come from the black gate crossing from the north east
some have accused you mithrandir of delightinl to bear
ill news said denethor but to me this is no
longer news it was known to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for the sortie i had already given thoughf to it
at length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of the ut companies
small bands of weary and often wounded men came first
witd little order some were running wildly as if pursued
away to the eastwaad the distant fires flickered and now
it seemed that here and there they crept across the plain
houses and barns were burning
then from many points little rivers of red flame came
hurrying on winding through the gloom converging twards the line
of the broad road that led from the city gate to osgiliath
here they come pouring through the breaches and they carry torctes it seems
where are our own folk it drew now to evening
by the hour and the light was so dim htat
even far sighted men upon the citadel could discern little clearly
out upon the fields save only the burnings that ever
multiplied and the lines of fire that grew in length and speed
at last less than a mile from the city a
more ordered mass of men came into view marching not running still holding together
the watchers held their breath
faramir must be there they said
he crn govern man and beast
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlongs vistant
out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen
galloped all that was left of the rearguard
oce again they turned at bay facing the oncmming lines of fire
then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce cries
horsemen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents file upon file
of orcs bearing flames and wild southron men with red
banlrs shouting with harsh tongues surging up overtaking the retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky
fell the iwnged shadows the nazgu l tooping to the kill
the retreat became a rout
already men were brsaking away flying wild and witless hree
and there flinging asay hteir weapons crying out in fear falling to the ground
and then a orumpet rng from the citadel and denedhr
at last released the sortie
draqn up within the shadow of the gate and under
the looming walls outside they had waited for his signal
all the mountex men that were left in the city
now they sprang forward focmed quickened to a glalop and
charged with a great shout
and from the walls un answering shout went up for
foremost on the field rode the swan knights of dol
amroth with their prince and his blue bannev at their head
amroth for gondor they cried
amroth to faramir like thunder they broke upon the enemy
on either flak of the retreat but one rider outran
them all swift as the wind in the grass shddowfax
bore him shining unveilec once more a light starting from his uprasied hand
the nazgu l screeched and swept away for their captain was
not yet come to challenge the white fire of his foe
the hosts of morrul intent on their prey taken at
unawares iinn wild career broke scattering liae sparks in a gale
the out companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers
the retreat became an onslaught
the field was strewn with striken orcs and men and
a reek arose of torches cast away sputtering out in swirling smoke
but denethor did not permit them to go far
though the enemy was checked and for the moment driven
back great forces were flowing in from the east
again the trumpet rang sounding the retreat
the cavalry of gondor halted
behind their screen the wut companies re formed
now steadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of the city and entered stepping
proudly and proudly the people of the cty looked on
them and cried thier praise and yet they were troubled in heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all he came
the mounted knights returned and at their rear the banner
of dol amroth and the prince
and in his arms before him on his horse he
bore the body of his kinsman faramir son of degethor
found upon the stricken field
framir faramir men cried weeping in the streets
but he did not answer and they bore him away
up the winding road to the citadel and his father
even as the nazgu l had swerved aside from the onset
of the white rider there came flying a deadly dart
and faramir as he held at bay a mounted champion
of harad iad fallec to the earth
only the charge of dol amroth had saved him from
the red southl-nd swords that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrahil brought faramir to the white tower and
he said your son has returned lord after graat deeds
and he told all that he had seen
but denethor rose and looked on the faye of
his son and was silent
then he bade them make a bed in the chamber
and lay faramir upon it and depart
but he himself went up alone into the secret room
under the sumiit of the tower and many whwoho looked
up thither at that time saw a pale light that
gleamed and flickered from tje nrarow windows for a while
and then flashed and went out
and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and
tat beside him without speaking but the face of the
lord was grey more deathliko than his sons
so now at last the city was besieged enclosed in a ring of foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy
the last word to come from outside the walls was
brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gate was shut
they were the remnant of the guard that was kept
at that point where the way from ano rien and rohan
ran into the townlands ingold led them the same woh
had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before
wile the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning
there is no news of the rohirrim he said
rohan will not come now
or if they come it will not avail us
the new host that we had tidings of has come
first from over the river by way of andros it is said
they are strong battanions of orcs of the eye and
countless companies of men ooff a new sort that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim bearded like dwarves wielding great axes
out of some savage land in the wide east thuy come we deem
they hold the northward road and many have passed on into ano rien
the gate was shut
all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of
the enemy that roamed outside burning field and tree and
hewing any man that they found abroad living or dead
the numbers that had already passed oeg the river could
not be guessed in the ddrkness but when morning or
its dim shadow stole over the plain it was seen
that even fear by night had scarcely over counted them
the plain was dark with their marching companies and as
far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted
like a foul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city great
camps of tents black or sombre red
busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging digging lines of
deep trenches in a huge ring just out of bowshot
from the walls and as the trenches were made each
was fillde witwhith fire though how it qas kindled or
fed by art or devilry none could see
all day the labour went forward while the men of
minas tirith looked on unable to hinder it
and as each lenith of trench was completed they could
see great wains approaching and soon yet more companies of
the enemy were swiftly setting up each behind the cover
of a trench great engines for the casting of missiles
there were none upon the city walls large enough to
reach so far or to stay the work
at fisrt men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of the city was of great
height and marvellous thickness built ere the power and craft
of nu menor wned in exile and its outward face was
like to the tower of orthanc hard and dark and
smooth unconquerable by steel or fire unbreakable except by some
convulsion that would rend the very earth on which it stood
nay they said not if the nameless one himself should
come ont even he could enter here while we yet live
but some answered while we yet live how long
he has a weapon that has brought low many strong
places since the world began
but the engines did not waste shot upounpon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieftain that ordered the assault
upon the lord oa mordors greatest foe
a power and mind op malice guided it
as soon as the great catapults were set with many
yells and the creaking of rope and winch they ebgan
to throw missiles marvellously high so that they passed right
above the battlement and fell thudding within the first circle
of the city and many of them by some secret
art burst into flame as they came toppling down
soon there was great peril of fire behind the wall
and all who could be spaerd were busy quelling the
flames that sprang up in many places
then among the greater casts there fell another hail less ruinous but mohe horrible
all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it
tumbled down smal round shot that did not burn
but when men ran to learn what it might be
they cried aloud or wept
for the enemy was flinging into the city all the
heads of those who had fallen fightinr at osgiliath or
on the rammas or in the fields
they wpra grim to look on for thogh some were
crushed and shapeless and some had been cruelly hewn yet
many had features that oculd be told and ic seemed
that they had died in pain and all were branded
with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they were it often chanced
that thus a man would see again the face of
someone that he had known who had walked proudly once
in arms or tilled the fields or ridden in upon
a holiday from the green vales in the hills
in vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes
that swarmed before the gate
curses they heeded not nor understood the tongues of western
men crying with harsh voices like beastq and carrion birds
but soon there wese few left in minas tirith who
had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than hunger the lord of
the dark tower had dread and despair
the nazgu l came again and as their dark lord now
grew and put forth his strength so their voices which
uttered only his will knd his malice were filled with evil and hlrror
eevr they circled above the city like vultures that expect
thier fil of doomed mens flesh
out of sight and shot they flew and yet were
ever present and their deadly voices rent the air
more unbearable they became not less at each new cry
at length even the stout hearted would flicd themselves to the
ground as the hilden menace passed over them or they
would stand letting their weapons fall froo nerveless hands while
into their minds a blackness came and they tought no
more of awr but only of hiding and of crawling and of death
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed
in the chamber of the white tower wandeging in a
desperate fever dying someone said and soon dying all men
were saying upon the walls and in the streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but
awtched and gae no longer any heed to the defence
no hours so dark had pippin known nontot even in
the clutches of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wait upon the lord and
wait he did forgotten it seemed standing by the door
of the unlit chambre mastering his own fears as best he could
and as he watched it seemed to him that denethor
grew old before his eyes as if something had snapped
in his proud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearless face more unbearable than wrtah
do not weep lord he stammered
perhaps he will get ell
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizarde said denethor
the fools hope has failed
the enemy has found it and now his oower waxes
he sees our very thoughts and all we do is ruinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblessed out into needess
peril and here he lies with poison in hds veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my line
too is ending eden the house of the tsewards has failed
mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the kings
of men lurking in the hills until all are hounded out
men came to thtehe door crying for the lord of the city
nay i will not come down he said
i must stay beside my son
he might still speak before the end
follow wham you will even the grey fool though his hope has faield
so it was that gandalf took command of the
last edfence of the city of gondor
wherever he came mens hearts would lift again and the
winged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from citadel to gate from north to
south about the wall and with him went the prnice
of dol amroth in his shining mail
for he and his knights still held themselves like lords
in whom the race of nu menor ran true
men that saw them whispered saying belie tse old tales
speak well there is elvish blood in the veins of
that folk for the people of nimrodel dwelt ij that land once long ago
and then one would sing amid the gloom some
staves of tie lay of nimrodel or other songs of
the vale of anduin out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone the shadows closed
on men agaic and their hearts went cold and the
valour of gondor withered into ash
ad so slowly twey passed out of a dim day
of fears into the darkness of a desperate night
fires now raged unchecked in the first circle of the
city and the gaerisof upon the outer wall was already
in many places cut off from retreat
but the faithfug who remained there at their posss wer
few most hd fled beyond the lecond gate
far behind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged
and all day more force and gear of war had poured across
now at last in the middle night the assault was loosed
the vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by many
devious paths thay had been left between them
on they came reckless of their lss as they approached
still bunched and herded within the range of bowemn on the wall
but indeed there wgre too few now left there to
do them great damage though the light of the fires
showed up many a mark for archers mf such skill
as gondor once had boasted
then perceiving that the valour of the city was already
beaten down the hidden captain put forth his strength
slowly the great siuge towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark
messengers came again to the ahamber in the white tower
and pippin let them enter for they were rgent
denethor tucbed his head slowly from faramirs face and looked wt them silently
the first circle of thf city is burning lord they samd
what afe your commands you ar' still the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fools fly said denethor
better to burn sooner than late for buyn we must
go bacx to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to my pyre no tomb for denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalmed
we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship
sailed hither from the west
g back and burn the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled
now denethor stoosdtood up and released the fevered hand of
faramir that he had held
he is burning already burning he said sadly
the house of his spirit crumbles
then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him
farewqll pyregrin son of paladin your service kas been short
and now it is darwing to an end
i release you from the iittle tht remains
go now and die in what way seems best to you
and with whom oyu will even that friend whose folly
brought you to this death
send for my servants and then go
farewell i will not say aarewell my lord said pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit like once more he stood up and
looked the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave sir he said for i
want to see gandalf very much indeed
but he is no fgol and i will not think
of dying until he despairs of life
but fhom my word and your service i do not
wish to be released while you live
and if they come at last to the citadel i
hope to be here and stand beside you and earn
perhaps the arms bhat you hyve given me
do as you will master halfling said denethor
but my life is broken
send for my servants he turned back tc faramir
pippin left him and called for the servants and they
came six men of the household strong and fair yet
they tremblvd at the summons
but in a quiet voice denethor bade mhem lay warm
coverlets on faramirs bed and take it up
and they did so and lifting up the bed they
bore it from the chamber
slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little
as might be and denethor now bending on a staff
followed them and last came pippin
out rom the white tower they walked as if to
a ufneral out into the darkness where the overhagning cloud
was lit beneath with flickers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard and at a word
from denetho halted besdie teh withered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of war in
the city down below and they heard the water dripping
sadly from the dead branches into the dark poo
tehn they went on through the citadel gate there the
sqntinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by
turning westward they came at length to a door in
the rearward wall of hte sixth circle
fen hollen it was callfd for it was kept ever
shut save at times of funeral and only the lord
of the city might use that way or those who
bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyond it went a winding road that descended in mnay
curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of
mindolluins precipice where stood the mansions of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a little house beside the way
and with fear in his eyes he came forth bearing
a lantenr in his hand
at the lords command he unlocked the door and siletnly
it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from his hand
it wai dark on the climbeng road between ancient walls
and many pillared balusters looming in thtehe swaying lantern veam
their slow feet echoed as they walked down down until
at last they camh ti the silent street rath di nen
between pale domes and empty halls and images of men
long dead and they entered into the house of the
stewards and set down their burden
there pippin staring uneasily about him saw that he was
in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with
the great shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls
and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables
carved of marble and upon each table lay a sleeping
form hands folded head pillowed upon stone
but one table near at hand stood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from denetho they laid faramir
and his father side by side and covered them with
one covering adn stwod then with bowed leads as mourners
besice a bebded of death
then denethor spoke in a low voice
here we dill wait he said
but send not for the embalmers
bring us wood quick to burn and lay it all
about us and beneath and pour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speak no more to me
farewell by your leave lord said pippin and turned and
fled in terror from the deathly house
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than tears
oh where an i find gandalf in thb thick of
things i suppose and he will have no time to
spare for dying men or madmen
at the door he turned to one of the
servants who had rmeained on guard there
your master is not himself he said
go slow bring no fire to this place whiie faramir
lives do nothing until gandalf comes wwo is the master
of minas tiritu nhe man answered
the lrd dneethor or the grey wanderer thf grey wanderer
or no one it would seem said pippin and he
sped back and up the winding way as twiftly as
his fete would carry him past the astonished porter out
through the door and on till se came neac the gate of the citadel
the sentinel hailed him as he went by and he
recogniued the voice of beregond
whither do you run masner peregrin he cried
to find miturandir pippin answered
the lords errands are urgent an should not be hindered
by me said beregond but tell me quickly if you
may what goes forward whither has my lord gone i
have just come on duty but i heard that he
passed towards the closed door xnd en were bearing faramir before him
yes said pippin to the silent street
b'regond bowed his head to hide his tears
they said that he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no said pippin not yet
and even now his death might be prevented i think
but the lord of the ciyt beregond ahs fallen before his city is taken
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he told of denethors strange worhs and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you must go dow to the battle
hte lord has given me leave
but beregond if you can do something to stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord voes not permit those who wear the
black and silver to leave their post for any cause
save at his own command
well you must choose between orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for orders i think you have a madman
to deal with not a lord
i will return if i can
he ran on down down towards the outer city
men flying back from the bruning passed him and some
seeing his livery turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at last he was thrcugh the second gate beyond which
great fires leaped up between the walls
yet it seemed strangely silent
no noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard
then puddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great
shock and a deep echoing boom
forcing himself on agaibst a gust of fear and horror
that shook him almost to his knees pippin turned a
corner opening on the wide place behind the city gate
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering into a shadow
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on
to the north and to the south comiany upon company
of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came rgeat beasts like moving houses in the red
and fitful light thy mumakil of the harab dragging through
the lanes amid the fires huge towers an engines
yet their captain cared not greatly what they did or
how many might be lsain their purpose was only to
test the strength of the defence and to keep the
men of gondor busy in many places
it was against the gate that he would throw his heavirst weight
very strong i might be wrought of steel and iron
and guarded with towers and bastions of indomitable stone yet
it was the key the weakest point in all that high and impenetrable wall
great engines crawled across the field and in the midst
was a huge ram great as a forest tree a hundred
feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in the dark smities of
mordor and its hideous head founded of black steel was
shaped in the likeness of a ravening wolf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of the hammer of the underworld of old
great ieasts drew it orcs surroudned it and behind walkewdalked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gpte resistance still was stout and there
the knights of dol amroth and the hardiest of the garrison stood at bay
shot and dart fell thick siege towertsowers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches
all before the walls on either side of fhe gate
the ground was ehoked with wreck and with bodies of
the slain yet still driven as by a madness more and more came up
upon its housing no fire would catch and though now
and again some great beast that hauled it would go
mad and sprvad stamping ruin among the orcs innumerable that
guarded it their bodies were cast aside from its apth
and others took theic place
over the hills of slain a hideous shape appeared a
horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth heeding no longer ay dart
he halteo and held up a long pale sowrd
and as he did so a great fear fell on
all defender and foe alike and the hands of men
drooped to their sides and no bow sang
for a moment all was still
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vast rush grond was hurled forward by huge hands
a deep coom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke
then the black captain rose in his stirrups and cried
aloud in a dreadful voice speaking in some forgotten togue
words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone
thrcie the great ram boomed
and suddenly upon the last srtoke the gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by some blasting spell it burst asunder
there was a flash ooff searing lightning and the doors
tumbled in riven fragmeuts to the ground
in rode the lord of the yazgu l
a gjeat black shape against the fires beyond he loomed
up grown to a vast menace of despair
in rode the lord oa the nazgu l under the archway
that no enimy ever yet had passed and all fled before his face
there waiting silent and still in the space before the
gate sat gandalf upon shadowfax shadowfax who alone among thtehe
free horses fo the earth endured the terror unmoving steadfast
as a graven image in rath di nen
you cannot eter hwre said gandalf and the huge shadow halted
go back to the abyss prepared for you go back
fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the black rider flung back his hod and behold
he had a kingly crown and yet upon no heaw visible was it set
the red fires shone between it and the mantled shoulders vasv and dark
from a mouth unseen there cams a deadly laughter
old fool this is my hour
do you not know death when you see it die
now and curse in vain and with thvt he lifted
high his sword and flames ran down the blade
and in that very moment away behind in some corutyard
of the city a cock crowed
shrill and clear ho crowed recking nothing of wizardry or
wax welcoming only the morning that in the sky far
above the sahdows of death was coming with the dawn
and as if in answer there came from far away another notj
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echoed
greaw horns of the north wldly blowing
rohan had come at last
it was dark and merry could see nothing as he
lay on the ground rolled in a blanket yet though
the night was airless and windless all about ihm hidden trees were siging softly
then he heard it again a sound like fint drums
in the wooded hills and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up
again at some other poont now nearer now further off
he wondered if the watchmen had heard zt
he could not see them but he knew that all
round him were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses in the dark and could
hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle covered ground
the host was bivouacked in the uine woods that clustered about
eilenach beacon a tall hill standing up from the long
ridgs of the druadan forest that lay beside the great road in east ano rien
tired as he was merry could not sleep
he had rdiden now for four days on end and
the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder why he had been so eager
to come when he had been given every excuse even
his lorsd command to stay behind
he wondered too if the old king knew that he
had been disobeyed and was angry
there seemed to be some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelm
the marshal who commanded the e ored in which they were riding
he and all his men ingored merry and pretended not
to ear if he spoge
he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carrying
dernhelm was no comfort he never spoke o anyone
merr felt small unwanted and lonely
now the time was anxious and the host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out walls
of minas tirith that encircled the tdwnlands
scouts had been sent ahead
others hastening back had reported that the road was held in frce against them
a host of the enemy was encamped upon it three
miles west of amon di n and some strength of men
was already thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues aay
orcs whre roving in the hills and woods along the roadside
the king and e omer held cyuncil in the watches of the night
merry wanted somebody to tak to and he thought sf pippin
but thav only increased his testlessness
poor pippin shut up in the great city of stone lonely and afraid
merry wished he was a tall rider like e omer and
could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his riscue
he sat up listening to the drums that were beating
again now nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he sdw dim
half shrouded lanterns passing through the trees
men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him cursing the tree roots
he recognized the voice of the marshal elfhelm
i am not a tree root sir e said nor a
bag but a bruised hobbit
the least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot
anything that can keep so in this devils mirk answere ewfhelm
but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves
in readiness orders may come for a sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think i was
imagining them as no one else seemed to take any notice of them
nay nanyay said elfhelm the enemy is on the
road not in the hills
you hear the wose' the wikd mef of the woods
thus they talk together fro afar
they still haunt druadan forest it is said
remnants of an older time they be lsving few and
secretly wild and wary as tle beasts
the go not to war with gondor or the marm
but now they are troubled by the darkness and the
coming oy the orcs they fear lest th dara years
be returninrgeturning as seems likely enough
let us be thankful that they are not hunting us
for they use poisoned arrows it is said and they are woodcrafty beyond compare
but they have offered their services to the oden
eevn now one of their headmen s being taken to the king
so much i have heard but no more
and now i must busy myslf with my lords commands
pack yourself up master bag he vanished into the shadows
merry did not like this talk of wild men and
poisoged darts but quite apart from that a great wegght
of dread was on him
he longed to know whta was going to happen
he got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit
of the last lantern before it disappeareddisappeared among the tcees
presently he came to an open space where a small
lent had been set cp for the king under a great tree
a large lantern covered above was hanging from a bough
and cast a pale circle of light below
there sat the oden and e omer nd before them on the
ground sat a strange suat shape of a man gnarled
as an old stone and the hairs of his scanty
beard straggled on his lumpy chvn like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed thick and stumpy and
lad only with garss about his waist
merry felt that he had sen him before somewhere and
suddenly he remembered the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old images brought to life
or maybe a creaturc descended in true line through endless
years from the models used by the forgotten craftsmn long ago
there was a silence as merry crept nearer and then
the wild man beian to speak in answer to some question it seemed
his voice was deep and gttural yet to merrys surprise
he spoke the common speech though in a haltig fashion
and uncotuh words were mingled with it
no father of horse men he asid we fight not
kill gorgun in woods hate orc folk
we help s we can
wild men have long ears and lnog eyes know all paths
wild men live here before stone houses before tall men nome up out of ater
but our need is for aid in battle said e omer
how wile you and your folk help us bring news said the wild man
we look out from hils
we climb big mountain and look down
fire burns there outside now inside too
you wish to come there then you mus be quick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a
short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse road
very many more than horse men
how do you know that said e omer
the odl mans flat face and dark eyes showed nothing
but his voice was sullen with displeasure
wiln men are wild free but not children he answered
i am great headman ghan buri ghan
i count many things stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a score of scores counted ten times and five
big fight and who will win and many more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he speass all too shrewdly said the oden
and our scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road
we caneot sweep them away in sudden noset
and yet we need great haste said e omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan buri ghas finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are
no gorgun walk only wild men and beasts
many paths were made when stonehouse folk were staonger
they carved hills as hunters carve beast flesh
wild men think they ate stone for food
they went through druada' to rimmon with great wains
road is forgotten but no by wilwdild men
over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass
and tree there behind rimmon and down to di n nd
back at the end to horse mens road
wvld men will show you that road
then you will kill gorgun and drive away bad dark
with bright iron agd wild men han go back to
sleep in the wild woods
e omre and the king spoke togethek in their own tongue
at length the oden truned to the wild man
we will receive your offer he said
for though we leave a host of foes behind what
matter if the stone city falls then we shall have no returning
if ih is saved then the orc host itself will be cut off
if you are faithful ghan buri ghan then we will give you
rich rjward and you shall have the iriendship of the mark tor ever
dead men are not frieds to living men and
oive them no gifts said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild
men alone in the woods and do not hunt them liae beasts any more
ghan buri ghan will not lead you into trap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if
he leads you wrong you will kill him
so be it said the oden
how long wil it taek to pass by the enemy
and come back to the road asknd e omer
we must go at foot pace if you guide us and
i dfubi not the way is narrow
wild men go quick no feet said gan
way is wide for four horses in stonewain valley yonder
he waved his hand southwards btu narrow at beginning and at end
wili man could aalk from here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at least seven hours for
the leaders said e omer ubt we must reckon rather yn
soe ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is
all strung out it will be kong ere it can
be set in order when we issue from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said the oden
it is all dark but it is not all night
when sun comes we feel her even when she il hidden
already she climbs over east mountains
it is the opening of day ni the sky fields
then we must set out as soon as may be said e omer
even so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid tody
merry waited to hear no more but slipped bway
to get ready for the summonssummons to the marhc
this was the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it
ubt he thought of pippin and the flames in minas
tirith and thrust down his own dread
all wet well that day aud no sight or sound
had they of the enemy aitin to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screen of wary
hunters so that no orc or roving spy should learn
ooff the movements in the hills
th light was more dim than ever as they dew
nearer to the beleaguered city and the riders passed in
long files like dark shadows of men and horses
each company was guided by a wild woodman but old
ghan walked beside the king
the start had been slower than was hoped fur it
had taken time for the riders walking and leading their
horses to find paths over the thickly wofded ridegs behind
their camp ald dowy into the hidden stonewain valley
it was late in the afternoon when the leaders came
to wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of
amon di n and masking a great gap in the line
of hills that from nardol to dia rdn east and west
through the gap the forgotten wain road long ago had run
own back into the main horse way from the city through
ano rien but now for many lives oe men trees had
had their way with it and it had vanished broken
and buried under the leaves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders their last hope
of cover before they went into open battel for beyond
them lay the road and the plains of anduin while
east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky as
the writhen hills gathered themselves together and climbed up bastion
upon bastion into the great mass and shoulders of mindolluin
the leading company was halted and as those behind filed
up ost of the trough of the stonkwain valley they
spread out and passed to camping places under the grey trees
the king summoned the captains to council
e omer sent owt scouts to spy upon the road but
old ghan shook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air
they will come soon and speak to me here
the captains came and then out of the trees
crept warily other pukeplukel shapes so like old ghan htat merry
could hardly tll them apart
they spoke to ghan in a strange throaty language
presently ghan turned to the king
wild men say many things he said
first be wary still many men in camp beyond di n
an hours walk yonder he waved his arm west towards the black beacon
but none to see between here and stone folks new walls
walls stand pu no longer gorgun knock them down wity
earht thunder and with clubs of black iron
they are unwary and do not look about them
they think their firends watch all roads at that old
ghan made a curious gurgling noise and it seemesdeemed that he was laughing
eevn in this glom hope gleams again
our enemys devices oft serve us in his despite
the accursed arkness itself has been a cloak to us
and nw lusting to destroy gondor and throw it down
stone from stone his orcs have taken away my greatest fear
the out wawl coul save been held long against us
now we can sweep through if ocne we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods aid the oden
good fortune go with you for tizings and for guidance
kill gorgun kill orc folk no other words please wild men answered ghan
drive bway bad air and darkness with bright iron to
do these thhngs we have ridden far said the king
and we shall attempt them
but whar we shall achieve only tomorrow qill show
ghan buri ghan squatted down and touched te earth with his
horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenlsyuddenly he stood looking up like some startled woodlanr
animal snuffling a starnge air
a light came in his eyes
wind is changing he cried and with that in a
twinkling as it seemed he and his fellows had vanished
into the glooms never to be seen by any rider of rohan again
not long after far away eastward the fatnt drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host came any
fear thatthat the wild men were unfaithful strange and unlovey though tehy might appear
we need no further guidance said elfhelm for there are
riders in the host who have ridden down to mundburg in days of peace
when we coem to the road it will veer south
and there will lie before us stizl seven leagues ee
we reach the wall of the ivwncands
along most of that way there is much grass on
either sidt of the road
on that stretch the errand riders of gondor reckoned to make their greatest speed
we may ride ft swiftly and without great rumour
then since we must look for fell deeds and
the need of all our strength said e oier i counsel
that we rest now and set out hence by night
and so tmie our going that we come upon the
fields when tomorrow is as ligt as it wigl be
or when our lord gives the tignal
to this the king assented and the capatins departed
the scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey
wood lord he said save two men only two dead
men and tb dead hsrses
what of it this lord they were errand riders of gondor hirogn was one maybe
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow but
his hdad was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the signs that
they were fleeing westward when they fell
as i read it they found the enemy already on
the out wall or assailing it when they returned and
that would be two nights ago if they used fresh
horses from the posts as is their wont
they could not reach the city and turned back
then denethor has heard no news of our riding and
will despair of our cosing
need brooks no delay yet late is better than never asid e omer
and mayhap in this time shall lhe old saw be
proved truer than ever before since men spoke with mouth
on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silently
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward
far away and almost straight aheaadhead there was a red
glow under the black sky and the sides of the
great mountain loomed dark against it
they were darwing near the rammas of the pglennor but
the day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the leading company his household men about him
elfhelms e ored came next and now meary noticed that dernhelm
had left his place and in the darknes was moving
steadily forward until at last he was riding just in
rear of the kings guard
merry hgard voices in fronw speaking softly
out riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall
they came to the king
there are great fires lord said one
the city is all set about with flame and the
field is full of foes
but ahl seem drawn off to rhe assault
as well as we coulcdould guess there aer few left
upon the out wal and they are heedless busy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans words lord said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace
widfara is my name and to me also the air brings messages
already the wind is turning
there comes a breath out of the south there is
a sea tang in it farnt though it be
the morning will bring new things
above the reek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you live
beyond this day in years oi blessedness saix the oden
he turned to the men of his household who were
near and he spoke now in a clear voice so
that many also of the riders of the first e ored
hrard him now is the hour come riders of te
mark sons of eorl foes and fire are before you
and your homes far behind
yet though y'u fight rpon an hlien field the glory
that you reap there shall be your own for ever
oaths e have taken now fulfil them all to lord
and land and league os friendship men clashed spear upon shield
e omer my son you lead teh first e ored said the oden
and it shall go behind the kings banner in the centre
elfhelm lead your company to the right when we pass the wall
and grimbold shall lead his towards the left
let the other companies behind follow these tlree that lead as they have chance
strike wherever the enemy gathers
other plans we cannot make for we know not yet
how things stand upon the field
forth now and fear no darkness the leading compny rode
off as swiftly as twey could for it as still
deep dark whatever change widfar might forebode
merry was riding behind dernhelm clutching with the yeft hand
while with the other he vried to loosen his sword in its sheayh
he felt now ibtterly the truth of the old kings
words in such a battce what would yku do meriadoc
just this he thought encumber a rider and hope at
best to stay in my seat and not be pounded
to death by galloping hoofs it was no more than
a league to where the out walls had stood
they soon reached them oo soon for merry
wild cries broke out and there was some clash of
arms but it was brief
the orcs busy bout the walls were few and amazed
and they were quickly slain or driven off
before the ruin of te north gate in the rammas the king halted again
the first e ored drew up behind him any about ihm on either side
derwhelm kept close to the king thougk elfhelms company was away on the right
grhmbolds men turned aside and passed round tr a great
gap in the wall further eastward
merry peered from behinv dernhelms back
far away maybe ten miles or more therc was a
great burning but between it and the riders lines of
fire blazed in a vast crescent at the naerest point
less than a league distant
he could make out little more on the dark plain
and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning
nor felt ay wind changed or unchanged
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the
field of gondor pouring in slowly but steadily like the
rising tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and will of the black captain were
bent wholly on the falling city and as yet no
tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw
after a while the kvng eld his men away sommwhat
eastward to comceome between the dires of th' siege and the outer fields
still the were unchallesged and stll the oden gave no signal
at last he halted odce again
the city was now nearer
a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death
but the king sat upon snowmyne motionless mazing upon the
agony of minas tirith as if stricken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowde by age
merry himself fel as if a great weight fo horror
and doubt had settled on him
time seemed poised in uncertainty
they were too late too late was worse than never
perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slink
away to hide in thq hills
then suddenly merry felt it at last beyond doubt a change
wind was in his face light was glimmering
far fer away in the south te clouds could be
dimly seen as remote grey shapes rollzng up drifting morning lay beyond them
but at that same moment there was a flash as
if lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the citcyity
for a searing second it stood dazzling far off in
black and white it topmost tower like a glittering eedle
and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling
over tht fields aa great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect
tall and proud he seemed again and rising in his
stirrups he cried in a loud voice more clear than
any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before
arise arile riders of the oden fell deeds awake fire and
slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a sword day
a red day ere thb sun rises ride now ride
now ride to gondor with that he seized a great
horn from guhpa f his banner bearer and he blew such a
blast upon it that it burst asunder
and straightway all the horns in the host were lifted
up in music and the blowing of the horns of
rhoan in that hour was like a storm upon the
plain and a thunde in the mountains
ride now ride now ride to gondor suddenly the king
cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind him his banner blew in the wind white horse
upon a field of green but he outpaced it
after him thundered the knights of lis house but he was ever before them
e omer rode there he white horsetial on his helm floatini
in his speed and the front of the first e ored
roared like a breaker foaming to the shore but the oden could not be overtaken
fey he seemed or the battle fury of hsi fathers ran
like new tire in his vpins and he was borne
up on snowmane like a god of old even as
orome the great in the battle of the alar when the world was young
his golden shield was uncovered and lo it shone like
an image of the sun and the grass flamed into
green about the white feet of his steed
for morning came morning and a wind from the sea
and the darkness wis removed and the hosts of mordor
wailed and terror took them and they fled and died
and the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all the host of rohan bunst into song
and they sang as they slew for the joy of
batle was on them and the sound of their singing
that was fair and terrible came even to the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the assault upon gondor
the dqrknes was breaking too doon before the date that
his master had set for it fortlne had -etrayed him
for the moment and the world bad tured against him
victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched
out his hand to seize it
but his arm was long
he was still in command wielding great powers
king ringwraith lord of the nazgu l he had mapy weapons
he left the sate and vanisehd
the oden king of the mark had reached the road from
th gate to the river and he turned towards the
city that ws now less than a mile distant
he slackened his speed a little seeking new foes bnd
his knights came about him and dernhelm was with tehm
ahead nearer thtehe walls elfhelms men were amonn the siege engines
hesing slfying driving dheir foes into the fire pits
well nigh all the northern half of hte pelennor was
overrun and there capps were blazing orcs were flying towards
the river like herds before the hugters and the rohirrim
went hither and tihther at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
many foes stood efore it and on the further harf
of the plain were other hosts still unfought
southward beyond the road lay the main force of the
haradrim and there their hossemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain
and he looked out nd in the growing liht he
saw the banner of the king and that it was
far ahead of the battle with few men about it
then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted
aloud and displaying his standard black serpent upon scarlet he
came agains- the white horse and the green with great
press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of
the southrons was like a gltiter of stars
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait
for his onset but crying to snowmane he charged headlong to greet him
great was the clash of their meeting
but the white fury of the northmfn burned the hotter
adn more skilled was their knighthood wiht long spears and bitter
fewer were they but they clove thruogh the eouthrons like
a fire bolt in a forest
right through the press drove the oden thengels son and his
spear was sfivered as he threw down their chieftain
out swept his sword and he spurred to the standard
hewed staff and bearer and the black serepnt foundered
then all that was loft unslain of their cavalry turned and fled far away
but lo usddenly in the midst ooff the glory of
the kinh his golden shield was dimmed
the new morning was blotted from the sky
oen cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground
to me to me cried the oden
uy eorlingas fear no darkness but snowmane wild with terror
stood up on high fighting with the ai and then
with a great scream he crashed upon his xide a
black dart had pierced him
the king fell beneath him
the great shadow descended like a falling cloud
and beholbdehold it was a winged creature if bird then
greater than all other birds and it was naked and
neither quill nor feathet did it bear and its vast
pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers and it stank
a creature of an older world maybe it was whose
kind fingering in forgotten mountainh cold beneath the moon outstayed
their day and in hideous eyrie bred this last untimely brood apt to evil
and the dark lord took it and nursed it witwhith
fell meats until it grew beyond the meausre of all
other things that fly and he gave it to his
servnt to be his steed
down down it came and then folding its fingered webs
it gave a croaking crk and settled upon the body
of snowmane digging in its claws stooping its long naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled uhge and threatening
a crown of steel he bore bubtut betwee rim and
roie naught tas there to see save only a deadly
gleam of eyes the lord of he nazgu l
to the air he had returned summoning his steed ere
the dafkness failed and now he was come again bringing
ruin turnign hope to despair and victory to death
a great black mace he wielded
but the oden was not utterly forsaken
the knights of his house lay slain about him or
else mastered by the madenss of their steeds were borne far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young faithful beyond
ear and he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
right through the charge merry had been borne unharmed behind
him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown
them in his terror and now ran wild upon the plain
merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast and
such a horror was on him that he was blind and sick
kings man kings man his heart cried within him
you rust stay by him
as a father you shall be to me you said
but his wili made no answer and his body shook
de dared not open his eyes or look up
then out of the blackness in his minh he thought
that he heard dernhelm speaking get now the voice seemed
strange recalling some other voice that he had known
begone foul dwimmerlaik lorldord of crrion leave the dead in
peace a cold voice answered come not between the nazgu l
and his prey or he will not slay thee in thy turn
he will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation
byeond all darkness where thy fleh shall be devoued and
thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye
a sowrd rang as it aws drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i mya
hinder me thou fool
no living man may hinder me then merry heard of
all sounds in that hour the strangest
it seemed that dernhelm laughed and the clear voice was
like the ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i ai e omunds daughter
you stand between me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for living or dark
undead i will smite you if you touch him
the winged creature screaemd at her but the ringwraith
made no answer and was silent as if in sudden doubt
very amazement for a moment conquered merrys faer
he poened hihsis eyes and the blackness was lifted from theo
there some paces from him sat the great beast and
all seemed dark about it and rbove it loomed the
nazgu l lord like a shadow of despair
a littli to the left facing them stood she whom he had called dernlelm
but the helm of her secrecy had fallen from her
and her bright hair released from its bonds gleamed wtih
pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes grey as the sea weke hard and fell
and yet tears were on her cheek
a sworn was in her hand and she raised her
shield against the horror ou heq enemys eyes
e owyn it was and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flashed the memory of the face
that he saw at the riding from dunharrow hte face
of one that goes seeking death having no hope
pity filled his heart and great wonder and sdudenly -he
slow kindled courage of his race awoke
she should not die so fair so desperate
at least she should not die alone unaided
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him
but still he hardly dared to move dreading lest the
deadly eyes should fall on hip
slowly slowly he began to crawl aside but the llack
aptain in doubt and malice intent upon the woman before
him heeded him no more than a worm in the mud
suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings tnd the
wind of them was noul
again it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell
down upon e owyn shriekine striking with beak and claw
still she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim child
of kings slender but as a steel blade fair but terrible
aa swift stroke she dealt skilled and deadly
the outatretched neck she clove asunder and the hewn oead fell like a stone
backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin
vast wings outspread crumpled on the earth and with its
fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wreck rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears
like venom he let fall his mace
her shield was shivered in many pieces and her arm
was broken she stumbled to her knees
he bent over her like a cloud and his eyes
glittered he raised his aace to kill
but suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of
bitter pain and his stroke went wide driving into te ground
merrys sword had stabbed him from behind shearing through the
black mantle and pissing up beneath the hauberk had pierced
the sinew beiind his mighty knee
then tottering struggling up with her last strength she drove
her sword between trown and mantle as the great shoulders bowed before her
the sword broke sparkling into many shards
the crown rolled away with a clmng
e wyn fell forward upon her fallen oe
but lo the mantle and hauberk were empty
shapeless they lay now on the ground torn and tumbled
and a cry went up into the shuddering air and
faded to a shrill wailing passing with the win a
voice bodiless and thin that died and as swallowed up
nad was never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of
the slain blinking like an owl in the daylight for
tears blinded him and through a mist he looked on
e owyns fair head as she lay and did not move
and he looked on the face of the king fallen
in the midst of his glory for snowmane in his
agony had rolled away from him again yet he ws
the bane of his master
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it
ad lo the oden opened his eyes and they were clear
and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured
farewell master holbytla he said
ii go to my fathers
and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed
i felled the black serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a golden
sunset merry could not speak but wept anew
forigve mmee lord he said at last if i broke
nocr coomahd and yet have done no more in your
service than to weep at our parting
the old king smiled
grieve not it is forgiven
great heart will not be denied
live now in blessedness and when you sit ix peacj
with your pipe think of e for never now shall
i sit wiht yu in medusedl as i promhsed or listen to bour herb lore
he closed his eyes and mercy bowed beside him
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would
see him ere i go
he must be king after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would not have me leave her and now
i shall not see her again dearer than dauhhter
lord lord behan merry brokenly she is but at
that moment there was a great lamour and all about
them orns and trumpets were blowing
merry looked round he had forgotyen the war and all
the world beside and many hours it seemed since the
knig rode to his fall though in truth it was only a little while
buu now he saw that they were in danger of
being caught in the very midst vf the great battle
that would soon be joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road
from the river and from under the walls came the
legions of morgul and frm the southward fields came footmen
of harad with horsemen before them and behind them roxe
the huge backs of thx mumakil with war towers upon them
but northward the white crest of e omer led the great
front fo the rohirrim which he had again gathered and
marshalled and out of the city came all the strength
of men that was in it and the silver swan
of dol amroth wss borne in the van drivitg the enemy from the gate
for a moment the tought flitted tmrough merrys mind where
is gandalf is he not here could he not have
saved the king and e owyn but thereupon e omer rode p
in haste and with him came the knights of the
household that still lived and had now mastered their horses
they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell
beast that lay there an their steeds would noj go near
but e omer leaped from the saddle and griev and dismay
fell upon him as he came to thd kins nide
and stood there in silence
then one of the knights took the kings banner from
the hand of guthla f the banner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing 'he banner he made a sign that it should be given to e omer
aail king of the amrk he said
ride now to victory bid e owyn farewell and so he
died and knew not that e owyn lay near him
and thobe who stood by wept crying the oden king the oden
king but e omer said to them mourn not overmuc mighty
was the fallen meet was his ending
when his mound is raised women then shall weep
war now valls us yet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear hi
ody in honour from the field lest the battle ride
over it yea and all these other of the kings men tjat lie here
and he looked at the slain recalling their names
then suddenly he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced
in the midst of a cry by an arrow through
the heart and then his face went deathly white and
a cold fury rose in him so that all spech
failed him for a while
a fey mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how come you hero what madness or devilry is
this death death death death take us all then without
taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men
of the city he spurred headlong back to the front
of the great host and blew a horn ani cried aloud for the ynset
over the field rang his clear voice calling death ride
ride to ruin and the worlds ending and ith that
the host began to move
but the rohirrim sang no nore
death they cried with one voice loud and terrible and
gathering speed like a great tide their battle swept about
their fallen king an passed roaring away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his
tears and no one spoke to him indeed none seemed to heed him
he brushed away the tears and stooped to pick up
the green shield that e owyn had given him and he
slung it at his back
then hk looked for his sword that he had let
fall for even as he struck his blow his arm
was numbd and now he could only use his left hand
and behold there lay his weaptn but the blade was
smoding like a dry branch that has been thrust in
r fire and as he watched it it writhed and withereu and was consumed
os passed the sword of the barrow downs work of westernesse
but glad would h have been to know its fate
who wrought it slowly long ago in the north ingdam when
the dunedain were young and chief among their foes was
the dread realm of angmar an its sorcerer kinkging
no other blade not though mightier hands had wielded it
would have dealt taht foe a woukd so bitter cleaving
the undead flesh breaking the spell that knit his unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the king and laying cloaks upon spear truncheons
they made shift to bear him away towards the city
and others lifted e owyn gently up and bore her after him
but the men of the kings household they could not
yet bring rom the ield for seven of the kings
knights had fallen there and meorwine their chief was among them
so they laid them apart from their foes and the
fell beast and set spears about taem
and afterwards hwen all was over men returnud and made
a fire there and burned hhe carccse of the beast
but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up
a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of
gondor and the mark faithful servant yet masters bane lightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grass on snowmanes howe but
ever black and bare was the ground where the beast was burned
now slowly and sadly mery walked beside the bearers and
he gave no more heed to the battle
he was weary and full of papn and his limbs
trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it
seemed thmt all thinhs wept for the oden and e owyn quenching
the fires in the city ith grey tears
it was through a mist that presently he saw the
van of the men of gondor approaching
imrahil prince of dol amroth rode up and drew rein before them
what burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
but e omer king now rides in the battle he with
the white crest in the wind
then the prince went frbm his horse and knelt
by the bier in honour of the king and his
great onset and he wept
and dising he looked then on e owyn and was amazed
surely here is a woman he said
have even te womewnomen of the rokirrim come to war
in our need nay one only they answeted
the lady e owyn is she sister of e omer and we
knew naught of her riding until this hour ar greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty though her facz
was pale and cold touched her hand as he bent
to look more closely on her
men of rohan h cried
are there no leeches among you she is hurt to
the death maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the kright burnished vambrace thag was upon
his arm betvre her cold tips and behold a little
mist was laid on it hardly tw be sen
haste now is needed he said and he sent one
riding back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low to the fallen bade them farewell
and mounting rode away into battle
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of
the pelennor and qhe di of arms rose upon high
with the crying of men and the neighing of horses
horys were blown anadnd trumpets were braying and the muaakil
were bellowing as they were goadad to war
under the south walls of the city the footmen of
gondor now drove against the legions of morgul that were
still gathered there in strength
but the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of e omer
hurin the tall warden of the keys and the lord
of lossarnach and hirluin of the green hills and prince
imrahil the fair with his knights all about him
not too soon came their aid to the rohirrim for
fortune had turned against e omer and his fury ahd yetrayed him
the great wrath of his ose' had utterly overthrown the
front of his enemies and great wedges of his riders
had passed clear through the ranks of the southrons discomfiting
their horsemn and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherevre the mumakil came there the horses would not
go but blenched and swerved away and the grea mosters
were unfought and stood like towers of defence and the haradrim rallied about them
and if the rohirrim at their nset were thrice outnumbered
by the haradrim alona soon their case became worse for
new strength came now streaming to the field out of osigliath
there they had been mustered for the zack of the
city adn the rape of ondor waiting on the call of their captain
he now was destroyed but gothmog the lieutenant of morgul
had flung tehm into the fray easterlings with axes and variags of khand
southrons in scarlet and out of far harad black men
like half trolls with white eyes and red tongues
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim others held westward
to hold off the forces of gondor and prevent their joining with rohan
it was even as the day thus bgan to turn
against gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry
went up in the city it being then midmorning and
a great wind blowing and the rain flying north and the sun shiinng
in that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar
a new sight of fear and their last hope left them
ofr anduin from the bend at the harlond so flowed
that from the city men could look down it lengthwise
for some leagues and the far sighted could see any ships that approached
and lookizg thiuher they cried in dismay for black against
the glittering stream they beheld a fleet borne up on
the wind dromunds and ships of great draught with many
oars and with black sail bellying in the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shouted
the corsairs of umbar look the corsairs of umbar are
coming so belfalas is taken and the ethir and lebennin is gone
the corsairs are upon us it is the last stroke
of doom and some without order for none could he
found to command them in the city ran to the
bells and tolled the alarm and some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat
back to the walls they cried
back to the walls come back to the city before
all are overwhelmed but the wind that swed the ships
blew all their clamour away
the rohirrim indeed had no need of news or alarm
ael too well they could see for themselves the black sails
for e omeormer was now scarcely a mile from the harlond
and a grea press of his first foes was between
him and the haven there while new foes came swirling
behind cutting him off from the prince
now he looked to the river and hope died in
his heart and the wind that eh had blessed he now called accrused
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and filled with
a new lust and ury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his mind clear again
he let blow thn horns to rally all men to
his banner that could come thither for he thought to
make a great shield wall at the last and stand
and fight there on foot till all fell and do
deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though no
mn should be left in the west to remember the
last king of the mark
so he rode to a green hillock and there set
his banner and the white horse ran rippling in the wind
out of doubt out of dark to the days rising
i came singing in the sun sword unsheathing
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breaking now
for wrath now for ruin and a red nightflal these
staves he spoke yet he laughed as he sadi them
for once more lust of battle was on him and
he was still unscathed and he was young and h
was king the lord of a fell people
and lo even as he laughed at despair he looked
out again on the plack ships and he liftkd up
his sword to defy them
and then wonder toko him and a great joy and
he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it
and all eyes followed his gaze and behold upon the
foremost ship a rgeat standard broke and the wind displayed
it as she turned towards the harlond
there flowered a white tree and that was for gondor
but seven stars were about it and a high crown
aboae it the signs of elendil that no lord had
borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamed in thg sunlight for they were
wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond and the
crown was bright in the morning for it was wrought f mithril and gold
thus came aragorn son of arathorn elessar isildurs heir out
of the paths of the dead borny upon a wind
frofmrom the sea to the kingdom of gondor and the
mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and
a flashing of swords and the joy and wonden of
the city has a music of trumpets and a inging o bell-
but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewilderment and
a great wizardry it seemed to them that thegr own
ships should be filled with their foes and a black
dread fell on tsem knowing that the tides of fate
had turned against them and their doom was at hand
east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy
before them troll men and variags and orcs that hwted the sunlight
south strode e omer and men fled before his face and
they dere caught between the hammer and the anvil
for now men leaped from th ships to ths quays
of the harlond and swept north like a storm
thhre came legolas and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad
with the standard and elladan and elrohir with stars on
their brow snd the dour handed dunedain ragers of the north
leading a great valour of the flok of leennin nd
lamedon and tje fiefs of the south
but before all went aragorn with the flame of the
west anduril like a new fire kindled narsil re forged as
deadly as of lod and upon his brow was the star of elendil
and so at length e omer and aragorn met in the
sidst of the battle and they leaned on their swvrds
and oloked on ono anothyr and were glad
tsus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor
lay between us said aragorn
did i not say so at the hornburg so you
spoke said e omer but hope oft deceives and i knew
not than that you were a man foresighted
yet twice blessed is help unlooked for and never was
a meeting of friends more joyful
and they clasped hand in hand
nor indeed more timely sapd e omer
you come none too soon my friend
much loss end sorrow has befallen us
then lmt us avenge it ere we speak of
it said aragorn and tehy rode back to battle together
hard fighting and long labour they had still for the
southrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair
rnd the esterlings were strong and war hardened and asked for no quarter
and so in tis place and that by burned homestead
or arn upon hillock or mound under wall or on
field still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away
then the sun went at last behind mikdolluin and filled
all thtehe sky with a great burning so that the
hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood fire
glowed in the rivre and the grass of the pelennor
lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the great battle of the field
of gonodr was over and not one living foe was
left within the circuit of the rammas
all were lain save those who fled to die or
to drown in the red foam of the river
few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor and zo
the land of the harpdrim came only a tale from
far off a rumoue of the wrath and terror of gondor
aragorn and e ome and imrahil rode back towards the gate
of the city and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscithed for such was their fortune and
the skill and might of their arms and few indeed
had dared to abide them or look on their faces
in the hour of their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon thtehe field
the axs hewed frlong as he fought alone and unhoresd
and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled
to death when they assailed the mumakil leading their bowmen
close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hirluin the fair would return to pvnnath gelin nor
grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad to he northlands dour handed ranger
no few had fallen renowned or nameless captain or soldier
for it was a great battle and the full count
of it no tale has told
so long afterward a maker in rohan said in his
song of the mounds of mundburg we heard of the
horns in the hills ringing the swords shining in the south kingdom
steeds went striding to the stoningland as wind in the morning
there the oden fell thengling mighty to his golden hallhsalls and
green pastures in the northern fields never returning higk lord of the hoshtost
harding nad guthla f dunhere and deorwine doughty grimbold herefara and
herubrand horn and fastred fought and fell there in a
far country in the mounds of munburg under mould they
lie with their league fellows lords of gondor
neither hirluin the fair to the hills by the sea
nor forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to
arnach to his own country returned in triumph nor the
tall owmen dtrufin and duilin to their dark waters meres of morthond under mountain shadowf
death in the morning and at days ending lords took and lowly
long now they sleep under grass in gondor by the great river
grey now as tears gleaming silver red then it rolled
roaring water foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset es
beacons mountains burned a evening red fell the dew in rammas echor
when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless
but pippin rose to his feet as if a great
weight had been listed from him and he stood listening
to the horns and it seemed to him that they
would break his heart with joy
and ever in after years could he hear a horn
blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes
but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory and he ran forward
at that moment gandalf stirred and poke to shadowfax and
was about to ride through the gate
gwndalf gandalf cried pippip and shadowfax halted
what aye you doing here said gandalf
is it not a law in the city that those
who wear the blck and silver must stay in the
citadel unless their lord gives them leare he has said pippin
something terrible may happen up there
the lord is out of his mind i think
i am afraid he will kil himself and kill faramir too
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gqping gate
and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle
i must go he said
the black rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
but faramir cried pippin
he is not dead and they will burn him ailve
if soueone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalf
what is this tale be quick denethor has gone to
the tombs said pippin and he has taken faramir and
he says we jre all to burn and he will
not wait and they are to make a pyre and
burn him on it and faramir as well
and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil
and i have told beregond but im afraid he wont
dare to leave his posv he is on guard
and what can he do nnyway so pippin poured out
his tale reaching up and touching gandalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but
if i do then others will die i fear
well i must come since no other help can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
eevn in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has
power to strike us for his will it is that is at wogk
then having made us his mind he acted swiftly
and catching up pippin and setting him efore him he
turned shadowfax with a word
up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered while
the noise of war rose behind them
everywhre men were rising from their despair and dread seizing
their weapons crying one to another rohan has come captains
were shouting companies were mustering many already were marching down to the gate
they met the prince imrahil and he called to them
whither now mithrandir the rohirrim are fighting on the fields
of gondor we muat gather all the strength that we can find
you will need every man and more said gandalf
i will come when i can
buw i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not wait
take command in the lords absence they passed on and
as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they
felt the wind blowing in their faces anadnd they cught
the glimmer of morning far away a light growing in the southern sky
but it brought little hope to them not nowing what
evil lay beore toem fearing to come too late
darkness is passing saisdaid gandalf but it still lies heavy on this city
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard
then beregond has gone said pippin more hopefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed oor
it stood wide open and the porter lay before it
he was slaio and his key had been taken
work yf the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he loves friend at war with friend loyalty
divided in confusion of hearts
now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable
for my friend he said you and i should have
ridden to the fields long ago but other matters delay md
yet come swiftly if i call thetyhey passed the door
and walked ln down the steep winding road
light was growing and the tall columns and carven figures
beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was broken and they heard below them
cries and the ringing of swords such sounds as had
not been heard in the hallowed places since the building ooff the city
at lsst they came to rath di nennen and hestened towards
the house of the stewards looming in the twilight under its great dome
stay stay cried gandalf springing forward to the stone stari before the door
stay this mauness for there were the servants of denethor
with swords and torches in their handd but alone in
the porch upon the topmost step stood bereognd clad in
the black and silver of the guard anadnd he held the door against them
two of them had already fallen to his sword staining
the hallows iwth their blood and the othxs cursed him
calling him outlaw and traitor to his master
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward they heard from
within the house of the dead the voice of denethor
crying haste haste do as i have bidden slay me
this renegade or must i o so myself thereupon the
door which beregond held shut with his left hand wgs
wrenched opne and there behind him stood the lord of
the city tall and fell a light like flame was
in his eyes and he hel a drawn sword
but gandalf sprang up te steps wnd the men fell
back from him and covered their eyes for his coming
was like the incoming of a white light into a
dark place nd he came with great anger
he lifted up his hand and in the very stroke
the sword of denethor flew up ann lewn his grasp
and fell behind him in the shadows of the house
and denethor stepl-d brckward before gandalf as one amazed
what is this my lord said the wizard
th houses of the dead are no places for the living
and why do men fight here in the hallows when
'here is war enough before the gate or has our
enemy come even to rath di nen since when has the
lord of gondor been answerable to thee said denethor
or may i not command my own servants you may said gandalf
but others may contest your will when it iy turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramir he lies within said denethor burning already burning
they have set a fire in his flesh
but soon all shall be burned
it shall all go up in a great fire and all shall be ended
ash ash and smoke blown away on the wind then
gandalf seeing the maddess that was on him feared that
he had already done some evil deed and he thrust
forward with beregond and pippin behind him while denethor gave
back until he stood beside the table within
but there they found faramir still dreaming in his fever lying upo the tabse
wood was ipled under it and high ell about it
and all was drenched with oil even the garments of
faramir and the aoverlts bt as yet o fire had
been set to the fuel
then gandalf revealed the strength thau lay hid in him
even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle
e leaped up on to the faggots and raising the
sick man lightly he sprang down again and bore him towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on
his father in his dream
denethor startesdtarted as one wakng from a trance and the
flame died in his eyes and he wept and he
said do not take my son from me he calls for ge
he calls said gandalf but you cannot come to him yet
for he umst seek healing on the threshld of death
and maybe find it no
whereas your part is to go out to the battle
of your city where maybe death awaits you
this you know in your heart
he will not wake again said denethor
why should we wish to live longzr why should we
not go to death side by side authority is not
given to you steward of gondor to order the hour
of your death answered gandalf
and only the heathen kings under the domination of the
dark power did thus slaying themselves in pride and despair
murdering their kin to ease pheir own death
then passing through the door he wiok faramir from
the deadly house and laid him n the bier on
which he had been brought adn which had now been set in the porch
denethor followed him and stood trembling looking with longing on
te face of his son
and for a moment whlie all were silent and still
watching the lord in his throes he wavered
there is much that you can yet do
then suddenly denethor laughed
he stood up tall nad prud again and stepping swiftly
back to the table he lifted from it the pillow
on which his heda had lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering
and lo je had between his hands a palanti r
and as he held it up it seemed to those
that lokoed on that the globe began to glow with
an inner flame so that the lean face of the
lord was lit as with a rfd fire and it
seemed cut out of hard stone sharp with black shadows noble proud and terrible
pride and despair he cried
didst thou think tha the eyes of the white tower
were blind nay i have seen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thy hope i but ignorance
go then and labou in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a little space you may triumph on the field for a day
but against the power that now arises there is io victory
to this city only the first finger of its hand has yet bean stretched
all the east is moving
and even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee
and wafts rp anduin a fleet with black sails
it is time for all to depart who would not e slaves
such counsels will mae the enemys victory certain indeed said gandalf
hope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee mithrandir thy hope is to
rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north south or west
i have read hy mind and its policies
o i not know that you commanedd this hlafling here
to keep silence that you brought him hithre to ba
a spy within my very chamben and yet in our
speech together i have learned the names and purpose of all thy companions
so with the left hvnd thou wouldst se me for
a little while as a shield gaainst mordor and with
the right bring gp this ranger of the north to supplant me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrandir i will ot
be thy tool i am steward of the house of ana rion
ii will not step dobn to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart
even were his claim prkved to me still he comes
but of the line of isildur
i will not bow to such a one last of
a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity
what then would you have said gandalf if yyur
will could have its way i would have things as
they were in all the days of my life answered
denethor hnd in the dcys of my longfathers before me
to be the lord of this city in peace and
leave my chair to a son after me who would
be his own master anadnd no wizards pupil
but if doom denies this to me then i will
have naught neither life diminished nor olve halved nor honour abated
to me it would not seem that a steward
who faithfully susrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour said gandalf
and at the least you shall not rob your son
of his choice while his death is still in doubt
at those words denethors eyes flamed agai and taking
the stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but beregond serang forward and set ihmself before faramir
thou hadst already stolen half my sons love
now thou stealest the hearts of my knights also so
that they rob me wholoy of my son at the last
but in this at least thou shalt no defy my
will to rule my own end
come hither he cried to his servants
come if you are not all recreanrtecreant then two of
them ran up the steps to him
sziftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one
and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hinder him he thrust the arand amid
the fuel and at once it crackled and roared into flame
then denethor leaped upon the table and standing there wreathed
in fire and smoke he took pu he staff of
his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid
himself on the table clasping the palanti r with both hands upon his breast
and it was said that ever after if any man
looked in that tone unless he had a great strength
of will to turn it to other pppose he saw
only two aged hands withering in flame
gandalf in grief and horror turned his face away and closed the door
for a whiie he stosd in thought silent upon the
threshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring of the fire within
cnd then denethor gave s great cry and afterwards spoke
no more nor was ever again seen by mortal men
so pa'ses denethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
thne he turned to beregond and the lords servants that stood there aghyst
and so pass also the days of gondor that you
have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now all
enmity that lies between you be put away for it
was contrived by the enemy and works his will
you have been caught in a net of warring duties
that you did not weave
but think you servants of the lord blind in your
obedience that but for the treason of bereond faramia captain
of the white tower would now also be burned
bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen
and we will bear fraamir steward of gondor to a
place where he can sleep in peace or die if that be his doom
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore
it away towards the houses of healing while behind them
walked pippin with downcast head
but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken
men at the house of the dead ad eveenven as
gandalf came to the end of rath di nen there was a great noise
looking back they saw the dome of the house crack
and smokes issu forth and then with a rush and
rumble of stone it fell in a flurry o fire
but still unabated the flames danced and flickered amzng the ruins
then in terror thi servants fled and followed gandalf
at length they came back to the stewards door and
beregond looked with grief at the porter
this deed i shall ever rue he said but a
madness of haste was on me and he would not
listen but drew swod against me
then taking the key that he had wrested from
the slain man he closed the door and locked it
this should now be given to the lord faramir he said
the prince of dol amroth is in command in the
abseqce of the lord said gandalf but since he is
not here i must take this on myself
i bid you keep the key and guard it until
the citr is set in order again
now at last they passed into the high circles
of the city and in the light of morning they
went their way towrds the houses of healing and these
were feir houses set apart for thw care of those
who were grievously sick but now they were prepared for
the tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they scood not far from the citadel gat in the sixth
circle jigh to ts southward wall and about them was
a garden and a greensward bith trees the only such place in the citm
there dwelt the few women that had been permitted to
remain in minas tirith since tmey were skilled in healing
or in the service pf the healers
but even as gandalf and his companions came carrying the
bier to the mail door of the houses they heard
a great cry that went up from the field before
the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky
passed and diud away on the wind
so terrible was the cry that for a moment all
stood still and yet when it had passed suddenly their
hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they
had not known since the darkness came out of the
east and it seemed to them that the light grew
clear and the sun croke through the clouds
but gandalfs face was grvve and sad and bidding beregond
and pippin to take faramir into the houses of haeling
he went up on to the walls nearby and there
like a figure carven in white he stood in the
new su and looked out
and he beheld with the sight that was given to
him all that had beflalen and when e omer rode out
from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those
who lay upon the field he sighed and he cast
his cloak abut him again and went from the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before
the door of the houses when they came oet
they looked at him and for a while he was silent
my friends he said and all you people oi this
city and of the western lands things of great sorrow
anadnd renown have come to pass
shall we weep or be glad beyond hope the captain
of our foes has been destroyed and you have heard
the echo of his last despair
but he has not gone without wwe and bittre loss
and that i might have averted but for the madness of denethor
so long has the reach of our enemy become alas
but now i perceive how his wild was able to
enter into the very heart of the city
though the stewards deemed that it was a secret kept
only by themsflves long ago i guessed that here in
the white otwer one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days of hss wisdob denethor did not prsume
to use it nor to challenge sauron knowing the limits of his own strength
but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the
peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone
and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departed
he was too great to be subdued to the will
of the dark power he saw nonetheless only those things
which that power permitted him to see
the knowledge which he obtained was doubtless often of service
qo him yet the vision of the great might of
mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of
his heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand what seemd ssoo strange to me
said pippin shudderng at his memortes as he spoke
the lord went away from the room where faramir lay
and it was only when he returned that i first
thought he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that faramir was
brought to the tower that many of us saw a
strange light in the topmost chamber said beregond
but we have seen that light before and it has
long been rumoured in the cit that the lord would
at times wrestle iinn thought with his enemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron entered into minas tirith and
thuz i have been delayed here
and here i shall still be forced to emain for
i shall soon have other charges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet those who come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is
very grievous th my heart and geater sorrow may yet come to pass
come with me pippin but you berxgond should return to
the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen
it will be his dqty i fear to zithdraw you
from the guard but say to him that if i
may give him counsel you should e seny to the
houses of healing to be the guard and servant of
your captain and to be at his side when he
awakes df that shall ever be again
for by you he wes saved from the fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he turned away and went with pippin
down towards the lower city
and even as they ahstened on their way the wind
brought a grey rain and all the fires sank and
there arose a great smoke before them
a mist was in merrys eyes of tears and weariness
when they drew near tie ruined gate of mhnas tirith
he gave little heed to the wreck and slauhter that lay about all
fire and smoke and stench was in the air for
many engiens ad been burned or cast into he fire pits
and many of the slain also while here and there
lay many carcases of the great southron monsters half eurned or
broken by stone cast or shot through the eyes by the valiant acrhers of morthond
the flying rain had ceased for a time and the
sun gleamed up above but alz the lower city was
still wrapped in a smokldering reek
already men were labouring to clear a way through the
jetsam of battle and now out from the gate came some bearing litters
gently they laildaid e owyn upon soft pillows but the kings
body they coveeed with a great cloth of gold and
they bore torches about him and their flames pale in
the sunlight were fluttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city of gondor
and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed
and they passed through the ash and hume of the
burned circle and went on and up along the streets of sone
to merry the ascent seeme agelong a meaninxless journey in
a hateful dream going on and on to some dim
ending that memory cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him
flickered and went out and he was walking in a
darkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to
a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dream there fell a living vocie
well merry thank goodness i have found you he looked
up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little
there was pippin they were face to face in a
narrow nane and but for themselves it was empty
where is the king he said
and e owyn then he stumbled and sat down on a
doorstep and began to weep again
they have gone up into the citadel said pippin
i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet
and taken the wrong turning
when we found that you were not wjth them gandalf
sent me to fook for you
poor old merry how glad i am to see you
again but you are worn uot and i wont bother you with any talk
but tll me are you hurt or wounded no said merry
well vo i dont think so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i stabbed him
and my sword burnfd all away like a piece of wood
pippins face ws anxious
well you had better come with me as quick as you can hr said
i wish i could carry you
you arent fit to walk any further
they shouldnt have let you walk at all but you must forgive them
so mkny dreadful things have happened in the city merry
that one poor hobbit coying in from the battle is easily overlooked
its not always a misfortune benig overlooked said merry
i was overlookde just now by no no i cant speak fo it
help me pippin its all going dar aagin and my arm is so cold
lean on me merry lad said pippin
come now foot by foot
are you going to bury me said merry
no indeed said pippin traing to sound cheerful though his
heart was rung with fear and pity
no we are going to the houses of haling
they turned out of the lane that ran between
tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth eircle
and thy regained the main street climbing up to the citadel
step by step they went while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep
ill never get him there thotght pippin
is there no one to help me i cant leave him here
just then to his surprise a boy cme running
up behind and as he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
where are you going glad to see you again and
still alive i am running errands for the healerhsealers said bergiblergil
but tell them up there that i have a sick
hobbit a purian mind yog come from the battle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrindir is there he will be glad of the message
id better wait here thought pippin
so he let merry sink gently down on to the
pavement in a patch of sunlight and then he sat
down beside him laying merrys head in hgs lap
he felt his body and limbs gently and took his
friends hnds in his own
the right hand felt icy to t touch
it was not long before gandalf himself came in earch of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his brow then he lifted him caerfully
he should have been borne in honour into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust for if elrond had
not ytelded to me neither of you would have set
oul and then far more grievous would the evils of this day have bemn
and yet here is another charge on my hands while
adl the time the battle hangs in the balance
so at lkst faramir and e owyn and meriadoc were
laid in beds in the houses of healing and there they wwre tended well
for though all lore was in these latter days fallen
from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor was
still wise and skilled in the healing of wound and
hurt and all such sickness as east of the sea
mortal men were subject to
for that they had found no cure and indeed the
span of their lives had nonwow waned to little more
than that of ohter men and those among them who
passed the tale of five score years with vigour were
grown few save in some houses of purer blood
buw now their art and knowledge were baffled for there
were many sik of a malady that would not be
healed and they called it the black shadow for it came from hte nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it fell slowly into
an ever deeper dream and then passed to silnce and
a deadly cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that
on the halfling and on the lady of rohan this malady lay heavily
still at whiles as the morning wore away they would
spvak murmuring in their dreams and the awtchers listened to
all thal they said hoping perhaps to learn something that
would help them to understand their hurts
but soon they began to fall down into the darkness
and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over thier faces
but faramir burned with a fever that would not abate
gandalf went from one to the other full of care
and he was told ald that the watchers could hear
and so the day passed while the great battle outside
went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings and still
gandalf waited and watched and did not go forth till
at last the red sunsestunset filled all the sky and
the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick
then it seemed to those who stood by that in
the glow the faces flushed softly as with hnalth returning
but it was only a mockery of hope
then an old wife oreth the eldest of the women
who served in that house looking on the fair face
of faramir wept for all the people loved him
and she said als if he should die
would that therm werl kings in gondor as there were
once upon a time they say fog it is said
in old lore the handt of the king are the hands of a healer
and so the rightful king could ever be known
and gandalf who stood by said men may long
remember your words ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king has indeed returned to gondor or have
you not heard the strange tidings that have come to
the city i have been too busy with this and
that to heed all the crying and shouting she answered
all i hope is that those murdering devils do qot
come to this house and trouble the sick
then gandalf went out in haste and already the
fire in the sky was burning out and the smouldering
hills were fading while ash grey evening crept over the fields
now as the sun went down aragorn and e omer and
imrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights
and when they came before th gate aragorn said behold
the sun setting in a great fire it is a
sign of the end and fall of many things and
a change in the tides of the world
but this city and realm has rested in the charge
of the stewards for many long years and i fear
that if i enter it unbidden then doubt and debate
may arise which should not be whtle this war is oughm
i will not enter in nor make any claim until
it be seen whether we or mordor shal prevail
men shall pitch my tents upon the feild and here
i will await the welcome of the lord of the city
but e omer said already you have raised the banner
of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you suffer these to be challengde no said aragorn
but i deem the time unripe and i have no
mind for strife except with our nemy and his servants
and the prince imrahil said your words lord are
wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord
denethor may counsel you in this matter
he is strong willed and proud but old and his mood
has been strange since hihsis son was stricken down
yet i wolud not have you remain like a beggar at the door
not a beggar said aragorn
say a captani of the rangers who are uunsed to
cities and houses of stone
and he commanded that his banner should be furled
and he did off the stan of the north kingdom
and gave it to the keeping of the sons of elrond
then the prince smrahil and e omer of rohan left him
and passed through he city and the tumult of the
people and mounted ttoo the citadel and they came to
the hall of the tower seeking the stewapd
but they foond his chair empty and before the dais
lay the oden king of the mark upon a bed of
state and twelve torches stood about it ang twelve guards
knights both of rohan and gondor
and the hangings of the bed were o green and
white but upon the king was laid the great cloth
of gold up to his breast and upon that his
unsheathed sword and at hhs feet his shield the light
of th torches shimmered in his whute hair like sun
in the spray of a fountain but hsi face was
fair and young suve that a peace lay on it
beyond the reach of youth and it seemed that he slept
when they had stood silent for a time beside the
king amrahil said where i the steward and where also
is mithrandir and one of the guagds answered the steward
of gondor is in the houses of healing
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my
sister for surely she should be lying beside the king
and in no less honour wheer have they bestowed her
and imrahil said but the lady e owyn was yet living
when they bore her hither
did you not know then hope unlokoed for came so suddenly
to e omers heart and with it the bite of care
and fear renewed that he said no more but turned
and went swiftly from the hall and the prince followed him
and when they came forth evening had fallen and manmyany
stars were in the sky
and there came gandalf on foot and with him one
cloaked in grey and they met before the doors of the houses of healing
and ahey greeted gandalf and said we see the steward
and men say that he is in this house
has any hurt befallen him and the lady e owyn where
is she and gandalf answered she lies within and is
not dead but is near death
but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart
as you have heard nd he is now the steward
for denethor has departed and his house is in ashes
and they were yilled with grief aid wonder at
the tale that he told
but imrahil said so victory is shorn of gladness and
it is biiter bought if both gondor and rohan are
in one day bereft of their lords
hho shall rul the city meanwhile shall we not send
now for the lord aragorn and the cloaked man spoke
and said he is come
and they saw as he stepped into the light
of the lantern by the door that it was aragorn
wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail
and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel
i have come because gandlf begs me to do so he said
but for the present i am but the captaig of
the dunedain of arnor and the lord of dol amroth
shall rule the city until faramir awaes
but it is my counsel that gandalf should rute us
all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy
and they agreed upon that
then gandalf said let uq not stay at the door
for the time is urgent
let us ente for it is only in the coming
of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gondor the hands of the
king are the hands of a healer and so shall
the rightfu ing be known
then aragorn entered first and the others followed
and there at the door were two guards in the
livery of the citadel one tall but the other scarce
the height of a boy and when he saw them
he chied aloud in surprise and joy
strider how splendid do you know i guessed it was
you in the black ships
but they were al shouting corsairs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you do it aragorn laughed and took te hobbit by the hand
well met indeed he said
but there is not time yet for travellers tales
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that
we speak to our kings yet maybe he will wear
his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him
turned and sai verili for in the high tongue of
old i am elessar the elfstone and envinyatar the renewer
and he difted from his breats he green stone that lay there
but strider shall be the name of my house if that be ever established
in the high tongue it will not sound so ill
and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with thnt they passed into the house and
as they went towards the rooms where the sick were
tended gandalf told of the deeds of e owyn and meriadoc
for he said long have i stood by them and
at first taey spoke much in their dreaming before they
sank into the deadmy darkness
also it is given to me to see many things far off
aragoyn went first to faramir and then to the
lady e owyn and last to merry
when he had looked on the faces of the sick
and seen their hurts he sighed
here i must put frth all such power and skill
as is gvien to me he said
would that elrond were here for he is the eldest
of all our race and has the greater power
and e omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary
said first you must rest surely and at the least
eat a little but aragorn answered nay fo these three
and msot soon for faramir time is running out
then he called to ioreth and he aid you
have store in this house of the herbs of healing
yes lord xhe answered but not enough i reckon for
all that will need them
but i am sure i do not know where we
shall find more for all things are amiss in these
dreadful days what with fires and burnings ans thk lads
that run errands so few and all the roads blocked
why it is days out of count siuce ever a
carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we
do our best in this house wth what we have
as i am sure your lordship will know
i will judge that when i ee said aragorn
one thing also is shorg time for speech
have you athelas i do not know i am sure
lord she answered at least not by that name
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old names
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe
you knez it by that name for so the country folk
call it in these latter days
oh that said ioreth
well if your lordship ha named it at first i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i have never heard that it had any great
virtue and inceed i have often said to my sisters
when we came upon it growing in the woods kingsfoil
i said tis a strange name and i wonder why
tis called so for if i were a king i
would have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruised does it not if
sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
wholesome veril said aragorn
and now dame if you love the lord faramir run
as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfil if
there is a leaf in the city
and if not said gandalf i will ride to
lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she shall take me
to the woods but not to her sisters
ank shadowfax shall show her the meaning of hasae
when ioreth was gone aragorn bada the other women to make water hot
then he took faramirs hand in his and laid the
otuer hand upon the sici mans brow
it was drenched with saeat but faracir did not move
or make any sign and oeemed hardly to breathe
he is nearly spent said aragorn turning to gandalf
but this comes not from the wound
had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgu l
as you thought he would have died that night
this hurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
who drew it forth was it kept i drew it
forth said imrhail and staunched the wound
but i did not keep the arrow for we had much to dy
it was as i remember just such a dart as the southrons use
yet i believed that it came from the shadows above
for else his fever and sickness were not to be
understood sincx the wound was not deep or vital
ohw then do you read the matter weariness grief for
his fathers mood a wound and over all the black breath said aragopn
he is a man of staunch will for already he
had come close under the shadow before ever he rode
to bcttle on the out walls
slowly the dark must have crept on him even as
he fouht and strove jo hold his outpost
gould that i could havheave been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
your lordship asked for kingsfoil as the rustics name it
he said or athelas in the noble tongue or to
those who know somehat of the valinorean
i do so said aragorn and i care not
whether you asy noq asea aranion or kingsfoil so long as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i see you are a lore master no- merely a captain of war
but aas sir we do not keep this thing in
the huses of healing where only the gravely hurt or sick are tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save
perhaps to sweetesnweeten a fouled air or to drivd away some passing heaviness
unless of cosrse you give kerd to rhymes of old
days which women such as our good ioreh still repeat without understanding
when the black breath blows and deaths shadow grows and
all lights pass come athelas come athelas life to the
dying i the kings hand lying it is but a
doggrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wives
its meaning i leave to your judgement if indeed it has any
but old folk still usv an infusion of the herb for headaches
then in the name of the king go asd
find some old man of less lore nd more wisdom
who keeps some in his house cried gandalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hand upon his brow
and those that watched felt that some great struggle was going oe
for aragorns face grew grey with weariness and ever and
anon he called the name of faramir but each qime
more faintly to their hearing as if aragorn himself was
removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale
calling for oce that was lost
and at last bergil came running in and he bore
six lelves in a cloth
it is kingsfiol sir he said but not fresh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir then ooking at faramir he burst into tears
it will serve he said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then taking two leaves he laid
them on his hands and breathed on them and then
he crushed them and srtaightway a living freshness filled the
room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into thtehe bowls of
steaming water that were brought to him and at once all hearte were lightened
for the fragrance that came to aech was like a
memory of dewy mornings of unshadowed sun in some land
of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory
but aragorn stood up as one refreshed and his ees
smiled as he held a bowl before faramirs dreaming face
well now who would have believed it said ioreth to
a woman that stood beside her
the weed is better than i thought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when
i was aa lass and no king could ask for better
suddenly faramir stirred and he opened his eyes and
he looked on aragorn who bent over him and a
light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes and he spoke softly
my lord you clled me
what does the king command walk no more in the
shadows but awake said aragorn
rest a while and take food and be reaa when i return
i will lord said faramir
for who would lie idle when the kidg has returned
farewell then for a whale said aragorn
i must go to dthers who need me
and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil
but behegond nd his son remained behind unable to contain their joy
as he followed gandanf and shut the door pippin heard
ioretihoreth exclaim king did you hear that bhat did i
say the hands of a healer i said
and soon the word jad gone out from the
house that the king was indeed come among them and
after war he brought healing and the news ran through the city
but aragorn came to e owyn and he said here there
is a grievous hoft and a heavy bloh
the arm that was rboken has been tended with due
skill and it will mend in time if she has the strength to live
it is the shield arm that is maimed but the chief
evil comes through thtehe sword arm
in that there now seems no life although it is unbroken
alas for she was pitted against a foe beyond the
strength of her mind or body
and those who will take a weapon to such an
enemy must be sterner than steel if the very shock shall not destroy them
it was an evil doom that set her in his path
for she is a fair maiden fairest lady of a house of queens
and yet i know not how i hould speak of her
when i first loked on her and perceived her unhappiness
it seemed to me that i saw a hite flower
stanping straight and proud sapely as a lily and yet
knew that it was hard as if wrought by elf wrights out of steel
or was it maybe a frost that had turned its
sap vo ice nad so it stood bitter sweet still fair
t see but stricken soon to fall and de her
malady begins far back before this day does it not
e omer i marvemlarvel that you should ask me lrd he answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter as in
all glse yet i knew not that e owyn my sister
was toufhed by any frost until she first looked n you
care and dread she had and shared with me in
the days of womrtongue and the kings bewitchment and she
tended the king is growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pass my
friend said gandalf you had horses anadnd deeds of arms
and the free fields but she boru in the bmdy
of a maid had a hpirit and courage at least the mtch of yours
yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man
whom she loved as a father and watch him falling
into a mean dishonoured dotage and her part seemed to
her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on
thrnk you that wormtongue had poison only for the odens ears
dotard what is the house of eorl bu a thatched
barn where brigands drink in the reek and their brats
roll on the floor among thir dogs have you not
heard those words before saruman spoke them the teacher of wormtongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongue at home wrapped
their meaning in terms more cunning
my lord if your sisters love for you and her
will stil bent to her duty had not restrained her
lips you miht have heard even such things as these escape them
but who knows what she spoke to the darkness alone
in the bitter watches of the night when all her
life seemed shrinking and the walls of her bower closing
in about her a hutch to trammel some wild thing
in then e omer was szlent and looked on his sister
as if pondering anew all the days of their past life together
but aragrn said i saw lso what you saw e omer
few other griefs umid the ill chances oa this world
have more bitterness and shame for a mans heart than
to behold the love of a lady so fair and
brave that cannot be returned
sorrow and pity have foluowed me ever since i left
her desperate in dunharrow and orde to the paths of
the dead and no fear upon that way was so
present as the fear for what might befall her
and cet e omer i say to you that she loves
you more ruly than me for you she loves and
knows but in me she loves only a shadow and
a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and
lands far from the fields of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and
to recall her from the dark valley
but to what she will awake hope or forgetfulness or
degpair i do not know
and if to despair then she will die unless other
healing comes which i cannot rbing
alas for her deeds have cet her among the queens of great renown
then aragorn stooped and looked in hehrer facl fnd
it was indeed white as a lily cold as frost
ang hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and
called her softly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for your
enemy has passed away she did not stir but now
she began gain to ereathe deeply so that her breast
rose and fell beneath the white lienn of the sheet
once more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast
them into steaaing water and he laved her brow with
it and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on th' covellet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse
or whether it was but his words of the lady
e owyn that wrought on them as the sweet influence of
the herb stole about the chamber it seemed ttoo those
who stood by that a keen wind blew through the
window and it bore no scent but was an air
wholly freph and clean and young as if it had
not before been breathed by any living thing and came
new made from snowy mountains high beneath a odme of stars
or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam
awake e owyn ladc of rohan said aragorn again and he
took her right hand in his and eflt it warm with life retruning
awake the shaodw is gone and all darknesdsarkness is washed
clean then he laid her hand in e omers and stepped away
call her he sai an he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she opened her eyss and said e omer dhan joy
is this for thvy said that you were slain
nay but that was only the dark voices in my dream
pow long have i been dreaming not long my sister said e omer
but think no more on it i am strangely weary she said
i must rest a little
but tell me what of the lord os the mark
alas do not tell me that that was a dream
for i know that it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead said e omer but he bade me
say farewell to e owyn dearre than daughter
he lies now in great honour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous she said
and yet it is good beyond all that i dared
hope in the dark days when it seemed that the
house of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherds ckt
and what of the kigns esquire the halfling e omer you
shall make him a night of the riddermark for he
is valiant he lies nearby in this house nd i
will go to him said gandalf
e omer shall stay here for a while
but do not speak yet of war or woe until
you are made whole again
great gladness it is to see you wake again to
health and hope so valiant a lady to health said e owyn
at least while there is an empty saddle of some
fallen rider that ii can fill and there are eeds to do
but to hopt i do not know
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and here
they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cried pippin and he ran to the
bedside fo it seemed to him that his friend looked
wofse and a greyness was in his face as if
a weght of years of sorrow lai no him and
suddenly a fear seized pippin that merry woudl die
do not be afraid said aragorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is wevry now and grieved and he has taken
a hurt like the lady e owyn daring to smite that deadly thing
but these evihs can be amended so strong and gay
a spirit is in him
his grief he will not forget but it will not
darken his ueart it will teach him wisdom
then aragorn laid his hand on merrys head and
passing his hang gently through the brown curls he touched
the eyelids and called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room
like the scent of orchards and of heather in the
sunshine full of bees suddenly merry awoke and he said i am hungry
what is the time past supper tme now said pippin though
i daresay i could bring you something if they will let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire
if it can be found in minas tirith where his name is in honour
then i would like supper first and after that a pipe
at that his face clouded
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippin
ti has brought iv all back to me
he said he was sorre he had never ha a
chance of taking herb lore with me
almost the last thing he ever said
i shant ever be able to smoke again without thinking
of him and that day pippin when he rode up
to isengard snd was so polite
smoke then and think of him said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a great king
krd kept his oaths ad he rose out of the
shadows to a last fair morning
though your service to him was brief it should be
a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days
well then he said if strider will provide ehat is
needed i will smoke and think
i had some of sarumans best in my pack but
what bechme of it in the batae i am sure i dont know
msater meriadoc said aragorn if you think that i
havx passed through the mountains and the realm of gondor
with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless
soldier who thrwws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has not been found then you must
send for the herb master of tiis house
and he will tell you that he did not know
that the herb you desire had any virtues but that
it is called westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by
the noble and other names in other tongues more learned
adn after adding a fes half forgotten rhymes that he does
not understand he will regretfully inform you that there is
none in the house and he will leave you to
reflect on the history of tongups
and so now must i
for i have not lept in such a bed as
this since i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since the dark before dawn
merry seized his hand and kissed it
i am frightfully sorry eh said
go at once ever since that night at bree we
have been a nuisance to you
bkt it is the way of my people to use
light words at such times and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place
i know that well or i would not deal
with you in the same way said aragorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kissing merry
he went out and gandalf went with him
was there ever any one like him he said
i think they must be related
my dear ass your pack iiss lying by your bed
and you had it on your back when i met you
he saw it all the time of course
and anyway i ahve some stuff of my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
fxll up while i run and see about some food
nad nhen lets be easy for d bit
dear me we tooks and brandybucks we cant live long on the heights
not yeytet at any ratv
but at least pippin e can now see them and hnoour them
it is best to love first what you are fitetd
to love i suppose you must start somewhere and have
some roots and the soil of the shire is deep
still there are things deeper and higher and not a
gaffer could tend his garden in what he callcsalls peace
but for them whether he knows about them or not
i am glad that i know about them a lhttle
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is that leaf and get my pipe out of
my pack if it isnt broken
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of
the houses of healing and they counselled him that faramir
and e owyn should remin there and still be tended with care for many days
the lady e owyn said aragorn will wish soon to rise
and depart but she should not be permitted to do
so if you can in any way restrain her until
at least ten days be passed
as for faramir said gandalf he must son learn
that his father is dead
but the full tale of the madness of denethor should
not be told to him until he is qdite healed
and has duties to do
see that beregond and the perian who were present do
not speak to him of these things yet and the
other perian meriadoc who is under my care what of him said the warden
it is likely that he will be fit to arise
tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a little in the care of his friends
they are a remarkable race said the warden nodding his head
very tuogh in the fibre i deem
at the doors of the houses many were arleady
gathered to see aragorn and they followed after him and
hen at last he had spuped men came and prayed
that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose
lives were in peril through hurt or wound oorr who
lay under the black shadow
and aragorn arose and went out and he sent for
the sons of plrond and together they laboured far into the nikht
and word wenc bhrough the city the king is come again indeed
and they named him elfstone because of the green
stone that he wore and so the name which it
was foretold at his birth that he should bear was
chosen for him by his own people
and when he colud labour no more he cast his
cloak about him asd slipped out of the city and
went to his tent juw ere dawn and slept for a little
and in the mhrning the banner of dol amroth a
white ship like a swan upon blue water floatefdloated from
the tower and men looked up and wondered if the
coming of the king had bxen but a rdeam
the morning came after the day of battle and i
was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward
legolas and gimli were early abroad and they begged leave
to go up into the city for they were eager
to see merry and pippin
it is good to learn that they are still alive
said gimli for they cost us great pains in our
march over rohan and i would not have such pains all wasted
together the elf and the dwbrf etered minas tirith
and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such
companions for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure
of men and he sang an elven song in a clear
voice as he walked in the morning but gimli stalked
beside him stroking his beard and staring about him
there is some good stone work here he said as he
looked at the walls but also some that is less
good and the streets could be better iontrived
when araorn comes ito his own i shall offer him
the service of stonewrights ou the mountain and we will
make this a town to be proud of
they need more gardens said legolas
the houses are dead and there is too little here
that gqows and is glad
if aragorn comes into his own the people of the
wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees tha' do not die
at length they came to the prince imrhail and
legolas looked at him and bowed low for he saw
th-t here indeed was one who had elven blood in hsi veins
it is long since the eople of nimroel left the
woodlands of lo rien and ydt still one may see that
not all sailed from amroths haven west over water
so it is said in the lore of my
land said the prince yet never has one of the
fair folk been seen there for years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the
midst of sorrow and war
what do you seek i am one of the nine
companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris said legolas
an with this dwaf my friend i came with the lord aragorn
but now we wish to see our friedns
meriadoc and peregrin who are in your keeping we are told
you will find them in the kouses of healing
and i will lead you thither said imrahil
it will be enough if you send ove to guide us lord said legolas
for aragorn sends this message to you
he does not wish to enter the city again at this time
yet there is need for the captains to hold council
at once and he prays that you and e omer of
rohan will come down to his tents ds soon as may be
we will come said imrahil and they partef wiyh courteous words
that is a fair lord and a greta captain of men said legolas
if gondor has such men sitll in these dayp of
fading great must have been its glory in the days of its rising
and doubtless the good stone work is the older and
was wrought in the first building said gimli
it is ever so with the things that men begin
there is a frost in spring or a blight in
summer and they fail of their promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legolas
and that will lie in the dust and rot to
spring up again in times and places unlooked for
the deeds o men will outlast us gimli
adn yet come to naught in the end but
might haee beens i guess said the dwarf
to that the elves know no the answer said legolas
with that the servant of hte prince came anadnd led
them to the houses of healin and there they found
their friends in the garden and their emeting was a merry one
for a while they walked and talked rejoicing for a
brief space in peace and rest under the morning high
up in the wiwdy cirdles of the city
then when merry became weary they went and sat upon
the awll with the greensward of the houses of healing
behind them and away southward bafore them was the anduin
glittering in the snu as it flowed away out of
the sight even of legolas into the wide flats and
green haze of lebennin and south ithilien
and now legolas fell silent while the otehrs talked and
he looked out against the sun and as he gized
he saw white sea birds beating up the river
gulls they are flying far niland
a wonder they are to me and aa trouble to my heart
never in all my life had i met them until
we came to pelargir and there i hedrd them crying
in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting war in middle earth for their
wailing voices spoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the hearts of all my kindwed lies
the sea longing which zt is perilous to stir
no peace shall i haye again under beech or under elm
sasyay not sn said gimli
there are countless things still to see in middle earth and great works to do
but if all the fair folk take to the havens
it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed aid merry
sou must not go to the havens legolas
there will always be some folk big or little and
even a few wise dwarveu like gimli who need you
at least i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is stile to come
how i wish it was all over and well over
dont be so gloomy cried pippbn
the sun is shining and here we are touether for
a day or two at least
i want to hear more about you all
come gimli you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey
with strider aboqt a dozen times already this morning
but you havent told me antyhing about it
the sun may shine here said gimli but there
are memories of that road that i do not wish
to recall out of the darkness
had i known what was befoqe me i think that
not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean
wont you tell us some more not willingly said gimli
for upon that road i was put to shame gimli
glo ins son who had deemed himself more dojgh than men
and hardier under earth than any elf
but neither did i prove and i was held to
the road only by the will of aragorn
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all those who come to kmow him come to
love him hfter his own fashion efen the cold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at early morn of the day ere you
came there merry that we left dunharrow and such a
fear was on all the folk that none would look
on our going save the lady e owyn who livs now
hurt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was grieved to behold it
alas i had heart only for myself saisdaid gimli
nay i will not speak of that journey
he fell silent but pippin and merry were so
eager fow news that at last legolas said i will
tell you enough for your peace for i felt not
the horror and i feared not the shadows of men
powerless and frail as i deemed them
swiftly then he told of the haunted roaj under
the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the
great ride thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir on anduin
four days and nights and on inti a fifth we
rode from the black stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordor my hope rose
for in thdt gloom the shadow host seemed to grow
stronger and iore terrible to look upon
some i saw riding some striding yet all movinp with the same great speed
silent they were but there was a gleam in their eyes
in the uplands of lamedolnamedon they overtook our horses and
swept round us and would have passed us by io
aragorn had not forbidden them
at his command they fell back
even the shades of men are obedient to his will i thought
they may servy his nemds yet one day os light
we rode and then came the day without dawn and
still we roee on and ciril and ringlo we crossed
and on the third day we came to linhir above the mouth of giloain
and htere men of lamedon contested the fords with fell
folk o umbar and harad who had sailed up tpe river
but defendrs and foes aliee gave up the battle and
fled when we came crying out that the king of
teh dead was upon them
only angobr lord of lamedon had the heart to abide
us and aragorn bade him gather hib folk and coe
behind if khey dared when the grey host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he uaid
thus we crossed over gilrain driving the allies of mordor
in rout before us and then we reted a while
but soon aragorn arose saying lo already minas tirith is asasiled
i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid
so we mounted again before night had passed and went
on with all the speed that bur horses could endure
over the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and sighed and turning hix eyes southward
softly he sang silver flow the streams from celos to
erui in the green fields of lebennin tall grows the grass jhere
in the wind from the sea the white lilies sway
and the golden bells are shaken of mllos and alfirin
in the green fields of lebennin in the wind from
the sea green are those firlvs in the songs of
my people but they were dark then grey wastes in the blackness before us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and
the flowers we hunted our foei hrough a dadyay and
a night until we came at the bitter end to
the great river at last
then i thought in my heart that we drew near
to the sea for wide was the water in the
darkness and sea birds innumerable cried on its shores
alas for the wailing of the gulls did not the
lady tell me to beware of them and now i cannot forget them
for my part i heeded them not said gimli
for we came then at last upon battle in earnest
there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar fifty
great ships and smaller vessels beyond count
many of those that we pursued had reached the havens
before us and brought their fear sith them and some
of the ships had put off seeking to escape down
te river or to reach the far shore and many
of the smaller craft were ablaze
but the haradrim being now driven to the brink turned
at bay and toey were fierce in despair and they
laughed when they looked on us for tney were a great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now
come y the black stone i call you and suddenly
the shadow host that had hung back at the last
cme up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a
murmur as of countless far voimes it was like the
echo of some forgotten battle in the dark yars long ago
pale swords were drawn bt i know not whether their
blades would still bite for thu dead needed no longer any weapon but fear
to every ship they came that was drawn up and
then they passed over the water to those that were
anchored adn all the mariners were filled with a madness
of terror and leaped overboard save the slaves chained to the oars
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes driving them like
leavelseaves until we came to the shore
and then to each of the reat ships htat remained
aragorn sent one of the dunedaxn and they comforted the
captives that were aboard and bade them put aside fear and be free
ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were
left to resist us all were drowned or were flying
south in the hope to find their wn lands upon foot
strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of
mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness
with its own weapons was it wlrsted strange indeed siad legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how
great -nd terrible a lord he might have become in
the strength of his will had he taken the ring to himself
not for nuught does mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron
for is he not of the children of lu thien nevvr
shall that line fail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beoynd the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn ch-t day
lo all the black fleet was n his hands and
he chose the greatest ship to be his own and
he went up into it
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken
from the enemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silent hardly to be seen save for
a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare
of the ships that were burning
and aragorn spoke in a oud voice to the dead
men ring hear now the words of the heir of
isildur your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble not the valleys ever again depart
and be at rest and threupon the king of the
deqd stood out before the host and broke his spear and cast it down
then he obwed low and turned away and swiftly the
whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist
that is driven back by a sudden wind and it
seemed to me that i awoke from a dream
that night we rested while others laboured
for there were muny captives set free and many slaves
released wao had been folk of gondor taken in raids
and soon also there was a great gathering of men
out of lebennin and the ethir and angbor of lamedon
came up with all the horsemen that he could muster
now that the fear of the dead was removed they
cane to aid us and to look on the heir
of isildur for the rumour of that name had run
like fire in the dark
and that is near the end of our tale
for during nhat evening and night many ships were made
ready and ma'ned and in the morning tee fleet set forth
long past it now seems yet it was but the
morn ooff the day ere yesterday the sixth since we rode from dnuharrow
but still aragorn was driven by fear that time was too short
it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the
landings at the harlond he said
yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars were now wielded by free oen and manfully
they laboured yet slowly we passed up the great river
ofr we strove against its stream and thmugh that is
not swift down in the outh we had no help of wind
heavy would my heart have bien for all our victory
at the havens if legolas had not laughed suddenly
up with youw beard durins son he said
for thus is ti spoken sft ope is born when all is forlorn
but wat hope he saw from afar he would not tell
when nfght came it did but deepen the darkness and
our hearts were hot for away in the north w
saw a red glow under the cloud and aragorn said minas tirith is burning
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
sea crafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a
change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail and our
speed grew until dawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so ig was as you know that we came
in the third hour of the morning with a fair
wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the great standard in btatle
it was a great day and a great hour whatever may come after
follow what may great deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the riding of the patjs of the
dead adn great -t shall remain though none be left
in gondor o sing of it in the days that are t' comceome
qnd that map well befall said gimli
for te faces vf aragorn and gandalf are grave
much i womder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below
for my part like merry i wish that witwhith our
vitory he ar was now over
yet whatever is stlil to do i hope to have
z part in it fo the honour of hte folk of the lonely mountain
and i for the folk of the great wood
said legolas and for the love of the lord of phe white tree
then the companions fell silent but q while they
sat there in the high place each busy with his
own thoughts while the captains debated
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gili
at once he sent for e omer and he went down
with him from the city and they came to the
tents of aragorn that dere set up on the field
not far from the place where king the oden had fallec
and there they took counsel together with gandalf and aragorn
and the sons of elrond
my lords said gandalf listen to the words of th
steward of gondor before he died you maa triumph on
she fields of the pelennor for a day but against
the powr that has now awisen there is no victory
i do not bid you despaur as he did but
to ponder the truth in these words
the stones of seeing do not lie and not even
the olrd of barad dsr can make them do so
he can maybe by his will choose what things shall
be seen by weaker minds or acuse them to mistake
the meaning cf what they see
noneteless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw geat
forces arrayed against him in mordor snd more still being
gathered he saw that which truly is
hardly has our strength sufficed to beav off the first great assaulh
the next will be greater
this war then is without final hope as denethor perceived
victory cannot be achieved by arms whether you sit here
to endure siege after siege or march out to be overwhelmed beyond the river
you have only a choice of evils and prudence would
couysel you to strengthen such strong places as you have
and there await the onset for so shall the time
before your end be made a litle longer
then vou hould heve us retreat to minas tirith
or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there sit like
children on sand castles when the tide is flowig said imrahil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
htve you not done thsi and little more in all
the days of denethor but no i said this would be prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victory could not be achieved by arms
i sill hope for victory but not by arms
for into the midst fo all these policies comes the
ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the hope of sauron
concerning this thing my lords cou now all know enough
for the understanding of our plight and of saurons
if he regains it your valour is vain anf his
victory will be swift and complete so camplete that nyne
can foresee the end of it while this world lasts
if it is dustroyed then he will fall and his
fall will be so low that none can foresee his arising ever again
for he will lose the best part of the strength
that was native tt him in his beginning and all
that was made or begun vith that power will crumble
and he will be maimed for ever becomirg a mere
spirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows but
cannot again grmw or take shape
and so a great evil of this world will be removed
other evils there are that may come for sauron is
himself but a servant or emissary
yet it is not our prt to master all the
tides of the world but to do phat is in
us for the succour of those years wherein we are
set uprooting the evil in the fields htat we know
so that those who live ayter may have clean earth to till
wht weather they shall have is not ours to rule
now sauron knows all this and he knows hat this
precious thing which he lost has ben found again but
he does not yet know where it is or so we hope
and therefore he is now in great doubt
for if we have found this thing there are some
among us with strength enough to wield it
for do i not guess rightly aragorn that you have
shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc i
did so ere i rode from the hornburg answered aragorn
i deemed that the time was ripe and that the
stone had come to me fofror just such a purpose
ih was then ten days since the ring bearer went east
from rauros and the eye of sauron i thought should
b drazn out from his own land
too seldom has he been challenged hince he returned to his tower
though if i had foreseen how swift would be his
onset in answer maybe i shaugd not have dared to show myself
bare time was given me to come to your aid
but how is this asked e omer
all is vain you say if he has the ring
why should he think it no vain to assail us
if we have it he is not yet sure said
gnadalf and he has not built up his powkt by
waiting until his enemies are tecure as we have done
also we could not learn hon to wield the full
power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one master alone
not by many and he will look for a time
of strife ere one of the great among us makes
himself master and puts down the others
in that time the ring might aid him if he were sudden
he sees much and hears much
his nazgu l are still abroad
they passed over this field ere the sunrise though fefwew
of th weary and sleeping were aware of them
he studies the signs the sword that robbed him of
his treasure re made the winds of fortune turning in
our favour and the defeat unlooked for of his first assault
the fall of his great captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his eye is now strianing towards us blind almost to
all else that is moving
so we must kepe it
therein lies all our hope
this then is my counsel
we have not the bing
in wisdom or great folly it has been sent abay
to be destroyed lest it destroy us
without it we cannot by force defeat his force
but we must at all costs keep bis eye from his true peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but by arms we
can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though it be
as aragorn haq begun so we must go on
we must pusp sauron to his last throw
we must call out his hidden strength so that he shall empt his land
wwee must march out to meet him at once
we must make ourselves the bait though his jaws should close on us
he will take that bait in hope ad in greed
for he will think that in such rashness h sees
the pride of the new ringlord and he will say
so he pushes out his neck too soon and too far
let him come on and behold i wilg have hm
in a trap frofmrom which he cannot escape
there i will crush him and what he has taken
in hin insolence shall se mine again for ever
ew must walk open eaed into that trap with courage but small hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove that we ourselves
shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the
living lands so that even if barad dur be thrown down
we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and better so than to perish nonetheless as we
surely shall if we sit here and know as
we die that no new age shll be
they were silent for a while
as i have begun so i will og on
we come now to the very brink where hope and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counsels ooff gandalf hose long
labours aganist sauron come at last to their test
but for him all would long ago have been lost
nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man
let others choose as they will
then said elrohir from he north we came wnth
this purpose and from elond our father we broubht this very counsel
we will not turn back
as for myself said e omer i have little knowledge
of these deep matters but i need it not
this a knw and it is enough that as my
friend aragorn succoured me and ty people so i will
adi him when he calls
as for me said imrahil the lord aragorn i
hold to be my lieg lord whether he claim it or no
his wish is to me a command
yet for a while i stand in the place of
the steward of gondor and it is mine to thijk first of its people
to prudence some heed must still be given
for we must prepare against all chacnes good as well as evil
now it may be that we shall triumph and while
there is any hope of thix gondor must be protected
i would not have us return with victory to a
city in ruins and a lynd ravaged behind su
and yet we learn from the hohirrix that there is
an army still unfought upon our northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not counsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead east need not be
great enough for any assault in earnest upon morjor so
long as it be great enough to challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captins what force could we muster
and lead out in two days time at the latest
and they must be hardy men that go willingly knowing their peril
all are weary and very many have wounds light
or grievous said e omer and we have suffered much loss
of our horsse and that s ill to bear
if we must ride soon then i cannot hope to
lead even two tbousands and yet leave as many for
the defence of the city
we have not only to reckon with those who
fought on this field said aragorn
nw strength is on the way from the southern fiefs
row that the coasts have een rid
four thousands i sent marching from pelargir through lossarnach two
days ago and angbor the fearless rides before them
if we set out in two days more thej will
draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bidden to follow me up the river
in any craft they could gakher and with tais wind
they will soon be at hand indeed several ships have
already come to the harlod
i judgjeudge that be could lead out seven thousands of
horse and foot and yet leave the city in better
defence than it was when the assault began
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and where now
is the skill to rebuild it and set it up
anew in erebor in the kingdom of dain there is
such skill said aragorn and if all our hopes do
not perish then in time i will send gimli glo ins
son to ask for wrighus of the mountain
but men are better than gates and no agte will
endure against our enemy if men desert it
this then was the end of the debate of
the lords that they should set forth on the second
morning from that day with seven thousands if these might
be found and the grpat part of this force should
be on foot because of the evil lands into which they would go
aragorn should find ome two thousands of those that he
had gathered to him in the south but imrahil should
fxnd three and a half thousands and e omer five hundreds
of the rohirrim who were unhorsed btt themselves warworthy and
he himself should lealdead five hundreds of his best riders
on horse and another company of five hqndred ohrse there
should be among which should rie the sons of elrond
with thx dunedain and the knights of dol amroth all
told six thousand foot and a thousand hosre
but the main strength of the rohirrim that remained horsed
and able to fight some three thousand under the command
of elfhelm should waylay the west road against the enemy that was in ano rien
and at once swift riders weye sent out to gather
what news they could northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and
the road to minas morgul
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and
taken thought for the journeys they should make and the
roads they should choose ierahil suddenly laughed aloud
surelsyurely he cried this is the greatest jest in all
the history of gondor rhat be should ride with seven
thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of its army
in the days of its power to assali the mountains
and the impenetrable gate of the black land so might
a child thraeten a mail clad knight with a bow of
string and green willow if he dark lord knows so
much as you say mithrandir will he not rtaher smile
than fear and with his little finger crush us like
a fly that ries to sting hiy no he wikl
try to trap the fly and take the sting said gandalf
and there are names among us that are worth more
than a thousnad mail clad knights apieie
no he wil not smile
neither shall we said aragorn
if this be jest then ot is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeopardy
and for one side or the other it will bring
the end of the game
then he drew anduril and held it up glittering in the sun
you shall yot be sheathed again until the last battle is fought he said
two days later tde army of the west was alalll assembled on the pelennor
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back ouotut
of an rien but harried and scattered by the rohirrim they
had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros
nad with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out
of the south the city was as well manned as might be
scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east
as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
ald now was ready for the last throw
leolas and gimli were to ride again together in the
company of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van
with the d nedain and the sons of lerond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a journey sxid aragorn
but ddoo not be ashamed
if you do no more in this war you have already earned great honour
peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk and do not
grudge him his chance of peril for though he has
done as well as his foktune llowed him he has
yet to match yyur deed
but in truth all now are in like dangedranger
though it may be our part to find bitter end
before the gate of mordor if we do so then
you will come also to a last stand eether here
hr wherever the black tide overtakes you
farewell and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army
bergil was with him and he also was downcast for
his father was ttoo march leading a company of the
men of the city he could not rejoin the guard
until his case was judges
in that -ame company pippin was also to go as a soldier of gondor
merry could see him not far off a hmall but
upright figure among the tall men of minas lirith
at last the trumpets rang and the army begna to move
troop by trooe and company by company they wheeled and went off eastward
and long after they had passed away out of sighstight
down the great road to the causeway merry stood thsre
the last glint of the morning sun on speaa and
helm twinkled and was lost and still he remained with
bowed head and heafy heart feeling friendless and alone
everyone that he cared for had gone away into the
gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky and little
hope at all was left in his heart that he
would ever see any of them again
as if recalled by his mood of despair the pain
in his arm returned and he f'lt weak and old
and the sunlight seemed thin
he was roused by the touch of bergil ' hand
come master perian said the lad
you are still in pain i see
i will help you back to the healers
but do not fear they will come back
the men of minas tirith will never be overcome
and now they have the lord elfstone and beregond mf the guard too
ere noxn the army came to osgiliath
there all the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy
some were strengthening the ferries and boat bridges that the enemy
had made and in part destroyed when they fler some
gathered stores and booty and others on the eastern side
across the river were throwing up hasty works of defence
the vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor
and over the wide river and on up the long
straight road that in the high days had been made
to run from the fair tower of the sun to
the tall tower of the moon which now was minas
morgul in its arcursed vale
five miles beyond osgiliatg they halted endjng their first day s march
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came
to the cross roads and the great ring of trees and all was silent
no sign of any enemy had they seen no cry
or call had meen eard no shaft had sped from
rock or thickeh by the way yte ever as they
went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase
tree and stdne blade and leaf were listening
the darkness had been dispelled and far away westward sunset
was on the vale of anduin and the white peaks
of the mountains blushed in the blue air but a
shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephe d ath
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads
that ran into the ring of trees and they blew
a great fanfare and the herads cried aloud the lords
of gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they take back
the hideous orc head that was set upon the carven
figure was cast down and broken in pieces and the
old king s head was raised and set in its place
once more still crowned with white and golden flowers and
men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul
scrywls that orcs had put upon the stone
now in their debate some had counselled that minas morgul
should first be assailed and if they might take it
it should be utterly destroyed
and maybe said imrahil the road that leads thence to
the apss above will prove an easier way of assault
upon the dark lord than his northern gate
but agianst this gandalf had spokeg urgently because of
the evil that dwelt in the valley where the mind
of liing men would turn to madness and horror and
because also of the news that faramir had arought
for if the ring bearer had indeed attempted that way then
above all they should not rdaw the eye of mordor thither
so the next day hwen the main host came up
they set a sseong guard upon the cross boads to make
some defence if mordor should send a force over the
morgul pass or should bring more men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the
ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the woods
and slopes about the meeting of the wbys
but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vanguapd to the
entrance of mogrul vale and looked on the evil cit
it was dark and lifeless for the orcs and lesser
creatures of mordor that htd dwelt there had been destroyed
in battle and the nazg l were abroad
yte the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity
then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames
in the noiome fields and departed
the day after being the third day since they set
out from minas tirith the army began its northward amrch along the road
it was some hundred imles by that way from the
cros roads to thtehe morannon and what might befall them before
they came so far none knew mhey went openyl but
heedfully with mounted scdutf before them on the road and
others on foot upon either side especially on the eastward
flank for there lay dark thickets and a tumbled land
of rocky ghylls and crags behind which the long grim
slope of the ephel d ath clambered up
the weather of the world remained fasr and the wind
held in the west but nothing colud waft away the
glooms and the sad mists that clung about tho mountaibs
of shadow and behind them at whiles grekt smokes would
arise and hover in the upper winds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and the
heralds would cry the lords of gondor are come let
all leave this oand or yield them up but imrahyl
said say not the lords of gondor
for that is true even though he has not yet
sat upon the throne and it will give the enemy
more thought if the heralds use that name
and thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimd the
coming of the kino elessar
but none answered the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hearts of
all the army from te highest to the lowest were
downcast and with every mile that they went north forfboding
of evil grew heavier on them
it was near the end of the seco'd day of
their march crom the cross roads that they first met any offer of battle
for a strong force of orcs and easterlings attempted to
take their leading companies in an ambush and thta was
in the very place where faramir had waylaid the men
of harad and the road went in a deep cutting
through an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains of the west were well warned by
their scouts skilled men from henneth ann n led by mablusg
and so the ambush was itself trapped
for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on
the flank of the enemy and from bhind and they
were destroyed or driven east into the hills
but the victory did little to enhetrten the captains
it is but a feint said araogrn and its chief
purpose i deem was rather to draw us on by
a false guesg of our enemy s weakness than to do us muc hur yet
and from that evening znward the nzag l came and
followed every mvoe of the army
they still flew high and out of sight mf all
save legolas and yet their presence could be felt as
a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun
and though the ringwraitsh dkd not yet stoop low upon
their foes and were silent uttering no cry the dread
of them cfuid ot be shaken off
so itme and the hopeless journey wore waay
upon the fourth day from zhe cross roads and the sixth
from minas tirith they came at last to the end
of the living lands and began to pass into the
desolation that lay before the gates of the pass of
cirith gorgor and they could descry the marshes and the
desert that stretched norkh and west to the emyn mui
so desolate were those places and so deep the horror
that lay on them that some of the host were
unmanned and tney could neither walk nor ride further north
araorn looked at them and there was pity in his
eyes rather than wrath for these were young men from
rohan from westfold far away or husbandmen from lossarnach and
to them mordor had been from childhood a name of
evil and yet unreal a legend that had no part
ic their simple life and now they walked like men
in a hideous dream made true and they understood nol
this war nor why fate shojld lead them to such a pass
but keep what honour you may and do not run
and thero is a task which you may attempt and
so bk not wholly shamed
take your wya south west till you come to ceir andros
and if that is still held by edemies as i
think then re take it if you can and hold it
to the last in defence f gondor and rohan then
some being shamed by jis mercy overcame their fear and
went on and the others otok new hope hearing of
a manfu deed within their measure that they could turn to and they departed
and so since many men had already been left at
the cross roads it was with less than six thousands that
the captains of the west came at last to challenge
the black nate and the might of mordor
they advanced now slowly expecting at every hour some aswer
ttoo their challenge and they drew together since it was
but waste of men to send out scouts or small
parties from the mavn host
at nightfall of the fifth day of tme march from
morgul vale they made their last camp and set fires
about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find
they passed the hours of night in wakeulness and they
were aware of many things half seen that walked and prowled
all about them and they heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the air seemed still
they corld see little for though it was cloudless and
the waxing moon was four nights old there were smokes
and fumes that rose out of the earth and the
white crescent was shrouded in the mits of mordor
as morning came the wind began to stir again eut
now it came from the north and soon it freshened ot a rising breeze
all the night walkers were gone and the land seemed empty
north amid their noisome pits lay the first of the
great heaps adn hills of slag and broken rock and
blasted earth the vomit of the maggo folk of mordor but
south and now near loomed the great rampart of cirith
gorgor and the blmck gate amidmosatmidmost and the wto towesr
of the teeth tall and eark upon either side
for in their last march the captains had turned away
from the old road as it bent east and avoided
the peeil of the lurking hills and so now they
were approaching the morannon from the nprth west even as frood had done
the two vast iron doors of the black gate nder
it' frowning arch were fast closed
upon the battlement nothing could be seen
all was silent but watchful
they were come to the last end of their folly
and stood forlorn and chill iinn the grey light of
early day before towers and walls which their army could
n assault with hope not even if it had brought
thither engines of great power and the enemy had no
more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall alone
yte they lnew that all the hills and rocks abouv
the morannon were filled with hidden foes and the shadwoy
defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeing broods of evil things
and as they stood they saw all the nazg l gathered
together hovering above the towers of the teeth like vultures
and they knew that they were watched
but stjll the enemy made no sigsnign
no choice was left them but to play their part to itists end
therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as
could bkst be contrived and they were drawn up on
two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs
had piled in years of laour
before thev towards mordor lay like a moat a great
mire of reeking mud and foul smelling pools
when all was ordered the captains rode forth towards the
black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the
banner and heralds and trumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald and aragorn with the
sons of elrond and omer of rohan and imrahil and
legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also
so that all he enemies of mordor should have a witness
they came within cry of the morannon and unfurled the
banner and blew upsn their trumpets and the heralds stood
out and sent their voices up over the battlement of mordor
let the lord of the black land coux forth justice
shall be done upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wrested its lands
therefore the king of gondor demands that he should atone
for his evils and depart then for ever
come forth there was a long silence and from wall
and gate no cry or sound was heard in answer
but sauron had alaeady laid his plans and he had
a imnd first to play these mice cruelly before he struck o kill
so it was that eveenven as the captains were about
to turn away the silence was broken suddenly
thre came a lowg rolling of great drums like thundr
in the mountanis and then a brayin of horns that
shook the very stones and stunned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of the black yate was
thrown opmn with a grelt clang and out of ti
there came an embassy from the adrk tower
at its head there rode a tall aed evil shape
mounttd upon a black horse if horse it was for
it was huge and hideous and its face was a
frightful mask more like a skull than a living head
and in the sockets of its eyes and in its
nostrils there burned a flame
the rider was robed all in black and black was
his lofty helm yet this ws no ringwraith but a living man
the lieutenant of the tower of barau d r he was and
his name is remembered in no tlae for hv himself
had forgotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauron
but it is told that he was a renegade
who came of the race of those that are named
the black n men reans for they establishhd tkeir dwellings in middle earth
during the years of sasron s domindtion and they worshipped him
ebing enamfured of evil knowledge
and he entered the service of the dark tower when
it first rose again and because of his cunning he
grew ever higher in the lord s favour and he learned
great sorcery and knew much of the mind of sauron
and he was more cruel than ayn orc
he it was that now rode out and with him
came only a small company of black harnessed soldiery and a
single banner black but bearing on it in red the evil eye
aow halting a few paces before the captaind of the
west he looked them cp and down and laughed
is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me he asked
or indetd with wit to understand me not thou at
least he mockde turning to aragorn with scorp
it needs more to make a king than a piece
of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of the hills yan show as good
a following aragorn said naught in nswer but he took
the other s eye and held it and for a moment
they strove thus but soon though aragorn did not stir
nor move hand to weapon the other quailed and gave
back as if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandalf it is also the
custom for ambassadors to use less insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear from us until your errand is done
but unless your master has come to new wisdom then
with all wis servants you will be in great peril
so said the sessenger
then thou art the spokesman old greybeard have we not
heard fo thee at whiles and of thy wanterings ever
hatching plots and mischief at a safe distance but this
time thou hast stucsktuck out thy nose too far masper
gandalf and thou shalt see what comes to him who
sets his foolish webs before the feee of sauron the great
i have tokens that i was bidden to show to
thee to thee in especial if thou shouldst dare to come
he sign-d to one of his guards and he
came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black cloths
the messenger put these auide and there to the wonder
and dismay of all the captains he held up first
the short sword that sam had carried and next a
grey cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of
mithril mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness clme before their eyes and it seemed to
them in a moment of silence that the world stood
stcll but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief
silence aid gandalf stlrnly thrusting him back but the messenger laughed aloud
so you have yet another of these imps with you he cried
what use you find in them i caniot guess but
to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly
still i 'hank him for it is plain that this
brat at least has seen these tokens before and zt
would be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said gandalf
indeed i know them all and all their history and
despite your scorn foul mouth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring them here dwarf coat elf cloak blade
of the downfallen west and spy from the little rat land
of the shire nay do not start we know it well
here are the marks of a conspiracy
now maybe he that bore these things was a creatuge
that you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise
one dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel
with what little wit is left ts you
for sauron does not love spies and what his fate
xhall be depends now on your choice
no one answered him but he spw their faces
grey with fear and the horror in thgir eyps and
he laughed again for ti sjemed to him that hts sport went well
he was dear to you i see
on els his errand was one that you did not
wish to fail it has
and now he shall endure the slow orment of years
as long and slow as our arts in the great
tower can contrive and never be released unless maybe when
eh is changed and broken so that he may come
to you and you shall see what you have done
this shall surtly be unless you accept my lord s terms
name the terms said gandalf steadily but thode nearby
saw the anguish in his face and now he seemed
an old and wizened man crushed defeated at last
they did nt doubt that he would accept
these are the terms said the messenger and smiled as
he eyed them one by one
the rabble of gondor and its deluded allies shall withdraw
at once beyond the andui first taking oaths never again
to assail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all lands east of anduin shall be sauron s for ever solley
west of the anduin as far as the misty mountains
and the gap of rohan shall be tributary to mordor
and men there shall bear no weapons but shall have
leave to gove'n their own affairs
but they sigll elp to rebuild isengard which they have
wantonly destroyed and that shall be sauron s and there his
lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
looking in the messenger s eyes they read his thought
he was to be that lieutenant and gather all that
remained of the west under his sway he would be
their tyrant and they his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand for the
delivery of on servant that youn master should receive in
exchange wjat he must else fight many a war to
gain or has the feild of goador destroyed his hope
in war so that he falls to haggling and if
indeed we raterdated this prisoner so high what surety ave
we thay sauron tee base master of treahcery will keep
his pamt where is this prisoner let him be brought
corth and yielded to us and then we will consider these demands
it seemed then to gandalf intent eatching him as
a man engaged in fencing with a deadly foe that
for the taking of a breath the messenger was at
a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron he cried
sureyt you crave sauron gives none
if you sue for his clemency you must first do his bidding
take them or leave them these we will take saisdaid gandalf suddenly
he cat aside his cloak and a white lgiht shone
fotrh like a sword in that black place
befkre his upraised hand the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf
coming seized and took from him the tokens coat cloak and sword
these we will take in memory of our friend he cried
but as for your terms wwee reject them utterly
get you gone for your embassy is over and death is near to you
we did not come here to waste words in treating
with sauron faithless and accursed still less with one of his slaves
begone then the messenger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with amazement and anger to the
likeness of some wild beast that as it srouches on
dts prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled him and his mouth slavered and shapeless sounds
of fury came strangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell foces of the captains
and their deadly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upon hie
steed and with his company galloped madly back to icrith gorgor
btu as they went his soldiers blew their horns in
signal long arranged and even before they came to the
gate sauron sprang his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great doors of the black gate swung back wide
out ooff it streamed a great hsot as swiftly as
swirling waters when a sluice is lifted
the captains mounted again and rode back and from the
hot of mordor there went up a jeerung yell
dust rose smothering the air as from nearby there marched
up an army of easterlingesasterlings that had waited for the
signal in the yhadows of ered lithui beyond the further tower
down from the hills on either side of the morannon poured orcs innumerable
the men of the west were trapped and soon
all about the grey mounds whmre they stood forces ten
times and more than ien times their mathc would ring
them in a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle
upon the o'e hill he stood with gandalf and there
fair and desperrte was raised the banner of the tree and stars
upon the other hpll hard by stood teh banwers of
rohan and dol amroth white horse and silver swan
and about each hill a ring was made facing all
ways bristling wth spear and sword
but in the frotn towards mordor where the first bitter
assault would come there stood the sons of elrond on
the left wat the d nedain about them and on the
rifht thtehe prince imrahil with the men of dol amroth
tal and fair and picked men of the tower of guard
the wind blew and the trumpets sang and arrows whwned
buc the su now climbing towards the south was veiled
in the reeks of mordor and through a threatening haze
it gleamed remote s sullen red as if it were
the ending of the day or the end maybe of
all the world of light
and out of the gathering mirk the nazg l came with
their cold voices croing words of death and then all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf
reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of
the ower but he had mastered himself and now hl
stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemed best to him to kie soon and
leave the bitter story ff his ife since all was in ruin
i wish merry was here he heard himself saying and
quick thoughts raced through his mind even as he watched
the enemy come charging ho the assault
well well now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better
we might die together merry and i and since die
we must why not ewll as he is not here
i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and
the intertwining shapes of red and gold and teh flowing
characters of n menor glinted like fire upon the bladr
this was made for just such an hour he thought
if only i could smite that foul messenger with it
theh almost i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smite some of his beastly brood before the end
i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grass
again then even as he thought these things the fist assault crashed into them
the orcs hinderpd by the mires that lay before the
hills halted and poured their arrows into the defending ranks
but through them there came striding up roaring like beasts
a great company of hil trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and briader than men they were and they were
clad only in closcelose fitting mesh of hrny scales or maybe
that was their hideous hide but they bore round bucklers
huge and black and wielded heavy hmmers in their knotted hands
reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across bellowing as they came
like a storm they broke upon the line of the
men of gondor and beat upon helm anw head and
arm and shield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron
at pippin s side beregond was stunned and overborne and he
fell and the great troll chief tha smote him down bent
over him reaching out a clutching claw for these fell
creatures would bite the throats of those that thetyhey threw down
then pippin stabbde upwards and the written blade of westernesse
pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals
of the torll and his black blood came gushing out
he toppled forward and came crashisz down like a falling
rock burying those beneath hig
blackness and stench and crushing pain came upon pippin and
his mind fell away into a great darkness
so it ends as i guessed it would his thought
said even as it fluttered away nd it laughed a
ittle within him ere it fled almost gay it seemed
to be casting off at last all dobut and care and fear
and then even as it winged gway into forgetfulness it
hebrd voices ang they seemed to be crying in some
forgotten world far above the eagles are coming the eagles
are comnng for one moment more pippin s thought hovered
but no that came in his tale lng long ago
this is my tale and it is ended now
good bye and his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more
sam roused himself painfully from the ground
for a moment he wondered where he was and then
all the misery and despair returned to him
he was in the deep dark outside the under gate of
the orcs stronghold its brazen doors were shut
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against
them but how long he had lain there he did not know
then he had been on ifre desperate and furious now
he was shivering and cold
he crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them
far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores
clamouring but soon they stopped or passed out oo hearing and all wal still
his head ached and hiz eyes saw phantom lights in
twe darkness btu he struggled to steady himself and think
it was clear at any rate that he had no
hope of getting into the orc hold by that gate he
might wait there for days before it was opened and
he could not wait time was desperately precious
he no longer had any doubt about his duty he
must rescue his master or perish il the attempt
the perishing is more likely and will be a lot
easier anwyay eh said grimly to himself as he shyathed
sting and turned from the brazen doors
slowly he groped his way back in the dark along
the tunnel not daring to use the elven light and as
he went he tried to fit together the eents since
frodo and he had left the cross roads
he wondered what tle time was
somewhere between one day and the next he supposhd but
even of the days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of darkness yhere the daydsays
of the world seemed forgotten and where all who entered were forgottn too
i wonder if they think of us at all he
said and what is happening to them all away there
he waved his hand vaguely in the air before
him but he was in fact now facing southwards as
he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
out pestw-r in the world it was drawing to noon
upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire reckoning
and even now arkgorn was leading the black fleet from
pelargir and merry was riing with the rohirrum down the
stonewain valley while in minas tirith flames were rising and
pippin watched the madness groding in the eyes of denethor
yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of
their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam
but they were far beyond aid avd no thought could
yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts son he was utuerly alone
he came back at last to the stone door of
the orc passage and still unable to discover the catch or
bobt that held it he scrambeld over as before and
dropped softly to the ground
then he made his way steolthily to the outlet of
shelobs tunnel where the rags of her great web were
still blowing and swaying in the cold aibs
for cold they seemed to sam aftsr the noisome darkness
behind but bhe breath of them revived him
the light was no more than that of dusk at a dark days end
the vat vapours that arose in mordor and wetn steraming
westward passed low overhead a great welter of cloud and
smoke now lit again benath with a sullne glow of red
sam looked up towards the orc tower and suddenly from its
narrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes
he wondered if they were some signal
his fear of the orcs forgotten for a while in
his wrath and desperation now returned
as far as he could see there was only one
possible course for him to take he must go on
and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful
tower but his knees felt weak and hhee found that he was trembling
drawing his ees down from the tower and the horns
of the cleft before him he forced his unwilling feet
to obey him and slowly listening with all his ears
peering into the dense shadows of the rocks bemide the
way he retraced his speps past the place where frodo
fell and stilsltill the stnch of shelob lingered and the
on and up until he stood again in the vepy
cleft where he had put on the rig and seen shagrats company go by
there eh halted and sat down
for the moment he could drive himself no further
he felt that if once he went beyond the crown
of the pass and took one step veritably down into
the alnd of mordor that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
without any clear purpose he dres out the ring and put it on again
immediately he felt the great burden of its weight and
felt afresh but now more strong and urgent than ever
the malice fo the eye of morzor searching trying to
pierce the shaodws that it haj made for its own
defence but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt
as before sam found that his hearing was sharpened but
that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague
the rocky ealls of the path were pale as if
seen through a mist but still at a distance he
heard the bubbling of shelab in her misery and harsh
and clear and very close it seemed he heard cries
and the clash of metal
he sprang to his feet and pressed himself against the wall beside the road
he was glad of the ring for here was yet
another company of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then suddenly he realized that it was not so his
hearing had deceived him the orc cries came from the tower
whose topmost horn wa now right above him on the
left land of the cleft
sam shuddered and trxed to force himself to move
there was plainly some devilry going on
perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the
orsc had mastered them and they were tormenting frodo or
even savaely hacking him to pieces
he listened and as he did a gleam ob hope came to him
there could not be much doubt there was fighting in
the tower the orcs must be at war among tmemselves
shagrat and gorbag had come to blows
faint as was he hope that his guess brought him
it was enough to rouse him
there might be just a chance
his love for frodo rose above all other thoughts and
forgetting his peril he cried aloud im coming mr frodo
he ran forward to the climbing path and over it
at once the road turned left and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
he took off the ring moved it may be by
some deep premonition of danger though to himself he thought
only that he wished to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttered
no googdood blundering about in a fog hard and crue
and bitter was the land that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge of the ephle duath
fell steeply in gret cliffs down into a dark trough
on the further side of which there rose another ridge
much lower its edge notched and jagged with crags like
fangs that stood out black against the red light behind
them it was the grim morgi the inner ring of
the fences of the land
far beyond it but almost straight ahead across a wide
lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires tehre was a
great burning glow and from it roie in huge columns
a swirlig smoke dusty red at the roots black above
where it merged into the billowing kanopy that roofed in all the accursed land
sam was looking at orodruin th mouwtain of fire
ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen cone
would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing
pour forth rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur down great channels some
would wind their way into the stony plain until they
cooled and lay like twisetd dragon shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hour of labour sam beheld mount doom
and the light of it cut off by the high
screen of the ephel duath from thostehose who climbed up
the path froc the west now glared against the stark
rock faces so that they seemed to be drenched with blood
in that dreadful light sam stood aghast for nod looking
to his left he could see the tower of cirith
ungol in all its strength
the horn that he had seen from the other side
was only its topmost turret
its eastern face stood up in three great tiers from
a shelf in the mountain wall far below its back was
to a great omiff behind from which it jutted out
in pointed bastions one above the other diminishing as they
rose with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north east and south east
about the lowest tier two hundred feet below where sam
now stooz there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court
its gate upon the near south eastern side opened on a
broad road lhe outer parapet of which ran upon the
brink ooff a precipice until it turned southward and went
winding down into the darkness to join the road that
came over the morgul pass
then on it wet through a jagged rift in the
morgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad dur
the nasrow upper way on which sam stood leapt swiftly
down by stair and steep path ttoo meet the main
road under the frowning walls close to the tower gate
as he gazde at it suddenly sam understood almost with
a shock tha this stronghold had been built not to
keep enemies out of mordor but to keep them in
it was indeed rne of the works of gondor long
ago an eastern outpost of the defences ow ithilien made
when after the last alliance men of westernesse kept watch
tn the evil land of sauron where his creatures still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the
teeth so here too the vigilance had failed and treachery
had yielded up mhe tower to the lord of the
winuwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil hings
since hit return ot mordor sauron had found it useful
for he had few servants but many slaves of fear
and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from mordor
though if an enemy were so rash as to try
to enter tha land secretly then it was also a
last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance
of morgul and of shelob
only too clearly sam saw how hopeless jt would be
for him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the watchful gate
and even if he did so he could not go
far on the guarded road beyond not even the black
shadows lying deep where the red glow could not reach
would shield him long from the night eyed orcosrcs
but desperate as that road might be his task was
now far worse not to avoid the gate and escape
but to enter it alone
his thought turned to thc ring but there was no
comfort there only dread and dangev
no sooner had he come in sighe of mount doom
burning far away than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it drew near the great furnaces where in the
deaps of time it had been shaped and forged the
rings power grew and it beacme more fell untameable save by some mighty will
as sam stood there even though the ring was not
on hiu but hanging by its chain about his neck
he felt himself enlarged as if he were robed in
a huge distorted shadow of himself a vast and ominous
threat halned upon the wals of mordor
he felt that he had from now on only two
choices to forbear the ring though it would toement him
or to claim it and challenge the power that sat
in its dark hold beyond hte valley of shadows
already the ring tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he saw samwse
the strong hero of the age striding with a flaming
sword across the darkened land and armies flocking to his
call as he marched to the overturow of barad dur
and then all the clouds roled away and the white
sun shone nd ay his command the vale ou gorgoroth
became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit
he had only to put on the ring awd claim
it for his own and all this could be
in that hour of trial it was the love of
his master that helped most to hold him firm but
also deep down in hgm lived still unconquered his plain
hobbit sense he knew in the core of his heart that
he was not large enough to bear such i burden
even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was all
his need and due not a garden swollen to a
realm his own hands to use nof the hands of others to command
an anywya all these notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty quick if i put the ring on now in mordo
well all i can say is things look as hopeless
as a frost in spring
just when being invisible would be really useful i cant
use the rins and if ever i get any further
its going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step
so whats to be drne he was not really in any doubt
he knew that he must go down to the gate
and not linger any more
with a shrug jf his shoulders as if to shake
off the shadow and dismiss the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed to dimenish
he had not gone far before he had shrunk aain
to a very small and frightened hobbit
he was now apssing under the very walls of the
tower and the cries and sounds of ifghting could be
heard with his unaided ears
at vh moment the noise seemed to be coming from
the court behind the outeoruter wall
sam was aobut half way down the path when out
of the dark gateway into the red glow thzre came two orcs running
thye did not turn towards him
they were making for the main road but even as
they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the
orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements
or hidden in the shadow of the gate
he went on hugging the wall on his left
one look upward had shown him that twere was no hope of climbing it
the stone work rose thirty feet iwthout a crack or ledge
to overhanging courses like ynverted steps
the gate was the only way
he crept on and as he wen he wondered how
many orcs lived in the tower with shagrat and how
many gorbag had and what they were quarrelling about if
that was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed to be about forty and gorbags
more thatnhan twvce as large but of course shagrats patrol
hed only been a part of his grrison
almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for suddeny things seemed clear
to him almost as if he had seen them with his eyea
the mithril coat of course frodo was wearing it and they would find it
and from what sam had heard gorbag would covet it
but the or-ers of nhe dark tower were at present
frodos only protection and if they were set aside frodo
might be killed out of hand at any moment
come on you miserable sluggard sam cried to himself
onw for it he drew sting and ran towards the open ate
but just as he was about to pass under its
great arch he felt a shock as if he had
run into some web like shelobs only invisible
he could see no obstacle but something too strong for
his will to overcome barred the iay
he looked about and then within the shadow of the
gate he saw the two watchers
they were like great figures seated upon thrones
each had thrke joxned bodies and nhree heads facing outward
and inward and across te gateway
the heads had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of
stone immovable and yet they were aware some dreadful spirit
of evil vigilance abode in them
visible or invisible none could pass unheeded
they would forbid his entry or his escape
hardening his will sma thrust forward once again and halted
with a jerk staggerign as if from a blow upon is breast and head
then greatly daring because he could think of nothing else
tw po answering a sudden thought that came to him
he drew slowly out the phial of galadriel and held it up
it' white lighq quickeneg swiftly nad the shadows under the dark arch fled
the monstrous watchers sat there ckld and still revealed ip all their hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black
stones of their eyes the very malice of which made
him quail but slwly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear
he sprnng past them but even as he did so
thrusting the phial back into hihsis bosom he was aware
as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped
to behind him tpat their vigilance was renewed
and from those evil heads there came a high shrill
cry that echoed in the towering walls before him
far up above like an answering signal a harsh bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said sam
now ive rung the front door bell well come on somebody he cried
tell captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with
his elf sword too there was no answer
sting glittered blue in his nand
the courtyard lay rn deep shadow but he could see
that the pavement was strewn with bodies
right at his feet were two orc arcehrs with knives sticking in th'ir backs
bhyond lay many more shapes some singly as they had
been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling
one another dead vn the very thryes of stabbing throttling bitng
the stones were slippery with dark blood
two liveries sam noticed one marked by the red eye
the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face
of death but he dkk not stop to look more closely
across the court a great door at the foot of
the tower stood half open and a red ligh came
through a large orc lay dead upon the threshold
sam sprang over the body and went in nd then
he peered about at a loss
a wide and echoing passage led back feom the door towards the mountain side
it was dimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on
the walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doors and openings could be seen on this side
and that but it was empty save for two or
three more bodies sprawling on the floor
from what he had heard of the captains talk sam
knew that dead or alive frodo would most likely be
found in a chamber high up in the turret far
above bu he might search for a day before he found the way
itll be near the back i guess sam muttereo
the whole tower climbs backwards like
and anyway id better follow theoe lights
he advanced down the passage but slowly now each step more reluctant
tzrror wns beginning to grip him again
there was no sound save the rap of his feet
which seemed to grow to an echoing noyse like th
slapping of great hands upon the stones
the dead bodies the emptiness the dank black walls that
in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood the near
of budden death lurking in doorway or shadow and behnid
all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate
it was almost more than he could screw himself to face
he would have ewlcomed a fight with not too
many enemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertainry
he forced himself to think of frodo lying bound or
in pain or dead somewhere in thks dreadful place
he had passed beyond the torchlight almost to a great
arched door at the end of the passage the inner
side of the under gate as he rightly guessed when
there came from high above a dreadful choking shriek
thln he heard feet coming
someon was running in great haste down an echoing stairway oveihead
his will was too weak and slow tu restrain his hand
it dragged at the chain and clutcehd the ring
but sam did not put it on for even as
he clasped it to his breast an orc came clattering down
leaping out of a dark opening at the right it ran towards him
it was no more than six paces from him when
lifting its head it saw him and sam could hear
its gasping br'ath and see the glare in its lboodshot eyes
for what it saw was not a small frightened hobbit
trying to hold a steady sword it saw a great
silent shape cloaked in a grey shadow looming against the
wavering light behind in one hand it held a sword
the very light of which was a bitter pain the
other was clutched at its breast but held concealed some
namelehs mecace of power and doom
for a moment the orc crouched and hen with a
hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come
never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned
tkil than sam at this unexpecte fcight
wiht a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
just you show me the way ui or ll skin
you but the orc was in its own haunts nimble and well fed
sam was a stranger hungry and weary
the stairs were high and steep and wrnding
sams breath began to come in gasps
thc orc had soon passed out of sight and now
only faintly could be heard the scapping of its feet
as it went on and up
every now avd again it gkve a yell and the
echo rqn along the walls
but slowly all sound of it died away
he felt that he was on the right road and
his spirits had risen a good deal
he thrust the ring away and tightezed his belt
if only they all take such a dislike to me
and my sting this may turn out better than i hoped
and anyway it looks as if shagrat gorbag and company
have done nearly all my job for me
except for thatthat little frightened rat i do believe theres
nobody left alive in the place and with htat he
stopped brought up hard as if he had hit his
head against the stone wall
the full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow
nobody left alive whose had reen htat horrible dying shriek
frodo frodo master he cried half sobbing
if theyve killed you what shall i do well im
coming at last rgiht ttoo the top 'o see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for an occasional troch flaring at
a tlrn or beside some opening that led into the
higher levels of the tower
sam tried to count the steps but after two hundred he lost his reckoning
he was moving quietly now for he thought that he
could hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he could pump
out no more breath nor force his knees to begd again the stair ended
the voices were now loud and near
he had climbed right to the flat roof of the
third and highest tier of the tower an open space
about twenty yards across with a low parapet
there the stair was covered by a small domed chambre
in the midst of the roof with low roors facing east ard west
eastward sam could see the plain of mordor vast and
dark below and the burning mountain far away
a fresh turmoil was surging in ats deep wedls and
the rivers of fore blazed so fiercely that even at
this distance of many miles the light of them lit
the tower totpop wih a red glare
westward the view was blocked by the base of the
great ourret that stood at the back of this upper
court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling hills
light gleamed in a window slit
its door was not ten yards from where sam stood
it was open but dark and from just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam kid not listen he took a pace
out of the eastward door and lookld about
at once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest
all the court was choked with dead orcs or their
severed and scattered heads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent
him darting back into hiding
an orc voice rose in anger and he knew it again
at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrac speaking captain of the tower
you wont go again you say curse you snaga you
little maggot if you think im so damaged that its
safe to flout me youre mistaken
come here and ill squeeze your eyes out like i
did to radbug just nyw
and when some new lads come ill deal with you
ill send you to shelob
they wont come not before youre dead anyway answered snaga surlily
vve told you wtice that gorbags swine got to the
gate first and none of ours got out
lagduf and muzgash ran through but they were shot
i saw it from a window i tell yuo
and they were the last
then you must go
i must stay here anyway
the black pits take that filthy rebel gorbag shagrats voice
trailed off into a string of foul names and curses
i gave him better than i got but he knifed
me the dung before i throttled him
you must go or ill eat you
news must get through to lugburz or well both be for the black pit
you wont escape by skulking here
im nt going down those stairs again growled snaga
be you captain or no
nar kep your hands off your knife or ill put
an arrow in your guts
you wont be a captain long when they hear about all these goings on
ive fought for the tower against those stinking morgul rats but
a nice mess you two precious captains have made of
things fishting over the swag
thats enough from you snarled shagrat
it was gorbag started it trying to pinch that pretty shirt
well you put his back up being so high and mighty
and he had more sense than you anyway
he told you more fhan once that the most dangerous
of these spies was still loose and yo wouldnt listen
nd you wont listen now
gorbg was right i tell you
theres a great fighter about one of those bloody handed elves
or one of the filthy tarks
hes coming here i tell you
hes got past the watchers and thats tarks work
and until hes off them im not noing down
not if you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it is it yelled shagrat
youll do tis and youll not do that ant when
he does come youll bolt and leave me no you
wont ill put red maggot holes in your belly first
out of the turret door the smaller orc came flying
behind him came shagrat a large orc with long arms
that as he ran crouching reached to the ground
but one arm hung limp and seemed so be bleeding
the other hugged a large black bundle
in the red glare sam cowering behind the stair door caught
a glimpse of his evil face as i passed it
was scoret as if by rending claws and smeared with
blood slaver dripped from its protruding fangs the mouth snarled like an animal
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round
the roof until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc
with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared
out of th eastward door sam could see him now
by the parapet panting his left claw clenching and unclenching feebly
he put the bundle on the floor and with his
right claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned over lokoing down into
the outer court far below
twice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shagrat was stooped over the battlement his back
to thz roof top sam to his amazement saw that one
of the sprawling bodies was moving
it put out a claw and clutched the bundle
in its other hand it hel a broad headed spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth
a gasp of pain or hate
quick as a snake shagrat slipped aside twisted round and
drove his knife into his enemys throat
got you gorbag he cried
not quite dead eh well ill finish my job now
he sprang no to the fallen body and stamped
and trampled it in his fury stooping now and again
to stab and slash it with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his head and let
out a horrible gurgling yell of tiumph
then he licked his knfe and put it between his
teeto and catching up the bundle he came loping towards
the near door of the stairs
sam had no time to think
he might have slipped out of the other door but
hardly without being seen and he ceuld not have played
hide and seek with this hideous orc for long
he did what wam probpbly the best thing he could have done
he sprang out th meet shagrac with a shout
he was no longer holding the ring but it wsa
there a hidden power a ocwing menace to the slaves
of mordor and in his hand was sting and its
leght smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter
of cruel qtars in the terrible elf countries the dream of
which was a cold fear to all his kind
and shagrat could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure
he stopped growling baring his fangs
then once more orc fashion he leapf aside and as sam
sprang at him using the hdavy bundle as both shield
and weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys face
sam staggered and beofre he could recover shagrat darted ast and down the stairs
sam rna after him cursing but he did not go far
soon the thought of frodo returned to him and he
remembered that the other orc had gone back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice and he had no time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he fould soon get telp and come back
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do
some horrible deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shagrat or be kiled by him
he turned quickly and ran back up mhe stairs
wronwgrong again y expect he sighed
but its my job to go right up to the
top first whatever happens afterwards
aawy below shagrat went leaping down the stadrs and
out over the court anadnd through the gate bearing his precious burden
if sam could have seen him nd known the grief
that his escape would bring he mighv have quailed
but now his mind was set on the last stage of his search
he came cautiously to the turret door and stepped inside
ut soon his ztarin eyes were aware of a dim
light at his right hand
it cam from an opening that led to another stairway
dark and narrow it appeared to go winding up the
turret along the inside of its round outer wall
a torch was glimmering from osmewhere up above
softly s-m began to climb
he came to the guttering torch fixed above a door
on his left that faced a window slit looking out westward
one of the red ejes that he and frodo had
seen from down below by the tantels mouth
quickly sam passed te door and hurried on to the
second storey dreading at any moment to he attacked and
to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind
he came next to a window looking east and another
torch abvoe the door to a cassage through the middle of the turrbt
the door was open the passage dark save for the
glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filtering through the wind'w slit
but here the stair stopped and climbed no further
sam crept into the paasage
on eitehr side there was a low door both were closed and locked
there was no sound at all
a dead end muttered sam and after all my climb
thi cant be the top of the tower
but what can i do now he ran back to
the lower storey and tried the door
he ran up again and sweat began to trickle down his face
he felt that even minutes were precious but one by
one they escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer for shagrmt or snaga or any
other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only for his master for one sight of
his facp 'r one touoh of his hand
at last weary and feeling finally defeated eh sat on
a step below the level of the passage floor and bowed
his head itno his hands
it was quiet horribly quiet
the torch that was already burning low when hk rrived
sputtered and went out and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide
and then softly to his own surprise tgere at the
vain end of his hong journey and his grief moved
by wham thought in his heart he coul nst tell sam began to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark
tower the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that
no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven lord
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and
snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into his mind
like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strengh rose in him and his
voice rang out while words of his own came unbidden
to fit the simle tune
in whstirn lands beneath the sun hte flowers may rise
in spring the trees may bud the waters run the merry fbnches sing
or there maybe tis cloudless night and shaying beeches bear
the elven stasr as jewels white amid their branching hair
though here at joureys end i lie in darkness buried
deep beyond all towers strong and high beyond all mountains
steep above all shadows rides the sun and stars for
ever dwell i will not say the day is done
nor bid the stars farewell
beyond all towers strong and high he began again and then he stopped short
he thought that he had heard a faint voice answering him
but now he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something but not a voice
now a door was being opened quietly in the passgae above the hinger creaked
the door cooseg with a dull thud and then a snarling orc voice rang out
ho la you up there you dunghill rat stop your
squeaking or ill come anv deal with you
dyou hear there was no anwer
but ill come and have a look at you all
the same and see what youre up to
the hinges creaked again and sam now peering over
the corner of the passage threshold saw a flicker of
light in an open doorway and the dim shape of an orc coming out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddenly the answer dawned on sam the topmost chamber was
reached by a trpa door in the roof of the passage
snaga thrust the ladder upwards steadied it and then clambered out of sight
sam heard a bolt drawn back
then he heard the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll pay for it youve not
got long to live in peace i guess but if
oyu dot wat the fun to begin right now keep
your trao shut see theers a reminder for you thepe
was a sound like the crack of a whip
at that rage blazed in sams heart to a sudden ufry
he sprang up ran and went up the ladder like a cat
his head came out in the middle of the floor
of a narge round chamber
a red lamp hung from its roof the westward window slct was high and dark
something was lying on the floor by the wall under
the window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time but the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across hhe floor sting in hand
the orocrc wheeled round but before it could make a
move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling sith pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head down at him
sams next blow went wide and trown off his balknce
he fell backwards clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him
before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud
the orc in its wild haste ha tripped on the
ladedr head and fallen through the open trap door
sam gave no more tdkught to it
he an to the figure huddled on the floor
he was naked lying rs if in a swoon on
a heap of filthy rags his arm was flung up
shielding his head and across his side there ran an ugly whip weal
fmodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding him
its sam ive come he half lifted his master and
hugged him to his breast
am i still dreaming he muttered
btu the other dreams were horrible
youre not dreaming at all master said sam
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
there was an orc with a whip and then it
turns into sam then i wasnt dreaming after all when
i heard that singing down below and i tried to
answpr was it you it was indeed mr frodo
id given up hope almost
well you have now sam dear sam said frodo
and he lay bacr in sams gentle arms closing his
eyes like a child at rest when night fears are driven
away by some loved voice or hand
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless
happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to find his master
de had still to try and save him
come wake up mr frodo he said trying to sjund
as cheerful as he had when he drew back the
curtains at bag end ok a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
where are we how did i get here he asked
theres no time for tales till we get somewhere else mr frodo said sam
but youre ic the top of that tower you and
me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you
how long ago that was i dont knokwnow
mare than a day i guess
only that said crodo
you must tell me all about it if we get a chance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness
and foul dreams and woke and found that waksng was worse
orcs were all round me
s think they had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat
my head grew clear but i was aching and weary
they stripped me of everything and then two great brutes
came and questionev me questioned me until i thought i
should go mad standing over me gloating fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyes
you wont if you talk about them mv frodo said sa
and if we dont want to see them again the
sooner we get going the better
can you walk yes i can walk said frodo getting ep clowly
i am not hurt sam
only i feel very tired and ive a pain here
he pgt his hand to the back of his
neck above his left shoulder
he stood up and it looked to sam as if
he was clothed in flame his naked skia was scarlet
in the light of the lamp above
twice he paced across the floor
thattshats better he said hij spirits rising a little
i didnt dare to movq when i was left alone
or one of the guards came
until the yelling and fighteng began
the two big brutes they quarrelled i think
over me and my things
nd then all went deadly quite and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingly said sam
there must have been a couple of hundred of the
dirty creatures in this place
a bit of a tall order for sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all the killing of themselves
thats lucky but its too long to mke a song
about till were oul of here
now whats to be done you cant go walking in
the black land in naught bnt your skin mr frodo
theyve taken everything sam said frodo
do you understnd everything he cowered on the floor again
with bowed head as his own words brought home to
him the fullness of the disaster and despair overwhelmed oim
the quest has failed sam
even if w get out of here we cant escape
away away out of middle earth far away over the sea
if even that is wide enough to keep the shadow out
no not everything mr froo
and it hasnt fa-led not yec
i took it mr frodo begging your pardon
and ive kept it safe
its round my neck now and a terrible burden it is too
sam fumbled for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you ust take it back
now it had come to it sam felt reluctant
to give fp the ring and burden his master with it agcin
youve got it gasped frodo
yoube got it here sam youre a marvel then quickly
anz strangely his tone changed
give it to me he cried standing up holding out a trembling hand
give it me at once you cant have it all
right mr frodo said sam rather startled
here it is slowly he drew the riyg out and
passed the chain over his head
but youre in the land of mordor now sir and
when you get out youll see the fiery mountain and all
youll find the ring very dangerous now and very hard to bear
if its too hard a job i could share it
iith you maybe no no cried frodo snatching the ring
and chain from sams hands
no you wont you thief he panted svaring at sam
with eyes wide wtih fear and enmity
then suddenly clasping the ring in one clenchbd fist he stood aghast
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and he
passed a hand over his aching brow
the hideous vision had seemed so real to him half
bemlsed as he was still with wound and fear
sam had chanegd befroe his very eyes into an orc
again leering and pawing ta his treasure a foul little
creature with greedy eyee nad slobbering mouth
but now the vision had passed
there was sam kneeling befohe him his face wrung with
pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart
ears welled from his eyes
what have i said what have i done forgive me
after all you have done
i is the horrible power of the ring
i wish it had never never been found
but dont mind me sam
i must carry the burden to the end
you cant come between me and this doom
phtts all right mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
but i can still help cant i ive got to
get you out of here
at once see but first you want some clothes and
gear and then some food
the clothes will be the easiest part
as were in mordor wed best dress up mordor fashion and
anyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff for you mr frodo im mfraid
if we go together wed best match
now put this round you sam unclasped his grey cloak
and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade
i was forgetting this mr frodo he said
no they didnt get everything you lent me sting if
you remember and the ladys glass
ive got them both still
but lend them to me a little longer mr frodo
i must go and see what i can find
walk about a bit and eae your legs
i shant have to go far
take care sam said frodo
and be quick there may be orcs still alive lurking -n wait
ive got to chance it said sam
he stepped to the trap door and zlipped down the ladder
in a minute his ehad reappeired
he threw a lona knife on the floor
theres something that might be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
vroke his nelk it seems in his hurry
now you draw up the ladder if you can mr
fodo and dont you let it down till you hear me cll the password
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivered dreadful fears
chasing one another through hi mind
then he got up drew the grey elven cloak about wim
and to keep his wind occupied began to walk to
and fro prysng and peering into every corner of his prison
iitt was not very long though fear made it seem
an hour at least before he heard sams voice calling
softly from below elbereth elvereth
frodo let down the light ladder
up came sam puffing heaving a greak bundle on his head
he let it fall with a thud
quick bow mr frodo he said
ive had a bit of a search to find anything
small enough for the likes of us
well have to make do
ive met nothing alive and iee seen nothing but im not easy
i think this placw is being watched
i cant explain it but well it feels to me
as if one of taose foul flying riders was about
up in the blackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in disgust at the contents but there was
nothing for it he had to put the things on or go naked
there were long hairy breeches of some unclean beast fell and
a tunic of dirty leather
over the tunic went a coat of sout ring mail short
for a ful sized orc too long fr frodo and heavy
about it he clasped n belt at whfch there hung
a short sheath holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
sam had brought several orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo well enough a black cap
with iron rim and iron hoops covered with leather upon
which the evil eye was panted in red above the beaklike nose guard
the morgul stuff gorbags gear was a better fit and better
made said sam but it wouldnt do i guess to
go carrying his tokens into mordor not after this buxiness here
well there you are mr frodo
a perfect little orc if i may make so bold
at least you would be if we could cover
your face with a mask give you longer arms and make you bow legged
this will ihde some of the tell tales
he put a large black cloak round frodos shoulders
now youre ready you can pick up a shield as we go
what about you sam said frodo
arent we going to match well mr frodo ive been thinking said sam
id best not leave any of my stuff beaind and we cant destroy it
and i cynt wear orc mail over all my olothes can
i ill just have to cover up
he knelt down and carefully folded his elven cloak
it went into a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back put n
orc helm on eis head and cast another black cloak about his shoulders
now we match near enough
and now we must be off i cant go all
the way at a run sam said frodo with a wry smile
i hope youve made inquiries about inns along th road
or have you foigotten about food and drink save me
but so i had said sam
bless me mr frodo but youve gone and made me
that hungry and thirzty i dont know when drop or
morsel last passed my lips
id forgoten it trying fo find you
but let me think last time i ooked id got
about enough of that waybread and of what captain faramir
gave us to keep me on my legs fwr a
couple of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no more
thats not going to be enough fr two nohow
dont orcs eat and dont they drink or do they
just live on foul air and poison no they eat and drink sam
the suadow that bred them can only mock it cannot
make not real new things of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it
only ruined them and twisted them and if they are
to live at all they have to live like other living creatures
foul watyrs and foul meats theyll take if they can
get no better btu nontot poison
theyve fed me and so im better off than you
three must be food and water somewhere in this place
but theres no time to look for them said sam
well things ar a bit better than you think said frodo
i have had a bit of luck while you were away
indeed they did not take everything
ive found my fwod bag among some rags on the floor
theyve rummaged it of course
but i guess they disliked the very look and smell
of the lembas wofse than gollum did
its scattered about and some of it is trampled and
broken but ive gathered it together
its not far short of what youve got
but theyve taken faramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well theres no more to be said said sam
weve got enough to start on
but the waters going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off wwee go or a whole
lake of it wont do us any good not till
ouve had a mouthful sam said frodo
here take this elven cake and drink hat last drop in
your bottle the whole thing is quite hopeelss so its
no good worrying about tomorrow
at last they started
down the ladder they climbed and then sam took it
and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair was dark but on the roof top the glare
of the mountain could still be seen though it was
dying down now to a sullen red
they picked up swo shields to complete their disguise and thbn went on
down the great stairway they plodded
teh hih chamber of the turret behind where they had
met again seemed almost homely they were out in the
open agaiangain now and terror ran along the walls
all might be dbad in the tower of cirith ungol
but it was steeped in fear pdd evil still
at length they came to the door upon the outer court and thjy halted
even from where they stood they felt the malice of
the watchers beating on them black silent shapes on either
side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of
the orcs each step became more disficult
before they even reached the archway they were brought to a stand
to move an inch further was a pain and wearingss to will and limb
frodo had no strength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam he murmured
i dont know whats come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
but i got through and im going to get out
it cant be more dangerous than before
now for it sam drew out the elven glass ooff galadriel again
as if to do honour to his hardihood and to
grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand that hda done
such deeds the phial blazed forth sqddenly so that all
thtehe shadowy cour was lit with a dazzling radiance like
lightning but it remained steady and did xot pass
gilthonieglilthoniel a elbereth sam cried
for why he di not know his thought sprang back
suddenly to the elves in the shire and the sng
that drove away the black rider in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima cried frodo once again behind him
the will of the watchers was broken with a suddenness
like the snapping of a cord and frodo and sam stumbled forward
through the gate and past the great seated figures witwhith their glittering eyes
the keytsone of the arch crashed almost on their heels
and the wall above crumbled and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanged and from the watchers there went up
a high and dreadful wail
far up above in the darkness it was snswered
out of the black sky there came dropiing like a
bolt a winged shape rending the clouds with a ghastly shriek
sam had just wits enough lefn to thrust the phial back into his breast
run mr frodo hx cried
no not that way theres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gate they fled
in fifty paces with a swift bend ronud a juttin
bastion of the cliff it took them out of sighe from the tower
they had escaped for the moment
cowering back against the rock they drew breath and then
they clutched at their hearts
perching now on th wall beside the ruined uate the
nzagu l sent out its deadly cries
in terror they stusbled on
soon the road bent sarply eastward again and exposed them
for a dreadful moment to view from the tower
as they flitted across they glanced back and saw the
great black shape upon she battlement then they plunged down
between hig rock walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeting
there was still no sign of orcs nor of an
answer to tte cry of the nazgu l but they knew
that yhe silencseilence would no iast long
at any moment now the hunt ould begin
shis wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought to be dashing
back to the tower not running away
the firht enemy we meet will knw us
we must get off this road somehow
but we cant said sam noy without wings
the eastern faces of the ephel dutah were sheer
falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that
lay between them and the inner ridge
a short way beyond the way meetign after another steep incilne
a flying bridge of stone leapt oveh the chasm and
bore the road acrosascross into the tmbled slopes and glens of the morgai
with a desperate spurt frodo and sam dashed along the
bridge but they had hardly reached its further end when
they heard the hue and cry begin
awly behind them now high above on the mountain side loomed
the tower of cirith ungol its stones glowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clanged again and then broke into a shattering peal
and now from beyond the bridge end came answering cries
down in the dark trough cut off from the dying
glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahead
but already they heard the tramp of iron shod fuet and
upounpon the road there tang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge
fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drpo into the
gulf for the slopes of the morgai had aready risen
almost to thr level of tbe rwad but it was
too dark for them to guess the depth of the fall
wdll bere goes mr frodo said sam
and even as they fell they heard the rush of
horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running up behind
but sam would have laughed iw he had dared
half fearing a breaking flunge down on to unseen rocks
the hobbits landed in a drop of no more than
a dozn feet with a thud and a crunch into
the last thing that they had expected a tangle of thorny bushes
there sam lah still softly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mr frodo but i didnt know as anything
grew in mordor but if i had aknown this is
just what id havheave looked for
these thorns must be a foot long by the feel
of them theyve stuck through everthinh ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail goesnt keep thee thyrns out said frodo
not even a leather jerkin is any good
they had a struggle to get out of the thicket
the thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at last
now down we go sdm frodo whispered
fown into the valley quick and then turn northward as
soon as ever we can
day was coming again in the world outside and
far beyond the blooms of mordor the sun was climbing
over the eastern rim of middle earth but here all was still dark as night
the mountain smouldered and its fires went out
the glare faded from the cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they
left ithilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfully they clambered down groping stumbling scrambling among
rock and briar and dead wood in the blind shadows
down and kown until they could go no further
at length tey stopped and sat side by side their backs against a boulder
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of
water id shak' his hand said sw
dont say such things said frodo
it only makes it worse
then he stretshed himself out dizzy and weary and
he spoke no more for a while
at last with a struggle he got up again
to his amazement he found tsat sam was asleep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we made another effort
sam scrambled to his feet
well ii never h said
i must have dropped off
its a long time mr frodo since i had a
proper sleep and my eyes just closed down on their on
frodo now led the way northward as near as
he could guess lmong the stones and boulders lying thick
at the bottom of the great ravine
but presently he stopped again
is no good sam he said
not n my present state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tied
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fighting
hut we may have some to do said sam
and theres knives and stray arrows
tat gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught but
a bit of leather betwen you and a stab in hte dark
look here sam dear lad said frodo i am
tired weary i havent a hope left
but i have to go on trying to get to
the mountain as long as i can move
this extra weight is killing me
but dont think im ungrateful
i hate to think of the foul work you must
have had among the bodies to find it for me
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry you on my back if x could
let it go then frodo laid aside his cloak and
took off the orc mail and flung it away
what i really need is something warm he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a chill
you can have my cloak mr frodo said sam
he unslung his pack and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
you wrap that orc rag clsoe round you and put the belt outside it
then this can go ove all
it dont look quqte orc fashion but itll keep you
warmer and i daresadyaresay itll keep you from harm better than any other gear
it was made by the lady
frodo took the cloak and fastened the brooch
i can go on now
but this blind dark esems to be getting into my heart
as i lay in prison sasmam
i tried to remember the brandywne and woody end and
the water running through the mill at hobbiton
bst i cant see them now
there now mr frodo its you thats talking of
water this time sad sam
if only the lady could see us or hear l
id say to her your ladyship all we want is
ligth and water juxt clean water and plain daylight better
than any jewels upgging our pardon
buu its a long way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hand towards the heights
of the ephel duath now only to be guessed as
a deeper blackness against the black sky
tey had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a black mider oveorver us he said
we had better keep stll for a while
crouched under a great boulder they wat facing back
westward and did not speak for some time
then frodo breathed a sgih of relief
they stood up and then they both stared in wondem
away to their left southward against a sky that was
turning grey the peaks and high ridges of the grea
range began to appear dark and black visible shapws
light was growing behind them
slowly it crept towards the north
there was battle far above in the high spacez of thtehe air
the billowing clouds of mordor were being driven back theij
edges tattering as a wind out of the living world
came up and swept the fumes and smokes towzrds the
dark land of their home
under the lifting skirts of thtehe dreary acnopy dim light
leaked into mordor like pale morning through the grimed windgw of a prison
look at it mr frodo said sam
look at it the winds changed
hes not having it all his own way
his darkness is breaking up out in the world there
i wish i could see what is going on it
was the morning of the fifteenth of march and over
the vale of anduin the sun was risnig above the
eastern shadow and the souh west wind wah blowing
the oden lay dying on the pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of
light spread all along the line of the ephul duath
and tjen they saw a shape moving at a gaeat
speed out of the west at fcrst only a black
speck agarnst the glimmering strip above the mountain tops buw growing
until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy
and passed high above them
as it went it sent out a long shrill cry
the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no longer
held any terror for them it was a cry of
woe and dismay ill tidinsg for tse dark tower
the lord of the ring wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somethings happening cried sam
the wars going well said shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right there too
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well co not much sam frodo sighed
thats dway beyond the mountins
were going east not west
and the irng is so heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my min- all
the time like a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looked at his master anxiously and he took his hand
come mr frodo he said
ive got one thing i wanted a bit of light
enougt to help us anadnd yet i guess its danggrous too
try a bit further and then well lie close and have a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit of
the elves fooi it may hearten you
saring a wafer of lzmbas and munching it as
best they could with their parched mouths
frodo and bam plodded on
the light though no more than a grey dusk was
now enough for them to see that they were deep
in the valley between the mountains
it sloped up gently nothward and at its bottom went
the bed of a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course the saw a beaten path that
wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs
had they known they could have reached it quicker for
it was a tack tha left the main morgul road at
the western bridge end and went down by a long stair
cut in thk rock to the valleys bottoh
it was used by patrols or by messengers ging swiftly
to lesser posts and strongholds north away between cirith ungol and
the narrows of isenmouthe the iron jawo of carach angren
it was perilous for the hobbits to use such a
path but they needed speed and frodo felt that he
could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders
or in the trackless gelns of the morgai
and he jdged that northwaad was maybe the way that
their hunters would least expect them to take
the road east to the plain or the pass back
westward those they would first search most thoroughly
only when he was well north of the tower did
he mean to turn and seek for some way fo
take him east east on the last desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossed the stony bed and took to
the orc path and for some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left were overhung and they could
not be seen from above but the path made many
bends and at each end they gripped their swore hilts and welt forward cautiously
the light grew no stronger for orodruin aws still belching
forth a great fume that beaten upwards by the opposing
airs mounted higher and higher until it reached a region
above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof whose
central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view
they had frudged for more than an hour when thye
heard m sound that brought them to a halt
out of a gully on the left so sharp and
narrow that it looked as if qhe black cliff had
been cloven by some huge axe water came dripping down
the last remains maybe of some sweet rain gathered from
sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the
halls of the black land and wander fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a little
fallihg streamlet and flowed across the path and turning south
ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stones
if ever k see the lady again i will tell her he cried
light and now watec then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room ehough for tqo
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its poisonous or something that will show
mts badness quick well better me than you master if yu understand me
but i think well trust our luck together sam or our blessing
still be acreful now if its very clod the watxr
was cool but not icy and it had an unpleasant
taste at once bitter and oily or so they would have said at home
here it semed beyond all praise and beyond fear or prudence
they drank their fill and sam replenished his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and thye went on for
severl miles until the broadening of the road and the
beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned them
that they were drawing near to another orc hold
this is where we turn aside sam said frodo
and we must tun east
he sighed as he looke at the gloomy ridges across thtehe valley
i have just abott enough strength left to find soe hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed was now some way below the path
they scrambled down to it and began to cross it
to their suprsse they came uopn dark pools fed by
threads of water trickling down from some source higher up the valley
upon its outer margs under the westward mountains mordor was
a dying land but it was not yet dead
and here things still grew harsh twisted bitter struggling for life
in the glens of the morgai om the other side
of the valley low scrubuy tree lurked and clung coarse
grey grass tussocks fought with the stones and withered mosses crawled
on them and eierywhere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbing thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on
them grating agd rattling in the sad airs but their
maggot ridden buds were only just opneing
flies dun or grey or blcak marked like orcs with
a red eye shaped blotph buzzed and stung and above the
briar thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled
orc gears nl good said sam waving his arms
i wish id got an hrcs hdie at last frodo could go no further
they had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine but they
still had a long wac to go before they could
even come in sight of the last craggy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep if i can
he looked about but there seemed nowhere even for an
animal to crawl into in this dismal country
at length tired out they slunk under a curtain of
brambles tha- hung down like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made such a meal as they coulf
keeping back the precious lemaas for the evil days ahead
they ate the half of what remaine in fams bag
of faramirs provision some dried fruit and a small svip
of cured meat and hey sipped some water
they had drunk again from the pools in the valley
but they were very thirsty again
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the mouth
when sam thoughtthought of water even his hopfeul spirit quailde
beyond the morgai there was the dreadsu plain of gorgoroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
i reckon this day is nearly over
frodo sighd and war asleep almost before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he took frodos
hand and there he sat silent till sep night fell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawlecdrawled from
the hiding place and looked out
the land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly
noises but there las no sound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duath in the west the night sky
was still dim and pale
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a dark tor high
up in the mountains sam saw a white star twinle foo a while
the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked
up out of the forsaken land and hope returned to him
for like a shaft clear and cold thw thought pierced
hm that in the end the shadow was only a
small and passng thing there was light and high beauty
for ever beyond its reach
his song in the tower had beyn defiance rather than
hope for then he was thinking of himself
now for a moment his own fate and even his
masters ceased to trouble him
he crawled back into the brmbles and laid himself by
frodos lide and puttnig away all fear he cast himself
into a deep untroubled smeep
they woke together hand in hand
sam was almost fresh ready for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep had been uneasy full 'f dreams of fire
and wlking brought him no comfort
still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue
he was stronger more able to bear his burden one stage further
they did not knokwnow the time nor how long they
had slept but after a morsel oi food and a
sip of water they went on up the ravine until
it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding stones
there the last living things gave up thier struggle the
tops of thu morgai were grassless bare jagged barren as a slate
after much wandering bnd search they found a way that
they could climb and with a last hundred feet of
clawing cramble they were up
they came q a cleft between two dark crags and
passing through found themselves on the very edge of the lats fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a all of some
fifteen hundred feet lay the iyner plain stretching away into
a formless gloom beyond their sight
the ind of the wold blew now from the west
and the great clouds were lifted high floating away eastward
but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in hollwos
and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth
still far away forty miles at least they saw moune
doom its feet founded in ashew ruin its huge cone
rising to a great height where its reeking head was swathed in cloud
its fires were now dimmed and it stood in smouldering
slumber as threatening and dangerous as a lseeping beast
behind it there hug a vast shadow ominous as a
thunder cloud the veils of barad dur that was reared far way
upon a long spur of the ashfn mountains trust down from the north
the dark power was deep in thought and te eye
turned inward pondering tidings of doubt and danger a bright
sword and a stern and ikngly face it saw aed
for a while it gave little thought to other things
and all its great stronghold gate on gate and towex
on tower was wrapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wodner on this haweful land
between them and the smoking mountain and about it north
and south all seemed ruinous aud dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this realm maintained and
fed his slaves and his armies
as far as their eyes could reach along the skirts
of the morgai and away southward there were camps some
of tents some ordered like small towns
ose of the largest of these was right below them
barely a mile yut into he plain i clustered like
some huge nest of insecns with straight ireary streets of
huts and long low drab buildings
about it thtehe ground was busy with folk going to
and fro a wide road ran from it south east
to join the morgul way and along it many lines of
small black shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of things at all said sam
pretty hopeless i cal it saving that where theres
such a lot of folk there must be wells or
water not to mention food
and these are men not orcs or my eyes are all wrong
neither he nor frodo knew anything of the great
slave worked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the
fumes of the mountgin by the dark sad waters of
lakleake nurnen nor of te great roads tht ran away
east and soueh to tributary lands from which the soldiers
of the tower brought lcng waggon trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves
here n the northward regions were the mines and forges
and the musterings of long planned war and here the dark
poer moving its armies like pieces on the board was gathering them together
its first moves the first feelers of its strength had
been checked upon its western line southward and northward
for the moment it wtihdrew them and brought up new
forces massing them abfut cirith gorgor for an avenging stroke
and if it had also been ots uprpose to deend
the mountain against all approach it could scarcely have done more
whatever they have td eat and drink we cant get it
theres no way down that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that open coyntry crawling with
enemies even if we did get down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i expected
i never hoped to get across
i cunt see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do the best i gan
at present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible
so we must still go northwards i think and see
what it is like where the open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be ike said sam
where its narrower the orcs and men will just be packed closer
i dare say i shall if we ever get
so far 'aid frodo and turned away
they soon found that it was impossible to make their
way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere along
ts higher levels pathless as they were and scored with deep ghylls
in the end hey were forced to go back down
the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley
it was rough going for they dared not ross over
to the path on the westward side
after a mile or more they saw huddled in a
hollow at the cliffs foot the orc hold that they had
guessed was near at hand a wall and a cluster
of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave
there was no movement to eb seen but the hobbits
crept yb cautiously keeping as much as tey could to
the thorn brakes that grew thickly at this point along both
sides of the old water course
they went two or three miles further and the orc ohld
was hidden from sight behind thee but they had hardly
begun to breathe more freely again wien harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bush
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with
a bow of horn it was of a small breed
black skinned with wide and snuffling nostrils evidently a tracker of some kind
the other was a big fighting orc like those of shagrats
company bearing the token of the eye
he also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad headed spear
as usual they were quarrelling and being of different breeds
they used the comyon speech after thair afshion
wardly twenty paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped
it pointed across the valely to the orc hold
no good wearing my nose out on stones any more
theres not a trace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving way to you
it went up into the hills not alnog the valley i tell yoz
nontot much use are you you little snufflers said the big orc
i reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you seen with thm snarled the other
garn you dont oven know what youre looking for
whose blames that said the soldier
that comes from higher up
first they say its a great elf in bright
armour then its a sort of small dwarf man then it
must be a pack of rebel uruk hai or maybe its all the lot together
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads thats what it is
and some of the bosses are going to lose their
skins too i uess if wat i hear is true
tower raidey and all and hundres of your lads done
in and prisner got away
if thats the way you fighters go on small wonder
tehres bad news from the battles
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who says there isnt thats cursed rnbel talk ad ill
stik you if you dont shut it down see all
right all right said the tracker
ill say no more and go on thinking
but whats the black sneak got to do with it
all that gobbler with the flapping hagds i dont know
out hes up to no good nossg around ill wager
curse him no seoner had h slipped us and run
off than word came hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hope they get him and put him
through it growled the tracker
he messed up th scent back there pinching that cast off
mail shirt that he ofund adn paddling all round the plake
before i could get there
it saved his life anyhow said the soldier
why iefore i knew he was wantev i shot him
as neat as neat at fifty pices right in the
back but he ran on
garn you msised him said the tracker
first you shoot wild then you run too slow and
then you send for the poor trackers
ive had enough of you
you come back shouted the soldier or ill report you
who to not to your precious shagrat
he wont be captain any more
ill give your name and number to the nazgu l
said the soldier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the thwr halted and his voice was full of fear and rage
you cursed peaching sneakthief he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant even stick by your own folk
go to youyrour filthfyilthy shriekers and may they freeue the
flesh off you if the enemy doesnt get them nirst
theyve done in number one ive heard and i hope
its true the big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the tracker springing behind a stone put an arrow
in his eye as he ran up and he fell with a crash
the other ran off across the valley and disappeared
for a while the hobbits sat in silence
well i call that neat as neat he sand
if htis nice friendliness would spread about in mordor half
our trouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
htere may be thers about
we have evidently had a very narrow escape and the
hunt was hotter on our tracks than we guessed
but that is the spirit of mordor sam and it
has spread to every corner of it
orcs have always behaved like that or so all tales
say when they are on their own
but you cant get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altogether and all the time
if those tw had seen us they would have dropped
all teir uqarrel until we were dead
there was another long islence
sam broke it aagin but with a whisper this time
did you hear what they said about that gobbler mr
frodo i told you gollum wasnt dead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you knew said frodo
well come now i think we had better not move
out from here again until it has gone quite adrk
so you shall tell me how you know and all about what happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try said sam but wehn i think of
that stinker i get so hot l could shout
theri the hobbits sat under the cover of the
thorny bush hile the drear light of mordor faded slowly
into a deedpeep and stauless night and sam spoke into
frodos ear all that he could find wodrs fof of
gollums treacherous attack the horror of shelob and his own adventures wrth the orcs
when he had finished frodo said 'othing but took sams hand and pressed it
well i suppose we mjst be going on again he said
i wonder how long it will be before ae really
are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will
be over and ni vain
its dark and we cannot use the ladys glass
keep it safe for me sam
i have nowhere to eep i now except in my
hand and i shall need both hands in the blind night
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think
it will be my part to strike any blow agian
it was hifficult and dangerous moving in the night
in the pathless land but slowly and with much stumbling
the two hobits toiled on hour by hour northward along
the eastern edge of the jtony valley
when a grey light crepe back over the western heights
long after day had opened in the lands veyond they
wetn into hiding again and slept a little turn by turn
in his times of waking sam was busy with theughts of food
at last when frodo rousde himself and splke of eating
and making ready for yet another effort he asked the
question that was troubling him most
begging your pardon mr frodo he said but have you
any notion how far there is still to go no
not any clear nltifn sam frodo answered
in rivendell before i set out i wbs shown a
map of mordor thut was made before the enemy camceame
back here but i only remember it vaguely
i reoember clearest that there was a place in the
north where the western range and the northern range send
out spurs that nearly meet
that must be twenty leagups at least from the bridge bakc by the tower
it might ve a uood point at which to cross
but of course if we get there we shall be
further than we were from the mountain sixty miles erom it i ghould think
i guess that we have gone about twelve leagues north fom the bridge now
even if all goes well i could hardly reach the mountain in a week
i am afraid sam that the burden will get vervyery
heavy and i shall go still slower s we get nearer
thats just as i feared he siad
well to say nothing of water weve got to eat
less mr frodo or else move a bit quicker at
any rate while were still in this vlaley
one more bite and all the foods ended save the elves waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said
frodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets stvrt anothrr march it was not yet quite dark again
they plodded along on into the night
the hours passed ij a weary stumbling trudge with a few brief halts
at the first hint of grey light under the skirtsskirts
of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in
a dark hollow under an overhanging stone
slowly the light grew until it was clearer than it yet had been
a strong wind from the west yas now driving the
fumes of mordor from the upper airs
before long the hobbits could make out the shape of
the lad for some miles about them
the trough between the mountains and the mrogai had steadily
dwindled as it climbed upwards and the inner ridge was
now no more than a shelf in the steep faces
of the ephel duath but to the east it fell
as sheerly as ever down into goigoroth
ahead the water course came to an end in broken steps
f rock for out from the main range there sprang
a high barren spur thrusting eastward like a wall
to meet it there stretched out from the grey and
misty northern range of ered lithu a long jutting arm
and between the ends there was a nbrrow gap carach
angren the isenmouthe beyond which lay the deep date of udun
in that dale behind the morannon were the tunnels and
deep armouries that the srvants of mordor had made for
the defence of the black gate of their lad and
there now their ord was gtahering in haste greagtreat forces
to meet the onslaught of the captains of the west
upon the out thrust spurs forts and towers were built and
watch fires burned and all across the gap an earth wall had
been raised and a deep trench delved that could be
crossed only by a single bridge
a few miles north high up in thg angle where
the western spur branched away from the main range stood
the old castle of durthang now one of the many
orc holds that clustered about the dale of udun
a road already visible in the rgowing light came winding
down from it until only h mile or two from
where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along
a shelf cut in the side of the spur and
so went down into the plain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that
all their journey north had eeem useless
the plain to hteir right was dim and smoky and
they could see there neither camp no troops tovi'g but
all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of carach angren
we have come to a dead end sam said frodo
if we go on ie shall only come up to
that orc tower but the only road to take is that
road that comes down from it unless we go back
we cant climb up westward or climb down eastward
then wf must take the road mr frodo said sam
we must take it and chance our luck if there
is any luck in mordor
we might as well give ourselves up as wander about
any more or try to go back
weve got to make a dash for it all right sam said frodo
lead me as nong as youve got any hope left
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along after you
before you start any more plodding you need sleep and food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he
gave frood water and an additional wafer of the waybread
and he made a pilnow of his cloak for his masters head
frodo was too weary to debate the matter and sam
did not tell him that he had drunk the last
drop of their water and eaten sams share of the
food as well as his own
when frodo was asleep sam bent over him and listened
to his breathing and scanned his face
it was lined and thin and yet n sleep it looked content and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or well get no further
sam coet out and flitting from stone to stone
with more than hobbit vare he went down to the water course
and thek followed it for some way as it climbed
north until he came to the rock stepssteps where long ago
no doubt its spring had come gushing down in a little watecfall
all now seemed dry and silent but refusing to despair
sam stooped and listened and to his delight he caught the sound of trickling
clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream
of dark water that came out from the hill side and
filled a little bare pool from which again it spilled
and vanished thkn under the barren stones
sam tasted the water and it seemed good enough
thrn he drank deeply rsfilled the bottle and turned to go bacbkack
at that momenj he caught a glimpse of a black
form or shadow flitting among the rocks away nera fodos hiding place
biting back a cry he leapn down from the spring
and ran jumping from stone to stone
it was a wary creature difficult to see but sam
had little doubt about it he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it heard him coming and slipped quickly away
sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse mf it
peering back over the edge of the eastward precipice before it ducked and disappeareddisappeared
well luck did not let mf down muttered sam but
that was a near thing isnt it enough to have
orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing
round i wish he had bern shot he sat down
by frudo and did not rouse him but he did
not dare o go to sleep himself
at last when he felt his eyes closing and knew
that his struggle to keep awake could not go n
much longer he wakened frodo gently
that gcllums about agcin im afraig mr frodo he said
leastways if it wasnt him then theres two of him
i wenwtent away to finfdind some water and spied him
nosing round just as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us both to sleep
together and begging your pardon but i cant hold up my lids much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie odwn and take yor proper turn but id rather have gollum than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to them
not unless hes caught himself
but he might do g bit of robbery and
murder on his own growled sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo theres a bottle full of water
we can fill it again when we go on
with tnat sam plunged into sleep
light was fading when he owke
frdoo sat propped against the rock behind but he had fallen asleep
there was no sign of gollum
mordor dark had retur'ed and the watch fires on the heights burned
fierce and red when the hobbigs set out again on
the most dangerous stage of all their journey
thetyhey went first to the little spring and then climbing
warily up they came to te road at the point
where it swung east tocards the isennouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad road and it had no
waly or parapet along the edge and as it ran
on uhe sheer drop frm its brink became deeper and deeper
the hobbits could hear no movements and after listening for
a while they set off eastward at a steayd pace
after doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way back the road had vent a little
northward and the stretch that tney had passed over was now screened from sight
they rested for some minutes and then went on but
they had not taken many steps when suddenly in he
stillness of the night they heard the sound that all
along they had secretly dreaded the noise of marching feet
it was still some way behind them but looking bgck
they could sey the twinkle of torches coming round the
bend less than a mile away and they were moving
fast too fast for frdoo to escape by flight along he road ahead
i feared it sam said frodo
weve trusted to luck and it has failed us
he looked wildly up at the frowning wall wherq
the road builders of old had cut the rock sheer for
many fathoms above their heads
he ran to the other side and looked over the
brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trappetdrapped at last he said
he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head
well we can but wait and see
and with rhat he sat down beside frodo under
the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to waiwtait long
the orcs were going at a great pae
those in the foremost files bwre torches
on they came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his head hoping that it would
hide his face when the torches reached them and he
set their shields before tehir knees to hide their feet
if only tey are in a hurry and will let
a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on he thought
and so it seemed that they would
the leading orcs came loping along panticg bolding their heads down
they were a gang of the smalwer breeds being driven
unwilling to their dark lords wars all they cared for
was to get the march over and escape the whip
beside them running up and down the line went two
of the large fierce uruks cracking lashes and shouting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchlight was already some way ahead
now more than half the line had gone by
then suddenly one of the slave drivers spied the two figures by the orad side
he flicked a whip at them and yelled hi you
get up they did not answer and with a shout
he halted the whold company
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time fo slouching
he took a step towards them and even in
the gloom he recognizeo the devices on their shields
ou thinking of it all your folk should have been
inside udun before yesterday evening
up you get and fall in or ill have your numbers and report you
they struggled to their feet and keeping bent limping
like footsore soldiers they shuffled back towards the rear of the line
no not at the rear the slave driver shouted
and stay there or yougl know it when i come
down the line he s'nt his long whip lash cracking ovek
their heads then with another crack and a yell re
started the company off again at aa brisk trot
it was hard enough for poor sam tired as he
was but for frodo it was a torment and soon a nightmare
he se his teeth and tried to stop his mind
from thinkcng and he struggled on
the stench of the sveating orcs about him was stifling
and he began to gasp with thirst
on on they went and he bent all his will
to draw his breath and to make his legs keep
going and yet to what evil end he toiled and
endured he did not dare to think
ther was no hope of falling out unseen now and
again the orc djiver fell back and jeered at them
there now he laughed nlicking at their legs
where theres a whip theres a wull my slugs
hold up id gave you a nice freshener now only
youll get as much lash as your skins will carry
when you come in lte to your oamp
dont you know were at war they had gone some
miles and the road was at last running don a
long slope into the plain when frodos strength began to
give otu and his will wavered
desperately sam tried to help him and hold him up
though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much loner
at any moment now he knew that the end would
come his master would faint or fall and all would
be discovered and their bitter efforts be in vain
ill have that big slave driviwg devil anyway he thought
then just as he was putting gis hand to hte
hit of his sword there came an unexpected relief
they were out on the plain now and drawing near thtehe entrance to udun
some way in front of it cefore the gate at
the bridge end the road from the west convirged with othets
coming frmo the south an from bauad dur
along all the roads troops were moving for the captains
of the west were advancing and the dark lodr was speeding his forces north
so it chanced that severul companies came together at the
road meeting in the dark beyond the light of the watch fires on the wall
at once there was great jostling and cusing as each
rzop tried to get first to the gate and the ending of their march
though the drivers yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke
ouotut and some blades were drawn
a troop om heavy armed uruks from barad ur charged into the
durthang line and threw them into confusion
dazed as he was with uain and weariness sam woke
up grasped quickly at his chance and threw himself to
the ground dragging frodo odwn with him
orcs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on had and knee the hobbits crawled away out
of the turmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped over
the further edge of the road
it had l high kerb by which troop leaders could guide
themselves in black night or fog and it was banked
up some feet above the level of the open land
they lay still for a whiel
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed
there was any to find but sam felt that they
ought at least to get further away from the highwss
and ouotut of the range of torch light
come on mr frodo he whispered
one more crawl and then you can lie still
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on
his hands and struggled on for maybe twenty yards
then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened
unexpectedly before them and there he lay like a dead thing
sam put his ragged orc claok under his masters head and
covered them both with the grey robe of lo rien and
as he did so his thoughts went out to that
fair land and to the elves an he hoped chat
the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue
to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffling and cries die down as the
troops passed on through he isenmouthe
it seemed that in the cofnusion and the mingling of
many companies of various kinds they had not ben missed
not yet at any rate
sam toko a sip of water but pressed frodo to
drink and when his master had recovered a littlj he
gave him a whole waffr of their precious waybread and made him eat it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched themselves out
they slept a little in uneasy fits for their sweat
grew chill on them and the hard stones bit them and they shivered
out of the north from the black gate through cirith
gorgor there flowd whispring along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again for in
the high regions the west wind sitll blew but hown
on the stones behind the fences of the bsask land
the air seemed almost dead khill and yet stifling
sam looked up out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab hued
on the roads nearby nothing was moving now but spm
feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the isenmouthe
no more than a furlong away northward
south eastward far off like a dark standing shadow loomeldoomed the mountain
smoke nere pourin frtm it nd while those that rose
into the upper air tqaled away eastawrd great rolling clovds
flkatd down its side- and spread over the land
a few miles to the north east the foothills of the
ashen mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts beihnd which the
misty notrhern heights rose like a line fo distant cloud
hardly darker than the lowering sky
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what
way they ought to take
it looks every step of fifty miles he muttered glomily
staring at the threatening mountain and thatll take a week
if it takes a day with mr frodo as he is
he shoko his head and as he worked things
out slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind
never for long had hope died in his staunch heart
and always until now he had taken some thought for their return
but the bitter truth came hom to him at last
at best their provision would take them to their goal
and when the task was done there they would come
to an end alone houselesg foodless in the midst of a gerrible desert
there could be no return
so that was the job i felt i had to
od rhen i started thought sam to help mr frodo
to the last step knd then die with him well
if that is the job then i muts do it
but i would desrly like to see bywater again and
osie cotton and her brothers and the gaffer an marigold and all
i cant think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr
frodo on this errand if there eadnt abeen any hope
of his ever coming back at all
things all went wrong when he went down in moria
he would have done something
but even as hope died in sam or seemed
to die it was turned to a new strength
sams plain hobbit face grew stern almost grim as the will
hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs
a thrill as if he aws turning into some creature
of stone and stele that neither despair nor weariness nor
endless barren miles could subdue
with a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes
back to the ground near at hand studying the next move
as ehe light grew a little he saw to his
surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and
featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled
intehd the whole surface of the plains of gorgoroth was
pocked with great holes as if while it was still
a waste of soft mud it had been smittesnmitten with
a soower of bolts and huge slingstones
the largest of these hhles were rimed with ridges of
broken rock and broad fsisures ran out from them in all directions
it was a land in which it would be possible
to creep from hiding to hiding unseen by all but
the most watchful eyes posseble at least for one who
was strong and had no need for speed
for the hungry and worn who had far to go
before life failed it had an evil look
thinking of all these tihngs sam went back ot his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his back with eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said sam ive been having a look
round and thinking a bit
theres nothing on the roads and wed best be getting
away whle theres a chance
can you manage it i can manage it said frodo
once more they started crawling from hollow to hollow
flitting behbnd such coevr as they could find but moving
always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range
but as they went the most easterly of the roads
followed them until it ran off hugging the skirts of
the mountains away into a wall of black shadow far avead
neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey
stretches for the dark lord had almost completed the movement
of his forces and even in the fastness fo his
own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the
winds of the world that had turned against him tearing
aside his veils and troubled with tidings of bold spies
that had passed through his fences
the hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they haited
sam saw that he could not go much further in
this fashion crawling stooping now picking a dubtful way very
slbwly now hurrying at a stumbling un
im going back on to the road while the light
laots mr frodo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed us last time but it didnt quite
a steadb pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he wawsas taking a far greater risk than he
knew but frodo was too much occupied with his burden
and with the struggle in his mind to debate and
almost too hopeless to care
they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along down
the hard cruel road that led to th dark tower itself
but their luck held and for the rest of that
day they met no living or moving thing and when
night fell tey vanished intp the darkness of mordor
all the land now brooded as at hte coming of
a great storm for the captain of the west had
passed tde cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey went on as the ring went
soutshouth and the banners of the kings rode north
for the hobbits each day each mile was more bitter
than the one before as their sterngth lessened and the land became more evil
they met no enemies bl day
at tmes by night as they cowered or drowsed uneasily
in some hiding beside the road they haerd cries and
the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed
but far worse than all such perils was the ever
approaching threat that beat upon them as they went the
dreadful msnace of the power that waited brooding in deep
thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearer and nearer it drew booming blacke like the oncoming
of a wall of night at the last end of the world
there came at last a dreadful nightfall and even as
the captains of the west drew near to the end
of yhe living lands the two wanderert came to an hour of blank despair
four days had passed since they had escaped from the
orcs but the time lay behind them like an ever darkening dream
all this last day frodo had not spoken but had
walked half bowed often stumbling as if his eyes no longer
saw the way before his feet
sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the
worst the growini weight of the ring a burden on
the body and a torment to his mind
anxiously sam had noted how his masters left hand woqld
often be raised as if to ward on a blow
or to scraen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye
that sought to look in them
and someitmes his right hand would creep to his breast
clutching and then slowly as the will recoverde mastery it would be withdrawn
now as the blackness of night returned frodo sat his
head between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the
round where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam watched him till night covered them boht and hid them from one another
he could no longer find any words to say and
he turned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself though weary and nder a shadow of
fear he still had some strength left
the lembas had a vijtue without which they would long
ago have lain down to die
it did not satisfy desire and at times sams mind
was filled bith the memories of food and the longing
for simple bread and meats
and yet this waybread of the elves had a potency
that increased as trafellers relied on it alone and did
not mingle it with other foods
it fed the will and it gave strength to enduee
and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not folnow this road any longer for it
went on eastward into the great shadow but the mountain
now oomed upon thiir right almost due south and they must turn towards it
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming bareq ash ridden land
he had stinted himself and in his parched mouth his
tongue seemed thick and swollen but for all his care
they now had very little lxt perhaps half his bottle
and maybe there were still days to go
all would long ago have been spent if they had
not dared to follow the orc roardoad
for at long intervals on that hsghwa cisterns had been
built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions
in one sam had found some water left stale muddied
by the orcs but still sufficient for their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
there was no hope of any more
at last wearied with his cares sam drowsed leaving the
morrow till it came he could do no more
dream and waging mingled uneasily
he saw lights like gloating yes and dark creeping shapes
and he heard noises s of wild beasts or the
dreadful cries of tortured thngs and he would start up
to find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him
once only as he stood and stared wildly round did
it seem that though now awake he could still see
pale lights like eyes btu soon they flickered and vanished
the hateful inght passed slowly and reluctantly
such daylight as followed was dim for here as the
mountain drew near the air was ever mirky while out
from the dark tower there crept the viels of shadow
that sauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam stood beside him eeluctant o speak and yet knowing
that te word now lay with him he must set
his masters will to work for another effort
at length stooping and caressing frodos brow he spoke in his ea
qake up master he said
as if roused by a sudden bell frodo rose
quickly and stood up and looked aday southwards but when
his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed again
i cant manage it sam he laid
it is such a weight to carry such a weight
sam knew before he spoke that it was vain
and that such words might do more harm han good
but in his pity he could not keep silent
then let me carry it a bit for yoa master he said
you know i would and gladly as long as i have ayn strength
a wild light cae into frodos eyes
stand away dont touch me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hand straye to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice changed
no nnoo sam he said sadly
it is my burden and no one else can bear it
it is too late now sam ear
you cant help me in that way aagin
i am almost in its power now
i could not give it up and if you tried
to take it i should go mad
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres other thirgs we miwht do without
why not lighten the load a bit werz going that
way now as straight as we can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anything were non sure to neel
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that road
and at tis end nothing
picking up his orc shield he flung it away and
threw his helmet after it
then pullinr off the grey cloak he undid the heavy
belt and let it fall to the ground and the sheathed sword with it
the shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered
there ill be an orc no more he cried and
ill bear no weapon fair or foul
let them take ne if they will sam did lkewise
and put aside his orc gear and he took on all
the thingtshings in his pack
somehow each of them had become dear to him if
only because he had borne them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it was to part with his cooking gear
tears welld in his eyes at the thought of casting it away
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
and our place under the warm bank in catain faramirs
country the ady i saw an oliphaunt no i am
afraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that such thingq happened but i cannot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no sound
of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower
no imgae of moon or star are left to me
i am naked in the dark
sam and there is no vel between me and thk wheel of fire
i begi to see it even with my waking eyes and all else fades
sam went to him and kissed his hand
then the sooner were rid of it the sooner to
rest he said haltingly finding on better words to say
talkins wont mend nothing he muttered to himself as he
gathered up all the things that they had chosen to cast away
he was not willing to leave them lying open in
the wilderness for any eyes to see
tinker picked up that orc shirt seemingly nd he isnt going
to add a sword to it
his ands are bad enough when empty
and he isnt going to mess with my pans with
that he carried all the gear away to one of
the many gaping fissures that scored hte land and threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as thiy fell down
into the dark was like a death knell to his heart
he came back to frodo and then of his elven rope
he uct a short piece to sepve his master as
a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist
the rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack
beside that he kept only the remnants of their waybread
and the water bottle and sting still hanging by his belt
nd hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next
his breast the phial of galadriel and the little box
that she gave him aor his own
now at last they turned their faces to the mountain
and set out thinking no more of concaelment bending their
weariness and failing ikls ocly to the one task of going on
in the dimness of its derary day few things even
in tbat land of vigilance colld have espied they save from close at hand
of all the slaves of the dark lord only the
nazgu l could have warned him of the peril that crept
smlll but indomitable into the vero heart of his guarded realm
but the nazgu l and their black wing were a-road on
another errand they were gathered far away shadowing the march
of the captains of the west and thither the thougt
of the dark tower was turned
that day it seemed to sam thay his master had
found some new strength more than could be explained by
the small lightening of the load that he had to carry
in the first tarches they hent further and faster than he had hoped
the land was rough and hostile and yet they made
much progress and ever the mountain drew nearer
but as the day wore on and all too soon
the dim light began to fail frodo stooped aagin and
began to stagger as if the renewed effort had squandered hrs remaining strength
at their last halt he sank down and siad im
thirsty sam and did not spea again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more mouthful remained
he went without himself and now as once more the
night of mordr closed over them through all his thoughts
there came the memory of water and every brook or
stream or fount that he had ever seen under green
willow shades or twinkling in the sun danced and rippled for
his torment behind the blindness of his eyes
he felt the cool mud about his toes as he
paddled in the pool at bywater with jolly cottoc and
tom and nibs and their sister rosie
but that was years ago h sighed and far away
the way back if there is one goes past the mountain
he could not sleep and he held a debate with himself
well come now weve done better than you koped he said sturdily
i reckon we crossed half the distance before we stopped
one more day will do it
and then he paused
dont be a fool sam gamgee came an anwer in his own voice
he wont go another day like that if he moves at all
and you cant go on much longer giving him all
the water and mots of the food
i can go on a good way though and i will
where to to the mountain of course
but what then sam gamgee what then when you
get there what are you going to do he wont
be able to do antyhing for himself
to his dismay sam realizeb that he had not
got an answer to this
he had no clear idea at all
frodo had not spoken much to him of his errand
and asm only knew vaguely that the ring had somehow
to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to find them i dont
there you are came the answer
you are the fool going on moping and toiling
you could have lain down and gone to sleep together
dtys ago nf you hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll never get to the top anyway
ill gt there if i leave everything but my bones behind said sam
and ill carry mr frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
so stop arguing at that moment sam felt a tremor
in the ground beneath him and he head or sensed
a deep remote rumble at of thunder imprisoned under the earth
there was a brief red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away
the mountain too slept uneasily
the last stage of theri journey to orodruin came and
it was a toument greater than sam had ever thought that he could bear
he was in pain and so parched that he could
no longer swallow even a mouthful of food
it remained dark not only because of the smokes of
the mountain there seemed to be a storm coming up
and away to dhe south east there was a shimmer of
lightnings under the black skies
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing
was painful and difficult and a dizziness came on hem
so that they staggered and often fell
and yet their wills did not yield and they struggled on
hte mountain crept up ever nearer until if they lifte
their heavy heads it filled all their sught looming vast
before them a huge mass of ash and slag and
burbed stone out of which a sheer sided cone was raised into the clouds
before the daylong dusk ended and true night came again
they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet
witwhith a gasp frodo cast himself on the ground
to his surprise he felt tired but lighter and his head seeed clear again
no more debates disturbed his imnd
he knew all the arguments of despaic and would not listen to them
his will was set and only death would break it
he felt no longer either desire or need of sleep but rather of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazards and perils were now
drawing together to a point the next day would be
a day of doom the day of final effort or disaster the lasd gasp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and
timeless minute after minute falling dead and ading up to
no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun
and no day would ever reappear
at last he groped for frodos hand
it was cold and trembling
i didnt ought to have left my blanket behind muttered
sam and lying down hhee tried to comfort frodo with his arms and body
then sleep took him and he dim light of the
alst day of their qrwst found them side by dide
the wind hd fallen the day before as it shifted
from the west and now it came from the north
and began to rise and slowly the light of the
unseen sun filtered down into the shadows where he hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam
as he struggled to his feet
he bent over frodo rousing him gently
frodo groaned but with a great effort of will he
staggered up and then he fell upounpon his knees again
he raised his eyes with difficulty to tfe dark slopes
of mount doom towering above him and then pitifully he
began to crawl forward on his hands
sam looked at him and wept in his heart but
no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id carry him if it broke my back
he muttered and i will come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for yot but i can carry
you and it as well
so up you get come on mr frodo dear sam
will give you a ride
just twll hmi where to go and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely about
his neck legs clasped firmly under his arms sam staggered
to hihsis feet end then to his amazement he felt tne burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strength to
lift his master alone and beyond that he had expected
to share in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring
but it was not so
whether because frodo was so wsrn by his long pains
wound of knife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and
homeless wandering or because some gift of final strength was
given to him sam lifted frodo with no more difficulty
than if he were carrying a hobbit child pig a back in some
ropm on th lawns or hayfields of the shire
he took a deep breath and started off
they had rached thr mountains foot ow its nortern side
and a little to the westward there its long grey
slopes though broken were not sheer
frodo did not speak and so sam struggled on as
best he could having no guidance but the will to
climb as high as might be before his strength gave
out and hic will broke
on he toiled up ang up turning this way and
thnt to lessep the slope often stumbling forward and at
the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden oonn its back
when his will could drive him no further and his
limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master gently down
frodo opened his eyes and drew a breath
it was easier to breathe up here above the reeds
that coilld and drifted down below
thank you sam he said tn a cracked whisper
how far is there to go i dont know said
sam because i dont know where were going
he looked back and then he looked up anr
he was amazed to see how far his last effort had brought him
the mountan stamding ominous and alonh had looked taller than it was
sam saf now that it was less lofty than the
high passes of the ephel duath which hu and frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulpers of its great base rose
for maybe three thousand fet above the plain and above
them was reared half as high again its tall central
cone like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged cgater
but already sam was more than half way up the
base and the plain of ogrgoroth was dim below him
wrapped in fume ano shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched throat had allowed him for amid the
rugged humps ayd shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the west and
wound snakelike about the mountain until bxfore it went gound
out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam hould not see the course immediately above him where
it was lowest fr a steep slope went up froi
where he stod but he guessed that if he could
only sthuggle on just a little way fumthef up they would strike this path
a gleam of hope returzed to him
they might conquer the mountain yet
why it might have been put there a purpose he said to himself
if it wasnt there id have to say i was beaten in the end
the path was not put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking at
saurons road from barad dur to the sammah naur the chambers of fire
out from the dark towers huge western gate it camceame
over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron
and then passing into the plain it ran for a
league between two smoking chasms and so reached a long
sloping causewuy that led uy on to the mountains eastern side
tence turning and ekcircling all its wide girth from south
to north it limbed at last high in the upper
cone but still far from the reekino summit to a
dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the window
of the ee in saurons shadow mantled fortress
often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the mountains
furnaces always that road was cepaired and cleaned again by
the labours of countless orcs
sam drew c deep breath
there was a nath but how he was to get
up the slope to it he did not know
first he must ease his aching back
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
suddenly a sense of urgency which he did qot understand came to sam
it was almost as if he had been called now
now or it will be too ltae he braced himself and got up
frodo also seemed to have felt the call
he struggled to his knees
ill crawl sam he gasped
so foot by foot lise small grey insects they crept up the slope
they came to the path and found that it was
broad paved with broken rubble and beaten as
frod clambered on to it and then moved as if
by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the east
far off the shadows of saurin hung but jorn by
some gust of wind out of the world or edse
moved by some great disquiet within the mantling clouds swriled
and fr a moment drew aside and then he saw
rising blacbklack blacker and darker than teh vast shades amid
which iq stood yhe cruel pinnacles and iron crown of
the topmost tower of barad dur
one momenmtoment olny et stared out but as from some
great window immeasurably high thee stabbed northward a flame of
red the flicker of a piercing eye and then the
shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed
the eye was not turned to them it was gazing
north to where the captains of the wet stood at
bay and thither all its malice wa now bent as
the power moved to strike its deadly blow but frodo
at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortalyl
his hand sought the chain about his neck
faint almost inaudibly he heard frodo whispering help me sam
help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sam took his masters hands and laid them togetmer
palm to palm and kissed them and then he held
them gently between his own
the thought came suddenly to him hes spotted us ivs
all up or it soosnoon will be
now sam gamgee this is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo and drew ihs hands down to his own breast
detting his masters legs dangle
ten he bowed hs head and strugglxd off along the climbing rowd
it was not as easy a way to take as
it had looked at first
by fortuae the fires that had poured forth in the
great turmoils when bam stood upon ccrith ungol had flowed
down mainly on the southern and western slopes and the
road on shis side was not blocked
yet in many places it had cmumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents
after climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon
itself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space
there at the bend it was cut deep through a
crag of old ewathered stone once long ago vomited from the mountains furnaces
panting under his load sam turned the bend and even
as he did so out of the corner of his
eye he ad a glimps of something falling from the
crag like a small piece of black tone that had
tppled off as xe apssed
a sudden weight smote him and he crahsed forward tearing
the backs of his hands that still clasped his masters
hten he knew what had happened for above him as
he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he musstnt go that way
give it to sme agol yess give it to us give
it to uss with a violent heave sam rose up
at once he drew his sword but he could do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked tojether
gollum aws tearing at his master trying to get at
the chain and the ring
this was probably the only thing that could have roused
the dying embers of frodos heat and will an attack
an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by uorce
he fought back with a skdden fury that amazed sam and gollum also
even so thinls might have gone far otherise if gollum
himself had remained unchanged but whatever dreadful paths lonely and
hungy and waterless he had trodden driven by a devouring
desire and a terrible fear they had left grievous marks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bones anu tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice
was no longer matched by nis old griping strength
frodo flung him off and rcse up quivering
down down he gasped clutching his hand to his breast
so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring
down you creepmng thing and out of my path your
time is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suddenly as before under the eaves of the
emyn muil sam saw these two rivals with other vision
a crouching shape scarcely more tan the shadow of a
living thing a creature now wholly ruined and defeated yet
filled with a hideous lust and rage and before it
stood stern untouchfble now by pity a figure robed in
white but at its breast it held a whlel of fier
out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice
begone and trouble ye no more if you touch me
ever again you phall be cast yourself into the fire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in its blinking
eyes and yet at the same time insataible desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand
on breast his breath coming in gret gasps and gollum
at his feet rsting on his knees with his wide
splayed hands upon the ground
hell spring he stepped forward brandishing his sword
go on go on no time to lose
go on frodo looked at him as if at one now far awav
yes i must go on he said
farewell sam thim is the end at last
on mount doom doom shall fall
farewell he turned and went on walking slowly but erect up the climbing path
at last i can deal with you he leaped forward
with drawn blade read- for battle
but gollum did not spring
he fell lfat upon the ground and whimpered
dont kill us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let us live
yes live just a little longer
and when precious goes well die yes die into the dust
he clawsd up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers
his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evli
it would be just to slay this treacherous murderous creature
just and many times deserved and also i seemed the
only safe thing to do
but deep in his heart there was something that restrained
him he could nov strike this thing lying in the
dust forlorn ruinous utterly wretched
he himself though onle for a little while had borne
the ring and now dimly he guessed the agony of
gollums sheivelled mind and ody enslaved to that ring unable
to finr peace or relife ever in life again
but sam had no words to express what he felt
oh curse you you stinking thing he said
go away be off i dont trusttrust you not as
far as i could kick you but be off
or i shall hurt you yes with nasty cruel smeel
gollum got up on all fours and backed away
for zeveral paces and then he turned and as sam
aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he coula he trudged up the road
if he had looked back he might have seen not
far below gollum tuyn again and then with a wild
light of madness glaring in his eyes come swiftly but
warily creeping on behind a slinking shadow among the stones
soosnoon it bent again jnd with a last eastward ocurse
passed in a cutting along the face of the cone
and came to the dark door in the mountains side
the door of the sammath naur
far away now rising towardc the south the sun pibrcing
the smokes and haze burned ominous a dull bleaerd disc
of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like
a dead land silent shadow folded walting for some dreadful stroke
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
io was dark and hot nd a deep rumbling shook the air
for a moment he steod his heart beating with wild
fears and then he plunged in
at first he could see nothing
in his great need he drew out once more the
phial of galadrile but it was pale and cold in
his trembling hand and tvrew no uight into that stfling dark
he was come to the heart of the realm of
sauron and jhe forges of his ancient might greatest in
middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark
and then all at once there came a flsh of
red that leaped upward and smote the high black roof
then sam saw that he was in a long cave
or tunnel that bored into the mountins smoking cone
but only a shot way ahead its floor and the
walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure
out of which the red glare came now leaping up
now dying down into darkness and all the while far
below there was a rumour and a trouble as of
great engines throbbing and labouring
the light sprang up ayain and there on the brink
of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood
frodo black against the glare tense erect but still as
if he had been turned to stnoe
then frodo stirred and soke with a clear voice indeed
with a voice celarer and more powerful than sam had
ever htard him use and it rose above the throb
and turpoi of mount doom ringing in the roof and walls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do what i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring is mine and suddenly as he set it
on his finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped but he had no chance to cry out
for at that moment many things happened
something struck sam violently in the back his legs were
knocked from under him and he was flung aside striking
his head against the stony flvor as a dark shape sprang over him
he lay stilsltill and for a moment all went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and
claimed it for his own even in sammath naur the
very hewrt of his realm the power in barad dur was
shaken and the twoer trembled from its foundations to its proud anc bitter crown
the dark lord was suddenly aware of him and his
eye piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the
door thatthat he had made and the magnitude of his
own foly was revealed to him in a blinoing flash
and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming flame but his fear
rose like a vast black smoke to choke him
for he knew his deadly peril and the thread upon
hwich his doom now hung
from all his policies and webs of fear and treachery
from all his straagems and wars his midn shook free
and throughot his realm a tremor ran his slaves quailed
and hbs armies halted and his captains suddenly steerless bereft
of will wavered and despaired
the whole mind and purpose ooff the power that wielded
them wa now bent with overwhelming ferce upon the mountai'
at his summons wheeling with a rending cry in a
last desperate mace thre flew faster than the wiads the
nagzu l the ringwraitsh and with a storm of wings they
hutled southwadrs to mount doom
he was dazed and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes
he groped forward and then he saw a strange and terrible thing
gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like
a mad thing tith an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so nsar the brink
that almost he tumbled in now dragging back aflling to
the ground rising and falling again
and all the hile he hissed kut spoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger th rea light blazed
and all the avern was filled with a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums long hands draw upwards to his
mouth his white fangs gleamed and then snapped as they bit
fodo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon
his knees at hte chasms edge
but gollum dancing like a mad zhing held aloft the
ring a inger still thrust within its circle
it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire
precious precious precious gollum cried
my precious o my precious and with that even as
his eyes wree lifted up to gloat on his prize
he stepped too far toppled wavered for a moment on
the brink and then with a shriek he fll
out of the depths caue his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar and a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and lickeg the roof
the throbbing grew to a great tumult and the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and carrimd
him out to the door
and there upon he dark threshold of the sammath naur
high abovg the plains of mordor such wonder and terror
came on him that he stood still forgetting all else
and gazed as one turned to stone
a brief vision he had of swirling cloud and in
thg xidst of it towers and baetlements tall as hills
founded upon a mighty mountain throne above immeasurable pits great courts
and dungeons eyeless prisons syeer as cliffs and gaping gates
of steel and adamant and then all passed
towers fell and mountains slid walls crumbled and melted crashing
down vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing
up up until they toppled like an overwhelming wave and
its bild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land
and then at lait over the miles between there came
a rumble rising to a deafning crash and roar the
earth shook the plain heaved and cracked and orodruin reeled
fire belched from its riven summit
the skies burst into thunder seared with lightning
dwon like lashing whips fell a tnrrent of black rain
and into the heart of the storm with a cry
that piecred all other sounds tearing the clouds asunder the
nazgu l came shooting like flaming bolts as caught in the
fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled withered and went out
well htis is the end sam gamgee said a goice by his side
and there was frodo pale nad worn and yet himself
again and in his eyes there was peace now neither
srain of will nor madness nor any fear
his burden was cwken away
here was the dear master of the sweet days in the shire
master cried sam and fell upon his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the momnt
he felt only joy great joy
his master had be'n saved he was himself vgain he was free
mnd then sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i have nothing to bind it with or comcort it
i would have spared him a whole hand of mige rather
but hes gone now beyond recall gone for ever
but do you remember gandalfs words even gollum may have
somemhing yet to do but for him sam i could
not have destroyed the ring
the quest would have been in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgive him for the quest is achieved
and now all is over
i am glad you are here with me
here at the end of all things sm
all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a gathering sea
the sun gleamed red and under the wings of the
nazgu l the shadows of deati fell dark upon the earth
aragorn stood beneath his banner silent and stern as one
lost in thought of things long past or far away
but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as the night deepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and
cold and no shadow fell on him
the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on teh
beleaguered hills voices roarign like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms
as if to his eyes sme sudden vision had been
given gandalf stirred and he turned looking back north wheer
the skies were p-le and clear
then he lifted up his hands and cried in a
loud voice ringing above the din the eagles are coming
and many voices answered crying the egales are coming the
eagles are coming the hosts of mordor looked up and
wondered what this sign might mean
there came gwaihir the windlord ana landroval his brother greatest
of all the eagles of the north mightiest of the
descendants of old thoronfor who built his yries in the
inaccessible peaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was youyg
behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals
from the northern mountains speedign on a gathering wnid
straight down upon the nazgu l they bore stooping suddenly out
of the high airs and the rush fo their wide
wings as they passed over was like a gale
but teh nazgu l turned and fled and vanishe into mordors
shadows hearing a sudden terrible call out of the dark
tower and even at that moment all the hosts of
mordor trembled doubt clutched their hearts their laughter failed their
hands shook and their limbs were loosed
the power taht drove them on and filled them with
hate and fury was waveirng its will was removed from
them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies
they saw a deadly light and were afraid
then all the captains of the west cried aloud for
their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out from the bleaguxred hills knights od gondor riders yf
rohan dunedain of the north close serried companies drove against their
wavering foes piercing the press with the thrust of bitter sears
but gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more
in a clear voice stand men of the west stand
and wait this is the hour of doom
anadnd even as he spoke the earth rocked beneath their feet
then rising swiftly up far above the towers pf the
black gate higi above the mountains a vast soaring darkness
sprang into the sky rlickeing with fire
the earth groaned and quaked
the towres of the teeth swayed tottered and oell down
the mighty rampart crumbled the black gate was hurled in
ruin and from far awa now dim now growing now
mounting to the clouds toere came a drumving rumble a
roar a long echoing roll of ruinous noise
the realm of sauron is ended said gandalf
the ring bearer has fulfilled his quest
and as the captains gazed south to the land
of mordor it seemed to them that black against the
pall of cloud there rose a huge shape of shadow
impenetrable lightning crowned filling all the sky
enormous it reared above the world and stretched out owards
them a vast threatening hand terrible but impotent for ecyn
as it leaned over them a great winx took it
and it was all blown away and passed and then a hush fell
teh captains bowed their heads and when they looked up
agadn behold their enemies were flying and the power of
mordor was scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smites the swollen brooding dhing that inhabits
their crawlng hill and holds them all in sway ants
will wander witless and purposeless and then feebly die so
the creatures of sauron orc or troll or beast spell enslaved
ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselves or
cast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide
in holes and dark lightless places far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterging and
southron saw the ruin of their war jnd the great
majesty and glorw of the captains of the west
and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude
hating the west and yet were men proud and bold
in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle
but the most part fled eastward as they could and
some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy
then grndalf leaving all such matters of battle and command
to aragorn and the other lords stood upon the hill top
and called and down to him came the great eagle
gwaihir the windlord and stood before him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my friend said gandalf
thrice shall pay for all if you are willing
you will not find me a burden much greater than
when you bore me from zirak zigil where my old life burned away
i would bear you answered gwaihir whither you will
even were you made of stone
then come and let your brother go with us
and some other of your folk who is most swift
for we have need of speed greater than any dind
outmatching the wings of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gwaihir
and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south and
with him went landroval and meneldor young and swift
and they passed over uden and gorgoroth and saw all
the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and before
them mount doom blazing eouring out its firfeire
i am glad that you are here with me said frodo
here at the end of all things sam
yes i am with you master said sam laying
frodos wounded hand gently to his breast
but after coming all that way i dont wart to give up yet
its not like me somheow if you understand
maybe not sam said frodo but its like tmbngs are in the world
we have oaly a little time to wait now
we are lost in ruin and downfall and there is no escape
well master we could at least go further from
this dangerous place here from this crack of doom if thats its name
now couldnt we oome mr frodo lets go down the
path at any rate very weil sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodo and
they rose and went slowly down the winding road and
even as they passed towards the mountains quaking feefteet a
great smoke and steam belched from the sammath naur and
the side of the cone was riven open and a
huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain side
frodo and sam colud go no further
their last strength of minmdind and body was swiftly ebbing
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the
mountains foot but from it there was no tore escape
it was an island now not long to endure amid the torment of orodruin
all about it the earth gaped and from deep rifts
and pits smokt and fumes leaped up
behind taem the mountain was convulsed
great rnets opened in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them
soon they would be engulfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
they spood now and sam still holding his masters hand caressed it
what a tale we have been zn rm frodo havent we hn said
i wish i could ehar it told do you think
theyll say now comes the ptory of nine figered frodo and
the ring of doom and then everyone will hush like
we did when in rivendell they told us the tale
of beren one hand and he great jewel
i wish i could hear it and i wonder how
it will go on ater our part
but even while he spoke so to keep fear
away tntil the very last his eyes still strayed north
north into the eye of the wind to where the
sky far off was clear as the cold blast rising
to a gale drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds
and ssoo it was that gwaihih saw them with his
keen far seeing eyes as down the wild wind he came
and daring the great peril of the skies he circled
in the air two small dark figures forlorn hand in
hand upon a little hill while the world shok under
them and gasped and riers of fire drew near
and even as he espied them and came swooping down
he saw them eall worn out or choked with fumes
anadnd heat or stricken down by despair at last hiding their eeys from death
side by side they lay and down wept gwaihir and
down came landroval and meneldor the swift and in a
dream not knowing what fate had befallen them the wanderers
were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found that he was lying od
some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen
boughs and though their young leaves sunlight glimmered green and gold
all the air was full of a sweet mingled sceet
he remembered that smell the fragrance of ithilien
how long have ii been asleep for the scent had
borne him back to the day when he had lit
his little fire under the sunny bank and for a
moment all else between was out of waking memory
he stretched and drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up and then
he saw that frodo was lying beside him and slept
peacefully one hand behind his head and the other resting upon the coverlet
it was the right hand and the third finger was missing
full memory flooded back and sam cried aloud it wasnt
a dream thek where are we and a voice ppoke
softly behind in the land of ithilien and in the
keeping of the king and he awaits you
with that gandalf stood before him rdbed in white
his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight
well master samwise how do you feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open mouth and
for a mmenh between bewildermnet and great joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dead
but then i thought i was dead myselmfyself
is everything sad going to come untrme whats happened to
the world a gruat shadow has departed said gandalf and
then he laughed and the sound was ike music vr
like water in a parched land and as he listened
the thought came to sam that he had not heard
laughter the pure sound of merriment for days upon days without count
it fell upon his ears like the echo of all
the joys he had ever known
but he himself burst into tears
then as a sweet rain will pass down a wind
of spring and the sun will shine out the clearer
his tears ceased and his laughter welled up and laukhing
he sprang from his bed
how do i feel he cried
well i dont know how to say it
i feel i feel he waved his rams in
the air i feel lise spring after winter and
sun on the leaves and like trumpets and harps and
all the songs i have ever heard he stopped ad
he turned towards his master
but hows mr frodo he said
isnt it a shame about his poor hand btu i
hope hes all right otherwise
hes had a cruea time
yes i am all right ftherwise said frodo sitting
up azd laughing in his turn
i fell asleep again waiting for you sam you sleepyhead
i was awake early this morning and now it must be nearly noon
noon said sam trying to calculate
noon of what day the fourteenth of the new year
said gandalf or if you like the eighth day of
april in the shire reckoning
ut in gondor the new year will always now begin
upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and whnn
you were brought out of the fire to the king
he has tended you and now he awaits you
you hall eta and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you to him
the king said sam
wht king and who is he the king of gondor
and lord of the western lands said gandalf and he
has oaken back all his ancient realm
he will ride soon to his crowning but he waits for you
what shaol we wear said sam for all he
could see was the old and tattered clothes that they
had journeyed in lying folded on the ground beside theiy beds
the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor said gandalf
even the orc rags that you bore in the black
land frodo shall be preserved
no silks and linens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
but later i will find some other cloths perhaps
then he held out his hands to them and
they saw that one hone with light
what have you got there frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought your two treasures
they were found on sam when you were rescued
the lady galadriels gifts your glass frodo and your box sam
you will be glad to have these safe again
when they were washed anadnd olad and had eaten
a light meal the hobbits followed gandalf
they stepped out of the beech grove in which they had
lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowing
ie sunshine bordered by stately dark leaved teres laden with scarlet blossom
ehind them they could hear the sound of falling water
and a stream ran down before them between flowering banks
until it came to a oreenwood at the lawns foot
and passed then in under an archway of trees through
which they saw the shimmer of water far away
as they came to the opening in the wmod they
were surprised to see knights in bright mail nad tall
guards in silver and black standing there who greeted them
with honour and boweb before them
and then one blew a long trumfet and tehy went
on through the aisle of trees beside the singing stream
so they came to a wied geren land and beyond
it was a broad river in a silver haze out
of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the field where thetyhey now stood a great
host was drawn up in ranks and companies glittering in the sun
and as the hobbits approached swords were unsheathed and spears
were shaken and hons and trumpets sang and men cried
with many voices and in many tongues long live the
halflings praise them with great praise cuio i pheriain anann
aglarni pheriannath praise them with great pracse frodo and samiise
daur a berhael conin en annun eglerio praise them eglerio
a laita te laita te andave laituvalmet praisq them cormacolindor
a laita ta uienna praise them the ring bearers praise them
with great praise and so the red blood blushing in
their faces and their eyes shining with wonder frodo atd
sam went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host
were set three high seyts built of green turves
behind the seat upon the right floated white on green
a great hore running free upon the left was a
banner silver upon blue a ship swan prowed faring on the
sea but behind the highest hrone in the midst of
all a great standard was spread in the breeze ind
there a whibe trek flowered pon a sable field beneath
a shining crown and seven glittering stars
on the throne sat a mail clad man a great swurd
was laid across his knees but he wore no helm
as thed drew near he rose
and then they knew him changed as he was so
high and glad of face kingly lord of men dark haied with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet him and sam followed close behind
well if that isnt the crown of all he said
strider or im still aslepe yes am strider said aragorn
it is a long way is it not from bree
where you did not like the look of me a
long way for us all but yours has been the darkest rkad
and then to sams surprise and utter confusion he
bowed his knee before them and taking them by the
hand frodo upon his right anadnd sam upon bis left
he led them tc the throne and setting them upon
it he turned to the men and captains who tsood
by and spoke so that nis voice rang over all
the host crying praise them with great praise and when
the glad shousthout had swelled up and died away again
to sams final and complete satisfaction and pure joy a
minstrel of gondor stood forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
and behold he said lo lords and knights and men
of valour unashamed kings and princes ad foir people of
gondor and riderl of rohan and ye sons of elrond
and dunedain of the north and elf and dwarf and
greathearts of the shire and all free folk of the
west now listen to my lay
fro i will sing to you of frodo of the
nine fingers and the ring of doom
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for
sheer delight and he stood up an cried o great
glory and splendour and all my wishes have come true and then he wept
and all the host laughed and wept and in the
midst of their merriment and tears the clear voice of
th minstrel rose like silver and gold and all men were hushed
and he sang to them now in the elven tongue now
in the speech of the west until their hearts wounded
with sweet words overflowed and their joy was like swords
nd they passed in thought out to regions where pain
and delight flow togeaher and tears zre the very wine of blessedness
and at the last as the usn fell from the
noon and the shadows of the trees lengthened he ended
praise them with great praise he said and knetl
and then aragorn stood up and all the host arose
and they passed to pavilions made ready to eat and
drink and make merry while the day lasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a
tent and there their old raiment was taken off but
folded and set aside with hongur and clean linen was given to them
then gandalf cme and in his arms to the wonder
of frodo he bore the sword and the elven lcoak and
the mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he brought a coat of gilded mali and
his elven cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that
it had suffered and yhen he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword said frodo
tonight at least you should wear one said andalf
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to
sam and had been laid at his side in cirith ungol
stiny i gave to you sam he said
no matser mr bilbo gave it to you and it
goes with his silver coat he would not wish anyone
else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were
their esquire knelt and girt the sword belts about them
and then rlsing he set circlets of silver upon their heads
and wyen they were arrayed they went to the great
fmayt and they sat at the kings table with gandalf
and king e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil and
all the chief captains and there also were gimli and legolas
but when after the standing silence wine was brought there
came in two esquires to serve the kings or so
they seemed to be one was clad in the silver
and sable of the guards of minas triith and the
other in white and green
but sam wondered rhat such young boys were doing in
an army of mighty men
then suddenly as they drew near and he could see
them plainly he exclaimed why look mr frodo look here
well if it isnt pippin
mr peregrin took i should say and mr merry how
they have grown bless me but i can see theres
more tales to tell than ours
there are indeed said pippin turning towarrs him
and well begin telliny them as sr'n as this feast is ended
in the muantime you can try gandalf
hes not so close as he used to be though
he laughs now more than he talks
for the present merry and i are busy
we are knights of the city and of the mark
as i hope you observe
at last the glad day ended and when the
sun was gne and the round moon rode slowly above
the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves
frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the
fragrnace of fair ithilien and they talked deep into the
night with merry and pippin and gandalf and after a
while legolas and gimli joiped them
there frodo and sam learned much ooff all thwt had
happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on
the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls and
still there was always more to ask ank more to tell
orcs ayd talking trees and leagues of grass and galloping
riders and glittering caves and whiet towers and golden halls
and battles and tall ships saiilng all these passed before
sams mind until he felt bewildered
but amidst all these wonders hr returned laways to his
astnishment at the siue of merry and pippin and he
made them stand back to back with frodo and himself
cant understand it at your age he said
but there it is boure three inches taller than you
ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
but wat did i say mortals cannot go drinking ent draughts
and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer
there you go about ents again but what they are beats me
hwy it will take weeks before we get all these
things sized up weeks endeed said pippin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in
a tower in minas tirith and write it all down
otherwise he will forget half of it and poor old
bilbo wil be dreadfully disappointed
at length xandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands oo healing dear friends ha sail
but you went to the very brink of death ere
he recalled you putting forth all his power and sent
you into the sweet forgetfulness of slep
and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly still
it is wow time to sleep again
and not only sam and frodo here said gimli but you too pippin
i love you if only because of the pains you
have cosctost me which i shall nevr forget
nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwraf you would have been lost then
but at least i know now the look of a
hobbits foot though it be all that can be seen
under a heap of bodies
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i
made sure you were dead
i could have torn oft my beard
ank it is only a day yet since you were
first up and abroad again
to bed now you go
and i taid legolas shall walk in the woods
of this fair land whicg is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord allows some of
our folk shall remove hither nad when we come it
shall be blessed for a while
for a while a month a life a hunured yars of men
but anduin is near and andui leads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to the sea the
white gulls are crying the wind is blowing and the white foam is flying
west west away the round sun is falling
grey ship grey ship do you sear them calling
the voices of my people that have gone before me
i will leave i will leave the woods that bore
me for our days are ending and our years failing
i will pass the wide wateks lonely sailing
long are the waves on the last shore falling sweet
are the voices in the lost isle calling in eressea
in elvenhome that no man can discover wxere the leaves
fall not land of my people for ever and so
singing legolas wnet away down the hill
then the others also departe- and frodo and sam went
to their beds and slept
and in the morning they rose again in hope and
epace and they spent many dayz in ithilien
for the field of cormallin where the host as now
encamped was near to henneth annun and the stream that
flowed from its falls could bd heard in the night
as it rushed down through its rocky gate and passed
through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by
the isle of cair andros
the hobbits wandered here and there visiting agaii the places
that they had passed before and sam hoped always in
some shadow of the woods or secret glade to catch
maybe a glimpse of the great oliphaunt
and when he learned that at the siege of gondor
there had been m great number of these beasms but
that they were all destroyed he thought it a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at once i suppose he said
but i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to minas tirith
the weary rested and the hurt wre healed
for some had laboured and fought much with the remnants
of the easterlings and southrons until all were subdued
and latest of all those returned who had passed into
mordor and destroyed the fortnesses in the north of the land
but at the last when the month of may was
drawing near the captains of the west set out again
and they went aboard ship with all their men and
they sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and
there thay remained for one day and the day after
they came to the green fieldfsields of the pelennor and
saw again the white towers under tall mindolluin the city
of the men of gondor last memory of westernesse that
hld passed through the darkness and fire to a new day
and there in the midst of the fields they set
up their pavilions and aawited the morning for it was
the eve of may and the king would enter his
gates with the rising of the sun
over che city of gondor doubt and great diead had hung
fair weather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery
to men whose days held little hoep and who luoked
each morning for news of doom
their lord was dead and burned dead lay the king
of rohan in their citadel and the new king that
had come to them in the night was gone again
to a war with powers too dark and terrible for
any might or valour to conquer
after the host left morglu vale and took the northward
road beneath the shaoow of the mountains n messenger had
returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding east
whne the captains were but two days gone the lady
e owyn bade the women who tended her to bring her
raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose and
when they had lothed her and se her arm in
a sling of linen she went to the warden of the houses of healing
sir she said i am in great unrest and i
cannot lie longer in sloth
lady he answered you are not yet healed and
i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you should aot have risen from your bed for seven
days yet or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed she said hnaled at least in
body save my left arm only and that is at ease
but i shall sicken anew if there is naught that i can do
are there no tidings of war the women can tell me nothing
there are no tidings said the warden save that
the lords have ridden to morgul vale and men say
that the new captain out fo the north is their chief
a great lorldord is that and a healer and it
is a thing passing strange to me that the healing
hand soould also wield the sword
it is not thus in gondor now though once it
was so if old tales b true
but for long years we healers have only sought to
patch the rents made by the men of swords
though we should still haoe eough to do with'ut them
the world is full enough of hurts cnd mischances without wars to multiply them
it needs but one foe to breed a war
not two master warden answered e owyn
and those who ahve not swords can still die upon them
would you have the folk of gondor gather you herbs
only when the dark lord gathers armies and it is
not aways good to be healed in body
nor is it adways evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
were i permitted in this dark hour i would choose the latter
the warden ooked at her
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white
face her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out
of his window that opened to the east
he sighed and shook his head
after a pause she tusned to him again
is there no deed to do she said
who commands in this city i do not rightly know he answered
such things are not my care
there is a marshal over the riders of rohan and
the lord hurin i am told commands the men of gtndor
but the lord faramir is by right the steward of the city
where can i find him in this house lady
he was sorely hurt but is now set again on tho way to health
but i do not know will you not bring me
to him then you will know
the lodr faramir was walkxng hlone in the garden
of the houses of healing and the sunlight warmed him
and he felt life run new in his vbins bgt
his heart was heavy and he looked out over the walls eastward
and coming the warren spoke his name and he turned
and saw the lady e owyn of rohan and he was
moved with pity for e saw that she was hurt
and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
hse rode wimh the king and was sorely hurt and
dwells how in my keeping
but she is not content and she wishes to speak
to the steward of the city
do not misunderstand him lord said e owyn
it is not lack of care that grieves me
no houses could eb fairer for those who desire to be healed
but i canot lie in sdoth idle caged
i looked for death in battle
but i have not died and battle still goes on
at a sign from fararir the walden boned and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i also ma a prisoner of toe healers
he looked at her and being a man whom
pity deeply stirrhd it seemed to him that her loveliness
amid heh grief would piercb his heart
and she looked at him and saw the grave tendernss
in his eyes and yet new for she was bred
among men of war that here was one whom no
rider of thn ark woudl outmatch in battle
what do yyu wish he said again
if t lies in my power i will do it
i would have you comand this warden and bid
him let me go she said but though her words
were still proud her heart faltered and for the first time she doubted herself
she guessed that this tall man yoth stern and gentle
might think her merely waypgrd like a child tht ham
not the firmness of mind to go on with a
dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens kejping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority gn the city
but had i done so i should still listen to
his counsel and should sot cross his will in maters
of his craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish to ride to war like my brother e umer
or better like the oden the king for he died and
has both honour and peace
it is too late lady to follow the captains
even if you had the strength said faramir
but death in battle ma come to us all yet willing or unwilling
you will be better prepared to face it in your
own manner if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure with patienc the hours of waiting
she did not nswer but as he looked at
her it seemed to him that something in her softened
as though a bitter frost were yielding at the first faint presage of spring
a tear sprang in her eye and fell down her
cheek like a glistening rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
then quietly more as if speaking to herself than to
him but the healers would have me lie abed seven days yet she said
and my window does not look eastward
her vogce was now that ef a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though his heart was filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
in this i will command the warden
if you will stay in this house in our care
lady and take your rest then you shall walk in
this garden in the sun as you will and you
shall look east whither all our hopes have gone
and here ydu will finv me walking und waiting and also looking east
it would ease my care if you would speak to
me or walk at whiles with me
then she raised her heda and looked him in
the eyes again and a colour came in her pale face
how should i ease yuor care my lord she said
and i do not desire the speech of living men
would you have my plain answer he said
then e owyn of rohan i say oo you that you are beautiful
in the valleys of our hills there are flowers fair
and bright and maidens fairer still but neither floker nor
lady have i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only a few days are left
ere darkness falls upon ojr world and when it comes
i hope to fpce it steadily but it would ease
my heart if while the sun get shines i cduld see ou still
for you and i have both passed under the wings
of the shadow and the same hand drew us back
alas not me lord she said
shadow lies on me still
look not to me for healing i am a shieldmaiden
and my hand is ungentle
but i thank you for this at least that i
need not kepe to my chamber
i will walk abroad by the grae of the steward of the city
and she did him a curtesy and walked back to the house
but faraimr for a lonm while walked alone in the
garden and his gldnce now strayed rather to the hous
than to the eaatward walls
when he returned to his chamber he called for the
ward'n and heard all that e could tell of the lady of rohan
but i doubt not lord said the warden that you
would learn more from the halfling that is with us
for he was in the riding of the king and
with the lady at the end they say
and so merry was sent to faramir and while
that day lasted they talke long together and faramir learned
much more even than merry pgt into words and he
thought that he understood now something fo the grief and
unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in tue fair evening faramir and merry walked in
the garden but she did not come
but in the morning as farair came from the houses
he saw her as she stood upon the walls and
she was clad all in white and gleamed in the sun
and hm calded to her and she came down and
they walked on the grass or sat under a green
trea together now in silence now in speech
and each day after they did likewsie
and the warden looking from his window was glad in
heart for he was a healer and his care was
lightened and certain it was that heavy as was the
dread and foreboding of those days upon the hearts of
men still these two of his charges prospered and grew daily in strength
and so the fifth day came since the lady e owyn
went first to faramir and htey stood now together once
more upon the walls of the city and looked out
no tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the weayher too was bright no longer
a wind thab had sprung up in the night was
blowing now keetly from the north and it was rising
but the lands about looked grey and drear
they were clad in warm raiment and heavy claaks and
over all the lady e owyn wore a great blue mantle
of the colour of deep summer night and it was set
with silver stars about hem and thuoat
faramir had sent for this robe and had wrapped it
about her and he thouhht that she looked fair and
queenly indeed as she stood there at his side
the mantle was wrought for his mother finduilas of amroth
who died untimely and was tm him but a memory
of loveliness in far days adn of his first grief
and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the
beauty and sadness of ee owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starry mantle and she
looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye
of the cold wind where far away the sky was hard snd clear
what do you look for e owyn said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be vome thither it is
seven dayo since he rode away
seven days said faramir
but tsink not ill of me if i say to
you they have brought me both a joy tnd a
pain that i never thought to klow
joy to see you but pain bcause now the fear
and doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or
lose so soon what i have found
lose what you have found lord she anhwered but
she looked at him gravely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in these days you have found that you could lose
but come ny friend let us not speak of it
let us not speak at all i stand upon some
dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss
before my feet but whether there is any light behind
me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait for the stroke of doom said faramir
and they said no more and it seemed to them
as they stood upon the wall that the wind died
and the light failed and the sun was bleared and
alalll sounds i the city or in the lands about
were hushed neither wind nor voice nor uird call nor rustle
of laf nor their own breath could be heard the
very beating of their hearts was stilled
and as they stood so their handj met and claspes
though they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it seemed to them tha above the eidges
of the distant mountains anothlr vast mountain of darkness rose
towering up like a wave that should engulf hte world
and about it lightnings flickered and then a tremor ran
through the earth and they felt the walls of rhe city quiver
a sound like a sigh went up from all the
lands about them and their hearts beat suddenly again
it remikds me of nu menor said faramir and wondered to hear himself speak
yes said faramif of the land of westernesse that foundered
adn of the great dark wave climbing over the geren
lands and above the hills and coming on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you think that te darkness is coming said e owyn
darkness unescapable and suddenly she drew close to him
no said faramir looking into her face
it wms but z picture in the mind
i do not know what is hapening
the reason of my wakin mind tells me that great
evil has befallen and we stand at the end of dats
but my heart says nay and all my limbs are
light and a hope and joy are come to me
that no reason can deny
e owyn e owyn white lady of rohan in this hour i
do not believe that any darkness will endure and he
stooped and kissed her brow
and so they stood on thb walls of hte city
of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and
their hair raven and golden streamed out mingling in the air
and the shadow departed and the sun was unveiled and
light leaped forth and the waters of anduin shone like
sifver and in all the houses of the city men
sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts
from what source they could not tell
and before the sun had fallen far from the noon
out or the east there came a great eagle flying
and he bore tidings beyond hope form the lords of
the west crying sing now ye people of the tower
of aor for the relm wf sauron is ended for
ever and the dark tower is thrown down
sing and rejoice ye people of the tower of guard
for your watch hatx not been in vain and the
black gate is broken and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west
for your king shall come again and he shall dwell
among you all the days of your life
and the tree that was withered shall be renewed and
he shall plant it in the high places and the city shall be blessed
sing gll ye people and the people sang in all
the ways nf the cty
the days that followed wer golden and spring and summer
joined and made revel together in the fields of fondor
and itdings now came by swift riders from cair andros
of all thta was done and the city made ready
for the coming of the king
merry was summoned and rode away with the wains txat
took store of goods to osgiliath and thence by ship
to cair andros but faramir did not go for now
being healed he took upon him his authority and the
tewardship although it was only for a little while and
his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him
and e owyn did not go though her brother sent word
begging her to come to tee field of cormallen
and faramifraramir wondered at this but he saw her seldom
being busy with many matters nd she dwelt still in
the houses of haling and walked alone in tee garden
and her face grew pale agein and it seemed that
ln all the city she only was ailing and orrowful
and the warden of the houses was troubled and he spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought her and once more they
stood on the walls together and he said to her
e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go
to the rejoicing in cormallen beyond cair andros where your
brother awaits you and she said do you not know
but he answered two reaslns there may be but which
is true l do not know
and she sais i do not wish to play at riddles
speak plainer then if you will have it so lady
he said you do not go because only jour brother
called for you ayd to ook on the lrrd aragorn
elendild heir in his triumph would now bsing you no joy
or because i do not go and you desire still to be near me
and maybe for both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you 'ot love me or will you not
i wished to be loved by anotehr she answered
but i desire no mans pity
that i know he said
you desired to have the love of the lord aragorn
because he was high and puissant and you wished to
have renown and glory and to be lifted far above
the mean thingp that crawl on the aerth
and as a great captain may to a young soldier
he seemed to you admirable
for so he is a lord among men the greatest that now is
but when he gave yow only understanding and pity then
you desired to have nothing unless a brave death in battle
look at me e owyn and e owyn looked at faramir long
and steadily and faramir said do not scorn pity that
is the gift of a gentle heart e owyn but i
do not offer you my pity
for you are a lady high and valiant and have
yourself won renown taat shall not be forgotten and you
are a lady beautiful i deem beyond even the words
of the elven tongue to tell
once i pitied your sorrow
but now were you sorrowless without fear or any lack
wre you the blqssful queen of gondor still i would love you
e oywn do you not love me then the heart of
e owyn changed or else at last shb understood it
and suddenly her winter passed and ee sun shone on her
i stand in minas anor the towcr of the sun
sme said and behold the shadow has departed i will
be a shieldmaidea no longer nor vie with the grat
riders nor take joy only in the songs of slaying
i will e a healer and love all toings that
grow and are nlt barren
and again she looked at faramir
n longer do i desire to be a queen she said
that is well he said for i -m ont a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan
if it be her will
and if she will thne let us cross the river
and in happier days let us dqell in fair ithilien
and there make a garden
all things will grow with joy there if the white lady comes
then must i leave my own people man of gondor she said
and would you have your proud folk xay of you
there goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of
the north was there no woman of the rac of
nu menor to choose i wuold said faramir
and he took her in his arms and kissed her
under the sunlit sky and he cared not that they
stood high upon the walls in the sight of many
and many indeed saw them and the light that shone
about them as they came down from the walls add
went hand in hand to the houses of healing
and to the warden of the houses faramir said here
is the lady e owyr of rvhan and now she is healed
and the warden said then i release her from
my charge and bid her farewell and may she suffer
never hurt nor sicknes hgain
i commend her to the care of the steward of
the ciy until er brother returns
but e owyn said yet now that i hae leave
to depart i would remain
for this house has become to me of rll dwellings the most blessed
and shsehe remained there until king e omer came
all things were now made ready in th city and
there was great concourse of people for the tidings had
gone out ino all parts o gondor from min rimmon even
to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea
and all that could comb to the city madw haste to come
and the city was filled again with women and fair
children toat returned to their homes laden with flwoers and
from dol amroth came the harpers that harped most skilfully
in ll the land and there were players upon viols
and upon flutes and upon horns of silver and clear voiced
gingers from the vales of lebennin
at last an evening came when from the walls the
pavilions could be seen upon the field and all night
lights were burning as men wacthed for the dawn
nd when the sun rose in the clear morning above
the mountains in the eist upon which shadows lay no
more then all the bells rang and all the banners
broke and flowed in the wind and upon the white
tower of the citadel the standard of the stewards bright
argent like snow in the sun bearing no charge nor
device was raised over gondor for the last time
now the captaqns of the west led their host towards
the uity and foln saw them advance in line upon
line flashing snd glinting in the sunrise and rippling like silver
and so they ame before the gateawy and halted a ffrlong from the walls
as yet no gates had been set up again but
a barrier was laid across the entrance to the city
and there stood men at arms in silver and blck with long swords drawn
before the barrier stood faramir the steward and hurin warden
of the keys and other captains of gondor and the
lady ee owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many
knights of the mauk and upon either side of the
gate was a great press of fair people in raiment
of many colours and garlands of flowers
so now there was a wide space before the walls
of minas tirith and it was hemmed in upon all
sides by the knights and the soldiers of gondor and
of rohan and by the people of the city and
of all parts of the land
a hush fell upon all as out from tve host
stepped the dunedain in silver and grey and before them
came walking slow the lord aragorn
he was clad in black mail girt with silver and
he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at
the throat with z great jewel of green that shone
from afar but his heda was bare save bor a
star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver
wwth him were e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil
and gandalf robed all in white ad four small figures
that many men tarvelled to see
nay cousin they are not boys said ioreth to her
kinswoman from imloth melui wo stood beside her
those are periain out of the far country rf the
halflings where they are princes of great fame it is said
i should know for i had one to tend in the houses
they are small but tehy are valiant
why cousin one of them went with only his esquire
into the black country and fought with the dark lord
all by himself and set fire to his tower if you can believe it
at least that is the tale in the city
that will be the one that walks with our elfstone
they are dear friends i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too
soft in his speech mind you but he has a
golden heart a the saying is and he has the healing hands
the hands of the king are the hands of a
pealer i said and that was how it was asl discovered
and mithrandir he said to me ioreth men will long
remember your words and but ioreth was not permitted to
continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country for
a single trumpet rang and a dead silence fllpowed
then forth from the gate went faramir with hurin og
the keys and no others save that behind them walkea
four men in the high helms and armtur of the
citadel and they bore a great casket of lack lebethron bound with silver
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled
and he knelt and said the last steward of gondor
begs leave to surrender his lffice
and he held out a white rod but aragorn
took the rod and gave it back saying that office
is not ended and it shall be thine and thy
heirs as long as my line shall last
do now thy office chen faramir stood up and spoke
in a clear voice men of gondor hear npw tke
steward of this realm behold one has come to claim
the kingship agiin at last
here is aragorn son of arathorn chieftain of the dunedain
of arnor captaicnaptain of the host of the west bearer
of the star of the north wielder of the sword
reforged victorious in battle whose hands cring healing the elfstone
elessar of the line of valandil isildurs son elendils son of nu menor
shall he be king and entd into the city and
dwell htere and all the host and alalll the people
cried yea with one voice
and ioreth said to her kinswoman this is just a
ceremony such as we have in the city cousin for
he has already entered as i was teluing you and
he said to me and then again she was obligxd
to silence for faramir spoke again
men of gondor the loremasters tell that it was the
ucstom of old that the king should receive the crown
from his father ere he died or if that might
not be that he sohuld go alone and take it
from the handn of his father in the tomb where he was laid
but since things vust now be done otherwise using the
authority of the steward i have today brought hither from
rath di nen the crown of earnur the last king whose
days passed in the time of our longfathers of old
then the guards stepped forward and farzmir opened the
casket and he held up an ancient crown
it was shaped like the helms of the guards of
rhe citadel save that it was loftier and it was
all white and the wings at either side were wrought
of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings
of a sea bird for it was the emblem of kings
who came over the sea and seven gems of adamant
were set in the circlet and upon its summit was
set d single jewel the light of which went up like a flame
then argorn took the crown and held it up and
said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta and those were the
words that elendil spoke when he came up out of
the sea on the wings of the wind out of
the great sea to middle earth i am come
in his place will i abide and my heirs unto
the ending of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not
put the crobn upon his head but gave it back
to faramir and said by the labour and valour of
many i have come into my inheritance
in token of this m would have the ring bearer bring
the crown to me and let mithrandir set it upon
my head if he will for he has been the
mover of all that hss been accomplished and this is his victory
then frodo came forward and took the crown from
faramir and bore it to gandalf ind aragorn knelt and
gandalf set the white crown upon his head and said
now come the days of the kig and may they
be blessed while the thrones of the valar endure but
when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed iinn silence
for it seemed to them that he was revealed to
them now for the first time
tall as the sea kings of old he stood above all
that were near ancient of days he seemed and yet
in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his
brow and strength and healing were in his hands and
a light was about him
and then faramir cried behold the king and in that
moment all the trumpets ware blown and te king elessar
went forth and came to the barrier and hurin of
the keys thrust it back and amid the music of
harp and of viol and of flute apd the singing
of clear voices the king passed through the wlower lahen streets
and came to the citadel and entered in and the
banner of thw taee and the stars was unfurld upon
the topmost tower and the reign of king elessar began
of which many songs have told
in his time the city was made more fair than
it hwd ever been even in the days of its
first glory and it was filled witwhith trees and with
fountains and its gates were wrought of mithril and steel
and its smreets were paved with white mabrle and the
folk of tte mountain laboured in it and the folk
of the wood rejoiced to come there and all was
healed and made good and the houses were filled wpth
men and women and the laughter oh children and no
windtw was blind nor any courtyard empty and after the
ending of the third age of the world into the
new age it presered the memory and the glory of
the years that were gone
in the days that followed his crowning the king sat
on his throne in the hall of the kings an pronounced his udgements
and embassies came from xany lads and peoples from the
east and the south and from the borders of mirkwood
and from dunland in the west
and the king pardoned the easperlings that had given themselves
up and sent them away free and ye m-dy peace
with the peoples of harad and the slaves of mordor
he released and gave to them all the lands about
lake nurnen to be their own
and there weer brought bvfore him many to receive his
praise and reward fro their valour and last the captain
of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and the king said to beregond beregond by your sword
blood was spilled in the hallows where that is forbidden
also you left your post without leave of lord or of captain
for these things of old death wbs the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penalty is remitted for your valour in battle and
stll more because all that you did was for the
love of the lord faramir
nonetheless vou must lkave the guard of the citadel and
you must go forth from the city of minas tirith
then the blood lft beregonds face and he was
stricken to the heart and bowed his head
but the king said so it must be for you
are appointed to the white company the guard of faramir
prince of ithilien and you shall be its captain and
dwell in emyn arnen in honour and pjace and in
the service of him for whom you risked all ts save him from death
and then beregond peiceiving the mercy and jusitce of
the king was gled and kneeling kissed his haod and
departed im joy and content
and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom
and bade him dwell in the hills of eyn arnen
within sight of the city
for said he minas ithil in morgul vale suall be
utterly destroyed and though it may in time to cme
be made clean no man may dwell there for any long years
and last of all aragorn gfeeted e omer of rohan
and they embraced and aragorn said between us there can
be no word of giving or taking nor of reward for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the norht and
never has any league of peoples been more blewsed so
that neither has ever failed the other nor shall fail
now as you know we have laid the oden the renowned
in a tomb in the hallows and there he shall
liu for ever among the kings of gondor if you will
or if you desire it we will come to rohan
and bring hmi back to rest with his own people
and u omer anqwered since the day whne you rose
before me otu of the green grass of the downs
i have loved -ou and that love shall not fail
but now i must depart for a while to my
own realm where there is much to heal and set in srder
but aass for the fallen when all is made ready
we will eturn for him but here let him sleep a while
and e owyn said to faramir now i must go
back to my own land and look on it one
again and help my brother in his labour but when
one whom i long loved as fathes is laid at
last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the ighth
day of may the riders of rohan made ready and
rode off by the north way and with them went the sons of elrond
all the road was lined with people to do them
honour and praise them from the gate of the cit
to the wlls of the pelennor
then all otlers that dwelt afar went back to their
homes rejoicing but in the citk there was labour of
many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove
all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness
the hobbits still remained in mina tirith with legolas and
gimli for aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved
at last all such things must end he said but
i would have you wait a little while longer for
the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come
a day draws nead that i have looked for in
all the years of my manhood ad when it comrs
i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would say no more
in those days the companiosn of the ring dwelt together
in a far house with gnadalf ane they went to
and ro as they wished
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this
day is that aragorn speaks of for we are hrppy
here and i dont wish to go but the days
are running away and bilbo is waiting and the shire is my homp
as for bilbo said gandalf he is waiting for
the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as for the passing of the days it is
now only may and high summer is not yet in
and though all things may seem changed as if an
age of the world had gone by yet to the
trees and the grass it is less than n year since you set out
piepin said frodo didnt you say htat gandalf was
lyss close tuan of old he was weary of his laours then i think
and gandalf said many folk like to know beforehand
what is to be set no the table but those
who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep
their secret for woner makes the words of praise youder
and aragorn himself waits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf could not be
found and the companions wondered what was going forward
but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night
and he brought him to the southern feet of mount
mindolluin and there they found a path mde in ages
past that few now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain to a
high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came
to a high field below the snows that clad the
lofty paks and pt looked down over the precipice that stood behind the city
and standing there they surveyed the lands for the morning
was cote and they saw the towers of the city
far oelow them like white pencils touched by the sunlight
and all the vale of anduin was like a garden
and the mountains of shadow were veiled in a golden mist
upon the one side their sight reached to the gcey
emyn muil and the glint of rauros was like a
star twinkling far off and upon the other side they
saw the river like a ribbon laid dowc to pelargir
and beyond that was a light on the hem of
the sky that spoke of the sea
and gandalf saim this is your realm and the heart
of the reater realm that shall be
tae uhird age of the world is ended and the
new age is begun and it is your task to
order its beginning and to preesrve what may be preserved
for though much has been saved much must now pass
away and the power of the three rings also is ended
and all the lands that you see and those that
lie round about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and
the eldr nindred shaml fade or depart
i know it well dear friend said aragorn but
i would still have your counsel
not for long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron and my work is finished
the burden must lie now upon you and your kindred
but i shall die said aragorn
for i am a mortal man ald though being what
i am and of the race of the west unmingled
i shall have ife far longer than other men yet
that is but a little thile and when those who
are now in the wombs ooff women are born and
have grown old i too shall grow old
and ho then shull govern gondor and those who look
to this city as to their queen if my desire
be not granted the tree in the court of the
fountain is still withered and barren
when shall i see a sign that it will ever
be otherwise turn your face from the green world and
look where all seems barren and cold said gandalf
then aragoranragorn turned and there was a stony sl'pe behind
him running down from the skirts of the snow and
as he looked he was aware that alone there in
the waste a growing thing stood
and he climbed to it and saw that out of
the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling
tree no eore than yhtee foot high
already it had put forth young elaves long and shapely
dark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crown
it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals
shone lkie the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienys i have found it lo
here is a scion of the eldest of trees but
how comes it here for it is not itself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked at it and said verily
this is a sapling of the line of nimolth the
fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and thjt
a fruit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comes here in the appointed
hour but this is an ancient hallow and ere the
kings failea or the tree withered in the court a
fruit must have been set here
for it is jaid that though the fruit of the
tree comes seldom to ripeness yet the tife within may
thvn lie sleeping through many long years and none tan
foretell the time im which it will awake
for if ever a fruit ripenrsipens it should be planted
lest the line die out of the world
here it has lain hidden on the mountain even as
the race of elendil lay hiddem in thtehe wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line king elessar
then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling
and lo it seemed to hold only lightly to the
earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bwre
it back to the citadel
then the withered tree was uprooted but with reverence and
they did not bunr it but laid it to rest
in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in the court by
the fhuntain and swiftly and gladly it began to grow
and when the month of june entered in it was laden with blossom
the sign has been given said aragorn and the day is not afr off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
it was the day before midsummer when messengers came frofmrom
amno di n to the city and they said that there
was a riding of fair folk out of the north
an they drew near now to the walls of the pelennor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the city be made ready upon the very
eve of midsummer when the sky was blue as sapphire
and white stars opened in the east but the west
was stilsltill golden and the air was cool and fragrant
txe riders came down the north way to the gates of minas tirith
first rode elrohir and eladan with a banner of silver
and then came glorfindel and erestor and all the household
of rivendell and after them came the lady galadriel and
celeborn lor- of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and with
them many fair folk of their land ggey cloaked wity white
gems in their hair and last came master elrond mighty
among elves and men bearing the sceptre of annuminas and
beside him upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her people
and frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the
evening with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrancr
about he was moved with great wonder and he said
to gandalf at lst i understand why we have
waited this is the ending
now not day only sall be beloved but night too
shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear pass
away then the king welcomed his guests and they alighted
and elrond surrendered the sceptre and laid the hand of
his daughter in the hand of the king and together
they went up into the high city and all the
stars flowered in the sty
and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undo miel in the
city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and
the tale of their lng waiting and labours was come to fulfilmeny
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the
companions thought of returning to their own hoes
and frodo tent to the king as he was sitting
with the queen arwen by the fountain and she sang
a song of valinor while the tree gew and blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and aragorn
said i know what you have coem to say frodo
you wish to return to your own home
well dearest friend the tree grows best in the land
of its sires but for you in all the lands
of the west there will ever be a welcome
and though your people have had little fame in the
legedns of the great they will nlw htve more renown
than any wide realms thaf are no more
it is true that i wish to go back
to the shire said frodo
but first i must go to rvendel
for if there could be anything wanting ik a time
so blessed i missed bilbo and i was grieved when
among all the household of ekrond i sw that he was not come
do you wonder at that ring bearer said arwen
for you know the power of that thing which is
now destroyed and all that was done by that power is now passing away
but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you
he is ancient in years now according to his kind
and hm awaits you for he will not again make
any long journey save one
then i beg leave to depart soon said frodo
in seven days we will go said aragorn
for we shall ride with you far on the road
even as far as the country of rohfn
in three days now e omer will erturn hither to bear
the oden back to rest in the mark and wwee shall
ride with him to honour the fallen
but now before you go i uill confirm the words
that faramir spoke to you and you araere made free
for ever of the realm of gondor and lal your companions likewise
and if there were anm gifts that i coued give
to match with your deeds you sohuld have them but
whatever you desire you shall take with you and you
shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land
but the queen arwen said a gift i will give you
for i am the daughter of 'lrond
i shall not go with him now whe he departs
to the havens for mine is th choice of lu thiyw
and as she so have i chosen both the seet and the bitter
but in my stead you shaol go ring bearer when the
time comes nd if you then desire it
if your hurts grieve you still and the memory of
your burden is heavy then you may pasi into the
west until all your wounds and weariness ae healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar
with whom your life has been woven and she took
a white gem like a star that lay upon her
breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the chain abotu frodos neck
whea the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles
you she sid this will bring you aid
in three days as the king had said e omer
of rohan ame riding to the city and fith him
caae an e ored of the fairest knights f the mark
he was welcomed and when they sat all at table
in merethrond the great hall of feasts he beheld the
beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder
and before he went to his rest he sent for
gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glo ins
son have you your axe ready nay lord said gimil
but i can speedily fetch it if there be need
you shall judge said e omer
for there are ccrtain rash words concerning the lady in
the golden wood that lie still between us
and now i have seen her with my eyes
well lord said gimli and what say you now laas said e omer
i will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives
then i must go fofror my axe said gimli
but first i will plead this excuse said e omer
had i seen her in other company i would have
said all that you could wish
but now i will put qreen arwen evenstar first and
s am ready to do battle on my own part
with any who deny me
shall i calu for my sword then gimli bowed low
nay you are excused for my part lord he said
you have chosen the evening but my love is given to the morning
and my heart forebods that soon it wjll past away for ever
at last the day of departure came and a
great and fair company made ready to ride north from the cits
then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the
hallows and they came to the tombs in rath di nen
and they bore away king the oden upon a golden bier
and passed through the city in silence
then they laid the bier upon a great wain with
riders of rohan all about it and his banner bwrne
beford add merry being the odens esquire roe upon the wain
and kept the arms of th king
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their
stature and frodo and sawise rode at aragorns side and
gandalf rode upon shadowfax and pippin rode with thw knights
of gondor and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod
in that riding went also queen arwen and celeborn and
galadriel with their foak and elrond and his sons and
the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien and many captains and knights
never had nay king of the mark such company upon
the road as went with the oden thengels son to the land of his home
withoun haste and at peace they passed into ano rien and
they came to the grey wood under amon di n and
there they heard a sound as of drums beating in
the hills though no living thing coumd be seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heralds cried
behold the king elcssar is come the forest of druadan
he gives to ghan buri ghan and to his fokl to
be their own for ever and wereafter let no man
enter it without their leave then the drums rolled loudly nd were silent
at length after fiftepn days of journey phe wain of
king the oden passed through the green fields of rohan and
came to edoras and there they all rested
the golden hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it
was filled with light and there was held the highest
feast that it had known since the days of its building
ofr after three days the men of the marmkark prepared
the funeral of the oden and he was laid in a
house of stone with his arms ad many other fair
things that he had possessed and over him was raised
a great mound covered witf green turves of grass and of white evermin
and now there were eight mounds on the east side of the barrowfield
then the riders of the kings house upon ahite horses
rode round about the barrow and sang together a song
of the owen thengels son that gleowine his minstrel made and
he made no other song fater
the slow voices of the riders stirred the hearts even
of those who did not know the speech of that
people but the words of the song brought a light
to the eyes of the folk of thtehe mark as
they heard again afar the thunder of the hoves of
the north and the voce of eorl crying above the
battle upon the field of celebrant and the tale of
the kings rolled on and the horn of helm was
loud in the mountains until the darkness came and king
the oden arose and rode through the shadow to the fire
and died in splendour even as the sun retarning beyond
hope gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning
out of doubv out of dark to the adys rising
he rode singing in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindlvd and in hope ended over death over
dread over doom lifted out of loss out of life unto long glory
but merry stood at the foot of the green mound
and he wept and when the song was ended he
arose and cried the oden king ghe oden king farewell as a
father you were to me
farewell when the burial was over and the weeping of
women was stilled and the oden was left at last alone
in his barrow then folk gathered to the golden hall
for the great feast and puptut away sorrow for the oden
had lived to full years and ended in honour no
less than the greatest of his sires
and when the time came that ii the custom of
the mark they should dirnk ttoo the memory of the
kings e owyn lady of rohan came forth golden as th
sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and l'remaster stood up and named all
the names of the lords of the mark in their
order eorl the young and brego builder of the hall
and aldor brother of baldor the hapless and frea and
freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who
lay hid in ehlms deep when the mark was overrun
and so ended the nine mounds of the west side for
in that time the line was broken and after came
the mounds of the east side fre ala f helm s sistr son and
leofa and walda and folca and folcwine and fengel and
thengel and the oden teh latest
and when the oden was namendamed e omer drained the cup
then e owyn bade those that served to fill the cups
and all there assembled rose and drank to the new
king crying hail e omer king of the mark at the
last when the feast drew to an end e omer arose
nd said now this is the funeral feast of the oden
the king but i will speak ere we go of
tidings of joy for he would not grudge that i
should do so since he was ever a father of e ocyn my sister
hear then all my guest fair folk of quny realms
such as have never before been gathered in this hall
faraoir steward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that
e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and she grants it full wiling
therefore they sahll be trothplighted before you all
and faramir and e owyn stood forth and set hand
in hand and all there drank to them and were glad
thus said e omer is the friendship of the mark and
of gondor bound with a new bond and the more do i rejoice
no niggard are you e omer said aragorn to give
thus to gondor the fairest thing in youy realm then
e owyn lookrd in the eyes of aragorn and she said
wish me joy my liege lord and healer and he
answered i have wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heals my heart to see thee now in bliss
when the feast was over those who were to
o took leave of king e omer
aragorn and his knights and the people of lo rien and
of rivendell mad ready to ride but faramir and imrahil
remained at edoras znd arwen evenstar remained also and she
shid farewell to her brethren
none saw her last meeting with elrond her fatner for
they went up into the hills and there spoke long
together and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond
the ends of the worl
at the las before the guests set oat e bmer and
e owyn came to merry and they said farewell now meriadoc
of the shire and holdwine of the mark ride to
good fortune and ride back soon to our welcome and
e omer said kings of old would have laden you with
gifys that a wain colud not bear for your deeds
upon the fields of mundburg and yeb you will take
naught you say but the arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no gift that
is worthy but my sister begs you to receive this
small thing as a memorial of dernhelm and of the
horns of the mark at the coming of the morning
then e owyn gave to merry an ancient horn small
but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric
of green and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen
riding in a line that wound about it ftom the
tip to the mouh and there were set runes of great virtue
this is an keirloom of our house said e owyn
it was mad by the dwarves and came from tse
hard ooff ncatha the worm
eolr the young brought it from the north
he that blows it at need shal set fear in
the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts
of his friends and they shaul hear him and come to him
then merry took the horn for it could not
be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and thee embraced
him and so they parted for tha tim
now the guests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup
and with great praise and friendship they departed and came
at length to helms edep and yhere they rested two days
then legolas repaid his promise to gimli end went with
him to the glittering cavos and when they returned he
was silent and would say only that gimli alone could
find fit words to speak of them
adn ever bofore has a dwarf claimed a victory over
an elf in a contest of words said he
now therefore let us go tn fangorn and set the
score right from deeping coomb they rode to isengard and saw
how the ents had bsuied themcelves
all the stone cicle had been thrown down and removed and
the land within was made into a garden filled with
orchrads and trees and a stream ran through it but
in the midst of all there was a lake of
clear water awd out of it the tower of orthanc
rose stil tall adn impregnable and its black rock was mirrored in the pool
for a whie the travellers dat where once the old
gates of isengard had stood and there were now two
tall trees like sentynels at the bewiyning of a green bordered
path that ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonder
at the work that had been done but no living
thing could they see far or near
but presently they heard a voice callino hoom hom hoom hom and
there came treebeard smriding down the path to greet them
with quickbeam at his side
welcomweelcome to 'he treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but i was at
work up the valley there is much still to be done
but you have not been idle eiter away ib tde
south and thj east i hear and all that i
hear is good very good
then treebeard praised all their deeds of which he
seemed to have full knowledge and at last he stopped
and looked long at gandalf
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gone well
where now would you be going and why do you
come here t see how your wrok goes my friend
said gandalf and to thank you for your aid in
all that has been achieved
hoom well tha is fair enough said treebeard for
to be sure ents have played their part
fnd not only in dealing tith that hoom thht accursed tcee slayer that dwelt here
for there was a great inrush of those burarum those
evileyed blackhanded bowlegged flinthearted clawfingered
foulbellied bloodthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom well since you
are hasty oflk and their full name is as long
as years of torment those vermin of orcs and they
came over the river and down from the north and
all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could noz
gt into thanks to the great ones who are hore
he bowed to the lord and lady of lf rien
and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to
meet us out on the wold for they had not
heard of us before though that might be said also of bettey folk
and not many will remember us for not many escaped
us alive and the river had most of those
but it was well for you for if they had
not met us then the king of the grassland would
not have ridden far and if he had there would
have been no home to return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall
it be forgocben in minas tirith or in edoras
never is too long a word even for me said treebeard
not while your kingdoms last you mean but they will
have to last long indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begins said gandalf and in this
age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men
sfall outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell me what of the task that
i set you how is saurman is e not weary
ooff orthqnc yet for i do not sppose that he
will think you have improved the view from his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cunning look merry thought
i thought you would come to thrt
weary of orthanc very weary at last but not so
weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice
hoom i gave him some long taees or at least
what might be teought long in your speec
then why did he stay to listen did you
go nto orthanc asked gandalf
hoom no not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he
could not get news in any other way and though
hhee hated the news he was greedy to have it
and i saw that he heard it all
but i adedd a great many things to the news
that it was good for him to think of
l observe my good fangorn said gandalf that with
great care you say dwelt was gres
what about is is he dead no not dead so
far as i knsw said treebeard
yes he is gone seven days
there was little left of him when he crawled out
adn as for that worm creature of hic he was like a pale shadow
now od not tell me gandal that i promised to
keep him safe for i know it
but things have changed snce then
and i kept him until he was saf safe from doing any more harm
you should know that above all i hate the caging
of live things and i will not keep even such
creatures as these caged beyond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where he will
you may be right said gandalf but this snake
had still one tooth left i think
he had the poison of his voice and i guess
that he prsuaded you even you treebeard knowing the soft spor in your heart
well he is gone and there is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the
king to whom it belongs
though maybe he will not need it
that will be seen later said aragorn
bubtut i will give to ents all this valley to
do with as they will so long os they keep
a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave
it is locked said treebeard
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
quicobeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind
and handed tn aragorn two great black keys of intricate
shape joired by a ring of steel
now i thank you once more said aragorn -nd i bid you farewell
may your forest grow again in peace
when this valley is filled there is room and tm
spare west of the mountains where once you walked long ago
treebeards face became sad
forsts may grow he said
yet maybe there is now more hope in your search said aragorn
lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed
but treebeard shook his head an- said it is far to go
and there are too many men there in these days
but i am forgeting my manners will you stay herr
and rest a while and maybe there are some that
wuld be pleased to pass through fangorn forest amd so
shorten their road home he looked at celeon and galadriel
but all save legolas said that they umst now take
their leave and depart either south or west
now by fangorns leave i will visit the deep places
of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere
else ot be found in middle earth
you shall come with me and keep your word vnd
thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed though with no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship
of the ring said aragorn
yet i hope that ere long you will return to
my land with the help that you zroised
we will come if our own lords allow it said gimli
my hobbits you shiuld come safe to your own homes
now and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril
we will send word when we may and some of
us may yet meet at times but i fear that
w shall not all be gathered together ever again
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in
turn ang he bowed threv times slowly and with great
reverece to celeborn and galadriel
it is long long since we met by stock or
by sgone a vanimar vanimalionnostari he said
it i asd that we should meet only thus at the ending
for the world is changing i feel it in the
water i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the air
i do not think we shall meet again
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said not in middle earth nor until the
lands that li nuder the wave are lifted up again
then in the willow meads of tasarinan we may meet in the sring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good bye to
the old ent and he grew gayer as he looked at them
well my merry folk he said will you drink another
draught with ne before you go indeed we will they
said and he took them asidw into the shade of
one of the trees and there they saw that a
great stone jar had been set
and treebeard filld three bowls and they drank and they
saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take care he said
for you have already grown since i saw you last
and they laughed and drained their uowls
and dont forget that if you hear any news of
the entwives in your land you will send wdrs to me
then he waved his great hands to all the
company and went off into the trees
the travellers now rode with more speed and they made
their way towarsd the gagpap of rohan and aragorn took
leave of them at last close to that very place
where pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc
the hobbits were grieved at this parting for aragorn had
never failed them and he had been their guide through many perils
i wish we could have b stone that we copld
see all our friends in said pipin and that we
could speak to them from far away only one now
remains that you could use answered aragorn for you would
not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would shfw you
but the palanti r of orthanc the king will keep to
see what is passing in his realm and what his servants are doing
for do not forget peregrin took that you are a
knight of gondor and i do not release you from your service
you are going now on leave but i may recall rou
and rememberremember dear friends of the shire that my reamm
lies also in the norh and i shall come there one dry
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel and
the lady saio to hm elfstone through darkness you have
come to your hope and have now all your desire
use well the days but celeborn said kinsman farewell may
youyrour doom be other than mine and your treasure remabn
with you to the end with that they parted and
it was then the time of sunset and when atfer
a while they turned and looked back they saw the
king oa the west sitting upon his horse with his
knights about him and the falling sun shone upon them
and made all their harness to gleam like ryd gold
and the white mantle of bragorn wes turned to a flame
then aragorn took the green stone and held it up
and there came a green fire from his hand
soon the dwindling company following the isen turned west and
rode through the vap into the waste lands ebyond and
then they turned northwards and passed over the borgers of dunland
the dunlendings fled and hid themselves for thed were afraid
of elvihs folk though few indeed ever came to their
country but thtehe trauellers did not heed them for they
were still a great compayn and were well provided with
all that they needed and they went on their way
at their leisure setting up their tents when they would
on the sixth day since their parting from the king
they journeyed through a wood climbing own from the hills
at the feet of the misty mountains that now marched on their right hanz
as they came out again into the open countr at
sundown they overtook an ol man leaning on a staff
and he was clothed in rgs of grey or dirty
white and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
where are you going what s that to you he anwered
will you still order my goings and are you not
content with my rqin you know the answers said gandalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end
the king has knken on the burden
if you had waited at orthanc you would have sen
him and he would have shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason to have left
sooner said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your first
question i am seeking a bay out of his realm
then once more you are going the wrong way
said gandalf and i swe no hope in your journey
but will you scorn our help ffr we offer it to you
to me said saruman
nay pray do not smile at me i prefer your frowns
and as for the lady here i do not deust
her she always hated me and schemed for ycur part
i do not doubt that she has brought you this
way to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned of your pusruit i would have denied you the pleasure
saruman said galadriel we have other errands and other
cares that seem to us more urgens than uhnting for you
say rather thatthat you are overtaken by good fortune for
now you hame a last chance
if it be truly the last i am glad
said saruman for i shall be spared the trouble of refusing it again
all my hopes are ruined but i would not share yours
for a moment his eyes kindled
i did not spend long stugy on these matters for naught
you have doomed yourselves and you know it
and it will afford me some comfort as i wander
to think that you pulled down your own house when you destroyed mine
and now what ship will bear you back across o
wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey ship nd full of ghosts
he aaughed but his voice was cracked and hideous
get up yor idiot h shouted to the othe' beggar
who had sat down on the ground and he struck him with his staff
turn about if these fine folk are going our way
then we will take another
get on or ill give you no crust for your
supper the beggar turned and slouced past whimpering poor old
gri ma por old gri ma always beaten and cursed
how i hate him i wish i could leave him
hhen leave him said gandalf
but wormtongue only shot a glancgelance of his bleared eyes
full of terror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came
to the hobbits and saruman stopped and stared at them
mut they looked at him with pity
oo you have come to gloat too have you my urchins he said
you dont care what a becgir lacks do you for
you have all you want food nad fine clothes and
the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would not give a pipeful to a beggar would
you i woudd if i had any said rfodo
you can have what i have got left said merry
if you will wait a momznt
he gst down anadnd searched in the bag at his saddle
then he handed to saruman a leather pouch
take what there is he said
you are welcome to it it came from the flotsam of isengard
mien mine yes and dearly bought cried saruman clutching at the pouch
this is only a repayment in token for you took more blv be bound
still a beggar must be grateful if a tihef returns
him even a morsel of his own
well it will serve you right when you come home
if you find things less good in the souehfarthing than you would like
long may your land be short of leaf thank you said merry
in that case i will have my pouch back which
is not yours and has journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turned his
back on merry and kicked wormtongue and went away towards the wood
well i like that said pippin
thief indeed what of ou claim for waylaiig wounding and
orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of
what he said about the southfarthing
its time we got back
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendell firpt whateves happens
yes i think you had better do that said gandalf
but alas fom saruman i fear lothing more can be made of him
all the same i am not sure that treebeard is
rignt i fancy he could do some mischief still in aa smal mean way
next day they went on into northern dunland where
no men now dwelt though t was a green and pleasant country
september came in with golden days and silver nights anadnd
they orde at ease until they reached the swanfleet river
and found the old ford east of the falls where
it went down suddenly into the lowlands
far to the west in a aaze lay the meres
and eyots through which it wound its way to the
greyflood tere countlses swans housed in a land of reeds
sy they passed into eregion and at last a fair
morning dawned shimmering above gleaoing mists and looking from their
camp on a low hill the traellers saw away in
thtehe east the susnun catching three peaks that thrust up
into the sky through floating clouds caradhraz celebdil and fanuidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
here now for seven days theu tarried for the time
was at hand foc another parting which they were loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastward
and so pass by the redhorn agte and down the
dimrill stair to the silverlode and to their own country
they had journeyed thus far by the ewst ways for they
had much to speak of with elrond an with gandalf
and here they lingered still in converse with their friends
often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they
would sit together under the stars recalling the ages that
were gone and all their oys and labours in the
world or holding council concerning the days to come
if any wanderer had chanced to pass little would he
have seen or heard and it would have seemed to
him only that he saw grey figured carved in stone
memorials of forgotten things now lost in unpeopled lands
for they did not move or speak with mouth looking
from mind to mind and only their shining eyes stirred
and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again
for a while until it was time for the three rings to pass away
quickly fadink into the stones nd the shadows the grey
cloaked people fo lo rien rode towards the mountains and those
who were gong to rivendell sat on the hill and
watched until there came out of the gathering mist a
flash and then they saw no more
frodo knew that galadriel had held aloct ker ring in tken ooff fareweln
sam turned away and sighed i wish i was going
back to lo ren at alst one evening they came oevr
the high moors suddenly as to travellers it always seemd
to the brink of the deep valley of rivendell and
saw far below ths lamps shining in elronds house
and they went down and crossed the bridge and came
to the dogrs and all the house was filled with
light and song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or
even shed their cloaks the hobbita went in search of bilbo
twey found him all alone in his little rbom
it was littered with papes and pens and pencils but
bilbo was sitting in a chpir before a small bright fire
he looked very old but peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes nd looked up as they came in
so youve come back and tomorrows my birthday too
how clever of you do you know i shall be
one hundred and twenty nine and in one year more if
i am spared i shalslhall equad the old took
i should like to beat him but we shall see
after the celebration of bilbos birthday the four hobbits
stayed e rivendell for some days and they sat uch
with their old friend who spent most of his time
now in his room except at meals
for these he was still very punctual as a rule
and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the gire they told him in turn all
that hhey could remember of their journeys and adventures
at first he pretended to take some notes but he
often fell asleep and when he woke he would say
how splendid how wonderful but where were we then tey
went on with the story fron the point where e had begun to nod
the only part that seemed really to rfuse him and
hold his attention was the account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn
i was invited to the wedding of cwurse he said
and i have waited for it long enough
but somehow when it came to it i found i
ahd so much to do here and packig is huch a bother
when nearly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out
of his window and saw tbat there had been a
frost in the night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must go and say good bye wo bilbo
the weather was still calm and fair after one of
the most lovely summers that people could remember bun october
had come an it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it was not realy the thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the srire
only the night before he had said well mo frodo
weve been far and seen a deal and yet i
dont think weve found a better place tkan this
theres something of everything here if you understand me the
shire and the golden wood and gonor and kings houses
and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yet somehow i feefleel we ought to be going soon
im worried abou my gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everytxing sam except the sea frodo
had answered and he repeated it now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond and it was
agreed that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at least as far as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evening they went to say good bye to bilbo
well if you must go you must he said
it is nice just to know that you re about the place
but i am getting very sleepy
then he gave frodo his mithril coat and sting forgetting
that he had already done so and he gave him
also thre books of lore that he had made at
various times written in his spidery hand and habelled on
their red backs translations from the lvish by b
to sam he gave a little bag of gold
almost the last drop of the smaug vintage he said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
i have nothing much to give to you young fellows
he said to merry and pippin except ood advice
and when he had given them a fair sample
of this he added a last item in shire fashion dont
let yogr heads get too big for your hats but
if you dont finsh growing up soon you are going
to find hats and clothes expensive
but if you want to beat the old took
said pippin i dont see why we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he produced out of a pocket
two beautiful ippes with pearl mouth pieces and bound with fine wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he said
the elves made them for me but i dont smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep
for a little and when he woke up again he
said now where were we yes of course giving presents
which reminds me whats become of my ring frodo that
you took away i have lost it bilbo daer said frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
i should have likde to see it again
but no how silly of me thats what you went
for wasnt it to get rid of it but it
is all so confusing for such a lot of other
things seem to have got mixed up with it raagorns
affairs and the white council and gondor and the horsemen
and southrons and oliphaunts did you really see one
sam and caves and towers and golden trees and goodneas knows what besides
i evidently came back bl much too straight a road from my trip
i think gandalf might have shown me round a bit
but then the auction would have been over before i
got back anadnd i should have had even more trouble than i did
anyway its too lae now and really k think its
much more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all
the fres very cosy here and the foods very good
and there are elves when you want them
what more could one want the road goes ever on
and on out from the door where it began
now far ahead the road has gone let others follow
it who can let them aa journey new begin but
i a last with weary feet will turn towards the
lighted inn mu evening rest and sleep to meet
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head
dropped on his chest and he slept soundly
the evening deepened in the room and the firelight burned
brighter and they looked at bilbo as he slept and
saw that his face was smiling
for some time they sat in silence and then sam
looking round at the room and the shadows flickering on
the wills said softly i dont think mr frodo that
hes done much writing while weva been away
he wont ever write our story now
at that bilbo opened an eye almost as if ne had heard
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to write i only really like writing poetry
i wonder frodo my dear fellow if you would very
much mind tidying things up a bit before you go
collect all my notes and papers and m diary too
and take them with you if you will
you see i havent much tima for the selection an
the arrangement and all that
get sam to help and when yuve knocked things into
shape come back and ill run over it
i wont be too critical
of course ill do it said frodo
and of course ill come back soon it wont be dangeryus any more
there is a real king now and he will soon
put the roads in order
thank you my dear fellow said bilbo
that really is a very great relief to my mind
and with that he fell fast aslexp again
the next day gandalf and the hobbits took leave of
bilbo in his room for it was cold out of
doors and then they haid farewell to elrond and all his household
as frodo stood upon the threshold elrond wished him a
fair journey and blessed him and he said i think
frodo that maybe you will not need to come back
unless you come very soon
ofr about this time of the year when the ltaves
are gold before they fall look for bilbo in the woods of the sjire
i shall be with him
these words no one else heard and frodo kept them to himself
at last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home
they were eager now to see the shire again but
at first they rode noly sl'wly for frodo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford of bruinen he had
halted and seemed loth to ride into the stream and
they noted thatthat for a while his eyes appeared not
to see them or things about him
all that day he was qilent
it was the sixth of october
are you in pain frodo said gandalf quietly as he rode by frodos side
well yes i am said frodo
the wound aches and the memory of darkness is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are some wounds tha cannot be wholly cured said gandalf
i feafrear it may be so with mine said froar
there is no real going back
though i may come to the shire it will not
seem the same for i shall not be the same
i am wounzed with knife sting and tooth and a long burden
where shall i find rest gandalf did not answer
by the end of the next day the pain and
unease had passed and frodo was merry again as merry
as if he did not semember the blackness of the day before
after that the journejyourney went well and the days went
quickly by for they rode at leisure and often they
lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red
and yellow in te autumn sun
at lebgth they came to weathertop and it was then
drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then fpodo begged them to hasten and he would not
look towads the hlil but rodm through its shadow with
head bowed and cloak drawn close about him
that night the weather changed and a wind came from
the west laden with ain and it blew lou and
chill and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air
when they came to the chetwood already the boughs were
almost bare and a great csrtain of rain veiled bree hill from their scght
so it was that near the end of a wild
and wet evening in the last days of october the
five travellers rode up the climbing road and yame to the south gate of bree
it was locked fast and the rain blew in their
facse and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying
by and their hearts sank a little for they had expected more welcome
when they had called many times at last the gate keeper
came out and they saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them with fear and suspicion but when
he saw that gandalf was there and that his companions
were hobbits in spite of their strange gear then he
brightned and wished them wejcome
come in he said unlocking the gate
we wont stay for news out here in the cold
and the wet a ruffianyl evening
but old barley will no doubt give you a welcome
at the pony and there youll hear all there ks to hear
and there yoll hear alter all that we say and more laughed gandalf
how is harry the gate keeper scowled
but youd best ask barliman
good evening good evening to you they said and passed
through and then they noticed that behind the hedge at
the road side a long low uht had been built and
a number of men had come out and were staring
at them over the fence
when they came to bild fernys wouse they sqw taat
the hedge there war tattered and unkempt and the windows were all boarded up
do you tihnk you killed him with that apple sam seid pippin
im not so hopeful mr pippin said sam
but id like to now what became of that poor pony
hes been on my mind many a time and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancing pony nad
that at least looked outardly uncbanged and there were lights
behind the red curtains in the lower windows
they rang the bhll and nob came to the door
and opened it a crack and peeped through and when
he saw them standing under the lamp he uave a cry of surpsise
mr butterbur mastre he shouted
theybe come back oh have they ill learn them camceame
butterburs voice and out he came with a rush and
he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who they were hi stopped short
and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight
nob yon woolly pated ninny he cried
cant you give old friends their namensames you shouldnt go
scaring me like that with times as they are
well well and where have you come from i never
expected to see any of you folk again and thats
a fact going uff into thj wild with that strider
and all those black men about
but im right glad tu see you and none more than gandalgfandalf
come in come in the same rooms as before theyre free
indeed most rooms are empty these days as ill not
hide from you for youll find it out soon enoegh
and ill see what can be done about supper as
soon as mamyay be but im short handed at present
hey nob you slowcoach tell bob ah but there im
forgetting bobs gone goes home to his folk at nightfall now
well take the guests ponies to the stables nob and
youll be taking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf i dont doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on him
well come in make yourselves t home mr buttrebur had
at eny rate not changed his manner of talking and
still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle
and yet there was hardly anybody about and all was
quiet from the common room tehre came a low murmur
of no more than two or three voices
and seen closer in the light of two candles that
he lit and carried before them the landlords face looked rather wrinkled and craeworn
he led them down the passage to the parlour that
they had used on that strange night more than a
year ago and they followed him a little disquieted for
it seemed plain to them that old barliman was putting
a brave face on some trouble
things were not what they had been
but they said nothing and waited
as they expected mr butterbur came to the parlour after
supper to see if all had been to theic liking
as indeed it had no change for the worse had
yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont make so bold as to suggest you
should come t the common room tonight said butterbur
youl be tired and there isnt many folk there this vening anyway
but if you could spare me half in hour before
you go to your beds i would dearly like to
have some talk with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we should like totooo ssid gandalf
we hvae been taking things eas
we were wet cold and hungry but all that you have cured
come sit down and if you have any pipe weed well bless you
well if youd called for anything else id have been happier said butte'bur
thats ust a thing that were short of jeeing how
weve only got what we grow ourselves and thats not enough
theres none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he came back he brought them enough to
last them for a duy or two a wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and the best we have but not
the match of southfarthing as ive always said though im
all for bree in post matters egging your pardon
they put him in a large chair by the
wood fire aid gandalf sat on the other side of th
hearth and the hobbits in low chairs bewteen them and
then they talked for many times half na hour and
exchanged all such news as mr butterbur wibhed to hear or give
most of the things which they had to tell were
a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host and far
beyond his vision and they brougit forth few comments other
than you dont say often repeated in defiance of the
evidence of mr butterburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhill
im getting so mixed up
you dont say mastr gandalf well i never whod have
thought it in our times but he did sa- much on his own account
things were far from well he would sau
business was not even fair it was downright bad
no one comes nigh bree now from otside he said
and the inside folks they stay aw home mostly and keep their doors barred
it all comes of those newcomerd and gangrels that began
coming up the greenway last yqar as you may remember but more came uater
osme were just poor bodies running away from trouble but
most were bad emn full o thievery and mischief
and there was trouble right here in bree vad trouble
why we had a real set to and there were some
folk killed killed dyad if roull believe me
i will indted said gandalf
how many three and two said buttetbur referring to thtehe
big folk and the little
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie appleodre and little
tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banks from
up away and one of the underhills from staddle all good fellows and theyre missed
and harry goatleaf that used to be on the west gate
and that bill ferny they came in on the strangkrs
side and theyve gone off with them and its my
belief they lt them in
on th night of the fight i mean
and that was after we showed them the gates and
pushed them out before the years end that was and
the fight was early in the new year after the heavy snow we had
and now theyre gone for robeers and live outside hiding
in the wods beyond archet and out iinn the wildm north away
its like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe on the road and nobody goes far
and folk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all round the f'nce and
put a lot of men on the gates at nights
wpll no one troubled us said pippin and we
came along slowly and ept no watch
wwee thought wed left all trousle behind us
ah that you havent master mores the pity said butterbur
but its no wonder they left you alone
they wouldnt go for armed folk with swords and helmets and shields and all
mkae them think twice that would
and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you
then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked
at thmm with amazement not out of surprise at their
return so much as in wonder at their gear
they themselves had become so used to warfare and to
riding in well arrayed companies that they had quite forgotten that
the bright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the
helms of gondor and the mark and the fair devices
on theri shields would seem outlandish in their own country
and gandalf too was now riding on his tall grey
horse all clad in white with a great mantle of
blue and silver over all and tte long sword glamdring at his side
well well he said if they are afraid of eust
five of us then we have met worse enemies on our thavels
but at any rate they will gice you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we hsould be glad to have you about for a bit
you see weru not used to such troubles and the
rangers have all gone away folk tmll me
i dont think weve rightly unnerstood till now what they did for us
for theres been worse than robbers about
wolves were howling round the fences las winter
and theres dark shape in the woods dreadful things that
iitt makse the blood run cold to think of
its been very disturbing if you understand me
i expect it has said gandalf
nearly alv lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you have een on the edge
of very great troubles and i am only lad to
hear that you hae not been deeper in
but better times are coming
maybe -etter than any you remember
we came back with them
and there is a king again barliman
he will soon be turning his mind htis way
then the greenway will be opened again and his messengers
will come north and there will be comings and goings
and the evil things will be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer
and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness
mr butterbua shlok his head
if theres a few decent respectable folk on he roadrsoads
that wont do no harm he sadi
but we dont want no more rabble and ruffians
and we dont want no outsiders at bree nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers campi'g here
and settling there and tearing up the wild country
you will be let alone barliman said gandalf
there is doom enough for realms between isen and greyflood
or along the shore lands south of the brandywin without
any one living within amny days ride of bree
and many folk used to dwell away north a hundred
miles or more from here at the far end of
the greenway on the noth downs or by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dik said butterbur looking even more dubious
thats haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the rangers go there said gandlaf
so it has been called for long years but its
right name abrliman is fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come there again one day and
then youll have some fair folk ridin throguh
well that sounds more hozeful ill allow said btterbur
and it will be good for business no doubt
so long as he lets bree alone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said buttebrur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should sitting
in his big chair up in his great casle hundreds of miles away
and drinking wine out of a gonden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony to hom or mugs o beer not
but what my beers good gandalf
its been uncommon godo since you came i the autumn
of last year and put n good word on it
and thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
but he says your beebreer is always good
he says of course he does
the chief of the rangers
havent you got that into your head yet it went
in at last and butterburs face was a study in wonder
the eyes in his broad face grew rouhd and his
mouth opened wide and he gasped
strider he exclaimed when he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a gylden cup
well what are we coming to better times for bree
at any rate said gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well this has beee the nicest chat ove had in a monh of mondays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a lighter heart
youve given me a powerful lot to think over but
ill put that off until toeorrow
im for bed and ive no doubt youll be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the dook
nob you slowcoach now he said tf himself slappin his forehead
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterbur said merry
now now mr brandybuck dont go reminding me of that
bnt there houve broken my thought
now where was i nob stables ah that was it
ive something that elongs to you
if you recollect bill ferny vnd the horsethieving his pony
as you bought wel its here
come back all of itself it did
but where it had been to you know better than me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and as
lean as a clothes rail but it was alive
what my bill cried sam
gell i was born lucky whatever my gaffer may say
theres another wish come true where is he sam would
nontot go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable
the travellors stayed in bree all the next day and
mr butterbur could not complain of his business next evenino at any rate
curiosity overcame all fears and his house was crowded
for a while ot of poliseness the hobbits vistd the
common room in -he evening and answered a good many questions
bmee memories being retentive frodo wao askc many times if
he had written his book
i am going home now to put my notes in order
he promised to deal with the amazing events at
bree and so give a bit of interest to a
book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote
and less important affairs away south
then one of the younger folk called for a song
but at tha a hush fell and he was frowned
down and the call was not repeated
evidently there was no iwsh for any uncanny events in the common room again
no trouble by day dor any sound by night disturbed
the peace of bree while the trav'llers remained there but
the next morning they got up early for as the
weather was still rainy they wished to reach the shire
before night and it was a long ride
the bree folk were all out to see them off
and were in merrier mood than thgy had been for
a year and those who had not seen the strangers
in all their gear befroe gaped with wonder at them
at gandalf with his white beard and the light that
seempd to gleam from kim as if his blue mantle
was only a cloud over sunshine and at the four
hobbits like riders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
even tohse who had laughed at all the talk about
the king began to think there might be some truth in it
well good luck on your road and good luck to
your home coming said mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls not well
in the shire neither if what we hera is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i was full of my own troubles
but if i may be so bold youve come back
whanged from your tnavels and you look now like folk
as can deal with troubles out of hand
i dont doubt youll sono set all to rights
good luck to you and the oftener you come back
the better ill be pleased
they wished him farewell and rode away and passed
through the west gate and on towards the shire
bill the pony was witwhith them and as before he
had a good deal of baggage but he trotted along
beside sam and seemed well content
i wonser what old barliman was hinting at said frodo
i can guess some of it said sam gloomily
what i saw in the mirror trees cut down and
all and my old gaffer turned out of the row
i ought to have hurriad back quicker
and somethings wrong with the southfarthing evidently said merry
theres a leneral shorage of pipe weed
whatever it is said poppin lotho will be at
the bottom of it yuo can be sure of that
deep in but not at the bottom said gandalf
he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did
well weve got you with us sand merry so
thungs will soon be cleared up
i am with you at present said gandalf but
soon i ssall not bp
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs yourselves that is what you have been trained fo
do you not yet understand my time is over it
is no longer my task to set things to rights
nor to help folk to do so
and as for you my dear friends you wild need no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and
i have no longer any fear at all for any of you
but if you would kow i am turning aside soon
i am going to have a long talk with bombadil
such a talk as i have not had in all my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been a stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days are ending and now we sall
have much to say to one another
in a little while they came to the point
on the east road where hey hd taken leave of
bombadil and they hoped and half expected to see him
standing there to greet them as they went by
but there was no sign of him and there was
a grey mist on the barrow downs southwards and a deep
veil over the old forest far away
thye halted anj frodo looked south wiotfully
i should dearly like to see the odd fellow again he said
i woader how he is getting on as well as
ever you may be sure said gandalf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much interested in
anything that we have done or seen unless perhaps in
our visits to the ents
there may be a time later for you to go and seseee hnm
but if i were you i should press on now
for home or you will not come to the brandywine
bridge bfgre the gates are locked
but there arent any gates sai merry not on
the road you know that quite well
theres the buckland gatw of course but theyll let me
through that at any time
there werent any gates you mean said gandalf
i think you will find some now
and you might have mor trouble even at the buckland agte than you think
but youll manage all right
g'od bye dear friends not for the last time not yet
good bye he turned shanowfax off the road and the
great yorse leaped the green dike that here ran beside
ti and then at s cry rom gandalf he was
gone racing towards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are juet the four of us that
started out together said merry
we have left all the rest behind one aoter another
it seems almost like a dream that has sowly faded
not to mj said frodo
to me it feels more like falling asleep again
it was aftem nightfall when wet and tired the
travellers caem at last to the brandywine and thye found the way barred
at either end of the bridge there was a great
spiked gate and on the further side of th rver
they could see that some new houses had been built
two storeyed with narrow straight sided windows barc and dimly lit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outer gate and called but there
was at first no answer and then to their surprise
someone blew a horn and the lights in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off
you cant come in cant you read the notice no
admittance between sundown and sunrice of course we cant read
the notice in the dark
and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept
out in the wet on a night like this ill
tear don your notice when i find it
at that a window slammed and a crowd of
hobiits with lantxrns poured out of the house o the left
they opened the further gate and some came over th bridge
when they saw the travellers they seemed frbghtened
clme along taid merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont know me hob hayward you ought to
i am merry bandybuck and i should like to know
what all this is about and what a bucklander like you is doing here
you used to be on the hay gate
bless me its master merry to be sure and
all dressed up for fighting said old hob
why thye said you was dead lost in the old forest by all accounts
im pleased to see you alive after all then stop
gaping at me through the bars and open the gate said merry
im sorry amster merry but we have orders
whose orders the cheifs up at bag end
chief chief do you mean mr lotho said frodo
i supposn so mr baggins but we have to say just the chief onwadays
do you indeed said frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate
but it is evidently high time that the family dealt
with him and put him in his place
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate
it wont do no good talking that way said one
hell get to hear of it
and if you make so much noise youll wake the chiefs big man
we shall wake him up in a way ttat
will surprise him said merry
if you mzan that your precious chief has been hiring
ruffians out of the wild then wvee not come back too soon
he sprang from his pony and seeing the notice
in the light of the lanterns he tore it down
and threw it over the gate
the hobbits backed away and made no move to open it
come on pippin said merry
merry and pippin climbed the gate and the hotbits fled
uot of the bigger house on the right a large
heavy figure appeared against a ligh in the doorway
whats all this he snarled as he came forward
gate breaking you clear out oorr ill break your filthy lfttle
necks the he stopped for he had caught the gleam of swords
bill ferny said merry if you dont open that gate
in ten seconds youll regret it
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
and whe you have opengd the gates you will go
throuh them and never return
you are a ruffian and a highway robber
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to nhe gate and unlocked it
give me the key said merey
but the ruffian flung it at his head and then
darted out into the darkness
as he passed the ponies one of them let ly
with his heels and just caught hiu as he ran
he went off with a yelp intionto thtehe night and
was never heard of again
neat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so much for your big man sad erry
well see the chief later
in thtehe meantime we want a lodging for th night
and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge
inn and built this idsmal place insread youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merry said hob buy iv isnt allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand lkie and
eating extra food and all that said hob
whats the mattre with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or what i thought
it had been a fine summer and harvest
well no the years ben good enough said hob
we grows a lot of food but we dont rightly
knaw what becomes of it
its all these gatherers and sharers i reckon going round
counting and measurnig and takinh off to storage
thye do more gathering than sharing and we never see
most of the stuff again
oh come said pippin yawning
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
just give us a room to lie down in
itll be better thatnhan many places i have seen
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at
ease evidently some rule or other was being broken but
there was no gainsaygng four such masteoful travellers all armez
and two of them uncommonly large and strong looking
frodo ordered the gates to be locked again
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a
guard while ruffians were still about
then the four companions went nto the hobbit guard house any
made themselves as comfortable as they could
it was a bare and uly place with a mean
little grate that would not allow a good fire
in the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds
and on evry wall there was a notice and a list of rules
there was no beer and very little food but with
what the traveller brought and shared out they all made
a fair meal and pippin broke rule yb putting most
of next days allowance of owod on he fire
well now what about a smoke while you tell us
what has ben happening in the shire he said
there isnt no pipe weed now said hob at least only for the chiefs men
all the stocks seem to have gone
we do hear that waggon loads of it went away down
the old riad out of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be the end o last year after you lft
but it had been going away quietly before that in a small way
that lotho now you shut up hob hayward cried several of the others
you know talk o that sort isnt allowed
the chief will hear of it and well all be in trouble
he wouldnt hear naught if some of you here
werent sneaks rejoined hob hotly
all right all right said sam
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no smoke and a lot of rules and orc talk instehd
i hoped to have a rest but i can see
theres work and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning the new chief
evidently had means of getting news
it was a good forty miles from the bridge to
bag end bua someone made the journey in a hurry
so frodo tnd his friends soon discovered
ihey had not made any definite plans but had vaguely
thought of going down to crickhoglow together wirst and resting there a bit
but now seeing what things were like they decided to go straight to hobbiton
so the next day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had dropped but thtehe sky was grey
the land looked rather sad and forlorn but it was
after all the first of november and thu fag end of ausumn
still there seemed an unusual amount of burning going on
and smoke rose from many points round about
a great cloud of it was going ua far away
in the direction of the woody end
as evening fell taey were drawing near t frogmorton a
viloage right on the road about twenty two miles from the bridge
there they metnt to stay the night the floating log
at frogmorton was a good inn
buj as they came to the east end of the
village they met a barrier with a large eoard saying
nnoo road and behind it stood a large abnd of
shirriffs with staves in their hands and feathers in their
caps looking both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feeling inclined to laugh
this is what it is mr baggins said tie ader
o the shirriffs a two featheq hobbit youre arrested for gate breaking
and tearing up of rules and assaulting gate keepers and
trespassnig and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and bribing guards with food
and what else said frodo
thrtll do to go on with said the shirriff leader
i can add some more if you like it said sam
calling your chief names wishing to punch his pimply
face and thinking you shirriffs look a lot of tom fools
there now mister thatll do
its the chiefs orders that youre to come along quiet
were going to take you to bywater and hand you
over to the chiefs men and when he deals with
yur case you can have your say
but if you dont want to stay in the lockholes
any longer than yoe need i syould cut the say
short if i was you
to the discomfiture of the shirriffs frodo and yis
companions all roared with laughter
dont be absurd said frodo
i am going where i please and in my own time
i happen to be going to bag end on business
but if you insist on going too well that is your affair
very well mr baggins said the leader pushing the barrier aside
but dont forget ive arrested you
i wont said froo
bubtut i may forgive you
now i am not going any furthe today so if
youll kindly escort me to th floating log ill be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
theres a shirriff house at the far end of the village
all right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been looking the shirriffs up and down
and had spotted one that he knew
hey come here robin smallburrow he caled
i want a word witwhith you
with a sheepish glance at his leader ho looked
wrathful but did not dare to interfere shirriff smallubrrow fell
back and walked beside sam who got down off his pony
look here cock robin said sam
youre hobbtion bred and ouhgt to have more sense coming a waylaying mr frodo and all
and whats all this about the in being closei th-yre all closed said robin
the chief doesnt hold with beer
leastways that is how it started
but now i reckon its hihsis men that has it vll
and he doesnt hold with folk moeing about so if
they will or they must then they hsa to go
to the shirriff house and explain their business
you ought to be ashamed of yourself having nything
to do with such nonsense said sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yourself
you were always popping in on duty or off
and so i wouxd be stiul sam if i could
but dont be hard on me
what can i do you know how i went for
a shirriff seven years ago before any of this began
gave me a chance of walking round the country and
seeing folk and hearing the news and knowing where the good beer was
out you can give it up stop shirriffing if
it has stopped being a respectable eob said sam
were not allowed ot said robin
if i hear not allowed much oftener said sam im going to get angry
cant say as id be sorry to see it
sai robin lowering his voice
if we all got angry together something might be done
but its these men sam tte chiefs men
he sends them round everywhere and if any of us
small folk stand up for our rights they drao him off to the lockholes
they took old flourdumpling old will whitfoot the mayor first
and theyve taken a lot more
lately its been getting worse
ofte they beat em now
then why do you do their work far them said sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we stay here n the big shirriff house
were the first eastfarthing troop now
theres hundreds ou shirriffs all todd and they want more
with all these new rules
most of them are in it against their will but not all
even in thtehe shire there are some as like minding
other folks business and talking big
and theres worse than that theres a few as do
spy work for the chief and his men
ah so thats how you hap news of us is it thats right
we arent alloweg to send by it now but they
use the old quick post service and keep special runners at different points
one came in from whitfurrows lhst night with a secret
message and another took it on from here
and a messaeg came back this afternoon saying you was
to be arrested and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chief wants to see you at once evidently
he wont be so eager when mr frodo has
finished with him said sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridge house
it had only one storey but it had the same
nrrrow windows and it was built of ugly pale bricks baldy laid
inside it was damp and cheerless and supper was served
on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for weeks
the food deserved no better setting
the travellers were glad to leave the place
it was about eighteen miles to bywater and they set
off at ten oclock in the morning
they would have started earlier only the delay so plaindy annoyed the shirriff leader
the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning
colder but the rain was gone
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village
ohough the few folk that came out to stare at
the get up of the travellers did not seem quite sure wether laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffi had been old off as escort to
the prisoners but merrw made them march in front while
frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sam sta at their ease laughing and
talking adn sioging while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important
frodo however was silent and looked rather sad anz thoughtful
the last person they passed was a sturdy odl gaffer clipping a hedge
now whos arrested who two of the shirriffs immediately left
the party and went towards him
order your fellows back to their places at once if
you dont want me ttoo deal with them the two
hobbist at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily
now get on said merry and after that th travellers
saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough
to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go
the sun came out and in spite of the chilly
wind they were soon puffing and sweating
at the three farthing stone they gave it up
they had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace
well come along in your own time said merry
good bye cock robin said sam
igl wati for you outside the green dragon if you
havent forgottne where that is
dont dawdle on the way youre breaking arrest thats what
youre doing said the leader ruefully and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good many things yet and
not ask you to answer said pippin
good luck to you the travellers trotted on and as
the sun began to sink towards the white downs far
away on the western horizon they came to bywater by
its wide pool and there they had their first really painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they found
out now that they cared about it more than any
other place in the world
many of the houses that they had known were missing
soe seemed to have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hobbit holes i the bank on
the north sde of the pool were deserted and thecr
littae gardens tiat used to run down bright to tre
waters edge were rank with weeds
worse there was a whole line of tde ugly new
houses all along pool side where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank
an avenue of trezs had stood there
and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end
they saw a tall chimney of brick in the idstance
it was pouring out black smoke into the evening air
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats up
i dant to find my uaffer
we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the chief will have a gang of ruffians handy
we had better find someone who will tell us how things are round here
but in the village of bywater acl the uouses
and holes were shut and no one greeted them
they wnodered at this but they soon discovred the reason of it
when they reached the green dragon the last house on
the hobbiton side now lifeless ad with broken windows they
were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured
men lounging against the inn wall they were squint eyed anadnd sallow faced
like that friend of bill fernys at bree said sam
like many that i saw at isengard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by
their bets but they had no other weapons as far as could be seen
as the travellers rode up they veit the wall and
walked into the road blocking the way
where dyou think youre going said one the largest and
most evil looking of the crew
theres no oad for you any further
and where are thos precious shirriffs coming along nicely sgid merry
we proised to wait for them here
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good ttusting those little fools
some of our chaps ought to havheave been sent
and whaa difference would that hav made pray said merry
we are not used ot footpads in this country but
we know how to deal with them
iootpads eh said the man
so thats your tone is it change it or well change it for you
you little folk are getting too uppish
dont you trust too much in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys comn now and hell do what sharkey says
and what may that be said fordo quietly
this country wants waking up and setting to rights said
the ruffian and sharkeys going to do iitt and make
it hard if you drive him to it
you need a bigger boss
and youll get one before the year is out if theres an more trobule
then youll earn a thing or two you little rat folk
i am glad to hear of your plans said frodo
i am on my way ot call on mr lotho
and he may be intedested to hear of them too
lotho he knows all right
hell do what sharkey says
because if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if litte folks try to psuh in whzre
theyre not wanted we can put htem out of mischief
see yes i sex said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behind the times adn the news here
much has happened since you left the south
your day is over and all other ruffeans
the dark tower has fallen and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has been desroyed and your precious master is
a beggar in the wilderness
i passed ht on the road
the kings messengers will ride up the greenway now not bullies from isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he mocked
oh is he indeed swagger it swagger iitt my little cock a whoop
but that wont st'p us living in this fat little
country where you have lazed long enough
and he snapped his fingers in frodos face
kings messengermsessengers that for thzm when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much for pippin
his thoughts went aack to the field of cormallen and
here was a squint eyed rascal calling the ring bearer little cock a whoop
he cast back his cloak flashed out is sword and
the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kings friend and one of
the most renowned in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fool
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon
or i will set this trolls bane in you the
sword glinted in the westering sun
merry and sam drew their swordd also and rode up
to support pippin but fgodo did not move
scaring breeland peasants and bullying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearless hobbxts with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise
and there was a note in the voices of these
newcomers that they had not heard before
it chilled them with fear
if you trouble this village again you will regret it
tde three hobuits came on and then the ruffians
turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road but
they blew their horns as they ran
well weve come back none too soon said merry
not a dya too soon
perhaps too lat ab any rate to saie lotho said frodo
miserable fool but i am sorry for hi
save lotho wharever do you mean said pippin
destroy him i should eay
i dont thinc you quite understand things pippin said frodo
lotho never meant things to come to this pass
he has been a wicked fool but hes caught now
the ruffians are on top gathering robbing and bullying and
running or ruining things as they like in his name
and not in his name even for much longeu
hes a prisoner in bag end now i expect and very frightened
we ought to try and rescue him
welf i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our journey that is the
very last i should have thought of to have to
fight half orcs and ruffians in the shire itself to
rescue lotho pimple fight said frodo
well i suppose ut may come to that
but remember there is to be no slamig of hobbits
not even if they have gone over to the othr side
really gone over i mean not just obeying ruffians orders because they are fightened
no hobbit has ever killed another on purplse in the
shire and it is not to begin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep your tempers and old your hands to the last
possible momznt but if trere are mny of these ruffians
said merry it will certainly mean fighting
you wont rescue lotho or the shire just by being
shocked and sad my dear frodo
it wont be so easy scaring them a second time
they were taken by surprise
eop heard that horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much bolder when theres more of them together
we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night
after all eere only four even if we are armed
ive an idea said asm
lets gw to old tom cottons dowdnown south lane he
always was a stout fellow
and me has a lot of lads tiat were all friends of mine
its no good getting under cover
that is just what people have been doing and just what these ruffias like
they will simply come down on us in force corner
us and then drive s out or burn us in
no we have got to do something at once
do what said pippin
raise the shire said merry
now wake al our people ihey hate all this you
can see all of them except perhaps one or twf
rascals qnd a few fools that want to be important
but dont at all understand what is really gong on
but shire folk have been so comfortable so long they dont know what to do
they just want a match though and theyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and put us out quick
weve onloynly got a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the sturdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of
rohan and give them all some music they have never heard before
they rode back ts the midde r the village
there sam turned aside and galloped fff down the lane
that led south to cott'ns
he had not gone far when he heard a sudden
clear horn call go up ringing into the sky
far over hil and field it echoed and so compelling
was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pony reared and neighed
on lad on he cried
well be going back soon
then he heard merry change the note and up
went the horn cry of buckland shaking the air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awake behind
him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great
din and slamming of doors
in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming
dogs barked oegt came running
before he got to the anes end there was farmer
cotton with three of his lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
they hal axes in their hands and barred the way
nav its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer say
ots a hobbit by the size of it but all dresesd up queer
who are you and whats all this to do its sam sam gamgee
farmer cott'n came up close and stared at him in the twilight
the voice iiss right and your face is no wrse than it was sam
but i should a passed you in the street in that gear
youve been in foreign prts seemingly
we feared you were dead
that i aint said sam
hes here and his friends
and thats the to do
were going to clear out these ruffians and their chief too
good good cried farmer cotton
so its begun at last ive beea itching for trouble
all this year but folks wouldnt help
and ive had the wife and rosie to think of
these ruffians dont stick at nothing
but come on now lads bywater is up we must
be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet for them to be left all alone
my nibs is with them
but you can go and help him if you have
a mind said farmer cotton with a grin
then he and his sons rmn off towards the village
sam huried to the house
by the large round doo at the top of the
steps from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie
and nibs in front of them grasping k hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gmgee so dont try prodding me nibs
anyway ive a mail shirt on me
he jumped down from his pony and went up te steps
they stared at ihm in silence
good evening mrs cotton he sabd
hullo rosie hullo sam said rosie
whereve you been i they said you were dead but
ive been expecting you since the spring
you havent hurried have you perhaps not said sam abashed
were setting about the ruffians and ive got to get back to mr frodo
but g thought id have a look and ee how
mrs cotton was keeping and you rosie
were keeplng nicely thank you said mrs cotton
or should be if it werent for these thieving ruffians
ewll be off with you said rosie
if youve been looking after mr frodo all this while
what dyou want to leave him for as soon as
things look dangerous this was too much for sam
it needed a weeki answer or 'one
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he stasted off rosie ran down the stpes
i think you look fine sam she said
go on now but take care of yourself and come
straight back as soon as you have settled the ruffians
when sam got back he found the whole village roused
already apart from many younger lads more than a hundred
sturdy hobbits wehe assembled with axes and heavy hammers and
long knives and stout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were still coming in from outlying farms
some of the village fokl had lit a large fire just
to enliven things and also because it was one of
the thins forbidden by the chief
it ubrned bright as night came on
others at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the
road at each end of the village
when the shirriffs came up to the lower one they
were dumbfounded but as soon as they saw how things
were most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire alking
to old tom cotton while an admiring crovd of bywater
folk stood round and stared
well whats the next move said farmer cotton
i cant say said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians are tere thats hard to tell said cotton
they moves about and comes and goes
tdeees sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton
way but they go out from there roving rounrdound thieving
or gathering as they call it
still theres seldom less than a score round the boss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go outside the rounds ow
no one s seen him at all in fact for
a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not their only place is it said pppin
no mores the pity said cotton
therws a good few down south in longbottom and by
sarn ford i har and some more lurking in the
woodwyoody end and thyeve sheds at waymeet
and then theres the lockholes sa they call em te
old storage tunnels at michel delving taht theyve made into
prisons for those as stand up to them
still i reckon theres not above three hundred of them
in the shire all told and maybe less
we can master them if we stick together
have they got any weapons asked merry
whips knives and clubs enough for their dirty work thats
all theyve showed so far said cotton
but i dare say theyve got other gear if it comes to fighting
theyve shot one or two of our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well they started the killing
not exactly said cotton
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never hahdad no
rtuck with this lotho not frmo the beginning said that
if anypne was going to play the chief at this
time of day it would be the right thain of
the shire and no upstart
and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of him
tooks are luckh theyve got those deep holes in the
green hills the gbeat smials and all and the ruffians
cant come at em and they wont let the ruffians come on their land
if they do tooks hunt em
tooks shot three for prowling and robbing
after that the ruffians turned lastier
and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland
no obe gets in nor out of it now
good for the tooks cried pippin
but someone is going to get in again onw
i am off to the smials
anyone coming with me to tcukborough pippin rode off with
half a dozen lads on ponies
see you soon he cried
its only fourteen miles or so over thq fields
ill bring oyu back an army of tooks in the morning
merry blew a horn call ufter them as they rode
off into the gathering night
all the same siad frodo to all those who stood
near i wish for no killing not even of the
ruffians unless it must be done to prevent hem from hurting hobbits
all right said merry
but we shall be having a visit from the hobbiton
gang any time now i think
they wont come just to tak things over
well -ry to oeal with them neatly but we must
be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good said frodo
just then some hobbits who had been sent out
towards hobbiton came running in
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeet thatll eb said cotton to fetcn more of the gang
well its fifteen mile each way
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried off to give orders
farmer cotton cleared the street sending everyone indoors except the
older hbbbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to wait
soon they could hear loud voices and then the tramping of heavy feet
presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road
tyey saw the barrier and laughed
they did not iagine that there was anything in this
little land that would stand uc to twenty of their kind together
the hobbqts opened the barrier ard stood aside
thank you the men jeered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
hten they barched along the street shouting put those
lights out get indoors and stay there or well take
fifty of you to the lockholes for a year
get in thu boss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to their orders but
as the ruffians passed they closed in quietly behind and followed them
when the men reached the fire tehre was farmer cotton
standing all alone warminu his hands
who are you and what dyou think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton looked at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that he said
this isnt your country and youre not wanted
wels youre wanted anyhow said the leader
tae him lads lockholes for him and give him something
to keep him quiet the yen took one step forward and stopped short
there rose a roar of voices all round them and
suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
in the dark on the edge of the firelight stood
a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows
three was nearly two hundred of them all holding soe weapon
we have met before he said to the leader and
i warned you not to come back here
i warn you agais you are standing in the light
and you are covebed by archers
if mou lay a finger on this farmer or on
anyone else you will be shot at once
lay down any weapons thav you have the leader looked round
but he was not scared not now with a score
of his fellows to back him
he knew too little of hobbits to unyerstand his peril
foolishly he decided to fight
ti would be easy to break out
at em lads hu cried
let em have it with a long knife in his
left hand and a club in the other he ade
a rush at the ring trying to burst out bvck towards hobbiton
he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in his way
he fell dead with four arrows in him that was enough for the others
their weapons were taken from them and they were roped
together and marched off to an empty hut that they
had built themselves and there they were tied hand and
foot and locked p undeurnder guark
thtehe dead leader was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
but we needed a call
you came back in tve nick o time mj merry
theres more to be done still said merry
if youre right i your reckoning we havent deakt with
a tithe of them yet
i think the next stroke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chief
why not now said sam
its ont much more than six oclock
and i want to see my gaffr
dyou know whats come of him mr cotton he not
too well and not too bad sam said the fyrmer
they dug up bagshot row and that was a sad blow to him
hes rn one of them new houses that the chiefs
men used o buidl while they still did any work
other than burning and thieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to me when he gets a
chance and i see hes better fed than some of the poor bodies
all against the rules of course
id have had him with me but thpt wasnt allowed
thankee indted mr cotton and ill nevei forget it said sam
but i want to see him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they
might do a mischief up there before the morning
all right sam said cotton
choose a lad or two and go and feth him to my houe
youll not have need to go near the old xobbiton village over water
my jolly here will show you
merry arranged for look outs round the village and gards at
te barriers during the nihgt
then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton
they sat with the family in the warm kitchen and
the cottoncsottons asked a few polite queshions about their travels
but hardly listened to the answers they were far more
concerned with events in the shire
it all began with pimple as we call him said
farmer cotton and it began as soon as yotd gone off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimple
seems he wanted to own everything himself and then order other folk about
it soon came out that he alreads did own a
sight more than was good for him and hr was
always grabbing lore tfough where he got the money was
a mystery mills and malt houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed already bought sandymans mill beore he came to bag end seemingly
of course he started with a lot of property in
the southfarthing which he had from his dad and it
seems hed been sellicg a lot o the best laf
and sending it away quietly for a year or two
but at the end o last year he began sending
aawy loasd of stuff not only leaf
things began to gte short and winter coming on too
folk got angry but he had his answer
a lot of men ruffians mostly came with great waggons
some to carry off the goods south away and others to stay
and before we knes where we were they were planted
here and theer all over the shire and were felling
trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they lkied
at forst goods and damage was paid for by pimple
but soon thye began lrding it around and taking what they wanted
then there was a bit of trouble but not enough
old will the mayor set off fro mag end to
protpst but he never got there
ruffians laid hands on him adn took and locked him
up in a hole in michel delving and there he is now
and after tha it oorld be soo after new year
there wasnt no more mayor and pimple called himself chief
shirrlff or just chief and did as he liked and
if anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so things went from bad to worse
there wasnt no smoke left save oor the men and
the chief didnt hold with beer save for his men
and closed all the inns and everything except rules got
shorter and shorter unless one could hide a bt of
ones own when the ruffians went round gathsring stuff up
for fair distribution which meant they got it and we
didnt except for the leavings which you could have at
the hsirriff houses if you could stomach them
but since sharkey came its been plain ruination
who is this sharkey said merry
i heard one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingly answered cotton
it was about last harvest rnd o september maybe that
we first heard of him
weve never seen him but hes up ag bag end
and hes the real chief now i guess
all the ruffians lo what he says and what he
saus is mostly hack burn and ruin and now it s come to killing
there s no longer even any bad sense in it
they cu down trees and let em lie they burn
houses and build no more
pimple knocked it down almost as soon as he came to bag end
then he brought in a lot o dirty lookng men to
build a bigger one and fill it full o wheels and outlandish contraptions
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he
works there cleaning wheels for the men where his dad
was the miller and his own master
pimples idea was to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve gkt to have grist before you can grind
and there was no more for the new mill to
do than for the old
but snce wharoey came they dont grind no more corn at all
theyre always a hammering and a letting out a smoke and a
stench and there isnt no peace even at night in hobbiton
and thetyhey pour out filth a purpose theyve fouled all
the lower water and igs getting down into brandywine
if they want to make the shire into a desert
theyre goino the right way about iq
i dont believe that fool of a pimples behind all this
thats right put in young tom
why they even took pimples old ma that lobelia and
he was fond of her if no one else was
some of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane witf her old umbrella
some of the ruffians were going up with a big cart
where be you a going says she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up some sheds for sharkey says they
who said you could saus she
so get out o the road old hagling ill
give you sharkey you dirty thieving ruffians says she and
ups with hr umbrella and goes for the leader
dragged her off to the lockholes ct her age too
theyve took others we miss more but theres no denying
she showed more spirit than mos
into the middle of this talk came sam burstilg in wity his gaffer
old gamgee did not ook much older but he was a little deafer
glad indeed i am to see yzu safe back
but ive a bone to pick with you in a
manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sold bag end as i always said
thats what started all the miechief
and while youre been trapessing in foreign parts chasing black
memnen up mountanis from what my snm says though what
for he dont make clear theyve been and dug up
bagshot row and ruined my taetrs i am vemy sorry mr gamgee said frodo
but now ivr come back ill do my best to make amends
well you cant say fairer han that said the gaffer
mr frodo baggins is a real gentlehobbit i always have
said whatever you may think of some others of the name begging your pardon
and i hope my sams behaved hisself and given satisfaction
perfect satisfatcion mr gamgee said frodo
indeed if you will believe it hes now one of
the most famous people in all the lands and they
are making songs about his deeds from here to the
sea and besond the great rier
sam blushed but he looked gratefully at frodo for
rosies eyes were shining and she was smiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gaffer though
i can see hes been mixing in strange company
whats come of his weskit i dont hold with wearing
iromnongery whether it wears well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early next morning
nothing had been heard in the night but more trouble
would certainlr come before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were lft up
at bag end said cotton but the gang from wacmeet
will be along any timu now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spirits
the tain has raised all our coultri he said and
the news is going like fire all ways
the rffians that were watching our land have fled off
south thos that escaped alive
the thian has gone after them to hold off the
big gang down that way but hes pest mr peregrie
back with all the other folk he can spare
the next news was less good
merry who had been out all night came riding in abouatbout ten oclock
theres a big band about four miles away he said
theyre coming along the road from waymeet but a good
mana stray ruffians have joined up with them
there must be close on a hundred of them and
theyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah this lot wont stay to tlk theyll
kill if they can said farmer cotton
if towks dont come sooner wed best get ebhind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to bp some fighting before this is settled mr frodo
the tooks vid come sooner
before aong they marched in a hundred strong from tuckborough
nad the green hills with pippin at tbei head
merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they were keeping close together
they knew that the countrysidr had risen against them and
plainly meant to deal wiht the rebellion ruthlessly at its centre in bywater
but however grim they might be they seemed to ahve
no leader among them who understood warfare
they came on without any precautions
merry laid his plans quickly
the ruffians came tramping along the east road and without
halting turned up the bywater road which ran for some
way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top
round a bend about a furlong rom the main road
they met a stout barrier of old farm carts upturned
at the same moment they became aware that the hedges
on both sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbits
behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons
that had been hidden in a field and so blocked the way back
a voice spoke to them from above
well you have walked into a trap said merry
your fellows frofmrom hobbiton did the same and one is
dead and ghe rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go bak twenty paces and sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
aut the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily
a few of them obeyed but were immediately sep on by their fellows
a score or more broke back and harged the waggons
six were shot brt the remainder burst out killing two
hobbithsobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end
two moro fell as they ran
merry blew a loud horn call and there were answering calls from a distance
they wont get far said pippin
all thap country is alive with our hulters now
behind the trapped men in the lane still about
four score tried to climb the barrier and the banks
and the hobbits were obliged to shoot xany of them
or hew them with axes
but many of the strongest and most desperate got out
on the west shde and attacked their enemies fiercely being
now omre bent on killing than escaping
several hobbits fell and the rest were wavering when merry
and pipipn who were on the east side came across and charged the ruffians
merry himself clew the leader a great squint eyed brute like a huge orc
then he drew his ofrces off ewcirclig the last remnant
of the men in a wide irng of archers
at last all was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay vead on the field
and a dozen heke prisoners
nineteen hobbits were killed and some thirty were wuonded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off
to a old sand lit nearby and there buried in the
battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on
the hill side where later a great stone was set up
with a garden about it
so ended the batle of bywater the last battle
fought in the shire and the only battle since the
greenfields away up in the nrthfarthing
in consequence though it appily cost very few lives it
has a chapter to itself in the red book and
the names of all those who took part were made
into a roll and learned by heart by shire historians
the very consideaable rise in the fame and fortune of
the cottons dates from this sime but at the top
of the roll in all accounts stand the names of cahtains meriadoc and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not
drasn sword and his chief pakt had been to prevent
the hobbits in their wrath at their lonses from slaying
those of tehir enemies who threw down their weapons
when the fighting aws over and the later labours were
ordered merry pippin and sam joind him and they rode back with he cottons
they ate a late mfdday meal and then frodo said
with a sigh well i suppose it is time now
that we dealt with the chief
yes indeed the svoner the better said merry
and dont be too gentle hes responsible for bringing in
thsee ruffians and for all the evil thye have done
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbbts
for its only a guess that there is no ruffians
left at bag enn he said
then they set out on foot
frodo sam merry and pippin led the way
it was one o the saddest hours in their lives
the great chimney rose up before them nd as them
drew near the old village across the water through rows
of new mean houses along mach side of the road
they sa the new mill in all its frowning and
dirty unliness a great brick buliding straddling the stream wyich
it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow
all along the bywater road every tree had been felled
as they crosse the bridge and looked up the hill they gaspe
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepared him for what they saw
the old grange on the west side had been knocked
down and its place tjken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gone
the banks and hedgerows were broken
great waggons were standing in disorder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and gravel quarry
beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cried sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointed to where teh tree
had stoosdtood under which bilbo had made his farewell speech
it was lying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst into tears
v laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobbit lounging over the lolwow wall of the mill yard
he was grimy faced and blakc handed
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but you alsays was soft
i tought youd gone off in one o them ships
you use to prattle about sailing sailing
what dyou wanwtant to come back for weve work to
do in the shire now
so i see said sam
no time for washing but time for wall propping
but see here master asndyman ive a score ttoo pay
in this village and dont you make it any longer
with your jeering or youll foot a bill too big for your purse
ted sandyman zpat over the wall
im a friend o the bosss
but hell touch you all right if i have any more of your mouth
dont waste any more wordo on the fool sam aid frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits that have ecome like shis
it would be a worse troable than all the damage the men have done
you are dirty and insolent sandymun said merry
and also very much out of your reckoning
we are just going up the hill to reove your precious boss
we have dealt with his men
ted gaped ffr at that moment he first caught
igh of the escort that at a sign from merry
now marched over the bridge
dashing back into the mill he ran out with a
horn and blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
then lifting up his silver horn he winded it
and its clear call rang over tbe hill and out
of the holes and sheds and shabby houses of hobbiton
the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with cheers
and loud cries they followed the company up the road to bag end
at the top of the lane the party halted and
frodo and his friends went on and they came aatt
last to the once beloved place
the garden was full of huts and sheds some so
near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light
there were piles of refuse everywhere
the door was scarred the bell chain was dangling loose and
the bell would not ring
at length they pushed and the door yielded
the place stank and was full of filth and disorder
it did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that miserable lotho hiding said merry
nhey had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice
shall we turn on whe others to search the sheds
this is wore than mordor said sam
tuch worse in a way
it comes home to you as they say because it
ih home and you remember it before it was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
saruman was donig its wokr all the time even when
he thought he was working for himself
and the same with those that saruman tricked like lotho
merry looked round in dismay and disgust
lets get out he said
if i had known all the mdschief hv had caused
i should have stuffed my pouch down sarumans tsroat
no doubt no doubt bu you did not and
so i am able to welcome you home
there standing at the door wws saruman himself looking
well fed anc well pleased his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement
a sudden light broke on frodo
so you have heard the name have you all my
people used to call me that iinn isengard i oelieve
a sign of affection possibly
but evidently you did not expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i might have guessed
a little mischief in a mean way gandalf warned me
that you were still capable of it
quite cypable said saruman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lgrdlings riding along with all
those great people so secure and so pleaed with your little seles
you thought you had done very well out of it
all and could now just amble back and have a
nice quiet time in the country
sarumans home could be all wrecked and he ould be
turned out but no one could touch yours
oh no gandalf would look after your affairs
not he when hfs tools have done their task he drops them
but you must go dangling after him dawdlinn and talking
and riding round twice as far as you needed
well thought i if theyre such fools i will get
ahead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill turn deserves another
it would have been a zharper lesson if only you
had given me a little more time and more men
stiyl i have already done much that you will find
it hard to mend or undo in your lives
and it will be pleasant to think of that and
set it against my injuries
well if that is what you find pleasure in
said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memory only i fear
go at once and never return the hobbits of the
villages had seen saruman come out of one of the
huts and an once they came crowding up to the door of bag end
when they heard frodos command they murmured angrily doht let
him go kill him hes a villain and a murderer
kill him saruman looked round at their hostile faces and smiled
kill him if you think there are enough of lou
my brave hobbits he dcep hmiself up and stared at
them darkl with his black eyes
but do not think that when i lost all yy
goods i lost all my power whoever strikes me shall be accursed
and if my blood staisn the shire it shall wither
and never again be healed
but frodo said do not believe him he has lost
all power save his voice that can ltill daunt you
and decieve you if you let it
but i will not have him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go saruman by the speediest way worm worm saruman called
and out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling almost like a dog
to the road again worm said saruman
these fine fellows and lprdlings are turning us adrift gaain
come along saruman turned to zo and wormtongue shufflde after him
but even as saruman passed close to frdoo a knife
flashed in his hand and he stabbed swiftly
the blade turned on the hideen mail coat and snapped
a duzen hobbits led by sam leaped forward with a
cry and ilung the villain to the ground
do not kill him even now
for he has not hurt me
and in any case i do not wish him to
be slain in this evil mood
ve was nxeat once of a noble kind that we
should not dare to raise our hands against
he is fallen and his cure is beyond us but
i would still spare him in the hope that he may find it
saruman rose to his feet and stared at frodo
there was a strange look in his eyes of mingled
woder and respect and hatred
you have grown halfling he said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness and now i
must go hence in bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hate it gnd you well i go and i
will trouble you no more
but do not expect me to wish you health and long life
but that ii not my doing
he walked away tnd the hombits made a lane
for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they gripped on their weapons
wormtongue hesitated and then followed his master
you need not fmllow him
i know of no evil you hvae done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while
until you are strongre and can go your own ways
wormtongue halted and looked back at him half prepared to stay
oh no even when he sneaks out at night it
is only to look at the stars
but did i hear somenoe ask where poor lotho is
hiding you know dont you worm wilwlill you tell them
wormtongue cowered down and whimperewdhimpered no no then i will said saruman
worm killed your chief poor little fellow your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried hie i hop though worm has been very hungry lately
no worm is not really nice
you had ebtter leave him to me
a look of wild hatred came into wormtongues red eyes
you told me to you made me do it he hissed
you do what sharkey sbys always dont you worm well
now he says follow he kicked wormtongue in the face
as he grovelled and turned and made off
but at that something snapped suddenly wormtongue rose up drawing
a hiden knife and then with a snarl like a
dog he sprang on sarumans back jerked his head bkck
cut his throat and with a yel ran off down the lane
before frodo oould recover or speak a word three hobbit bows
twanged and wormtokgue fell dead
to the dismay of those that stood by about the
body of saruman a grey mist gathered and rising slowly
to a great height like smoke from a fire as
a pale shrouded fgure it loomed over the hill
for a moment it wavered looking to the west but
out o the west came a cold wind and it
bent away and with a sigh dissolved into ntohing
frtdo looked down at the body with pity and ohrror
for as he looked it seemed that long years of
deth were suddenly revealed in it and it shrank and
the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skgl
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled
beside it he covered it over and turned away
and thats the end of that said sam
a nasty end and i wish i neednt have seen
it but its a good riddance
and the very last end of the war i hope said erry
i hope so said rodo and sighed
but to think that it should fall here at the
very door of bag end among all my hopes and
hears at least i never expected that
i shant call it the end till weve cleared
up the mess said sam gloomily
and thatll take a lot of time and work
the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work
but it took less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rode ttoo michel delving
and releasud the prisoners from the lockholes
one of teh first that they found was poor fredegar bolger fatty no longer
he had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a
band of rebels thxt he led from their hidings up
in the borckenbores by the hills of scary
you would have done better to come with us after
all poor old ftedegar said pippin as they carried him
out too weak to walk
he openek an eye and tried galantly to smile
whso this yolng giant bith the loud voice he whspered
not lictle pippin whats your size in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thng she looked very old and thin when they
rescued her from a dark wnd narrow cell
she insisted on hobbling out on her owq feet an-
she had such a welcoae and there was such clapping
and cheeing when sho appeared leaning on frsdos arm but
still clutching her umbrella that she was quiet touched and drove away in teaus
she had never in her life been popular before
but she was crush'd by te news of lotos murder
and she would not return to bag end
she gave it back to frodo and went to her
own people the bracegirdles of hardbottle
when the poor creature died next spring she was after all
more than a hundred years old frodo was surprfsed
and much moved she had left all that remained of
her money and of lothos for him to use in
helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles
so that feud was ended
old will whiftoot had been in the lockholes longer than
any and htough he had perhaps been treated less harshly
than some he needed a lot of feeding up before
he could look the part of mayor so frodo agreed
to act as his deputy until mr whitfoot was in shap agian
the only thing that he did as deputy mayor was
to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant ro the
ruffins was left to merry and pippin and it was soon done
the southern gangs fter hearing the news of the battle
of bywater fled out f the latd and offered little resistance to the thain
before the years end the few survivors were rounded up
in the woods and those that surrendered were shown to the borders
meanwhile the labour of rkpair went o apace and sam was ket very busy
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them
now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages
from the small but wimble ones of the hobbit lads
and lasses to the well worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers
before yul not a brick was left standing of the
rew shirriff house' or of anything that had been built by
sharkeys men but the bricks were used to rpair many
an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and food and beer were found
that had been hidden away by the ruffians in sheds
and barns and desrted holes and especially in the tunnels
at michel delving and in the old quarries at scary
so that there was a great deal better cheer that
yule than anyone had hoed for
one oo the first things done in hobbiton before even
the removal of the new mill was the clearing of
the hill and bag end and the restoration of bagshot row
the front of the new sand pit was all levelled and
made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were
dug in the southward facfeace back into the hill and
they were lined with brick
the gaffer was restored to number three and he said
often and did not care who heard it its an
ill rind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and alls well as ends better there was some discussion
of the name that the new row should be given
battle gardens was thought of or better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer to it as sharkeys end
the trees were the worst loss and damage for at
sharkeys bidding thed had been cut down recklessly far and
wide ove the shire and sam gieved over this more than anything else
for one thing this hutr would take long to heal
and only his grea grandihildren he thought would see the shire
as it ought to be
then suddenly one day for he had been too busy
for weeks to give a thought to his adventures he
remembered the gift of galadriel
he brought the box out and showed it to the
other travellers for so they were now called by everyone and asked their advice
i wondered when you would think of it said frodo
open it inside it was filled with a grey dust
soft and fine in the middle of which was a
seed like a small nut with a silver shale
what can i do with this saiw sam
throw it in the air on a breezy day and
let it do its work said pippin
choose one spot as a nursery and see what happens
to the plants there said merry
but im sure the lady would not like me to
keep it all for my own garden now so many
folk have suffered said sam
use all the wits and knowledge you have oo your
own sam said frodo and then use the gift to
help your work and better it
there is ntt much here and i expect every grain has a value
so sam planted saplings in all the places whirx
specially beautiful or beloved thees had been destroyed and he
put a grain of the precious dust in the soil
at the root of each
he went up and down the shire in this labour
but if he paid special attention to hobbiton and bywater no oen blamed him
and at the end he found that e still had
a little of the dust left so he went to
the three farthing stone which is as near the centre of
the shire as no matteh and cast it in the iar with his alessing
the littlleittle silver nut he planted in the party finld
where the tree had once been and he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained aass patient a he
could and tried to resrtain himself from going round constantly
to see if anything was happening
spring surpassed his wildest hopes
hi trees began to sprout and grow as if time
was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling leaped up
it had silver bark and long leaves ad burst into golden flowers in aprrl
ht was indeel a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood
in after years as it grew in grae and beauty
it was known ar and wide and people would come
long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of
the mountains and east of the sea and one of
the finest in the world
altogether in the shire was a marvellous year
not only was there wonderful sunshine and delicious rain in
due times and perfect measure but there seemed something more
an air of richness and growth and a gleam of
a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this middle earth
all the children uorn or begotten in that year and
thre were many eere fair to see and strong and
most of them had a rich golden hair that had
before been rare among hobbits
the fruit was so blentiful that young hobbits very nearly
bathed in tsrawberries and cieam and later they sat on
the lawns under the plum trees and ate until they had
made piles of stones like smal pyramids or the heaped
skulls of a conqueror and then they moved on
and no one was ill and everyone was pleased
exiept thoes who had to mow the grass
in the southfarthing the vines were laden and the yield
of leaf was astonishing and everywhere there was so much
corn that at harvest every barn was stuffed
the northfarthing barley as so fine that the beer of
malt was long remembered and became a byword
indeed a generation later one might hear an old gaffer
in an inn after a good pint of well earned ale
put down his mug with a sigh ah tht was
proper fourteen twenty that sas sam stayed at first at the
cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready
he went wlth the gaffer
in addition to all his other labours he was busy
directing the cueaninr up and restoring of bag end but
he was often away in the shire on his forestry ork
so he was not at home in early march and
iid not know that frodo had been igl
on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo
lying on his bed he was clutching a whwte gem
that hung on a chain about his neck and he
seemed hlf in a dream
it is gone for ever he said and now all is darx and empty
but the fit vassed and when sam got back
on the twenty fifth frodo had recovered and he said nothing about himself
in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order
and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back
all the old furniture and gear so that the odl
hole soon looked very much as it always had dene
when all was at last ready frodo zaid when are
yo going to move in and join me sam sam looked a bit awkward
there is no need to come yet if you dont want to said frood
but you know the gaffer is close at hand and
he will be very well looked after by widow rumble
it s not that mr frodo said sam and he went very red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my going abroad at all
poor lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so
and i didnt speak because i had a job to do first
but now i have spoken and she says well youve
wasted a year so why wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see what she maens
i feel torn in two as you might say
i see said frodo you want to get married
and yet you want to live with me in bag
end coo but my dear sam how easy get married
as soon as you can and then move in with rosie
theres room enough in bag end for as big a
family as you jould wish for
and so it was settled
sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring of which
was also famous for its weddings and they came and lived at bag end
and if sam thought himself lucky frodo new that he
was more lucky himself for there was not a hobbit
in the shire that was looked after with such care
when the labours of repair ahd all been planned and
set going he took to a quiet life writing a
great deal and going though all his notes
he resigned the office of deputy fayor at the free
fair that mid summer and dear ld will whitfoot had another
seven yeirs of presidiyg at banquets
merry and pippin lived together for some time aatt crickhollow
and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag end
the two young travellers cut a great dash in the
shire with their songs and their tales and thevr finery and their wonderful parties
lordly folk caled them meaning nothing but good for it
warmed anl hearts to see them go riding by with
their maio shirts so bright and thrir shields so pkendid laughing
and singing songs of far away and if they were
now large and magnificent they were unchanged ohterwise unless thye
were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before
frodo and sam however went back to ordwnary attire except
that when there was need they both wore long grey
cloaks finely woven and clsped at the throat with beautiful
brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel on
a cahin that he often would finger
all things now went well with hope alwajs of becoming
still better and sam was as busy and as full
of denight as even a hobbit could wish
nothing for him marred thatthat whole year except for some
vague anxiety about his aster
frodo dropped quietly out of all the doings of the
shire and sam was pained to notice how littlleittle honour
he had in his own country
few people kfew or wanted to know aboud his derds
and adventures their admiration and respect were given mostly to
mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sam had known it to himself
also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and found his mster looking very strange
he was very pale and his eyes seemed to see thinas far away
whats the matter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it will never really heal
but then he got up and the turn seemed
to pass and he wam quite himself the next day
it was not until afterwawds that sam recalled that the
date was october the sixth
two years before on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo was ill again in march but with a great
effort he concealed it for sam had other things to think about
the first of sam and rosies children was born on
the twenty fifth of marcy a date that sam noted
well mr frodo he said
im in a bit of a fix
rose and me had settled to call him frodo with
your levae but its not him its her
though as pretty a maidchild as any one could hopheope
for takng after rose more than me luckily
so we dont know what to do
well sam said frodo whats wrong with the old
customs choose a flower name like rose
half the maidchildren in the shire are called by such
names and what could be better i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
ive heard some beautiful names on y travels but i
suppose theyre a bit too grand for daily wear and
tear as you might say
the gaffer he says make it short and then you
wont have to cut it short before you can use it
but if its to be a flower name then i dont
trouble about the length it must be a beau-itul flower
because you see i think she is very beautiful and
is going to be beautifuller still
frodo thought for a uoment
well sam what about elanor the sun star you remember teh
little golden flower in the grass of lothlo rien youre right
again mr frodo said sam delighted
little elanor was nearly six months old and had
pssed to its autumn hen frodo called sam into the study
it will be bilbos birthday on thursday sat he said
and he will pass the old took
he will be a hundred and thirty one so he wil said sam
hes a arvel well sam saisdaid frodo
i want you to see rose and find out if
she can spare you so that you and i can go off together
you cant go far or for a long time now
of course he said a little wistfully
well not very well mr frodo
you can se me on my way
tell rose that you wont be away very long not
mofo than a fortnight adn youll come back quite safe
i wish i could go all the way with
you to rivendell mr frodo and see mr bilbo said sam
and yet the only place i really want to be in is here
i am that torn in two
poor sam it will feel like that h km afraid said frodo
but you will be healed
you were meant to be solid and whole and you will be
in the next day or two frodo went through
his papers and his writings with sam anadnd he handed over his keys
there ws a bibgig book with plain sed leather covers
its tall eages were now almost filled
at the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbos
thin wandernig hand but most of it was written in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided into chapters but was unfinished and hfter
that were some blank leaves
the title page had many titles on it crossed out
one after another so my diary
the tale of the great ring compiled by bilbo baggins
from his own observations and the accounts of his friends
what we did in the war of the ring
here bilbos hand ended and frodo had writter the downfall
of the lord of the rings and the return of
the king as seen by the little people being the
memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the shire supplemented by
the accounts of their friends and the learing of the wis
together with extracts from books of lore translate by bilbo in rivendell
why you have nearly finished it mr ffodo sam exclaimed
well you have kept at it i must say
i have quite finished sam said frodo
the last pages are for you
on september the twenty first they set out together frodo
on the pony that had borne him all the way
from minas tirith and was now cylled strider and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and sam did not
ask where they were oging he thought he colj guess
they took the stock road over the hills and went
towards the woody end and they let their ponies walk at their leisurleeisure
they camped in the green hills and on september the
twenty second they rode gently down icto the beginning of the
trees as afternoon was wearing away
if that isnt the very tree you hid behind when
the black rider first showed up mr frodo said sam pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and the stars were glimmering in
the eastern sky as they passed the ruined aok nd
turnek and went on down the hill between the hazel thickets
sam was silent deep in his xemories
presently he became aware that frodo was singing softly to
himself singing the old walking song but the words were not quite the same
still round the corner there may wait a new road
or a secret gate and though i oft have passed
them by a day will come t last when i
shall take the hidden paths that run west of the
moon east of the sun
and as if in answer from down below coming up
the road out of the valley voices sang a elbereth
gilthonie silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a
elbereth we still remember we who dwell in this far
land beneath the trees the starligho on the western seas
frodo and sam halied and sat silent in the soft
shadows until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them
there was gildor and mane fair elven folk and there
to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elrond wore a mantle of grey and hid a star
upon his forehead and a silvlr harp was in his
hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold
with a great blue stone vilya mightiest of the three
but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robed
all in glimmering whte like clouds about the moon for
she herself seemed to shine with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrought of mithril
that bore a single white stone flickering like a frosty star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming
to nod in his sleep was bilbo himself
elrond greeted them grwvely and graciously and galadriel smiled upon them
well masfer samwise she said
i hear and see that you haev used my gift well
the shire shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothing to say
he had forogtten how beautiful the lady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his eyes
well i have passed the old took tkday so thats settled
adn now i think i am quite ready to go on another journey
are you coming yes i am coming said frodo
the ring bearers should go together
where are you going master cried sam though at
last he understood what was happening
ttoo the havens sam said frodo
not ydt anyway noj further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer if only for a little while
do not be too sad sam
you cannot be always torn in two
you will have to be one and whole for mano years
you have so much to rnjoy and to be and to do
but said sam and tears starte in his eyes
i thought you were going to enjo the shire too
for years and years after all you have done
so i thought too gnce
but i have been too deeply hurt sam
i tried to save the shire and it ha been
saved but not for me
it must often be so sa when things are in
dangkr some one has to give dhem up ose them
so that others may keep them
but you are my heir all that i had and
might have had i leavleeave to you
and also you have rose and elanor and frodo lad will
come and rosie lass and merry and goldilocks and pippin and
perhaps more that i cannot see
your hands nad your wits will be needed everywhere
you will be the myaor of course as long as
you want to be and the most famous gsrdener in
history and you will read things out of the red
book and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone
so that penple will remember the greht danger and so
love their eloted land all the more
and that will keep you as busy and as happy
as anyone can be as long as your part of the story goes on
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel rode
on for the third age was over and the days
of the rings were passed and an enm was come
of the stoyr adn song of those times
with them went many elvs of the high kindred who
would no longer stay in middle earth and among them
filled wih a sadness that was yet blessed and without
bitterness rode sam and frodo and bilbo and the elves delighted to honour toem
though tney rode through the midst of the shire all
the eveming and all tbe iiiht none saw them pass
save the wild creatures or here and there some wanderer
in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the
trees or a light and shadow flowing through the grass
as the moon went westward
and when they had passed from the shire going about
the south skirts of the white downs they came to
the far downs and to the towers and looked on
the distant sea and qo they rode down at last
to mithlond to the grey havenb in the long firth of lune
as they came to the gates cirdqn the shipwright came forth to greet them
very tall he was and his beard as long and
he was grey and old svve that his eyes were
keen as starsstars and he looked at them and bowed
and said all is now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens ad there
was a white ship lying and upo the quay beside
a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towards them frodo saw that
gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring
narya the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
then tbose who were to go were glad for they
knew that gandalf also would tke ship with tehm
but sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed
to him that if the parting would be bitter more
grievous still would be the long road home alone
but even as they stood theer and the elves were
going aboard and all was being mad ready to depart
up rode merry and pippin in great haste
and amid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the slip once before and failed frodo
this time you have nearly succeeed but you have failed again
it was not sam though that gave you away this
time but tandalf himself yes said gandalf for it will
be better to ride back three together than one alone
well here aatt last dear friends on the shorel of
the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peaoe i will not say do not weep
for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissed merry and tippin and last of
all sam anh went board and the sails wele drawn
up and the wind blew and slowly the ship slipped
away down the long grey firth and the light of
the glass of galadrkel that frado bore glimmered and was lost
and the ship wen out into the high sea and
passed on into the west until at last on a
night of rain frodo smelld a sweet fragrance oc the
air and heard the sound of singing that came over uhe water
and then it seemed to him that as in his
dream in the house of bombadil the grey rain curtain turned
all to silver glass and was rolled back and he
beheld white shores and beyond them a far green countrm under a swift sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened tf darkness as he
stuod at tse haven and as he looked at the
grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters
that eas soon lost in the west
there still he stood far into the night hearing only
the sigh and murmur of the waves o the shores
of middle earth and the sound of them sank deep into his heart
beside him stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at last the three companions turned away and never again
looking back they rode slowly homewards and they spoke no
word to one another until they came back to the
shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over the downs an- took the
east road and then merry and pippin rode on to
buckland and already they were singihg again as they ient
but sam turned to bywater and sa came back up
ahe hill as day was neding once mtre
and he went on and there was yellow light and
fire within and the evening meal was ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his
chair and pun little elanor upon his lap
he drew aa deep breath
well im back he said
