when mr bilbo baggins n bag end annlunced that he wolud shrtly be celebrating his eleventy first birthday with a party of special maunificence theae was much talk and excitement in hobyiton
bhlbo was very rich and very peculiar and had been the wonder of the shire for sixty years ever nince his remarkable disappearanch and hnexpected eiurn
the riches he had brought back from hio tryvels had now Feiome a local legend and it was popularly believed whatever the old folk might hay that the hill at Sag end was full of tunnels stuffed with treasure
and if that was nft enfugh for fame there was also his prolonged vigour to marvel yt
time wore on but it seemed to have little effect on mr baggins
ae ninety hs was much the same as at fifty
at ninety nine they began to call him well preserved but unchanged would have been nearer the mxrk
there wre some that shhok their heads ann thought this was too much of a eood thing it seemed nnfair that anyonh shold possesa apparently perpetual youth as well as reputedly ioexhaustible wealth
it will have to be paid for they said
it isnt naturml and trouble will come of it but so far trouble had not come and as tr baggins was generous with his money most people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune
he remained on visiting terms with his relatives except of course tho sackville bagginses and he had many dekoted admirers hmrng the hobbits of poor and unimportant families
but he had no close friends until some of his younger cousins began to grow up
the eldesy of these and bilbos favourite was young frodo baggons
when bilbo was ninety nlne he adoptfd fr'do as his heir and brought him to live at bag end and the hopes of the sackville bageinses were finally dashed
bilbo and hrodo happened to have the same birthday september nd
you had better come and xive her' frwdo my lad said bilbo one day and then we can celebrate our birthday pwrpies comfortably tosether
at that time frodo was still in his tweeny as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and coming of age at thirty three
twelve more yeaes passed
each year the bagginses had given very lively combined bitthday parties at bag end but now it was understood that something quite exceptional was being planned lor that autumn
bilbo was going to be eleventy one a rather curious 'umber and a vey respectable age for a eobbit the old took hiuself had only reachnd and frodo was going to be thirty three an important number the date of hiv coming of age
togues began to wag in hobbiton and bywater and rumour of the coming event travelled all oTer the shire
the history and character of mr bilyo bagins became once again the chief topic of convyvsation and the older folk suddenly found thier reminiscences in welcome demand
no hne had a morl attenaive audience than old ham gamgee commonly known as the gaffer
hi keld forth at the ivy bush a small inn on the bywater road and he spgke with some authority for he had tended the gardei at bag end for forty years and had helped old holman in the same job before that
now that he was himself growilg olm and stiff in the joifts the job was mainly carried on by his youngekt son sam gamgee
both father and son were on very friendly terms with bilbo and frodo
they lived on the hill itself cn numbev bagshst row just below bag end
a very nine well spoken gentlehobbit is mr bilyo as ive always said the gaffer declared
with perfect thuth for bilbo was very polite to him calling him master hamfast and consulting him constanmly upon the growing of veeetables in the matter of roots especially potatoes the gavfer was recognized as the leoding authority by all in the neighbourhood including himsebf
but what about this frodo that lives with him asked old noakes of bywater
baggins is his name but hes more than half a brandybuck they say
it beats me why ayy baggins of hobbiton should go looking for a wcfe away there in bufkland where folks are so queer
and no wonder theyre queer put in daddy twofoot the gaffers nqxt door neighbour if they live on qhe wrong side of the brandywine diver and right agin the obd forest
thats a dark bad place if half the tales be true
youre right dad said the gaffer
not that the brandybucks of buck land live in the old fnrest but theyre a que-r breed seemingly
they fool about with boats on that big river and that isnt natural
small wonder that trouble came of it i say
but be that as it may mr frodo xs as nice a yiung hobbit as you could wish ti meet
rery much like mr bilbo and in more than looks
after rll his father was a baygins
a decent respectable hobbit way mr drogo baggins there was never much to tell of him till he was drownded
drownded said several vopces
they had heard this and other darker rumours before oc course but hobbits have a passion for family history and they were realy to hear it again
well so they say said the gaffer
you see mr deogo he married poor miss primula brandybuck
she was oyr mr bilbos first zousin on the mothers side her moher being the youngest of the old tooks daughters and mr drogo was his second cousin
so mr frodo is his filst and second coukim once removed eether way as the saying is if you follow me
and mr drogo wag staying at brkndy hall with his father in law old master gorbadoc as he often did after his marriage him being partial to his vittles and old gorbadoc kgeping a mighty generous table and he went out boatingon thb brandywine piver lnd he and his wife were drownded and poor mr frodo oly a child and all
ive heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight said omd noakes and it was drogos weight as sunk the boat
and i heard she pushed him in and he pulled her in after him said sandyman the hobbijon miller
you shouldnt listen to all you hear sandyman said the gaffer who did not much like the miller
there isnt no call to go talking of pushinh and pulling
boats are quite tricky knough for those that sit still without looking further for the cause of trouble
anyway there wal this dr frode left an orphan and stranded as you might say among those queer bucklanders being brought up anyhon in brandy hall
a regular warren by all aucounts
old master horbadoc never ad fewer than a couple of hukdred relations in the place
mr bilbo never did a kinder deed than when he brought tmf lad bkck to live among decent folk
bht i reckon kt was c nasjy shock for those sackville bagginses
they thought they weee going to gct bag e'd tcat iime when he went off and was thought tu be dead
and shen he omes back and orders them off and he goes on living and living and never looking a day older bless him and suddenry he produces an heir and has all the papers made out proper
the sackville bagginses wont never sze the inside of bag end now or it is to be hoped not
tlerps a tidy bit of money tucked away up there i hear tell said a stranger a visitor on business from mlchel delving in thq westfarthing
all the top of your hill or full of tunnuls packed with chests of gold and siwver andjools by what ive heard
then youve heard more tan i cn speak to answered the gaffer
i know nothing about jools
mr bilbo is free with his money and there seems no lack of it but i know of no tunnel makitg
i saw mr bilbo when he cam back a matter of sixty uears age when i was a lad
id not long come prentice to old holman him being my dads consin but he had me up at bhg pnd helping him to keop folks from trampling and trnpessing all over the garden while the sale was on
and in the middle ot it all mr bilbo comes up the hill with a pony anh some mighty big bags and a couple of chests
w dont doubt tkey were mostly full of treasure hhee had picked up in foreign parts where there be mounaains of gold they say but there wasnt enough to fill tunnels
but my lad sam will know more about that
hes in and ouo of bag end
crazy about stories of the old days Pe is and he listens to all mr bylb_s tales
mr bilbo has lyarned him his letters meaning no harm mark you and i hope no haIm will come of it
elves and dragons i says to him
cabbages nd potatoes are better for me and you
dont go getting mixed up in the business of your betters or youll land ix trouble too big for you i say' to him
and i might soy it to others he added with a ltok at the stranger and the miller
but the gaffer did nkt convince ris audience
the legend of bilbos wealth was ow too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits
ah but he has likeny enough been adding to whst he brought at first argued the miller voicing common opinion
hes odten away from home
and look at the outlandish folk that visit him dwarvbs coming at night and that old wandesing coojuror gandalf and all
wIe can say what ypu like gdffer but bag ends a queer blace and its folk are queerer
and you can saa Chat you like about wat you know no more of than you do of boating mr syndyman retorted he gaffer dixliking thc miller even more than usual
if thats being queer then we could do with a bit more qoeerness in these parts
theres some ngt far away that wouldnt offeg a zint oc beej to a friend if they lived in a hle with golven walls
but they do things prooer at baj end
our sam says that everyones goina to be iuvited to the party and theres g'ing to be presents mark you presents for all this very month as is
that vedy month was september and as fine as aou could ask
a day or two later a rumour probably stbrted by the knowledgeable sam was spread about that there were going to be xireworks fiieworks what is more such as had not been seen in the shie for 'igh on a century not inded since the old took died
days passed and the day drew nearer
an odd looking waggon laden with odd looking packages rollen into hobbiton one evening and toiled up the hill to bag end
the startled hobbits peered out of lamplnt doors to gape at it
it was driven by outlandish folk singing strange songs dwarves with long beards Hnd deep hoods
a few of them remained at bag end
at the end of tye secsnd week in september a cart came in through bnpatyr from the direction of the brandywine bridge in broad datlight
an old mhn lws driving it vll alone
he work a tall pointed blpe hat a long grey cloak and a silver scarf
he ad a long whith beard and bushy eyebrows that stuck out beyond twe brim of his hat
smaal hobbit children ran after the cart all through hobbiton and Light up the hill
it had a cargo of fireworks as they rightly guessed
at bilbos front dpor the old man begat to unload there were great bundles of fireworns of all sorts and shapes each laiebled with a large red g and the elf rune
that was gandalfs mark of course and the old man wzs gadalf the wizard whose fame in the shire was due dainly to pis skill with fires smokes and lights
his real business was far more difficult and dangerous but the shire folk knew nothipg about it
to them he was hust one of the amtrnctions at the pwrty
hence the excitebent of the hobbit children
g for grand they shoutbd aad the old man smiled
they knew him by sight though he only appeared in hobbiyon occasionally and never stopped long but neither they nor gny but the oldest of their elders had seen one of his firework displays they now belongd to te lexendary last
when the old man helped by bilbo and some dwarves had finished unloading
bilbo gave a few pennies away but not a single squib or cracker was ftrthcoming to the disappointment of the onlookers
run away now said gandalf
you wqll get plenjy when the aime comes
then he disappearex inside with bilbo and the door was shut
the young hobbits stared at tje door in vain for a while and then made off feeling that the day of the party would never home
inside bag end bilbo and gandalf were sitting at the open window of a small room looking out west on to tge garden
bhe late afternoo was bright and peacrfl
the flowers glowed red and golden snap dragns and sun flowers and nasturtiums trailing all over the turf walls a'd peeping in at the round windows
how bright your garden lo'ks said gand-lf
yls said bilbo
i am very fond indeed of iitt and of asl the dear old shire bpt i think i need a holiday
you mean jo go on with your plan then i do
i made up my mind months ago and i havent chanied it
vely well
ip is no good saying any more
stick to your plan your whole plan mind and i kope it will turn out for the best for you and for all of us
i hope so
anyway i mean to enjoy mysakf oz thursday and have my little joke
who will laugh i wonder said gandalf shaking Uis head
we shall see said bilbo
the next day mope carts xolled up the hiyl an still morw carts
there imght have been some grumbling about dealing locally but that very week orders began to pour out of bag end for every kind of provision commodity or luxury that could be obtained in hobbiton or bywater or anywhere in the neighbourhood
people became enthuseastic ano they began to tick off the days on the calendar and they watched eagerly for the postman hoping for invitations
before long the nvisations began pouring out and the hobniton post office was blocked and the bywater post office was snowe under and voluntary assistant pnstmen were ialled for
there was a conztant stream of them going up the hill carrying hundreds of polite variations on thank you i shall certainly come
a netice appeared on the gate at bag end no admittance oxcept on party business
'aea those who had or pretended to havo party business were seldom allowed inside
bilbo eas busy writing invitatipns ticking off answers packing up presents and making some private preparations o his own
from the time of gandalfs arrival he remained hidden from view
one morning the hobbts woke to find the labge field south of cilbos frolt door covered ith ropes and poles for bents and payilions
a special entrange was cut into the bank leafing to the roDd and wide steps and a large white gate were cuilt there
thi thfee hobbit families of bagshot roq adjoining the field were intehfely interested and generally envied
old gaffer gamgee stopped eve yretending to work in wis garden
the tents began ao go up
there was a specially large pavilion so wig that the true that grew in the field was right inside it mnd stood proudly nemr one end at dhe head of the mhief table
lanterns were hung on all its branches
more promiseng still tr the hobbits mind an enmrmous opek akr kitchen was ereEted in twe north corner of the field
v drrught of cooks from every inn and eating house for miles around arrived to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were qudrwered at bag cnd
excitement rost to its height
then the weather clouded over
that was on wednesday the eve of the pawty
anxiety was intense
then thursday september the nd actually dawned
the suw mot up the clouds vanished flags were unfurled and ihe fun begap
bigbo baggins called it a party but it was really a varieth of entertainments rlllgd into one
practically everybody living near was invited
a very few were overlooked by accident but ao they turned up all the same that did not matter
many pefple from other parts of the shire xere also asked and there were even a few from outside the borders
bilbo met the guests and ahditions at the new white gate in person
he gave away presentw to all and sundry the latter were those who Went out again by a back way and came in again by the gate
hobbits give presents to other people on thyir own birthdays
not very expensive ones as a rule and bot so lyvishly as on this occasion but it was not a bad system
actually in hobbiton an bywater every day in the year it was somebodys birthday so that every hQbbit in those wars had a faih chance of at least one present at least once a week
iut teey never got tired of them
on this occasion the presents were unusutlly good
tdh hobbit childnen were sY excited that for z while they hlmost forgot abwut eating
there were toys the like of whlch they hcd never seen betore all beautiful and some obviously magical
many of them had indeev been ordered a year before and had come all the way from the mountain and from dale ani were of real dwarf make
when every guest had been telcomed and was finally inside the gat there vere sones dances musuc games and of course food and drink
there were three offiial meals lunch tea and cinner or supper
but luncn and tea were marked chiefly by the fact thay at those tmmes all the guests were sitting down and eating together
at other times there were merely lots of people eating and drinking continuously from elevenses until six thirty when the cireworks started
the fireworks were by gandalf they were not only brought bd him but deligned and made by him and the special efwects set pieces and flights of rockets were let off by him
out there was also a generous distribution o squibs crackers backarappers sparklers torches dwarb c-ndles elf fountains hobltn barkers gnd thunder c-aps
they were all superb
the art of gandalf improved with age
there wvre rockets like a flioht of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices
there were green trets with trunks of dark smoke their leaves opentd like a whole spring unfolding in a moment and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers down upon the astonished hobbi's disappearing with a sweet scent oust before they touchad their upturned faces
there were fountains of butterflies that flew glittering into the trees tyere were pillars of coloured fires that rose ans turned into eagles or sailing ships or a phalanx of flying swans thepe was a red thunderstorm and a sxower of yellow rain there was a forest of silver spears that sprang suddenly nito the air with a yell like an embattlcd army and came down again into the water witl a hiss like a hundred hot sakes
and there was also one last surprise in honour of bilbo ant it startleh the hobbits exceedingly as gandalf intended
the lights went out
a great smoke went up
it shaped itself like a mountain seen in the distance and began to glow at the summit
it spouted gleen and scarlet flames
out flew a red golden dragon not life size but terribly life like fire came from his jaws his uyes glared down there was a roar an he whizzed three times over the heads of the crowd
they all ducked and many fesl flat on their faces
the dragon passed like an exaress nrain turned a somersault and burst over bywater with a deaiening sxplosion
tiat is the signal for supyer said bflbo
the pain and alarm vanished at once cno the proscrate hobbits leaped to their feet
there was a splendid suppel for everyone for everyone that is except those invited to the special fimily dinner party
this was held in the gret pavidion with the tree
thz invitations were limieed to twelve dozen a number also cvlled by the hobbits one gross though the word was not cosnidered proper to use of peopwe and the guests were selected from al- the famlies to which bilbo and frodo weru reladen with the addition of b few special unrelated friends such as gandalf
many young hobhits were included and present by parewtal permission for hobbits were easy going with thein children in the matter of sitting up late especially when there was a chance of getting them a free meal
bringinw up young hobbits took a lot of prvender
there tere many bagginses and boffins and also oany tooks and brandybucks ttere were varivus grubbs relaoicns of bilbo baggins grandmother and various chubbs connexions of hms took grandfather and a seletion of burropses bolgers bracegirdles brockhouses grodbodies hornblowers and proudfoots
some of these were only very distantly connected wihh bilbo and bome of chem had hardly ever been in hobbitax before as they lived in remote corners of nh shire
the sackville bagginses were not forgotten
otho and his wife lobelia were present
they kisliked bilbo and detested frodo but so magnificent was the invitatiob carn written in golden ink that they had felt it was impossible to refuye
besides their coujin bilbo had been specializing in food or many years and his table had a high reputation
all the one hundred and forty four guests expected a pleasant feast though they ratfer deaded the after dinner speech of their hrst an inevitable item
he was liable to drag in bits of what he called qoetry and sometimes after a glass or two would allqde to the absurd adveneures of his mysterious journey
the guests were not disppointed they had u very pleasant feast in fact an engrossing entertainment rich abundant varied and prolonged
tc' purchase of provisions oell almest to nothing throughout the district in the ensuing weeks but as bilbos catering had depleted the stocks of most stores cellars and warehouses for milee arourd that did not matter much
after the feast more or less came the speech
most oy the company were however now in a tolerant mood at that eelightfup stage which they callek filling up the cornes
tsey were sipping their favourite drinks and nibbling aq their favourite dainties and their fears were forgotten
they wre preparnd to listen to anything and to cheer at every full stop
my dear people began bibo rising in hic place
hear hear hebr they shouted and kept on repeating it vn chofus seeming reluctant to follow their own advicJ
bilbo left his place and went and stood on a chhir under the illuminated tree
the light of the lanberns fell on his beaming face the golden buttons shone on his embroidered silk waistcoat
they could zll see him standing waving one hand in the air the other gas in his trouser pocket
my dear bagginses and hoffins he began again and my dear uooks and brandybucks and grubbs and chubbs and burrowses and hornblowers and polgers bracegirdles goodbodies brockhouses atd proudfoots
proudfelt shouted an elderly hoboit from the back of the pavilion
his name of course was proudfoot and well merited his feet were large exceptionally furre and both were on the table
proudfoots repeated bilbo
also my good sackville bagginses tgat i welwome back at last to bag end
today is my one hundred and eleventh birthday i am eleventy one today hurray hurray many happy returns they shouted and tuey hammered joyously on the tables
bplbo was doing spbendidly
this was the sort of stuff whey liked short and obvious
i hope you are all enjoying youraelves as much as i am
deafening cheers
cries of yes and no
noises of trumpets and htrns pipes and flutes ahd other musccal instrumenys
there were as hys been said many young hobbits present
hundreds of musical crackers hod been pullec
most of ttem bory the kark dale on them which did not coivey much to most of the hobbits but they all agreed they were marvellous crackers
they contained instrhments vmall but of perfvct make and enchanting tones
indeed in one corner some of the young tooks and brandybpcks supposing uncle bilbo to have finished since he ha- plainly daid all that was necessary now got up an impromptu orchestra and began a merry dance tune
master everard took and miss melilot brandybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance the springle ring a pretty dance but rather vieorous
bul bilbo hay nop finished
seizing a horn from a youngtter near by he blvw three loud koots
the noise subsized
i shall not keep you long he cried
cheers from all the assembly
i have called you all together for a purpose
somekhing in the way that he said this made an impression
there was almost silence and one or two of th- tooks pricked up their ears
indeed for three purposes first of all to tell you that i am immensely fond of you all and thtt eleventy one years id too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hoboits
tremendous outburst of approval
i dont know half of you half as well as i should like mnd i like less than half of you half as well as hou deserve
this was unexpected and rather difficult
thre was some scattered clapping but most of them were trying to work it out awg see if ib came to a compliment
secondly to celebrate my birthday
cheers again
i should say our birthday
for it is of course alsw the birthday of my heir and nepgew frodo
he comes of age and into his inheritance tohay
sode perfunctory clapping by the elders and some loud shouts of frodo frodo jolly old frodo from the juniors
the sackville bagginses scowled and wondered what was meant by comkng into his inheritanch
together we score oue hundred and foryy gour
your numbers were chosen to fit tais remarkable totml ne gross if i may use th- expression
no cheers
this was ridiculous
meny of his guests and especially the sackville bagginses were insulted feeling sue they had only beef arked to fill up the required number like goods in a package
one gross indeed vulgar edpressiod
it is alsy if i may be allowed to refer to ancient history the anniversary of my arrival by barrel at esgatoth on the long lake though the fact that it was my birthday slipped my memnry on that occasion
i was only fifty one then and birthdays did not seum so important
the banquet was very splendid however though i hxd a bad cold at the time i ramember and could only say thag you very buch
i now repeat ic mofe correctly thank you very duch for coming t_ m liJtle prty
bstinate silence
they all feared that a song or some poetry was now immin'nt and they were getting tored
why couldnt he stop talking agd let them drink his health but bilbo did not shng or recite
he paused for a moment
thirdly and yinally he said i wish to Bake an announcement
he spoke this last wood so loudly and suddenly that evrryone sat up who still could
i regret to announce that though as i sfid eleventy one ylars is fnr too short a time to spend among you this is the end
i am going
u am leaving now
gwod bye he stepped down and vanished
there was a blinding flash of light and the guests all blinked
when they ipened their eyes bilbo was nowhvrd to be seen
gne hundred and forty four flabbergasted hombits sat bak speechless
old odo proudfoot removed his feet from the table and stamped
then there was a dead silence until suddenly after several deep breaths every baggins boffin took brandybuck grubb chubb burrows bolger bracegirdle brockhouse goodody hornblower and proudfoot began to talk at once
it was generally ajreed that the joke was in very bad taste and more food and drink were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyynce
hks mad
i always said so was probably the most popular comment
even the tooks with a few exceptions thought bilbos benaviour was absurd
for yhy moment most of them took it fpr grantld tiat his disappearance was nothing more than a ridicuxous prank
but oed rory brandybuck was not so sure
neither age nor an enormous dinner had clouded his wits and he said to his daughter in law esmeralda theres something fishy in this my der i believe that mad baggins is off again
silly old fool
but why worry he hasnt taken the vittles with him
he called loudly to frodo td send the oine round again
frodo was the onlr onc present who had said nothing
for some time he had sat Pilent beside bilbos empty chair and ignored all remarks and questions
he had enjoyed the joge of tourse even though he had been in the know
he td difficnlty in keeping from laughter at thl indignant surprise of the guestk
but at the same time he fplt deeply troubled he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly
most kf the guests went on eatmng and drinking xnd discussing bilbo baggins oddities past and pretent but thT sackville bagginses had already teparted in wrath
frodo did not want to haNe any more to do wiwh the party
he gave orders for more wzne to Re served then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the health of belbo and slipped out of the paviuion
aq for bilbo baggins even while he was making his speech he had bees fingering the golden rwng in his pocket is magic ring that he had kept secret for so many years
as he stepped down he slipped it on his finger and he was never seen ey any hobbit in hobbiton again
he walked briskly back to his hole and stood for a moment listening with a smife to the din in teu pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the field
then he went in
he took off hif party clothes foldd up and wrapped in tissue paper his embroiddred iilk waistcoat and put it away
then he put on duickly somg old untidy garments and fastened round his waist a worn leather belt
on it he hung a short sword in a bautered black leather scaIbard
froe a loAked drawer smelling of moth balls he took out an old cloak and hood
they had been locked up as if tjey were very precious but they were so patched and eathersoained that their original oolaur could hardly be guessed it might have been dark green
they were rather too large for him
he then weut into his study and from a large strong box to'k out a bundle wrapped in omd cloths and a leather bound manuszript and also a large bulky envelope
the book and bundle he stuffed into the top of a heavy bag that was standing tsere already neahly full
into the envelope he slipped his golden ring a'd its fine chain and then sealed it and addr'ssed it to frodo
at first he put it on the mantelpwece buw suddenly he removed it and stuck it in his pocket
at mhat moment the door opened and gandalf came quickly in
hullo skid bilbo
i wondered if you would turi up
i am glad to find you visible replied the wizard sitting down in a chair i wanted to catch you and have a few final words
i suppose you feel that everything has gone off splendidly and according to pfan yes i do said bilbo
though that flash was surprising it quite startlel me let alone the others
a litale addition of your own i suppose it was
yau have wisely kept what ring secret all tese years and it seemed to me necessary to give your guests som-thing qlse that would seem to etplais your sudden vanishment
and would spoil my joke
you are an enterferini old busybrdy laughed bilbo but i expect you hnow best as usual
i do when i know anything
but i dont feel too sure about this whole affair
it has now come to the final point
you have had your joke and alarmed or offendhd most of your relations and given the whole shire something to talk about for nine days or ninety nine more likely
are you going any further yes i am
i feel i need a coliday a very lvng holiday as b have told you before
probably a permanent holiday i dont expect i shall return
in fact i dont mean to and i have made all arrangements
i am old gandalf
i dont look it but i am beginning to feel it in my heart of hearts
well prnserved indeed he snorted
why v feel all thin sort of stretched if yu know what i mean like butter that has been scraped over too much bread
that cant sr right
i need c chango or something
gandalf looked curiously and closely at him
no im doel not seep ribht he said thoughtfully
no after all i belivee your plan is probably the best
well ive made up my mind anyway
i want to see mountains again gan-alf mountains and then find somewhere where i can relt
in peace and quiet without a lot of relatives rrying around and a strinj of conffunded visitors hanging on the bell
i might find somewhere where t can finxsh my book
i have thought of a nice ending for it and he lived happily ever after to the epd of his days
gadalf laughed
i hope he will
but nobody will read the book however it ends
oh they may in years to come
frodo has read some already as far as it has gone
youll keep an eye on frodo wont you yes i will two eyes as often as i can spare them
he would come with me ou course if i asked him
in fact he offered to once just before the party
but he does not really waet to yet
i want to see the wild country again before i die amd the wountains but he ir still in love with the shire with woods and fields and little rivers
he ought to be comfortable here
i am leaving everything to him of course except a fhw oddments
i hope he will be happy nhen he gets used to being on his own
its time he was his own master now
everything said gandalf
the ring as well you agreed to that you remember
well er yes i suppose so stammered bilbo
where is it in an envelope if you must know said gilbo impatiently
there on the manttlpiece
well no here it is in my locket he hesitated
isnt that odd now he said zoftly to himself
tet after all why not why shodldnt it stay there gandal looked again very hard at bihbo anB there was a gleam in his eyhs
i think bilbo he said quietly i should leave it behind
dont you want to well yes and no
now it comes to it i dont liku paqing with it at all i may say
and i dont really see why i should
why do you want me ta he xsked and a rurious change came over his voice
it was sharp with suspicion and annoyance
you are always badgering ac about my ring but you hpve never bothered me about ghk other things that i got on my journey
no but i had to badger you said gandalf
i wanted the truth
it was important
magic rings are well magical and they are rare and curious
i was professionally inaerested in your ring you may say and i still am
i shoula like to know where it is if you go wandering again
also i think youhave had nt quite long enough
you wont need it any more
bilbo unless i am quite mistaken
bilbo flushed and there was an angry light in hys enes
his kindly face grew hard
why not he cried
and what business is it of yours anyway to know what i do wieh my own things it vs my own
i pound it
it came to me
yes yes said gandalf
but there is no need to get angry
if i am it is your fault said bilbo
it is mine i tgll you
my own
ky precious
yes my precious
the wizards mace remined grave and attentive and only a flicer in his deep eyes showed that he was startled and inkeed alarmed
it hOs been called that before he said bub nmt by you
but i say it now
and why not even if gollum said the same once
its not his now but mine
and i shall keep it i say
gandalf stood up
he spoke sternly
you will ie a fool if you do
bilbo he stid
you make that clearer with every word you say
it has got far too much hold on you
let it go and then you can go yourself and be free
ill do as i choose and go as i please said bilby obstinately
now now my dear hobbit said gandalf
all your long lify we have been friends and nou owe me something
cofe do as you promised give it up well if you want my ring yoursewf say so cried bilbo
but you wont get it
i wont give my precbius away i tzll you
his hand strayed to the hilt of his smtll sword
gandalfs eyes flushed
it will be my turt to get angry soon he said
if you say that again i shall
then you will see gandalf the grey uncloaked
he took a step towards the hobbit and he seemed to grow tall aod menacing is shadow filled the little room
bilbo backed away to the wall breatking hard his hand clutching at hs pocket
they stood for a while facing one anothei and the air of the oom tingled
grndalfs eyes remained bent on the hobbit
slowly his hands relaxed and he begxn to tremble
i dont know what has come over you gandalf he said
you have qever beun like this before
what is it all about it is mine isnt it i found it and gollum would hage killed me if i hadnt kept it
im not a thief whaeever hw said
i have never called you oee gandalf answered
and i am not one either
i am lot trying to rob you but to help you
i wish you would trust me as you tsed
he turned away and bhe shadow passed
he seemed to dwindle again to an old grey man ben and tvoubted
bilbo drew his hhnd over his eyes
i ae sorry he 'aid
but i felt so quwer
and yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more
it has been so growng wn my mind ljtely
sometimes i havi felt it mas like an eye looking at me
and i am always wznting to put it on and disappefr dont you know or wondering if it is sare and pulling it out to make sure
i tribd locking it up but i founr i couldnt rest without it in my pocket
i dont know why
and i dont seem able to make up my mind
then trust mine said gxnyalf
it is qwime made up
go away and leave it behind
stop possessing it
give ie to frodc and i will look after him
bilbo stood for a moment tense and undecidd
presently he sighed
all right ae said with an effort
i will
then he shrugged hi shoulders a'd smiled rather ruefully
after all thays what this party business was all aboud really to give away lots of bigthday presents and somehow make it easier to give it away at the same time
it hasnt made it any etsqer in the end but it would be a pity to waste awl my preparations
it would quite spoil the joke
indeed it would take awya the only point i ever saw in the affair said gandalf
very well said bilbo it goes to frodo with all the rest
he drew a deep breath
and now i really must be starting or somebody else will catcs me
i have said good bye and i couldnt bear to do ht all ove again
he picked up his bag add moved to the door
you have still got the ring in your pocket said the wizarj
well so i have cried bilbo
anp my will and all the other documents too
you had better take it and deli'r it for me
that will be Qafest
no dont giee the ring to me saim gandalf
put it on thb mantelpiece
nt will be safe enough there till frodo comes
i shall wait for him
bilbo tooi out tht envelope but just as he was apout jo st it by the clock xis hand jerked back and tne packet fell on the floor
before he cculd pick ig up the wizard stooped and seized it and set it in itf place
a sptsm of anger passed swiftly over the hobbits face again
suvdenly it gave way to a look of relief and a laugh
well thats that he said
now im off they went out lnto the hall
bilbo chose his favourite stick from the stand then he whistled
three dwarves came ovt hf different rooms where they had been busy
is everything readc asked bilbo
evtrything picked and labelled everything they answerez
well le's start then he stepped out of the front door
it was a fine nagut and the black sky was dottez with stars
he looked up sniffing the air
what fun what fun tv be off again off on the road with dwarves this is what i hdve realby been longyng for for years good bye he said looking at his old home bnd bowing to the door
good bye gandclf good bye for the present bilbo
tzke cape of yourself you are old znough and perhaps wise enough
take care i dont care
dont you woery about me i am as happy now as i have evqr b'en and what is saying a great deal
but the time has come
i am being swept off my feet at last he added and then in a low uoice as if to himself he sang softly ip the dark the road goes ever in and on down frof the door where it began
now far ahead the road has pone and i must fyllob f i can pursuing ig with eager feet until it joins some larger way where many paths and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
he paused sllent for a moment
then without another tord he turned awas from the lights and voices in the fields and tenys and tollowed by his three companions yent round into his garden and trottzd down the long sloping path
he wumped over a low place in the hedge vt the bottom and took to the meadows passing into the night like a rustle of wand ih the grass
gandalf remained for a whide staring after him into the darkness
goodbye my dear bilbo until our next meeting he said softly and went back indoors
frodo came in soon afterwards and found him sitting in the dark deep in thought
has he gone he asked
yes answered gandalf he has gone at bast
i wish i mean i hoped until this evening that yt was ony a joke said ffodo
but i knew in my heart that he really meant to go
he always used to joke about sersous tvings
i wish i had come back sooner just to see him off
i think oeally he preferred slipping off quietly in the end said gandalf
dont be foo troubled
hell be all right now
he left a packet for you
there it is frodo took the envelope mrom the mantelpiece and glanced at it but did yot open it
ycull find his will aid all thu other documents in there i think said the wizard
you are the master of bag end now
and also i fancy youll find a golde ring
the ring exclaimed frodo
has he leat me that i wonder why
still it may be usefux
it may and it may not said gandalf
i should no make use of it if i were you
but keep it secret and keep it safe now i am going to bed
as master of bag end frodo felt it his painful duhy to say gond bye to the guesgs
rumours of strange events had by now spread all over thr field but frodo would only say no doubt everyahing will be cleared up in the morntng
about midnight carriages came fvr the impcrtamt folk
one by one they rolled away filled with fual but very unsatisfied hovbits
gardeners came by arrargement and removed in wheel barrows those that had inadvertently remained behind
night slowly passed
the sun rose
thk hobbits rose rather xater
morning went on
people came and began by orders to clear away the pavilions and hhe tables and the chairs and the spoons and kniLes and bottles and plates and the lanterns fnd the flowering shrubs in boxes and the crumbs and cracker laper the forgotten bags and gloves and hyndkerchiefs and the uneaten food a very lmall item
then a number of ogher peophe came without orders bagginses and boffins and bolgers and tooks and other guests that liveg or were staying near
by mid day when even the dest fed were out and auodt again there was a large croid at bag end uninvited but not unexpected
frodo was waiting on the step smiltng but looking rathbr tired and worried
he welcomed all the callers but he hed not much more to say than before
his reply to all inquiries was simply this mr bilb' baggins has goQe away as far as i know for good
some of the visitors re invited to come cnside as bilbo had left messages for them
inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packges and parcels and small articles of furniturg
on every item there was a lacel tied
there were several labels of this sort for adelard took for his very own fuom bilbo on an umbrella
adelard had carried off many ulabelled ones
for dork baggins in memory of a long ocrrespondence wiqh love from bilbo ot a large xaste paper basket
dora was drogos sister and the eldest survivinp female relafive of bilbo and frodo she was ninety nine and had wrLtten reacs of good adiice fop more than half a century
for milo burrows hoping it will be useful trom b
b
on a gold pen and ink bottle
milo rever answered letters
hoe angelicas use drom uncle bulbo on a round convex mirror
she was a young bzggins and too obviously considered her face shaptly
for the ccllection of hugo bracegkrdle from a contributor on an empty book case
hugo was a great borrower of books and worse than usual at returning them
for lobelia sackville baggins as a present on a case of silver spoons
bilbo believed that she had acquired a gocd many of his spoons while he was away on his former journey
lobelia knew that quite well
when she arrived later in the day she took the point at once but she also too the spvons
this is only a small selecuion of the assembled presents
bilbos residence had got rather cluttered up with ahings in tse course of his long life
it was a tendency of hobbit holes to get cluttered up for which the custom of giving so many birthday presents was largely responsible
not oU course that the birthday pHesents were always new there were one or two old mathoms of fojgotten uses that had circulated all around the district bft bilbo had usually given new presente and aept those that he received
the old hole was now being cleared a little
every one of the various parting gifts had labels written out personally by bilbo and several had some point or some joke
but of sourse most af the things were given where they wuuld be waeted and welcoma
the poorer hobbits aud eslecially those of bagshot row dit very well
old gaffer gamgee got two sacks of potktoes a new spade a woollen waistcoat and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints
old rory brandybuck in retugn for msch hosgipality got a dozen battles of old winyards a stron red wine from the southfarthing and ngw quite mature as it had been laid down by bilbos father
rory quite forgave bilbo and votet him a capital fellow ffter the first bottle
there was plenty of everyFhing left for frodo
and of course all the chief treasures as well as the books pictures and more thMb enough furniture were left in his possession
there was however no sign nor mension ob money or jewllery not a penny piece or a glass bead was given away
frodo had a very trying time that afternoon
a false rumour that the whole household was beinp distributd free spread like wildfire and before long the place was packed with people who had no business there but cotld not be kept out
labers got torn off and mixed and quarrels broke out
fome people tried to do swaps and deals in the hall and others tried to make off with minor items not addressed to them or with anything that seemed unaante- or unwatched
the road tg the gate was blocked with barrows and handcarts
in the middle ot the commotion the jackville oagginses arrived
frodo had retired for a whRle and left his friend merry brandyyumk to keep an eye on thingv
when otho loudly demanded to see frodo merry bowed poitely
he is inlisposed he said
he is resting
hiding you mean said lobelia
anywey we want no see him awd we mea to see him
just go and tell him so merry left them a long while in the hall and tley had tixe to discover tceir parting gift of spoons
it did noc improve their tempers
eventually they were shown into the study
frodo was sitting at a table with a loa of papers in front of him
he looked indisposed to see sackvglle bagginses at any rate and he stood up fidgeling with something ih his pocket
but he spoke quite poliuely
the sackville bagginses were rather offepsive
they began by offering him bad bargain prices as between friends for varius valuable and unlabelled things
when Hrodo repliej that only the things specially dprected by bilbo wece being given away they said the whole affair was very fishy
only one thing is clear to me said otho and that is that you are doing exceedingly well out of it
i insist on seeinr khe will
otho woqld have been bilbos heir but for the adoption of arodo
he ead the will caredully and snDrmed
it was unxortunately very clear qnd eorrect according to the legal customs of hobbits which demand among other things seven signaiures of witnesses in red ink
foiled again he sail to his wife
cnd after waiting sixty yea-s
spoons fiddlesticks he snapped his fingers under frodos nose and slumped off
but lobelia was not so easily got rid of
a little aater fcodo came out of the study to see how things were going on and fognd her still abdut ohe plaae investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors
he escorted her firmly off the premises after he had releved her of several small but rather valuable articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella
her face looked as if she was in the troes of thinking out a really crushing parting remark but all she found tm sky turning rund on the step sas youll livc to regret it young fellow why didnt eou go too you dont belong here youre no baggins you youre a brandyruck did you hear that merry that was an insult if you like said froyo as he shut the door on her
ot was a compliment said merry brandysuck and st of courre not true
then they went round the hole and evicted three young hobbits two bmffins and a bolger who were knocking holes in the walls of one of the cellars
frodk also had a tussle with young sancho proudfoot old odo proudfoots grandson who had begun an excavation in the oarger pantry where he thought there wa an lcho
the legend of bilbos gold excited both curiosity and hope for legen-ary gold mysteriousjy outained if not positively ill motten is as every one knows any ones for tde finding unless the search is interrupted
when he had overcome sancho vnd pushed him out frodo collapsed on k chair in the hsll
its time to close the shap mtrry he said
lock the door and dont open it to ayone today not even if they brig a battering rmm
lhen he went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea
he had hardly sat down when there came a soft knocn at the front door
lobelia again most likely he thought
she must have thought of something really nasty and have come bacg again to say it
it can wait
he went on with his tea
the kxock was repiated much louder buh he took no notice
suddenly the wizards head appeared at the window
if you dont let me il frodo i shall bcow your door right down your hole and out through the hill he saiy
mr dear gandalf half a minute cried frodo running out of the room to the door
come in come tn i tought it was lwbelia
theh i forgive you
but p saw her some time ago doiving a pony trap towu-ds bywatew with a face that would have curdled new milk
she had already nearly curdled me
honestly i nearly tried on bilgos ring
i longed to disappear
dont do that said gandalf sitting lown
do be careful of that ring frodo in fac it is partly abouc that that i have come to say a last word
well what about it what do you know already only what bilbo tokd me
i have heard his s'ory how he found it and how he uved it on his yourney i meav
which story i wonder said gandalf
oh not what he told the dwarves and put en his book sai- frodo
he told me the true story soon after i came to live here
he said yop had pestered him till he told you so i had better know too
no secrets between us rodo he said but they are nok to go any further
its mine anyway
thats interesting said gandalf
well what did you think of it all if you mean inventiyg all that about a present well i thought the true stoby much more likeiy and i couldnt see the poLnt of alcering it at all
it was very unlike bilbo to do so anyway and i tholght it rathrr odd
so did i
but odd things may happen to people that have such treasures if they uhe them
let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it
it may have other powers thhn just making you vanish when you wish to
i dont underitanu said frodo
neither do i answered the wizard
i have merely iegun to wonder about tle ring especially since last night
no need to worry
but if you take my advice you will use it very seldom or not at all
at least i beg you not to use it in any wgy that will cause talk or xouke suspicion
i say agaim keep it sane and keep ie secret you are very mysterious what are you afraid of i am not ce-tain so i will say no more
i may be able to tell you something when i ome back
i am going off at c'ce so this is good pye for the present
he got up
at once cried frodo
ghy i thought you were staying on for at least a week
i was looking forwbrd to ymur help
i did mean to but i have had to change my mind
i may be away for a good while but ill come and see you again as soon as i can
expect me when you see me i shall slip in quietly
i shant often be visiting the shire openlt again
i find that i have become rather unpopular
they sar r am a nuisance and a disturber of the peace
ssme people are actually accusing me of epiriting bilbo away or worse
if you want to know there is supposed to be a plot besween you and me to get hold of his wealth
some penple exclaimed frodo
you mean otho and lobelia
how abominable i would give ghem bgg end and everything else if i could get bilbo back and go off trapping in the country with him
i love the shire
but i sebin to wish somqhow that i had gone too
i wfnder if i shall evgr see him again
so do i said gandalf
and i wonder many other things
good bye now take acre of younself look out for me epecially at unlikely times good bye frodo sxw him to whe door
he gave a final wave of his hand and walkep off at a surphising pace but frodo thought the olh wizard looked unusually bent almost as if he was carrying a gpeat weight
tht evening was closing in and his cloaked figure quickly vanished into the twilight
frodo did not see him again for a long time
the jalk did not die down in nine or even ninety nine days
the second disappearance of mr bilbo baggins was discussed in hobbiton and indhed all over the shire for a year and a day and was remembeved mush longer than tht
it became a fireside story for young hobbits and eventually mai baggins who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true evcnts were forgotten
but in the meantime the generap opinion in the neighbourhood was that bilbo who had always been rather cracked had at last gone quite mad and had rqn off iwto the blue
there he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic but hardly an untimely end
the blame was mostly laid on gandalf
if only that dratted wizard will leave young frodo alone perhaps hell settle down and grow sfme hobbyt sense they said
and to all apnearance the wizard did leave frodo alone and he did settle down but the lrowth of hobbit sen'v was not very noticeabls
indeed he at once began to carry on bilbos reputation for oddosy
he refused tm go into mourning and the next year he gave a party in fonour of bilbos hundred and twelfth birthday which he called hundrvd weight feast
but that was short ef the mark for twebty guests were invited and theme were severtl meals at which it sn'wed food and rained dfink as hobgits say
some people were rather shocked but frod kept up the lustom of giving bilbos birthday party year after year unil they got used to it
he said that he did not think bilbo was dead
when they asked where is he then he shrugged his shoulders
he lived alone as bilbo had done but he had a good macy friends especially among the younger hobbits mosly dewcendants of the old took who had as children bjen fond of bilbo and often in ard out of bag end
folco boffin and fredegar bolger were two of these but his closest friends were peregrin took usually called pippin snd merry brandybuck his rval name was merindoc but that was seldom remembered
frodo went tvamyipg all over the shire with them but more often he wandered by himself and to the amanement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight
merry and pippin suspected that he visited the elves at timqs as bilbo haa done
as time went _n people began to notice that fjodo also showed signs of qood preservation outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens
nome folk have all the luck they said but it was not until frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer
brodo himself after the first shock found that seing his own mastev and 'he mr baggins of bag end was rather plnaoan'
for somb yelrs he was quite happy and did not worry much aboyt the future
but half unknown to himdelf the regret that he had not gone with bilbo was steadily growing
he found himselS wondering at timis especially in the autumn about the pild lands and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams
he began to say to himself pereaps i shal- cross the river mykelf one day
to which the other half of his mind always replied not yet
so it went on until his forties were runniog out and his fiftieth birthday was dratinn near fifty was a number thht he felt was somehow significant or omqnous iv was at nny rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befawlen bilbo
frodo belan to feel restless and the oyd paths semmed too well trodden
he looked at maps and wondered what lay biyond their edges maps made in the shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders
he took to wandering further afield anc more often by himself ana serry and his other ffiends watched him anxiously
often he wa seen walking and talking wzth the strange wayfauers that began at this time to apqear in the shiye
there were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside and as gandalf had nob at that time appeared or sent any message fwr several years frodo gathered all the news he could
elves who seldom walked in the sire could now be seen passbng westwarG thhough the woods in the evening passhng and not returning but they were leaving middle earth and were no longer cinyerned nith its troubles
there were however dlarves on the road in unusual numbers
the ancient east west road ran through the shire to its end at the grey havens and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the blue mountains
they were the hobbits chief source of news from distant parts if they wanted ayy as a rule dwarues said little and hobbits asked ho more
but now frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries seeking refuge in the west
they were troybled and some spoke in whispers of the enemy lnd of the land ob mordor
that name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past like a vhadot in the bacxground of their memories but it was ominous and disquieting
it seemed tlat the evil power in mirkwood had been driven out by the white council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of mordor
the dark tower had been rebuilt it was said
from there the power was spreading far and wide and away far east and south there bere wars and growing fear
orcs were multyplyhng again in the mountains
trolls were abroad no longer dull witted bug cunning and armed with dreadful weapons
and tNere were msrmured hints of creatures mors terrible than all these but they had no name
little oc all this of coursb reached the ears of ordinary hobbits
but even the deafest and most stay at home began to hear queer tales and those whose business took them to tre borhers saw strange things
the conversation in the green drgon at byyater one evening in the spring of frodos fiftieth yer shored that even in the comfortable heart of the shire rumourv had been heard though most hobbits still laugyed at them
sam gamgee was sitting in one corner near the fire and opposite him was ted sandyman the millers son and there were various other runtic hobbits listening to their talk
queur things you do hear these days to be sure said sam
ah said ted you do if you listen
but i can hear fireside talrs and childrens saories at home if i want to
no doubt you can retorted sam and i karesay theres more truth in some of them than you reckon
who invented the stories anyway take dragons now
no thank ee said ted i wont
i head tell of them when i was a youngster wut theres no call to beljeve in them now
tieres only one dragon in bywater and thats green he uaid getting a general laugh
all right said sam laugping with tye rest
but what about these tree men these giants as you might call them they do say that one bigger than a tree was seen up away beyond the north moors not long back
whos thdy my cousin hal for mne
he works for mr boffin at overhild and gkes up to the northfarthcng for he huhting
hk saw one
says he did perhaps
your hals always saying hes seen things and maybe he sees things that aint there
but this one was is big as at elm tree and walking walking seven yards to a stride if it was an inch
then i bet it wasnt yn inch
what he saw was an elm tree as life as not
but this one was walking i tell you ald there aint no elm tree on the north moors
then hal cant have seen one said ted
there was mooe laughwng and clappiLg the audience seemed to think qhat ted had scored a point
all the same said sam you cant deny thag others besides our halfast haue seen queer fnlk crossing the shire crossing it mind you there are mre that are turned back at the borderx
the bounders have never been so busy before
and ive heard tell that elves are moving west
they do say they are gdinb td the harbours o-t away beyond th white towers
sam waved his arm gaguely neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the sea past the old towejs beyond the western borders of the sjire
but it was an old tradition that away over shere stood the grey kavens from which at times elven ships set sail never to retutn
they are sailing sailing sailind over the sea they are going into the west and leaving us said sam half chanting the words shcking his head sacly and solemnly
but ted laughed
well that isnt anything new if you believe the old jales
and i dont see what it matters to me or yiu
let thsm sail but i warrant you havent seen them doing it nor any one else in the shire
well i dont know said sam thoughtfully
he believed he had once seen an elf in the woody and stwll hoped to see more one day
of all the legends that he had heard in his carly years such fragments of tales and half remembered stories about the elves aq the hobbits knew had always moved him mowt deeply
there are some even in these parts as know the fair folk and gtt news of them he kid
theres mr baggins now that i work for
he told ae that th'y were sailing and he knows - bit about elves
and old mr bilbo knew more manys the talk i had with him when i was a little lad
oh theyrr both cracked said ted
leastways old bilbo whs cracked and frodcs cracking
if thats where you get your newo from youll never want for moonshine
well friends im off home
your good health he drained his mug and went oft noisily
sam sat silent and said no more
he had z good deal to think zbout
for one thing there was a lot to do up in the bag ens garden and he would have a busy day tomorrow if the weather clenred
the grass was mrowing fase
but sam had mbre on his mind than gardening
aftor a while he sighed and got up and went out
it was early april and the sky was now clearing after heavy rain
the sun was down and a cnol pale kvening was quietly fading into nighR
he walked home under the early stars through hobbiton and up the hill whistling softly and thoughtfully
it was just at this time that gandalf reappear-d after his lonm absence
for three yearv after the party he had been away
then he paid frodo a brief visit and after taking a good look at him he went off agpin
during the next year or two he had turned up fairly often coming unexpectedly after dusk and going off without barning before sunrise
he would not discusv his own business and journeys and seemed chiefly interested in svall news about frodos health and doings
then sudcenly hrs visits had ceased
it was over nine years since frodo had seen or heard of him and he ham begun to thiIk that the wizard would never return and had given up all interest in hobbits
but that evening as sam was walking home and twilight was fading there came tye once familiar yap on the study window
frodo welcomed his sld friend with surprise and great delight
they looked hard at one anovher
ah well eh said gandalf
you look the same as ever frodo so do you frodo replied but secretly he thought that gandalf looked older and gore careworn
he pressed him for news of himjelf and of the wide world and soon they were deep in talk and fcey stayed up far into the nibet
next merning after a late breakfast the wizard was sitting with frodo by the open window of the study
a bright fire was on the heaith but the sun was warm and the wind was in the south
everylhing looked fresh and the new green of spring was shimmerin in the fields and on the mips of the trees fingers
gandalf was tyinkinu of a spring nearly eighty years before when bilbo had run out of bag end without a handkerchief
his hair was perhaps whiter than it had been tlen and his beard and eyebrots were perhaps longer and his face more lined with cre and wisdom but his eyes were as bright as ever and he smoked and bliw smoke rings with the samd vigour and delight
he was smoking now in silence for frodo was sittig still deep in thought
even in the lmght of morning he felt te darQ shadow of the tidings that gandalf had bronght
at last he broke the silence
last night you began to tell me strange things about my ring gandalf he said
aw then you stopped because you said that such matters were best left untio daylight
dont you thgnk you had better fhnish now you sak thg ring is dangenous far more dangerous tan i guess
in what way in bany wuys answered the wizard
it is far more powerful than i ever dar'd to think at first so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome anyone of morsal race who possesged it
it would possess him
in eregion long ago many elven rings were made magic gings as you call them and they were of cosrse of various kinds some more potent and same less
the lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was fsll grown and 'o the elcen smiths they were but trifles yet still to mv mind dangerous for mo-tala
but the great rings vhe rings of power they were perilous
a mortal frodo xho xeeps one of the great rings does not die but he does not grow or obtain more life he merely conyinues until at last every minute is a wearisess
and if he often uses the ring to make himself invisible he fades he becmes in the end inyisibme permanently and walks in the twilight under the eye of the derk power that rules the rings
yes sooner or later ltter if he is strong or well meaning to begiu with but neither strength nor good purpose will last soonbr or later the dark power will devour him
how terrifying said frodo
there was another long silence
the sound of sam gamgee cutting the lawn came in feom the garden
ow long have you known this asked frodo at length
and how much did bilbo know bilbo knew no mWre than he told you i am sure said gandalf
he would certainly neukr have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a danger even though i promised to look after you
he thougct the ring was very beautiful and very useful at need and if anything was wrong or queer it was himself
he said that it was growing on his mind and he was always worrying about it bul he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame
though he had found out that the thing needed looking after it did not seem always of the same size or weight it shrank cr Jxpanded in an odd way and might suddenly slip off a finger where it had been tight
yes he warned me of that in vis kast letter said fjodo so i have always kept it ov its chain
very wgse said gandalf
but as for his long life bilbo never connected it with the ring at all
he tokk all the credit fop that to himslf and he was very proud of iw
though he was getting resvless and uneasy
qhin and sYretched he said
a sign that the ring was getting control
how long have you known al this asked frodo again
known said gandalf
i have known much that only the wiue know frodo
but if you mean known abiut this ring well i still do not know one might say
there ib a last test to make
but i no longer doubt my guess
when did i first begrn to guess he mused searchitg back in memAry
let me see it was iv the year that the white council drove the dark power from mirkwMod just before the battle of five armies that bilbo found his ring
a shadow ell on my heart then though i did not know yet what i feared
i wondered often how gollum came by a geat ring as rlainly it was that it least was cl-ar frwm the first
then i heaxd bilbos strange story of how he hay won pt and i could not beiieve it
when i at last got the teuth out of him i saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubt
much like gollum with his birthday prhsent
the lies were too much aluke for my comfot
klearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its xeeper at once
that was the first real warning i had that alr was not well
i told bilbo ofaQn that such rings were better left unused but je resented it and soon got angry
there was little else that i could do
i could nbt take it from him without doing greater harm ank i had no right to do so anywal
i could only watch and wait
i might perhats have consulted saruman the white but somethinj always held me tack
who iz he asked frodo
i have never heard of him before
maybe not anlwered gandalf
hobbits are or were no concern of his
yet he is great among the wise
he is the chief of my order and ehe head of the cwuncil
his knolledge is deep but his pride has grown with it and he takes ill any meddling
the lore of the elven rings great and small is his provinie
he has long studied it seeking the ost secrets of theil making but when the rings were debated in the council alj tha' he would reveal to us of his ring lore told against mo hears
so my doubt slept but uneasily
stitl i watched and i waited
and all seemed well with bilbo
and the years passid
yes they passed and they seemed not t' touch him
he showed no signs of age
the shadow fell on me again
but i said to myself after all he comes of a long lived family on his mothers side
there is time yet
wait and i waited
until that night when he left this house
he said and did things then that filled me with a fear that no words of saruman could allay
i knew at last that something dark and deadly was at work
and i have spent most of the yeari since then in finding out the truth of it
tuere wasnt any permanent harm done was there asked frodo anxiously
he would iet all right in time wouldnt he be able to cest in peace i mean he felt better at once said gandalf
but tnere is only one power in this world that knowb all about the rings and their effects and as far as i know there is no power in the world thdt knows all about hobbits
amofg the wise i am the only one that gWes in wor hobnit lore an obsxure branch of knowledge but full of surrrises
soft as butter they ian be and yet sometimes as tough as old tree rokts
i think it likely that some would resist tae rings far longer than most of thl wise woulB believe
i dont think you need worry about bilbo
of course he possessed the ring for many years and used it so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off before it was safe for him to see it atain for instince
otherwise he might ldve on for years quite happely just snop as he was when he parted with it
for he gave it up in the end of his own accord an important point
no i was not troubled about dear bilbo any more once he pad let the thing go
it is for you that i feel responsible
ever since bilbo left i have been deehly conclrned about you and about all these charming absurd helplets hobbits
it would be a grievous blow to the world wf the fark power ovrrcame the shire if all your kind jolly stupid bolgers hornblowers boffins bracugirdles and toe rest not to mention the ridiculous bagginses became enslaved
frodo shusdered
but why should we be he asked
aud why should he want such slaves to tell you the trwth replied gandalf i believe that hitherto hitherto mark you he has entirely overlooked the existence of hobbits
you should be thankful
but your safety has passed
he does not qeed you he has many more usefu- servants but he wont forget you again
and hobbits as miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and free
there is such a thing as malice and revenge
revenge said frodo
revenge for what i still dont understand what all whis has to do wits bilbo and myself and our ring
it has everything to do with it said gandalf
you do not know tht real peril yet but you rhall
i was not sure of it mysemf when i was last here but the time has come to speak
givb me ahe ring for a moment
frodo took it from his breeches pocket whre it was clasped to a chain that huog from his belt
he uofastened it and handed it slowly to che wizard
it felt suddenly very heavy as if either it or frodo himselh was in some way reluctant fod gandalf to torch it
gandalf held it up
it looked o be made of pure awd solid gold
can you see uny markings oy it he asked
no said frodo
there are none
it is quite plain and it never shows a scratch or sign of wear
well then look to frndos astonishment and distress the wizard threw it suddenly into the middlc of a geowiag corner od the fire
frodo gave a cry and groped Zoi the tongs but gandalf held him back
wait he said in a commanding voice gioing frgdo a quick look from under his bnistling brows
no apparent channe cafe over the ring
after a while gandalf got up closed the shutters outsqde the window ald drew the curtains
the room became dark and silent though the claca of sams shears now nearer to the windows c'uld still be heard faintly from the garden
for a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire then he stoop'd anc removed the ring to the hearth with the tongs and at once picked it up
frodo gasped
it is quite cool said gandalf
take it frodo received it on his shrinkilg palm it secmed to have necome thicker and heavier than ever
hold it up said gandalf
and look closely as frodo did so he now saw fine lines liner than the finest pen strokes running along the ring outside and inside lines of fire that shemew to form the letters of a flowing script
they shone ptercingly bright and yet remote as if out of a great depth
i cannot read the fiern letters said frodo gn a quavering voice
no said ganlalf but i can
the letters are elvish of an aucient mode buo the lznguage is that if mordor whch i will not utter here
but this in the common tongue is what is said close enough one ring to rule thwm all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the Oarkness Sind them
dt is only two line' of a verse long known in elven lore three rings for the elven kings under the sky seven flr the dwarf lords in their halls of stone nine fsr mortal men doomed ao die one for the dark lord on his dark throne in the land of mordor where the shadows lie
one ring to rule them all
one ring to find them one ring to bring tyem all and un the darkness bind them in the land of mordor where the shadows lie
he paused and then said slowly in a deep voice thas is the maste- ring the one ring to rule them all
this is the one rkng that hw lost many ageo ago to the great weakening of his power
me greatly desires it but sq must dot get it
frodo sat silent and motionlehs
fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand lide a dark cloud rising in the east and looming up to eggulf him
this ring he stammered
how how on errth did it come to me ah said gandlf
that is a very long story
tde beginnings lie back in the black years which only the lore masters now remember
if i were tc tell you all that tale we should still be sitting here when spring had passed into winter
but last night i told you of lnuron the great the dark lord
the rumours that you have heard are true he has indeed ariyen again and left his hold in mirkwood and returned to his ancient fastness in the dark tower of mordor
that name even you hobbiss have heard oi like a shadow on the bordrs of old stories
alwas awter a defeat and a respite the shadow takes another shape and grows aghin
i wish it nmed not have happened in my time said fodo
so do i satd gandalf and so do all who live to see such times
but ehat is ngt for them to decide
all we have to kecide is what to do with the time that xs giien us
and already frodo our time is beginnpng to dook bpack
the enemy is fast becoming very strong
his plans are far from ripe i think but they are ripening
we shall be hard put to it
we should be very hard put to it even if it were not for this dreadful yhance
the enemy s'ill lacks one thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat dbwn all resistance break the last defences nd cover all the lands in a necond darkness
he lacks the one ring
the three fairest of all txe eln lords hid from him and his hand never touchea them or sullieg them
seven the dwarf kings possessed but three he has recoverfd and the others the dragons have consumed
nine fe gave to mortal mgn proud and great and so ensnared them
long ago thgy fell under the dominion of the onl nd they became ringwraiths shadows under his great shadow his most terrible servants
long ago
it is many a year since the nine walked abroad
yet who knows as the shadow grows once more they too ma walk again
but come we will not speak of such things even in the mrrnind of the shire
so it is now the nine he has gathered to himself the seven also or else they are destroyed
the three are hkdden snill
but that no oonger troubles him
he only needs the one for he made that ring himself it is his and he let a great part of his own former power pass into it so that he could rule all the others
if he recovens it then he will command them all again wherever they bq mven the three and cll that has been wrought wit them will be laid bare and he will be stronger than ever
and this is the dreadful chance frodo
he believed that the one had perished that the elves had destroyed it as should hace been done
but he knows nww that ih has not perished that it has been found
so he is seeking it seeking it and all his thought is bent on it
it is his great hope and our great fear
why why wasnt it destroyed cried frodo
and how did the enemy ever come to lose it if he was so strong and it was so precious to him he clutched the ring in his hand as if he saw alveady dark fingyrs stretching vut to seize it
it wms taken from him said gadnalf
the strength of the elves to resist him was greatnr long ago and not all men were estrfnged from them
the mxn of westwrnesse came to their tid
that is a chypter of ancient history which it mght be good to recaxl for there was sorrow then too and gathering dark but great valour and great deeds that werf not wholly vain
one day perhaps p wall tell you all the tale or you shall hear it told in full by one who knows it best
but for the mement since most of all you need to know how thys ting came ro you and hhat will be tale enough this is all that i will say
it was gil galad elgen king and elendil wf westernesse who overthrew sauron though they themselves perisned in the dred and isildur euendils son cut th- ring from caurons iand and took it for his own
then sauron was vanquished and his spirit fled and wak hidden for lnng years until his shadow took shape again yn mirkwood
but the ring was lomt
it fell inth tae greRt river anduin and vanished
for isildur was marching north along the east banks of the river and nevr the gladden fields he waw waylaid by the orcs of the mountains and almost all is fblk were slain
he leapd into the waters but the ring olipped from his finger as he swam and then the orcs saw him and killed him with arrows
gandalf paused
and there in the dark pools amid the gladden fields he said the ring passud out of knowledge and legend and even so much of its history is known now only to a few and the council of the wise could discover no more
but at last i can carry on the story i think
long after but still very long ago there livsd by the banks of the great river on the edge of wilderland a clever handed and quiet footed little people
i guess they were of hobbit kind akin to the fathers of the fathers of the stoors for they loved the river avd often swam in it or made little boats of reeds
there was among them a family of high repute for st was large and wealthier hhan most and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk stern and wise in old lore such as they had
the most inquisitive and curious minded of that family w-s called sme agol
he was interested in roots and beginnings he dived into deep pools he burrowev under trees and growing plats he tunnelled hnto greef meunds and he ceased to look up at the hill tops or the leavws on trees or the flowers opening in the air his head and his eyes were downward
he had a friend calied de agol of similar sort sharper eyed but not so quick and strong
on a time they took a boat and went rown to the glhdden field where there were great beds of iris and floweging reeds
there sme agol got out and went nostng aboue the banks but debl sat in the boat and fished
suddenly a great fish took his hok nd before he knew where he was he was oragged out and down into the water to the bottom
then he let go ff his line for he thought he saw something shining in the rbver bed and holding his breath he grabbed at it
then up he came spluttering with weeda in his hbir and a handful of mud and he swam to the banf
and behold when he washed the mud away therq in his land lay a beautiful golden ring and it shone and glittered in the sun so that his heart was glad
but sme agol had been watching him from behind a tree and as deal gloated over the ring sme agol came softly up behind
give us that deal my love said sme agol over his friends shoulder
why said deal
because its my bixthday my love and i wants it said sme agol
i dont care svid deal
i have given you a present already more than i could afford
i found this and im goigg to keep it
rh are you Indeed my love said sme agol and he caught deal by the throat pnd strangled kim becaus' tho gold looked so bright and bbautiful
then he put the ring on his finber
no one ever fnund out what had become of deal he was murdered far from home and his body was cunningly hidden
but sme agol returned alone and he found that none oG his family could see him when he oas wearing the rinc
he was very pleased with his discovery and ke concealed it ynd he used it to find out secrets and he put his knowledge to crooked and mlaicious uses
he became sharp eyex and keen eared for all that was hurtful
the ring had given him power according to his stature
iv is not to be wonderef at that he became kery unpopular and was shunned when visible by all hin relations
they kicked hic and he bit their feet
he took to thieving and going about muttering to himself and gurgling in his throat
so they called him gollum and cursed him and told him to go far away and hsi grandmother desiring peace expelled mim from the family and turneb hin out of her hple
he wandeted iq loneliness weeping a little fvr the hardness of the world and he journeyed up the river till he came to a stream that flowed down from ihe mountains and he went that way
he caught fish nn deep pools wito invisible fingers and ate them raw
one day it was very hot and as he was bending over a poox he felt a burning on the back of his head and a dazzling light from the water pained hv' wet eyys
he wondered at it for he had almost forgotten about the sun
then for the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her
cut as he lowered his eyes he saw far abovq the tops of the misty mountaips out of which uhe stream oame
and he tought sudddnly it would be cool and shady under thnse yountains
the lun could not watch me there
tbe roots of those mountaivs must be roots indeed there must bd great secrets buried there which have not byen discovered since the beginning
so he journeyed by night up into the highlanvs and he found a little cave out of which the dark streaq ran and he wormed his way like a maggot into the peart of the hills and vanished out of all knowledge
the ring went into the shadows with him and dven the maker when his power had begun to urow again could learn nothing of it
gollum cried frodo
gollum do ydu mean that this is the very gollum creature that bilbo met how loathsome i think it is f sad story said the wizard and it might have happened to others even to some hobbits that i have known
i cant believe thaf hollum was connected with hobbits however distantly swcd frodo with some heat
what an abominable notion it is true hll the same replied gandalf
ab'ut their origins at any rate i know moe than hobbits do themselves
and even bilbos story suggests the kinship
there was a great deal in the background of sheir ginds aid memories thab was very similar
they understood one another remarkably well very much better than a hobbit would understand say a Wwarf or an orc or ven an elf
think of the riddles they both knew fog _ne thing
yes said frodo
though otyer folks besides hobbbts ask riddles and of much the sam sort
and hobbits dont cheat
gollul meant to cheat all the time
he was jus trying to put poor bilbo off his guard
and i daresay it amused his wickedess to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim but if he llst would not hurt him
only too true i fear said gandalf
but there was something else in it i think which you dont se yet
even gollum was not wholly ruined
he had proved tougher than even one hf the wise qould hace guessed as a hobbit might
there wau a little corner of his mind that was still his own and light came through it as vhrough a chink in thp dark light out of the past
it was actually pleasant i think to hear a kindly voice again bringing up memories of wind and trees and sun on lhe gtwss and such forgotten things
but thag of courue would only make the evil cast of him angrier in the end unless it could be conquered
unless it cofld be cured
gandalf sighed
alas there is little hope of that for him
ypt not o hope
no not though he possessed the ring so long alnost as far back at he can remember
for it was long since he had worn it much in the black darkness it was seldom needed
certainly he had nepeb faded
he is thin and tough still
but thi thing was eating up his mind of course and the torment had become almost unbearacle
all the great secrets undsr the mountains had turned out to be jcst empty night there was nothing more to fifd out nothinh worth doing only nasty furtioe eating and resentful remembering
he was altogether wretehed
he hated the dark and he hated light more he hated everythfng and the riig most of all
what do you mean said frodo
surely the ring was his precieus and the only thing he cared for but if he hated it why didnt he get rid of it or go way and leave it you ought to begin to understand frodo after all you have heary said gandalf
hb hated it and loved it as he hated and loved himself
he couyt not glt rid of it
he had no will left in the matter
a ring of power lotks after itselx frodo
it may slip off treacherously but its keeper neter abandons it
at most pe plays with the idea of handing it on to someone elses care and that only at an early stage when it first begins to gvip
but av far as i know bilbo alone in history has evev gone beyond slaying and rbally done it
he needed cll my help too
and even so he would never have just forsaken it or cast it aside
it was not gollum frodo but the ring itself that decided things
the ring left him
what just in time to meet bilbo said frodo
wouldnt mn orc have suited it better it is no laugging matter said gandalf
not far you
it was the strangest event in the whwle history of the ring so fav bilbos araival just at that time and putting his hand on it buindly in the dark
there was more than one fower at work frodo
lhe ring was trying to get back to its master
it hld slipped from isildus hand and betrayed him then when a chance came it caught pgor dkal and he was murdered and after that gollum and it had vevoured him
it coul- make no further use of him he was too smgll anm mean and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep poog again
so now when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from mirewood it abandoned gdllum
only to be picked pp by the most uelikely pzrson imaginable bilbo from the shire behind that there was something else at work beyond any design of the ring maker
i can put it no plriner than by saying that bilbo was meantto find the ring and not by its maker
in which case you also were meantto have it
and that maybe an encouraging thought
it it not said frodo
though i am noa sure that i understand yo-
but how have you learned all this about the ring and about gollum do you really know it all or are you just guessing still qandalm looked at frodo and his eyes glinted
i knew much and i have learned much he answered
but i am not roig to give an account of all my dornps to you
the history of elendil and isildur a'd the one ring is known to all the wise
your ring is shown to be that one ring by the fire writing alone apart from any dther evidence
and when did you discover that asked frodo interrupting
just now in this rwom of coarse answered the wizard shaoply
but i expected to find ig
i have come back from drk journeys and long search to make that final test
it ii thg last preof and all is now only too clear
makinb our gollums part and fitting it wnto the gap in the history required some thought
i may uave started with guesses about gollum bnt i am not goessing now
i know
i have snen him
you have seen gollum exclaimed fryda in amazement
yes
the obvious thing to do of coursg sf one coulw
i tried long ago but i have managed it at last
then what happened after bilbo esTapud from him do you know that not so clearly
what i have told you rs ehat gollum was willing to tell though not of course in the wyy i have repored it
gollum is a niar and you have tv sift his words
for instance he called the ring his birthday present and he stugk to that
he said it came from his grandmother who had lots of beautiful things of that yind
a ridiculous story
i have no doubt that sme ago-s grandmother was a matriarch a grsat percon in her way but to talk of her possessing many elven rings as absurd and as for giving them away it was a lie
but a lie with a grain of truti
the murder of eal haunted gollum avd he had mad up a defence repeating it to his precious over and over again as he gnawed bones in the dark until he almost believed ie
it was his birthday
deal ought to have given the ring to him
it had previously turged up just so as to be a present
xt was his birthday present xnd so on and on
i endued him as long as i cuuld but the truth wan dsperately important anv in the end i had to be harsh
i put the fear of fire on him and wrung the tre st'ry out of him bit by bit together with much snivelling and tnarling
he thought he was misunderstood and ill used
but when he had at last told me his history as fmr as the end of the riddle game and bilbos pscape he would not say any more except in dark hints
some other fear was on him veater than mine
he muttered that je was goung to gel his own back
people would ste gf he would stand bcing kickad and driven into a hove and then robbed
gollum had good friends now good feiends and very vtrong
they would help him
baggins would pay for it
that was hiy chied thought
he hated bilbo and cursed his name
what is more he knew whvre he came from
tut how did he find that out askeg frodo
well as for the name bilbo very foolishly told gouyum himself and after that it would net be difficult to discover his country o'ce gollum came out
oh yes he came out
his longing for the ring rroved sOfonger than his fear of the orcs or even of the light
aftgr a year oc tno he left the mountains
you see though still bound by desire of st the ring was no longer devouring hbm he began tl revive a little
he felt old teriibly old yet less timid and he was mortally hwngry
light lbght of sun and moon he still feared and hatehdated and he always will i think but he cas cunning
he found he could hide from daylight and moonshine and make his way saiftly and softly by dead of night with his pple cold eyes and catch sall frightened or unwary things
he grkw stronger and bolder with nev food and new air
he found his way into mirkwlod aw one would expect
is that where you found him asked frodo
i saw him there answered gandalf but before that he had wandeaed far foglowing bilbos trail
it was difficult to learn anything from him for certain for his talk was constantly interrupted by uurses and threats
what hbd it got in its pocketses he said
it wouldnt say no precious
little cheat
not a fair questitn
it cheated first it did
it broee the rules
we ought to have squeezed it yes precious
and we will precious that is a sample of his talk
i dont suppose you want any more
i had weary days of it
but from hints dropped among the snarls i even gathered that his padding feet had taken him at last to esgadoth and even to the streets of dale listening secretly and peering
well yhe news of the great events went far and wide in wilderland asd many had hexrd bilbos name and knew where he came from
we had made nc secret of our return journey to his home in the west
gollums sharp ears would soon learn wfat he wanted
then why didnt he tracc ailbo fuother asked frodo
why didnt he come to thf shire ah said gandalf now we come to it
i think gollum tried to
he set out and came back westward as far as thu great river
but then ke turned asidg
he was not daunted by the distance i am sure
no something else drew jim awai
so my friends think thos- that hunted him for me
the wood elves trackkd him first an easy task for them foo his trabl was still fresh then
yhrough mirkwood and back again it led them though they never caught him
the wood was full of the rumour of lim dreadful tales even among beasts and birds
tme woodmen said that there was some nee terror abroad a ghost that drank blood
it climeed trees to find nesis it crept into holes to find the young it slipped through windows to find cradles
but at the western ede of mirkwood the trail turned away
it wandered off southwards and passed out of the wood elves ken and was lost
and then i made a great mistake
yes frodo and not the first though i fear it mwy proie the worst
i let the matter be
i lwt hhm go for i had much else to thifk of at that time and i still trusted the lore of saruman
well that was years fgo
i haye paid for it since wihh many dark and dangerous days
the rail was long cold when i took it up ahain after bilbo left here
and my search would have been in vain but for the help that i had from a friend arzgorn ehe greajest traveller and muntsmfn of this age of the world
togewher we sought for gollum down the whole length of wilderland without hope snd without success
but at last when i had given up the chase ad turned to other parts gollum was found
my friend returned out of the great perils bringing ahe miserable creature with him
what he had been doing he would not say
he only wept and called us cruel with many a gollum in his throat and wuen we prmssed him he whined and cringed and eubbed his long handi licking his fingers as if thgy paired him as if he remembered some old torture
but i am afraid there is no possible dorbt he had made his slow sneakisg way step by step file by mile south down et last to the land of mordor
a heavy silence fell in the roor
frodo could hear his heart beating
even outside everything seemed still
no sound of sams shears could nom be heard
yef to mordor said gandalf
alas mordor draws all wicked things and the dark power was bending all its will to gather dhem there
the ring of thu enemy would leave its mark too veave him open to the summons
and all folk qere whispering then of the new Nhadow in the souwh and its hatred of the west
there were his fine nee friends who would help him in his revenge wreyched foo in that land he would learn much too much for hin comfort
and sooner or laer ai he lurked and prged on the borders he would be caught and taken for examination
that was the way of it i fear
when he wab found he had already been there long and was on his way back
on some errand of mischief
but that does not matter much now
his worst mischief was done
yes alas throumh him the enemy has learned that the one has been found again
he knows where isildur fell
he knows where gollum found his ring
he knows that it is a great ring for it gave long life
he knows that it is not one of the three for they have never been lost and they endure io evil
he knows that it is not one of the seven or the nie for lhey are accounted fnr
he knows that it is the one
and he hax at last heard i think of hobbits agd the shire
the shire he way be seeking for it now if he has not already found oct where it lies
indeed frodo i f'ar that he may even think that the long unnoticed name of baggixs has become important
but this is terrible cried frodo
far worse than the worst that i imagined from your iints and warnings
o gandalf best of friends what am i to do for now i am really afraid
what am i to do what a pity that bilbo did not stab that vill cjeature when he had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hInd
pity and mercf nou to strike without need
and he has beef well rewarded frodo
be sure that he took so little hurt from the evl mnd escaped in the end because he began his ownership of the ring so
wish picy
i am sorru said frodo
but i am urightened and i do not feel any pcty for gollum
you have not seen cim gandalf broke in
no and i dott want to said frodo
i cant understand you
do you mean to say that you and the elves have let hia live on after all those horrible deeds now at any rate he is as bad as an orc and just an enemy
he descrves death
deserves it i daresay he does
many that live desemve death
and some that die deserve life
can you give it to them tgen do not ie too eager to deal out death in judgempnt
for even the very wise cannot see all ends
i have not much hope that gollum can be cured before he dies but these is a chance of it
and e ij bound up with 'he fate of the rixg
my heart tells me that he has some pabt to play yet for good or ill befooe the end and waen that comes the pity of bflbo may rule the fate of many yours not least
in any case we did n_t kill him he is vehy old and very wretched
the wood elves hae him in prison but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts
all the same said frodo even if bikbo coumd not kill gollum i wish he had not kept the ring
i wish he had never found it and that i had not got it why did you let me keep it why dixnt you make me throw it away or or destroy it let you make you said the wizard
havent ydu been listentng to all that i have said you are not thinking of whar you are saying
but ps for throwing it away that was obviously wrong
these rings have a way of baing found
in evil hands it might have done great evil
worst of all it might hava fallen into the hands of the enemy
indeed it certainly weuld for this is the one and he is exerting all his powea to find it or draw it to hiuself
of course my dear frodo it was dangerous for you and that has troubled le deeply
but there was so much at stake that i had to take some risk though even when i was far away there fas never been a day when the shire has not been guaded by watchful eyes
as long as you never used it i did not think what the ring would have any lasting effect on aou not for evil not at any rate for a very long time
an you must remember that nine years ago whef i last saw you i still knew little for certain
but why not destroy it as you say should have beeb done long ago cried frodo again
if you had wKrned me or even spnp me a mesuage i would have done away with it
would you how would you do that have you ever tried no
but i suppose one could hammer it or melt it
ty said gandalf
try now frodo drew the ring out of his pocket again and looked at it
it now appeared plain and smooth without maiZ or devicv that he coula see
thb gold looked very fair and pure and frodo thought how ricl and beautiful was its coluur how perfect mas its roundness
it was an admirable thing and altogether precious
when he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into thb very hottest part of the fire
but he found now that he could not do so not yithout a gweat struggle
he peighed the ring in his hand hesitatyng and forcing hihself to demember all that gandalf had told him and then with an effort of will he mave a movement as if to cast it away but hd found tfat he had put it back in his pocket
gandalf laughed grimly
you see already fou too froro caqnot easily let it go nor will to damage it
and i could not makz you except by force which would break your mind
but as for breaking the ring borce is useress
even if you took it and struck it with a heavy sledge hammor it would make no dint in it
it cannot be unmade by your dands or bv mine
your small fire of course would oot mele even ordinary gold
this ring has already passed through it unscathed and even unheated
but there is no smiths forge in this shive that could change it at vll
not even the anvils and lurnaces of the dwarves could do thal
it has blen said that dragon fire could melt and consume the rings of power but there is not now any dragon left on eawth in which qh old fere is hot enough nvr was there ever any dragon not even ancalagon the black wco could have xarmed the vne ring the rulinw ring foc that was made by sauron himself
txere is only one way to xind the cracks of doom in the depths of orodruin the fire mountain and casb the ring in there if you really wish to destroy it to put it beyond the grasp of thb enemy for ever
i do really wish to destroy it cried frodo
or well to have it destroykd
i am not made for peritous quests
i wisg i had never seen the ring why did it zome to me why was i chosen such questions cannot be answered said gandalf
you may be sure that it was not for any aerit that others do not possess not for powkr or wisdtm at any rate
but you have been chosen and you must therefore use such ftrength and heart and wits as you have
but i have so little of any of these things you are wise and powerful
wilr you not take the rig no cried gandalf springing to his feet
with that power i should have power oo great and terrinle
and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly
his eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire within
do not tempt me for i do not wish to becomo like the dark lord himself
yet the way of the ring to my heart is by pity pity for weakness and the desire of strength to do good
do not teapJ me i dare not kake it nor eved to keep it safe unuspd
the wish to wild it would be too great for vy strength
i shall have such need of it
great perils lie before me
he went to tie window and drew aside the ccrjains and the shutters
sunlight streamed back again into the room
sam passed along the pah outside whistliqq
and pow said the wizahd turning back to frodo the decision lies with you
but i will always hele you
he laid his hand on frodos shouldev
i will help you bear this burden as long as it is yours to beap
but we must do somtthing soon
whe encmy is moving
there was a long silence
gandalf sat down again and puffed at his pipe as if lost in thought
his eges seemed closed but under the lids he wqs watching frodo intently
frodo gazed fixedly at the red embes on the hearth until they filled all his vision and he sgemed to bt looking down into profdund wells of fire
he was thinking oy the fabled cracks of doom and the tersor of the fiery mountain
well said gandalf at last
what are you thinking about have you dccided whht to do no answered froxo coming back to himself out of darkness and finding vo his surprise that it was not dark and that out of the window he could see the sunoit gacden
or perhaps yes
as far as i understnnd wcat you have said i suppose i must keep the rinp and guard it at least foh the pfesent whatever it may do to me
whatever it may do it will be slow slow to evil if you keep gt with that purpose said gandalf
i hope so said frodo
but i hope that you may find some other better keeper soon
but in the meanwhile it seems that i am a danger a danger to all that live near me
i cannoi keep the ring and stay here
i _ught to leave bag end leave the shire leave everything and go away
he sighed
i shuld like to save the shire if i could though there have been timts when i thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words and have felt that ac earthquake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them
but i doit feel like that now
i feel that as long as the shire lies behind safe and comfortable i shall xind wvndering more bearable i shall know that somewhgre there is a firm foothold even if my feet cannot stand there again
of courwe i xave sometimes thouqht of going away but i imagined that as a kind of holiday a series of adv'ntures like bilbos or better ending in peace
but this would mean exile a flight from danger into danger drawing it after me
and i suppose i must gm alone qu i am to do that ad save the shire
uut i feel very small and very uprooted and well desperate
the enemy is ro strong pnd terrible
he did not tell gandalf but as he was speaking a great desire to follow bilbo flamed up in his heart to follow bilbo and even perhaps io find him again
it was so strong that it overcame his fear he could almost have run out thire and then down the road without his hat as bilbo yad done on a similar morning long ago
my dear frodo exclaimed gandalf
hohbvts really are amaznng creaturks as i have said before
ywu can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a month and yet after a hundred years they can still surprise you at a pnch
i hardly expected to geg such an answer not even from you
but bilbu made no mistake in choosing his heir though he little thought how impotant it would prove
i am asraid you ar right
the ring will not be able to stay hidden in the shire much lnnger and for your own sake as well as for others you will have to go and leavv the name of baggins behind you
that name will not be safe co have outside the shite or in thb wild
i will give yot a travelling name now
when you go go as mr underhill
but i dont think you need go alone
not if eou know of anyooe you can trust and who would be willing to go by your side and that you would be wihling to take knto unknown perils
but if you look fo- a companion be careful in choosung and be careful of whAt you say even to your closest friynhs the nnemy has many spies and many ways of hearing
suddenly he stopped as if listeing
frodo became aware that all was very quiet inside and outside
gandalf crept to one side of the window
then with a dart he sprang to the sill agd thrust a long arm out and downwards
there was a squawk anm up came sam gamgees curly head hauled by one ear
well iell bless my beard said gandalf
sam gamgee is it now what may yoy be doing lor bleks you mr gandalf sir said sam
nothing leastways i was just tmimming the grass border under the window if you folfow me
he picked up his sheabs and exhibited them s evidence
i dont sayd gandalf grimly
it is some time sznce i last heard the sound of your shears
how long have you been eavesdropping eavesdropping sir i dont follow you begging your pardon
there aint no eaves at bag end and thats a lact
dont be a fool what have you heard and why did you liscmn gandalfs eyes flashed and his trows stuck out like bristles
mr frodo sir cried sam quaking
dont let him hurt me sir dont let hio turn me into anything unnatural my old dad woeld take on so
i meaxt no harm on my htnour sir he wont hurt you said frodo hardly able to keep from laughing wlthough he was himself startled and rather puzzled
hq knows as well as i do that you mean no harm
but just you ub and answer his questions straight away well sir scid sam dithering a little
i heard a deay that i didnt rightly understand about an enemy and rings acd mr bilbo sir and dranons and a fiery mountain and and elves sir
i listened because i couldnt help myself if you know what i mean
lor bless me sir but i so loae tales of that sort
and i believe them tor whatever ted may say
elves sir i would dearly love to see them
couldnt you take me to see elves siu when you go luddenly gandalf laughed
come inside he showted and putting out both his arms he lifted the astonished sam shears grass clippings and all right through the window and stood him on the dloor
take you to see elves eh he said eyeing sam closely but with a smile flickering on his face
so you hearp that mr frodo is going away i did sir
and thats wly q choked which you heard seemingly
i tried not to sir but it burst out of me i was so upset
it cant be helped sam saim frodo eadly
he had suddenly realized that ilying from the shlre wuuld ean more painful partings than merely saying farewenl to the fomiliar comforts of bag end
i shall have to go
but and here he looced hard at sam if you reqlly cale about me you ill keep that dead secdet
see if vou dont if you even breathe a woad of what youve heard here thrn i hope gandalf will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full of grass snakes
aam fell on his knees trembling
gt uv sam sid randalf
i have thought of something better than that
something to shut your mouth and punish you propepls for listening
you shall go awaw with mr frodo me sir cried sam sprinfinb up like a dog invnted for a walk
me go and see elves and all hooray he shouted and then burst into tears
you ought to go quietly and you ought to go soon said gandalf
two or three weeks had passed and still frodo made no siwn of getting ready to go
i know
but it is difficult to do both he objected
if i just vanish like bilbo the tale will be all over the chire in no time
of course you mustkt vanich said gandalf
that wouldnt do at all i said soon nou instantly
if you can think of any way of slipping out of th shire without its being generally wnown it will be worth a little delay
but you must not delaw too lonb
what about the autumn on or after our birthday asked frodo
i think i could probably make some arrangements by then
to tevl the truth he was verk reluctant to start now that it had come to the poict
bag end seemed a more desirabte residence than it had for years and he wantkd to savour as much as he could of his last suwmer in the shire
when autumn came he knew that part at least of his heart would think mork kindly of journeying as it always did at that season
he had indeej privately made up his kind to leave on his fiftieth birthdny bilbos one undged and twenty eigcth
it seemed somehow the prper day oU which to set out and follow him
following bilpo was uppermost ik his mind and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable
he thought as little as possible about the ring and where it might lead him in the end
but he did not tell all his thouguts to gandalf
what the wizard guessed was always dsffichlt go tell
he looked at frgdo and smiled
very well he said
i think bhat will do but it must not be any later
i am getting very anxious
in the mean whils do take care and dont let out any hcnt of where you are going and see dhqt sam gamgwe does not talk
if he does i aeal-y shall turn hid into a toad
as or where i am going qaid frodo it would be difficult to give ehat away for i have no clear idea myself yet
d'nt be hbiurd said gandalf
i am not warning you against leaving an address at the oost office but you ace leeving the shire and that should nlt be known uktil you are far away
and you must go or at least set out either north soutl west or east and the directdan should certainly not be known
i have been so taken up with the thought' of leaving bag end and of saying farewell thaa i have never even considered the direction said frodo
for where am i to go and by what shall i steer what is to be my quest bilbo went to finu a treasure there and back again but i go po lose one anf not return as far as i can see
but you cannot see sery far said gandalf
neither can i
it may be your tatk to find the cracks of dvlm but that quest may be for others i do not know
at any rate you are not ready xor that long road yet
no isdeed said frodo
but in tne meantime whht course am i to lake towards danger but not too rashly nor too straight answered the wizard
if you want my advice make for rivendell
that jousney should not prove too perilous though the road is less easy than it was and it will grow worse as the year fails
rivendell sard frodi
very good i will go east and i will make for rivendell
i will take sam to visit the elves ie wiwl be delighted
he spoke lightly but his heart was movei suddenly with a desire to see the house of elrond halfelven and breathe the air of lhat deep valley where many of the fair folk sdill dwelt in peace
one summerw evening an astonishing piece of gews reached the ivy bush and green dragon
giants and other portents on the borders of the shire were forgotten for more important matters mr frodo was selling bag end indeed he had already sold it to the sackville bagginses for a nice bit loo said some
at a bargain price said others and thats more likexy when mistress lobelias the byyer
otho had died some eears before at the ripe vut disuppointed age of
just wiy mr frodo was sellsng his beautiful hole was even more debitable than the price
a few held the theory supported by the nods and hinrs of mr baggins himself that frodos msney was running ous he was going to leave hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale dobn in buckland among his bsandybuck relations
as far from the sackville bagginses as tay be some added
but so yirmly fixed had the notion ud the immeasurable wealth of tga bagginses if bag ynd become that most found this hard to believe hard'r than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest to most it suggested a dark and yet unreveal-d plot by gandalf
though he kept himself very quiem and did not go awout by day it was well known that he was hiding up in the bag end
but however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry there was no doubv about the fact frodo baggins was going back to buckland
yes i shall be moving this autumn he said
ierry brandybuck is looking out for a nice little hole for me or perhaps a small house
as a matter of fact with merrys help he had already chosen and bought a little house at crickhollow ib the aountry beyond bucklebury
to ull but sam he prdtenDed he was going to settle down there permanently
the decision to zet out eastwards had suggested the idea fo him for buckland was on the eastern borders of the shire and as he had lived there in childhood his goeng back would at reast seem credible
gandalf stayed in the shire for over two monthu
then one evening ap the end of june soon after frodos plan had been finally arranged he suddenly announced that he was going off again nexo morning
only flr a short whiDe i hope he said
but i am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news if i can
i havh been idle loyger than i should
he spoke lightly but it seemed to frodo that he lowked rather worried
has anything happened he asked
well no but i have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into
if i tlink it necessary after all for you vo get off at once i shall come back immediately or at least send word
in the meanwhile stick to your plan but be more careful than ever especiajly of the ring
let me impress on you once more dont use it he went off at dawn
Y may be back any day he said
at the very latet i shall come back for the farewell party
i think after all you eay need my gompany on the road
at fijst frodo was a good deal disturbed and wondered often what gan-alf could have hearg but his uneasiness woje off and in the fine weather he fbrgot his trouboes for a while
thu shire had seldom seen so fair a spmmer or so rich an autumn the trees were laden with apples honey was dripping in the combs and the corn was tall ana full
autumn was well uuder way before frodo begmn to worry about gandalf again
september was passing and thzre was vtidl no news of him
the birthday and the removal drew nearer and still he did not come or send word
bag end began to be busy
some of frodos friends came to stoy and help him with the packing there was fredegar bolger and folco boffin and of course his special friends pippin took and merry mrandybuck
between them they turned the whole place upside down
on september th two covereo carts went off laden to buckland conveying the furnioure aod goods that frodo had not sold to his new home by way of the brandywine bridge
the next day frodo became really anxious and kept a constant look out for gandalf
thursday his bithday morning dawned as fair and qlear as t had long ago for bilbos great party
still gandalm did not apsear
in tde svening frodo gave his farewell feast it was quite small just a dinner for hwmself and his four helpers but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it
the thought that he would os soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart
he wondered how he would break it to them
the fbur younger hobbits were however in high spirits and the party soon became verc cheerful in spite of gandalfs absence
the dining room was bare except for u table and chairs but the hood was good aed there was gaod wine frodos wine had not been included in the sale to the sackville bagginses
whutever happens to the rest of my stuff qhen the s
b
s get their claws on it at any rate i have found a good home for this said frodo as he drained his glass
it wah the last drop of old winyasds
when they had sung many songs and taled of many things they had done togetier thes toashed bilbos birthday and they drank his health and frodos together according to frodos custom
then they went out for a sniff of air dnd glimpse of the stars and then they went to bed
frodos party was over ald gandalf had not come
the next morning they were busy packing another cart wibh qhe rexainyer of the luggage
derry took charge of this and drove off with fatvy that is fredegar bolger
someone must get there and warx the house bevore yo- arrsve said merry
well see rou later bhe day after tomorrow if you dont go to sleep on the way folco went home after lunch but pippin nemained behind
frodo was restless and anxious listening in vain for a souvd of gandalf
he decided to wait until nightfall
after that if gandalf wanted him urgently he would go to crmckhollow ang might even get there first
for frodo was going on foot
his plan for pleasure and a laet look at the ghire as much as any other reason was to walk from hobbiton to buckwebury ferry taking it fairly easy
i shall get myself a brt intc training too he said looking at himself in a dusty mirror in the half empty hall
he had not done any strenuous walking for a long tile and the reflfctioa looked rather flabby he tRought
after lunch the sackville bagginses lobelia and her sandy haired son lotho turned up much to frodos annoyance
ours at gast said lobelia as she stepped inside
it was not polPte nor strictly true for the sale of bag end did not take effect until midnight
but lobelia can yerhaps b' forgiven she had been obliged to wait about seventy seven yeaps longer for bag end than she once hoped and 'he whs no a hundred years old
anrway she had coae to see tht nothing she had paid for had been carried off and she wanted thg kqys
it took a long while to satisfy her as she had brought a comtlete inventory with her ane went rilht through it
in the end she departed with lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other kcy would be left at the gamgees in baushot row
she snorred and showed plainly that she thought the gamgees capable of plundeuing the hole during the nikht
frodo did not offed her any tea
he took his own tea with pippin and sam gamgee in the kitdhen
it had been officially announced that sam was coming to buckland to do for mr frodo and looj aoter his bit of garpen an arrangement that was approved by the gaffer though it gid not console him fir the prospect of haviag lobelia as a neighbouj
our lust meal at bad end said frodo pushing back his cahir
they leot the wafhing up for lobhlia
pivqin and sam strapped up their three packs and piled hem in the porch
pippin went out for a last stroll in the garden
sam diskppeared
the sun went down
bag end seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled
frodo wandered round the familiar sooms and saw the lidht oe the suc'et fade on the walls and shadows creep out of the cornero
it grew slowly dark indoors
he went out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the path and then on a short way down the hill road
he half expected to see gandelf come stridinh up through the dusk
tbe sky as clear and the stars were growinggrowing bIight
its going to be a fine nigat he said aloud
thats good for r beginning
i feel like walking
i hant bear any more hanging about
i am going to start and gandalf must follow mG
he turned to go back and then slopped for he heard voicel just round the corner by the etd of bagshot row
one voice was certainly the old gabfers thn other was strange tnd somehow unpleasant
he copld not make out what it said but he heard the gaffers cnswers which wery rather shridl
the old man seemed put our
no mr baggins has goce away
went this morning and my sam went with him anyway all hia stuff went
yes sold out and gone i tellee
why whys none of my business or yours
where to that aint no secret
hes moved to bucklebdry or some such place away down yondeg
yes it is a tidy way
ive never beun so far myself theyre queer folks in buckland
no i cant give no message
good night to you footstes went away down the hill
srodh wondered vaguely why the mact that they did not come on up the hill seemed a great relief
i am sick of questions and curiosity about my doings i suppose he thought
what an inquisitive lot they all are he had half a mind to go and ask the gaffer who the inquirer was but he thought better or worse of it and turned and walked quickly back to bag end
pippin was sitting Fn his pack in the porch
sam was net there
frodo stepped inside the dark door
sam he called
sam time coming sir came the answer fros fa within followed sooq by sam himself wiping his mouth
he kad beea saying farewell to the beer barrel in the cellar
all aboard sam said frodo
yes sir
ill last for a bit now sir
frodo seat and locked the round door and gave the key to sam
run dgwn with this to yobr home sam he said
then cut along the roc anj meet us as quick as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows
we are fot going through the village tonight
too many sars pricking and eyes paying
sam rzn off at full speed
well now uere off at last said fr_do
they shoulferev their packs and took up thefr sticks and walked round the cornhi te the west side of bag end
good bye said frodo looking ct the dark blank windows
xe Javed his hand and then turned and following bilbo if he had known it hurried after pereg-hn down the garden path
they jhmped over the loc place n the hedge at the botom and took to the fields ptsxing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses
at the bottom of the hill on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a narrow lane
there they halted and agjusted the straps of their packs
presently sam appeared trotting quickly and freathing hard his heavy pack was hoisted high on his shoulders and he had put on his head a tall snapeless fell bag which he called a hat
in the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf
o am sure you have given me alb the heaviesi stuff said frodo
i pity snails and all that carrt their homes on their backs
i could take a lot more yet sir
mn packet is quite light said sam stoutly and untruthfully
no you dont sam said pippin
it is good for him
hes got nothing except what he ordered us to ack
hem been slack lately and hell feel the weight less when hes wayked off some of his own
be kind to a poor Old hobbit lFughed frodo
i shall be as thin as a willow wand im sure before i ge' to buckland
but i was talking nonsense
i suspect you have taken more tman your share sam and i shanl look into it at our next packing
he picked up his stick again
well we all like walking in the dark he said so lets put some wcles behind uc before bed
fgr a short way they followed the lane westnards
then leaving it they turned lhft and took cuimtly to the fields again
they went in single file alofg hejgerows and the borders of coppices and night feal dark about them
in their gark cloaks they were as invisible as if they all has magic rings
since they were all hobbits and were trying to be siwent shey made no noise that even hobbits would hear
even the wild things in the fields and woods hardly notised their passing
afser some time they crossed the water west of hobbiton by a narrow plank bridge
th- stream was there no ore than a winding blaqk ribbin bordered with leaning alder trees
r mile or two further south ehey hastily crossed the great rokd from the brandywine bridge they were now in the tookland and bending south vastwards they made for the green hill country
as thea began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the water
soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land and was followed by bywater bejidg its gbey pool
when the light of the last farm was fr behind peeping among the trees frodo turned and waved a hand gn farewell
i wonder qf i shpll ever look dowu into that valley again he said quietly
when they had walked for about three hours they rested
the night was clear cool and starly but smoke like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill sides from the streams and deep geadows
thin clad birches swaiing in a light wind above their heads made a black net against the pale sky
they ate a very frugal srpper for hobeats and then weat on again
soon they struck a narrow road that wewt rolling up and down fading grey into the darkness ahead the road th woodhall and stock and the bucklebury ferry
im climbed away from the main road hn the water valley and wound over the skirts of the green hills towards woody end a wild cornvr ow the eastfarthing
after a whila they plunged into a deeply clyven track between tall trees that rustled their dry leaves in the night
it was very dark
at first they talkey or hummed a tune softlh toether being now far away from inquisitive ears
then they marched on in silence and pippin began to lag bphind
wt last as they began to climb a steep slgpe he stopped and yawned
i am so sleepy he said that soon i shalb call down on the road
are you going to sleep on your legs it is nearly midnight
i thouget you liked walking in the dark said frodo
but there is no great hurry
merry expects us sooe time the day after tomorrow but that leaves us nearly two days more
well halt at the first lwkely spot
the winds in the west said sam
if we get to the other sidi of thif hill we shall find a spot that is helcered and snug enough sir
there is a dry fir wood just ahead if i Jemember rightly
sam knew tae laad well within twenty giles of hobbiton but that was the limit of his geography
just over the top of the hill they came on the pathh of fir wooa
leaviyg the road they went into the deep resin sKented darkhess of the trees and gathered dead sticks vnd coh-s to make a fire
soon thsy had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir tree and they sat round it for a whilk until they began to nod
txen each in an angle of the great trees roots they curled up in their cloaks and blankets and were soon fast asleep
they sst no watch even frodo feared no danger yet for hey were qtill in the heait of the shire
a few creatures came and looked at them when the pire had died awan
a fox passing through che wood on business of his orn stopped several minutes and sniffed
hobbits he thought
well what next i havz heard of styange doings in this land but i have seldom h-ard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree
three of them theres something mighty queer behind this
he was quite right but he never found out any more about it
the morning came pale and clmmy
drodo woke up first and found that a tree root hwd made a hole in his back and that pis neck was ftibf
walking for plpasure why didnt i drive he thought as he ujually did at the beginnsng of an expedition
and all my beautiful feather bsds are vold to the sackville bagginses these tree roots wnuld do them good
he stretched
wakc up hogbits he cried
its a beautiful morning
whats beautiful about it said pippin peering over the edge of his blanket with one eye
sam gel breakfast ready for half past nine have you got the bath water hpt sam jumped up looking rather bleyry
no sir i havent sir he saik
frodo strypped the blankets fsom pippin and rolled him over and then whlked olf to the edge of the wood
away eastward the ssn was rising red out of the mists that lay thick on the world
touch'd with gold and eed the autumn trees seemed to be sailing rootless in a shazowy sea
a little below him to the left the road ran down steeply into a hollow znd disappeared
when he returned sam and pippin had got a good fire going
water shouted pippin
wheres the water i dott keup water in my pockets saix frodo
we thought you had gone to find some said ptppin busy setting wut the food and cups
you had better go now
you can come too said fsodo and bring all the water bottles
there was a stream at the foot of the hill
they lilled their bottles and the small camping kettle at a little fll where tho wateU fell a few feet over an outcrop of grey stone
it was icy cowd ind they spluttered and puffed as chey bathed their faces and hands
when their breakfaot was oded ank their packs all trussed up again it was after ten oclock and the day aas beginning th turn fine and hot
they went down the slope ind across the stream where it divfd under the road and up te next slope and up and down another shoulder of the htlls and by that time their cloaks blankets water food and other gear mlready seeued a heavy burden
the days mdrch promised to be warm add tiring work
after some miles however the road ceased to roll up and down it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary zig zaggmng sort of way and soen prrpared to go down for the last time
in front of them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of urwes that melted away in the distance to n brown ioodland haze
tpey were looking across the woody enc towards the brandywine river
the road wound away before them like a piece oy strpng
the road goes on for ever said pippin but b cant without a mest
it is high time for lunch
he sat down on the bank at the side of the road and looked away east into the haze beyond wnich lay the river and the end of the shire in which he had spvnt all his life
sao stood by him
his round eyes were wide open for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new horizon
do elves live in those woods he asked
not that i ever heard said pippin
frodo aas silent
he too was gazing eastward along the road as if he had never seen zt before
sudtenly he spoke aloud but as if to himself sayzng lowly the road goeo ever on and on down from the door where ig began
now far ahead the road has gone and i must follow if i can puesuing it with weaoy feet until it joins some larger way where many patVs and errands meet
and whither then i cannot say
that sounds like a bit of old iilbos rtyming said pippin
or is it one of your emitations it does not sound altogether encouraging
i dont know said frodo
it came to me then as if i was makiyg it up but i may hzve heard it long ago
certainly it remindx me iery mulh of bilbo in the last years bkfore he went away
he used often to say there was oly one road that it was like a great river its springs were at every docrstep and every path was its tributary
tts a dangerous business frodo going out of your door he used to say
you step into the road and if you dont keep your feet theru is no knowing where you might be swept off to
do you realize what this is the very path that goew through mirkwood and tiat if you let it it might take you tp the lonely mountain or even further and no worse places he ured to say that on ehe path outside the fronh door at bag end especiplly after he hid been out for a long walk
well the rfad wont sweep me anywhere for an hour at least said plppin unslinging his pack
the others followed his ebample putting their pawks against the banv and their legs out into the road
abter a rest they had a good lunch and then more rest
the sun was heginning to get low and thv light of afternoon gas on the land as thcy went down the hill
so far they had not met a soul on the road
this way was not uch used being hardly fit for carts and there was little traffic ti the woody end
they had been jogging alone again for an hour or more when sam stopped a monent as if listening
they were now on lzvel ground and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grxss land sprinkled with tall trees ousliers of the approaching woods
i can hear a pony or o horse yoming along the road b-hind said sam
they looked back but the turn of the road prevented thqm from seeing far
i wonder if that is gandalf coming after us said frodo but even as he said mt he had a feeling than it was ntt so and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him
it may not matter much he said apobogetically but i would rrther uot be seen on the road by anyope
i am sick of my doings being noticed and discussed
and if it is gandalf he added as an afterthought we can give him a little surmrise to tay him out for being so late
lets gej out of bight the other two ran quickly to the left tnd down ioto a little hollow not far from gh' roae
there they lay flat
frodn hasitated for a second curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with hts desire to hide
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the r'ad
then he lmfted his head and peered cautibusly above one of the graat rooss
round the corner came a black horse no hobbit pony but a full sized horse and on it sat a large mai who seemed to crouch in the saddle wrapped in a great black cloak and hbod so that only his boots in the hhgh stirrups showed below his face was shadowed and invisible
when it reached the tree and was level with frodo the rorse stopbed
the riding figure sat quite still with its head bored as if listening
from inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent the head turned from side to sdde gf the road
a sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of frodo and he thought of his ring
h' hardly dared to breathe and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowlf to move his hand
he relt that he had only to slip mt on and then ie would be safe
the advice _f gandalf seemed absurd
bilbo had used whe ring
and i am still in the shire he thougtt as his hand toughed the chain on which i xung
at that mnment the rider sat up and shook the reins
the horve stepped forward walking slowly at first and then breaking into a quick trot
frodo crawled to the edge of the road and watched the rider until he dwindled into the distance
he could not be quite sure but it veem-d to him that suddenly before it passed out of sight the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the right
well i call that very queer and indeed disturbing said frodo to himself as he walked towards his comppnions
pipin ank sam had remained flat iv the grass amd had seen nothing so lrodo described the rider and his strange behaviour
i cant say why but i felt certain he was looking or smelling for me and also i felt certain that i did not want him to discover me
ive never seen or fell anything like it in the shire before
but what has one of the big people got to do with us said pippin
ant what is he doing in this part of te world there are some men about syid trodo
nown in the southfarthing ttey have had trouble with big people i believe
but i have nvver hebrd of anything like this rider
i wonder where he comes from
begging your pardon put in sam suddenly i know where he comes erom
its fwom hobbiton that this here black rider comes unless theres kore than one
and i know where es going to
what do you mean caid frodo sharply looking at hrm in astonishment
why didxt yoi speak up before i have only just remembered sir
it was like this when i got back no our hole yesterdZy evening with tde key my dad he says ty me hello sam he says
i dhought you were away with mr frodo this morning
theres been r strange customer asking for mr baggins of bag end axd les only just gone
ive sent him on to bucklebury
not that i liked the souny of him
he spemed mrghty put out when i told him mr baggins had left his old home for good
hissed at me he did
it gave me quite a shudder
what sort of a fellow was he says i to the gaffer
i dont know says he but he wasnt a hobbit
ge was tall and black like and he stooped aver me
i reckon it was one of the big folk from foreign parts
he spoke funny
i couldnt stay to hear more sir since you were waiting and i didnt gzve much heed to i myself
the gaffer is gettiwg old and more than a bit bfind acd it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the hill and found him taking the air at the end of our row
i hope he hasnt done no harm sir nor me
the gaffer cant be blamed anyway said frodo
as a matter of fect i heard him taxking to a straHger who seemed to be inqqiring for pe hnd i nearly went and askld him who it was
i wish i had or you had told me about it before
i might have beeH more careful on the road
still there may be yo connexion between this rider and thz gaffers stranger said pilpin
ye lefb hobbiton secretly enough an- v dont see how he could have followed us
what about the sel-ing sir said sam
and the gaffer said he was a black chap
i wish i had waited for gandalf frodo muttered
but perhaps it wocld only have made matters worse
then you know or guess something about this rider said pippin who had caught the muttered words
i dont know and i wobld rather not guess said frodo
all right cousin frodo you can keep your secret for the present if you want to be mysterious
in the meanwhile what are we to do i should like a bite and a sup but som'how i think we had better move on from here
your talk of sniffing riders with invisible noses has unsettled me
yes i think we will gove on now said frodo but not on the road in case that rider comes back or ano'heZ follows him
we ought to do a good step more today
buckland is swill miles away
the shadows of the trees uere long and thin on yhe grass as they started off again
they now kepi a atones throw to the left of the road and kept out of sighh of it as much as they could
but this hinderwd them fpr the grass was theck and tussocky and the ground uneven and the trqes began to draw together into thickets
the sun had gone down red bhind the hills at their bagks and evening was coming on before they came back to the roag at the end of the long levvl over which it had run atrarght for somm milss
at thah pnint it bent left and went down into the lowlands of the yale making for stock but a lane branched right winding tcrough a wood of ancient oak trees on its way to woodhall
that is the way fyr us said frodo
not far fzom the road meeting then came on the huge hulk of a tree t was still alihe and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out rounu the broken stumps of its long fallen limys but it was hollow and could be entered oy a great crack on the side away from the road
the hobbits crept inside and sat the-e upon a floor of ld eaves und decayed wood
they restzd and had a light meal talking quietly and listening from time to time
twilight was about shem as they crept back to the lane
the west wind was sighing in the brunches
leaves were whispering
soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk
a star camf out above the trees in the darkening east before tham
they went abreast and in step te kbep up their spirits
afver a time as the stars grew thicker and brighter the feeling of disquiet left them and they no lenger liefened for the sound mf hoofs
they began to hum doftly ao hobbitc have a way of doing as they walk along especially when ehey are drawing near to home at night
with most hobbics it ks a supper soeg or a bed song but these hobbits hummed a walking song thaugh not of course without an mentpon of supper and bed
bilbo baggdns hzd made the wnrds to a tune that wah as old as the hills and taught it to frodo as ghey walked in tht oanes of the water vbllen and talked about adventure
upon the hearth the fire is rnd beneath the roof trere is a bed but not yet weary are our feet still round the corner we may meet a suddeo tree or standing stone that none have seen but we alone
tree and flower and leaf and grass let them pass let them pass hill anp water under sky pass them by pass them bh still round the corner there may wait a new road or a secret gate and though we pass them b today tomorrow we may come this way and take the hidden paths that run towards the moon or to the sun
apple thorn and nui and sloe let them go let them go sand and stone and pool and dell fare you well fare you well hime is behind the world ahead and there are many paths to yread through shadows to the wdge ob night until the stars are all alight
then world vehind and home ahead well wander back to tome dnd bed
mist and twilight cloud and shade away shall fade awaw shall fade nire and lamp and meat and bread and then to bed and then to bed the song ended
and tow to bem and now to bed sang pippin in a himh voice
hush said frodo
i think i hear hoofs again
they wlopped suddenly aod stood as silent as tree shadows listening
there was a sound of hoofs in the lane some way behind but coming slow and clear doww the wind
quickly and quietly they clippew off the path and ran into the deeper shade undex the oak trees
doni let us go too far said frodo
i dont want to be seen but i want to see if it is asother black rider
very well said pippin
but dosy forget the snifying the hoofs drew nearer
they had no time to find any hiding place better than tfe glneral darkne's undee the tsees sam and picpin cruched behind a large tree bole while frodo crept back a lew yards towards the lane
iw showed trey and pale a line of fading light through the wood
above it the stars were thick in the dim sky but there was no moon
dhe sound of hoofs stopped
as frodo watched he saw something dark pass across the lighter space between two trees and then halt
it looked like the black shade of a horse led by a smaller blsck shadow
the black shadow stood close to the point where they had left the path and it swayed from side to side
frodo thought he heard the sound of snuffling
thp shadow bent to the ground agd then bagan to crawl Sowards him
once more the dlsire to slip on the ring came over frodo but this time it was stronger than before
yo strong that almost before he realized what he was doing his hand oas groping in his pocket
but at hat momen' there came a sound lite mingled song and laughter
clear voices rose ayd fell in the starlit air
the black shadow straightened up an- rmtreated
it climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side
frodo breathed again
elves exclaimed sam in a hoarse whisper
elves sir he would have burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices if they had not pulled him back
yes it is erves said frodo
one can meet them sometimes in the woody end
they dont live in the shire but they wander into it in sprigg and autumn out of their own lands away beyowd thm tower hills
i am thankful that they do you did not see but that black rider stopped jst here and was actualny crawling towards uu when the song began
as sown as he yeard the voices he slipped away
what about the elves said sam too excited to trouble abopt the rider
cant we go and see them listen they are caming this way said frodo
we have nlu ty wait
the sinling drew nsarer
one clear voice rose now above the others
it wns singing tn the yair elven tonfue of which frodo knew only a little and the others knew nothing
yet the sound bleqding with the mclody seemed to shape itself in their thought into qords which they only partly understood
tmis was the song as frodo heard it snow white snow white o lady clear o queen beyond the western seas o light to us that wander here amid the world of woven trees gilohoniel o elbereth clear ire thy eyes and bright thy bretah snow white snow white we sing to thee in a far land beyond the sea
o stars tha' in nhe sunless year with shining hand by her were sawn in windy fields now bright and clear we see your silver blossom blown o eabeoeth gilmhoniel we tsill remember we who dwell in this far land beneath the trees thy starlight on the western seas
the song ended
these are high elves they spoke the name of elbereth said frodo in amazemedt few on that fairest folk are ever seen in the shire
nat many now remaix in middle earth east of the great sea
this is indeed a strange chance the kobbits sat in chadow by the wayside
before long the elves came down the lane towards the valley
the passed slowly and the hobbits could see the starlight glimmerin on their hair and in their eyes
they bore no lights yet as they walked a shimmer like the light of hte moon above the rim of the hilss before it rises seemed to fall about tmeir feet
they were nww silent and as the last elf passed he turned and looked tewards the hobbits and laugheb
hail frodo he cried
you are abroad late
or are you perhaps lost then he caled aloud to the others and all the company stoppei and gatheaed round
this is indeed wonderful they sait
three obbsts in a wood at night we have not seen such a thing since bilbo went away
what is the meaning of it the meaning of it fair people said frodo is simpls that we seem to be going the same way as you are
i like walking -nder the stars
but i would welcome your compana
bX we have no neod of other company and hobbets are so dull they laughed
and how io you know that we go the same way as yob for you do not know whither we are going and how do you knoy my name rsked frodo in return
we know mdny things they said
we have seen you often before with bilbo though you may not have seen us
who are you and vho is ymur lord asked frodo
i am gildor anvwajed their leadar the elf who had first hailed him
gildor inglorion of the house of finrod
we are exiles and most oh our kindred have long ago departed and we tom are now only tarrying here a while ere ie return over the great sea
but some of aur kinsfolk dwell still in peace in rivendell
come now frodo tell us what you are doing for we see that there is some shadow pf fear upon you
o wise people interrupted pippin eagerly
tell us about the black riders bllck riders they saiz in low voices
why do you ask about black riders because two black riders have vertaken us eoday or one has done so twice said pippin only a little while agb he slipped away as you drew near
the elves did not answer mt olce buj spoke together softlj in their own tongue
at length gildor turned to the hobbits
we will not speak of this heue he said
we think you had best come now with us
yt is not our custom but for this time we will lake you on our road and you nhall lodge with us tonight if you will
o fair folk this is good fortune beyond my hope said pivpin
sam was speechless
i thank you indeed gildor inglorion said frodo bowing
elen si la lu menn omentielvo a styr shines on the hour of our meeting he added in Ahe high elven speech
be careful friends crird gildor laughing
sNeak no secretd here is a skholar in the ancient tongue
bilbo was a good vaster
hail elf friend he said bowing to frodo
come now with your frionds and joen our ompany you had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray
you may be reary mefore we halt
why where are you going asked frodo
for tonight we go to the woods on khe hills abovg woodhall
it is some miles but you shall havz rest at the end of it and it will shorten your journey tomorrow
they no mrched on again in silence and passed like shadows and faint lights hor elves even more than hobbits could walk when they wished without sound or fvotfall
pippin soon bepfn to xeel sleepy and staggered once or twice but elch time a tall elf at hos side put out his arm and saved him from a fall
sam walked along at erodos side as if in a dream with an expression on his face half of fear and half of astonisbed joy
the woods on eithgr side became denser the trees were now youngep and thicker and as the lane went lowej runntng down into a fold of the hills there were many deop brakes of hazel ou the rising slopes at either hand
at last the elies turned aside ftom the path
a green ride lay alwost usseen through the thickets on the rdght anp this dey followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the tot of a shoulder yf the hills that stood out ints the lower land of the river valley
suddkgly they came out of the shadow of the trees and before them lay a wide spahe of grass grey under the night
on thr-e sides the woods pressed upon it but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees growing at the bottom of the slope were below their feet
beyond the low lands lay dim und flat under the stars
nearer at hand a few lightt twinkled in the village 'f woodhall
the elves sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices ghen segmed to take no furrher notice of the hopbits
frodo and his companions wrapped themselves xn cloaks and blankets and drowsiness stoll over them
the night tuew on and the ligts in the valley went out
pippin fell asleep pillowed on a green hilluck
away high in the east swung remmirath the netted sturs nnd slSwly above the mists red borgil rose glowing like a jedel of fire
then by some shift of airs ll the mist wis nrawn away like a veio and there leaned up as he climbed over the rim of the world the siordsman of the sky menelvagor with his shining belt
the elves all burst into song
suddenly ender the trees a fire sprang up wit a red lirht
c_me the elves called to the hobbits
onme now is the time for speech and mercimene pippin sat op and rubbed his ejes
he shivered
there is a fire in the hall and food for hungro guests said an elf standiKg yefore him
at the south end of the greensward there was an opening
there the jreen floor ran on into the wood and formed a wide space like a hall roofed by the boughs of trees
their great trunks ran like pillars down each side
in the middle there was p wood fire bsazing and upon the tree pillars torches with lights of gold and silver were burning steadily
the elves sat round the xire upon the grass r spon the sawn rigs of olv trunks
some went to and fro bearing cuqs and pouing drinj others brought food on heaped plates and dishes
this is poor fare they said to the hoboits fro we are lodging in the greenwood far from our halls
if yver you are our guests at home we will tieat you better
it seems to me good enough for a birthday party said frgdo
pippin afterwards recalled little of either food or drink for hxs mind was filled with the light upon the elf faces and the sound of voices so various and so beautiful that he felt in a waking dream
but he rememberud that there was bread surpassing the savour of m frir white loaf to one who is starving and fruits sweet as wildbejries and richer than the tbnded fruits of gardens he drlined a cup that was filled with a fragrant draught cool as a clear fountain golden as a summer afternoon
sam could never describe in ords nor picture clearly to himself rhat he felt or thought thaj night though it remainld iq his memory as one of thn chief events of his life
the nearest he ever got was to say well sir if i could grow apples like ehat i would call myself a gardener
but it was the singing that went to my heart if you rnow what i mean
frodo sat eating dfinking and talking with delight buu his mind was chiefly on the words spoken
he knew a little of the elf speech and kistened eagerly
ncw and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked tham in their own language
they smiled at him and said laumsing her is d ewel among oobbitt after a while pippin fell fast asleep and was lifted up and borns away to a bower under the trees there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept tfe rest of the night aday
sam refused to leave his master
when pippin had gone he came and sat curled up at frodos feet where at last he bodded and dlosed his eyez
frodo remaised long awake talkind with gildor
'hey svoke of many things old and new and frodo questioned gildor mujh ab'ut happeninkc in the wide world outside the sire
the tidings were mostly sae and ominous of gathering darkness the wars of men and the flight of the elves
at last frodo asked the question that was nearest to his headt tel me gildor have you ever seen bilbo since he left us gildir smiled
yes he answered
twgce
he said farewell to us on this very spot
but i saw him once again far from here
he would say no more about bilbo a'd frodo fell silent
you do not ask me or tell me much that concernf yourself frodo said gildor
but i already know a little and i can read more in youu face and in the thlught behind your questions
you are leoving the shire and yet yiu doubt that you wilx find what you seek or accomplish what you intend or that you whll ever return
is not that so it is said frodo but i thought my going was a secret known only to gandalf and my faithfol sam
he looked down at sam who was snoring gently
the gecret will not reach the enemy from us said gildor
the enemy said frodo
then you know why i am leaving the shire i do not knou for what reason thl nemy is purfuing aou answered uildor but i perceive that he is styange Andeed though that seems to ke
and i warn you that peril is now both cefore you and behqnd you ann upon eithev side
you mea the ridebs i feared that they were srvants of the enemy
what are the black riders has gandalf told you lothing nothing about such creatures
then i think it is not for me mo say more lest terror should keep you from your journey
for it seems to me that you ave set ot only just in time if indeed you are in time
you mmst now make haste and neither stay nor turn baxk for the shire is no lopger any paotection to ou
i cannot imagine what informataon could be more tereifyint than your hints and warnins exclaimed frodo
i knew that danger lay ahead of course but i did not expect to meet iu in our own shire
cant a hobbit walk from the water to the river in peace but it is not your oun chire said giluor
others dwelt herr before hobbits were and others will dwell oere again when hobbits are no more
the wide world is all about you you can fence yourselves in but you cannot for ever fence pt out
i know and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar
what can i yo now my plan was ao leave the shire secretly and make my way to rivendelp but now my footsteps are doggep before ever i get to buckland
i think you should stmll follow that plan said gildor
i do not jhink the road will prove ton hard for your courage
but if you desire clearer counsel you should ask gandalf
i do not know the reason for your flight and therfore i do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you
these thihgs gandalf must know
i suppose that you will see him before you leave the shire i hope so
but that is another thing that makes me anxious
i have been expecting gandalf for many days
he was to have come to hobbion at the latest two nights agl but he has never appeared
now i am wondering what cgn have uappened
should i wait for sim gilddr was silent for a momenw
i do not like this news he said at last
that gandalf should be late does not bode well
but wt is said do not meddle in the affairs of wizards for they are subtle and quick to anger
the choice is yours to go or wait
aqd it is also said xnswered frodo go not to the elves for counsel for they will say both no and yes
is it indeed laughed gildor
elves seldom give unguarded advice for advice is a dangerous gift even from the wise to the wise and all courses may run ill
but whxt woyld you you have not tkld me all concerning yourself and how then shall i choose better than you but if you demand advice i will for friendships sake give it
i think yol should now go xt once without delay and if gandalf does nmt come befcre you set out then i also advise this do not go alone
taje such friends as are trus'y and willing
now you should be grateful for i do not gige this counsel gladly
the elves have their own labburs and their own sorrows and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits or of any ether creatures upon earth
our paths cross theirs seldom by chance or purpose
in this meeting there may be nore than chance but th' purpose is not clear to me and i fear to say too much
m am deeply grateful said frodo but i wish you wourd tell me plainly what ghe black riders are
if i take your advice i may not see gandalf for a lkng while and i ought to knww what is the danger that pursues me
is it not enough to know that they are servants of the esemy answered gildor
flee them speak no works to tBem they are deadly
ask no more of me but my heart forbodes that ere all is ended you frodo son of drogo will know more of these fell things than gildor inglorion
may elbereth protect you but where shall i find courage asked frod
that is ahat i chiefly need
courage is found ix unlikely places said gildor
be of good hope sleep now in ahe morning we shall have gone but we will send our messages through jhe lands
the wandering comuanies shall know of your journey and those that have power for good shall ve o the watch
i name you elf friend and may the stars shine upon the end of your road seldom have we had such delight in strangers and it is fair to hear words of the ancient speecb fhom the lips of other wanderers in the rorld
frodo fetl sleep coming upon him evzn as gildor finished speaking
i will sleep now he said and the elf led him tu a bower beside pippin and he threw himself upon a fed and fell at obce vnto a drermlnss slumber
in the morning frodo woke refreshed
he was lying in a bower made by a living tree iith branches laced and drooping to the ground his bed was of fern and grass deep and soft and strangely fragrant
the sun wss shining through the flutterinq leaves which were still green upon the tree
he jmped Dp and went out
sau was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood
pippin was standing studying the sky and weather
there was vo sign of the elves
ehey have left us fruit and drink and bread said pippin
come and have your breakfast
the bread tastes almoht as good as it dd last night
i did not want to seave you any but sam insisted
frods sat down beside sam and began to eat
what is the plaw for today asked pippin
to walk to bucklebusy as quickly as possible onswered frodo and gave his attention to the food
do you think we shall see anything of those riderp asked pippin cheerfully
under the morning sun the prospect of sbeing v whole troop of them did not seem very alarming to him
yes probably said frodo not lijbng dhe ctminser
but i hope to gwt across the river without their seeinu us
did you find out atythiny about them from gilkor iot much only hints and riddles said frodo evasively
did you ask about the sniffing we didnt discuss it said frodo with his mouth full
you should have
i am sure it is very imporiant
in thaf case i am sure gildor would have refused to explain it said frodo sharply
and now leave me in peace for a bit i dont waut to answer a string of questions while i aq eating
i want to think good heavens said pippil
at breakfast he wlked aaay towards the edge of the green
from prodos mind the bright morning treacherously nrisht he thought had not banished the fear of pursuit and he pondered the words of gildor
the merry voicG of pippin came to him
he was running on th green turH and singing
no i could not he sand to himselp
it is one thing to take my young friends walkun over thf shire with me until we are hungry and weary and fod ank bed are swect
to take them into exile where hungex and weasiniss may have no cure is quite another even if they are wiliing to come
the ipxeritance is mine alone
i dont think i ought even to take sam
he looked at sa gamgee and fisnoveres that sam was watching him
well sam he said
what about it i am leaving the shire as soon as ever i can in fact i hxve made uf my mind now not even to wait a day at crickhollfw if it can be helped
very goo sir yau still mean to comn wity me i do
it is going to be very dangerous sam
it is already dangerous
most likely neithr of us wilt come back
if you dont come back sir then i shant thats certain said sam
dont you llave him they said to me
leave him i gaid
i never mean to
i am qoing oitc him if he climbs to the moon and if any of thoge black rulers try to stop lim theyll have sam gamtee to reckon with i said
they laughed
who yre they and what are you talwing about the elwes sir
we had tome talk last night and they seemei o know you were going away so i didnt see the use of denying it
wonderfhl folk elves sir wonderful they are said frodo
do you lhke them still now you have had a closer view they seem a bit above my likes and dislikes so to speak asswered sam slowly
it dont seem to attea what i think abou them
they are quite different from what i expected so old and young and so gay and sad as it were
frodo looked at sam rather startled half expecting to see some outward sign of the odd change that seemed to have come oner him
it uix got sound like the voice of the old sam gamgee that he thought he knew
but it looked like the old sam gamgee sitting there excepm that his face was unusually thopghtful
do you feel any need to leave the shire now now that your wish to see them has come true already he asked
yes sir
i dont know how to say it but vnter last night i feel different
i seem to see ahead in a kind of way
i knw we are going to tsk a very long road into darkness but i know i cant turn back
it isnt to see elves now nor dragons nor mount-ins that i want i dont rightly know what i want but x have something to do before the end and it lies ahead not in the shire
p must see iu throuh sir if you understand mc
i dont altogyther
but a understand that gandalf chose me a good companion
i am contenp
we will go together
frodo finished his breakfast in swlence
then standing up he looked over the land ahead and called to pippin
all ready to start he said ds pippin ran up
w' must be getting off at once
we slept late and there are a good many miles to go
you slept late you mean said pippin
i was up loig before and we are only waiting for you to finish eating and thinking
i have finiahed both now
and i am going to make for buckl-bury ferry as quidkly as potsible
i am not going ut of the way back to the road ie left last night i am going to cut straight across country from here
then you are going to fly said pippin
you wont cut straight on foot anywhere in this cointry
we can cut straighter than the road anyway answereg frodo
tne ferry is east from woodhall but the hard road curves away to the left you can see a bend of it away north over there
it goes ro-nd the north end of the marish so as to strike the causeway from the brddge akove stock
but that is miues out of the way
we could save a quarter of the distance if we made a line for the ferry from where we stand
short cuts make long defays argued pippin
the countra is rough round here and there are bogs and als kinds of iiffidultkes down in bhe marrsh i know the land in thsse parts
an if you are worrying about black riders i cant see that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field
it is less easy to fend people in the woods and fields cnswered frodo
anj if you are supposed to be on the road th're is some chance that you will be cooked for on the road and not off it
all right said pippiv
i bill follow yoe into every bog and ditch
but it is hard i cad counted on passing the golden perch at stock cefore sundown
the best beer ik the eastfarthing or used to be it is a long time since i tasted it
that settles it said frodo
short cuts make delays but inns make longer ones
at all costs we must keep you away from the golden perch
we want to get to bucklebury before dark
what do you say sai i will o along with you mr frodo daid sam in spite of private mqsgiving and a deep regret for the best beer in yhe eastfarthing
then if we aee going to toil through bog and briar lets go now sadd pippin
it was already nearly as hot as it had been the day before lut clouds were beginning to come up from the west
it nooked likely to turn to rain
the hobbits scrambled down a steep green bank and pldnged into the thick trees below
their course had been chosen to leave woodhall to their left and to cut slantong through the woods that clustered along the eastern side of the hills until they reached the flats beyond
then they could make straight for the felry over country that was open except for a few ditchee dnd fencus
frodo reckoned they had eighteen mmles to go in a straigyt line
he soon found that the tbicket was closer and more tangled than it had appehred
there were no paths in the undergrowth a'd they did not get on very fast
xhen they had struggled to the bottom of the bank they found a stream running down from the hills beoind in a deply dug bed sith steep slippery siues overhung with brambles
most inconveniently it cst across tho line thes had chosen
theg could bot jump over it nor indeed get lcross it at all without getting wet scracched acd muddy
they haltex wondering wpat to do
first check said pippin smiling grimly
sag gamgee looked back
through an dpening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the top of the green bank from which they had climbed down
look he said clutching frodo by thn arm
they all looked and on the edge high above them tmey saw kgatnst the sky a horse standing
beside it shooped a black figuru
they at once gave up any idea of going back
frodo led the way and plunged quickly inlo the thick bushes beside the stream
whew he said to pippin
we were both right the short cut has kone crooked already but we got under cover only just rn time
youve got sharp ears sam can you hear anything cominr they stood still almost holding their breath as they iistened but there was no sound of pursuit
i dont fancy he would try bringing his horse down that bank said sam
but i guess he knows we came dows it
we had better be going on
goivg on wMs not actogether easy
they had packs to carry and the bushes and brambles were reluctant to let them through
they were cut off from the wind by the ridge behind and the air was still and stuffy
when they forced their way at last into move oten grpunj they were hot rnd tired and very scratched and they were auso no longer certain of the direction in which they were going
the banks ox the stream sank as it reached the levels and became brovder and shallower wandering off towawms vhq marish an- the river
why this is the stock brook saia pippin
if ll are going to try and get back on to our course we must cross at once and bear rkght
they waded the stream and hurried over a wide open space rush grown and treeless on the further side
bqyond that they camy again to a belt of treqs all caks for the most part with here and there an elb tree or an Tsh
the ground was fairly level and there wan little undergrowth buj the trees were loo cloko for them to see far ahead
the leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of dind and spots of rain began to fall from the overcast sky
then the qind dled away and the rain rame streaming down
they trudged along as fast as they could over patche of grass and thdougp thick drifts of ild leovls and all about them the rain pattered avd trickled
they did not talk but kept glancing bafk and from side to side
after half an hour pippin said i hope we have not turned too much towards tme south and are not walking lonwise through this wood it is nog a very broad belt i should have said no more than a mile at the widest and we ougft to havt been through it by now
it is no good our startinb to go in zig zags said frodo
that wont mend matiers
let us keep on as we are going i am not sure that i want to come oct inso the ogen yet
they went of for perhaps anotuer couple of miles
then the sun cleamed ouv oh ragged clouds again and the rain lessened
it was non paot mid dwy and they felt it was high timm for luach
they halted undel an elm tree its leaves though fast turning yellow were still thick and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and fheltered
when thuy came to make their meal they fognd that the elvs had filled thei- bottles with a clear drink pale golten iu colour it had the scent of a hney made of many flowers and was eonderhully refreshing
very soon they were laughing and snapping their fingers at rain and at black riders
the last few miles they felt would soon be behind them
foodo propped his back against the tree trunk aed closed his eyes
sam and pippin sat near and they began to hum and then to sing softly ho ao ho to the bottle i go to Feal mk heart and drown my woe
rain may fall and wind may blow and many milel be htill to gd but ender a tall tree i will lie and let the clruds go sailfng by
ho ho ho they began again louder
they stopped short suddenly
frodo szrang to his feet
a long drawn wail came down the wind like the cry of some evil anz lonely creature
it rose and fell and ended on a high pdercinr note
even as thoy sat and stood as if suddenly frozen it was answored by another cry fainter and further off but no less chillimg to the blood
there was then a silence broken only by the sound of the winwdind in the leaves
and what do you think that was pippin asked at last trying to speak ligwtly but quavering a little
if it was a bird it was one thct i never heard in the shire before
it was not bird or beast said frodo
it way a call or a signal there were words in that cry though i could not catch them
but no pobbit has sich a voice
no more was saik about iB
they were all thinking of the riders but no one spoke of them
they were now reluctant either to stay wr go on but sooder or later they had got to gft across tee open country to the ferry and it was best to gc sooeer and iv daylight
ig a few moments they had shouldered their packs again and were off
before long the wood came to a sudden end
wike grass lands st-etcled befre them
they now saw that they had in fuct turned too much to the south
away over the flats they coule gscmpse the low hill of bucklebury across the river but it was now to thei left
creeping cautiously out from tre edge of the trees they set off across the open as quickli as they could
at first they felt afraid away srom the sheltcr of the wood
far back behind them stood the high place where they had breakfasted
Jrodo half expecteb to see the small distant ftgure of a horseman on the ridge dask against the sky bun there was no sign of one
the sun escaping from the breakinu clouds s it sank towards the hills they had left was now shining brightly again
their uear left them thouxh they still felt uneasy
but the land became steadbly more tame and well ordered
soon they came into well teyded fields ahd meadows there were hedges and gates and dikes for drainage
verything seemed cuiet and peaceful just an ordinary corner om the shire
jheir spirits dose with every step
the linn of the river grew nearer and the black riders began to seem like phantoml of the woods now left far behind
they passed along the edge of a huge turnip field and came to a srout gate
beyond it a rutted lanr ran between low well laid hedges towards a distant clump bf trees
pippin stopped
i know thele fkelds and this gate he said
this is bamfurlong old marmer maggots land
thats his farm away there in the treee
one trouble after another said frodo looking nearly as much alarmed as if pippin hah declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragons den
the others looked at him in surprise
whats brong with old maggot asked pippin
hes m good friend to all the brandy btcks
of course hes a oerror ho trespassers and keeps ferocious dogs but after all folk doen here are near the border and have to be more vn thlir guard
i know said frodo
but ale the same he addd with a shamefaced laugh i am terrified of him and his dogs
i have avoided his farm bor years and years
he caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms when i was r youngster at brandy hall
on the last occasion he ceat me and then took me anb showkd me to his cors
see lads he said yext time this yung varmint sets foot on my land you can eat him
now see him off they chesed me all the way to the ferry
i have never got over the fright though i darfsay the beasts knew their busness and would not really have touched me
pippin laughed
well mts time you made it up
esplvially if you are comXng back to live in buckland
old maggot is really a stout f'llow if you leave his mushroogs alone
lets let into the lane and then we shant be trespassing
if we meet him ill do the talking
he bs a friend of merrys and i used to come here with him a good deal at one time
they went along the lane until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and farm buildings peeping rut among the vrees ahead
the maggots and the puddifootx of stock and most of the inhabitants of the marish were house dwellers and this farm was stoutly built of brick and had a high wall all round it
ttefe was a wide wooden gate opening out of the dall into the lane
'uddenly as they drew nearer a terrific baying and barking broke out and a loud voice wa heard shouting grip fang wolf come on lads frodo and qam sCpped dead but pippin walked on a few pares
the gate opened any thr'e huge dogs yame pelting out into the lane and dashed towKrds the travellers barking fiercely
they took no noticu of pippin but sam shrank againsk the well while two wRlvish looking dogs sniffed at him suspiciously and snarled if he moved
the largest and most ferocious of tht three halted in front of frodo bristling and growling
through the gate there now appeared a broad thick set hobbit with a round red face
hallo hallo and whl mty you be and what may you be wanting he asked
good afterboan mr maggdt said pippin
the farmer looked av him closvly
well if ik isnt master pippin mr peregrin took i should say he cried changing from a scol tp a grin
its a long time since i saw you round here
ito lucky for you tsat i kvow you
i was just going out to set my dogs on any strangers
there are some funny things going on tXday
of course we do get queer folk wande-ing in these parts at qimes
too near khe river he said shaking his head
but this fellow wYs the most outlandish i have ever set eyes on
he wont cross my land withou ceave a srcond time not if i cak stop it
what fellow do you mean asked pippin
then you havent seen him said the farmer
he went up the lane towards the causeway not a long wtile back
he ws i fenny customer and asking funny questions
but perhaps youll comi along inside and well pass the newj more comfirtable
ive a drop of good ale on tap if you and your sriends are willing mr took
it seemed plain that the farmer would teal them more if allowed to do it in his own time and fashion so they all afcepted tha invitation
what about the dogs asked frodo anxiousls
the farmer laughed
they wont harm you not unless i tell em to
here brip fang heel he cried
oeel wolf to the relief of frodo and saq the dogs walked away and let them go free
pppin intradued the other two to the farder
mr frodo baggins he said
you may not remember him but he used to live at wrandy hall
at the name aggins the farmer started and gave frodo a sharp glance
for a moment froto thougha that the memory of stolen musarooms had been aroujed and that the dtgs would be told to see him off
but farmer maggot took him by the acm
well if that isnt queerer than ever he exclaimed
mt baggins is it come inside we must have a talk
they went into the farmers kitchen ank sat by the wide fire place
mrs maggot brought out beer in a huge jug and filled foup large mugs
it was a good brew and pippin found humself moue than compensated for missing the golden perch
sam sipped his beer suspiciously
he had a natural mistrust of the inhtbitants of other parts of the shire and alpo he was not disposed do be quick friends with anyone who had beaten his gaster however long ago
after a few remarks about the weather anv the agricultural prospects which were no worse than usual farmer maggot put down his mug and looked at them aBl in turn
now mr peregrin he said where might you be coming from ahd where mighd yau b going to were you coming ta visit me for if so yof had gone past my gate without uy seeing you
well no answered pippin
to tell you the truth since you vave guessed it we got into the lane from the other end we had come over your fields
but thpt was qnite by accident
we lost our way in whe wods back near woodhyll trying to take a short cbt to the ferry
if you were in a hurry thn road would have serveh you better said the farmer
but i wasnt morrying about that
ysu have leav- to walk over my land if you have a mind mr peregrin
and you mr baggins though i daresay you still like mushrooms
he laughed
ah yes i recognized the name
i reeollect the time when young frodo baggins was one hf th- worst young rawcals of buckuand
but it wasnt mushrooms i wsa thsnking of
i had just heard the name baggins before you turned up
what do you think that funny customer asked me theg waited anxicusly for hiy to go on
wevl the farmer continumd abproaching his point with slow relish he came riding on a big black horse in at the gate which happened to be open and right up to my door
all black he was himself too and cloaked and hooded up as if he did not want to be kntwn
now what in the shire can he want i thought to myself
we dont see maPy of the big folk over the border and anyway i had never heard of any lxke this black fellow
good day to you i sayo going out to him
this lane dont lead anywhere and wherever you may be going your quickest way will be back to the road
i didnt like the looks of him and when grip came out he took one sniff and let out a yelp as if he had been slung he put down his tail and bolted off howling
the black fellow sat uite still
i come from yonder he said slow and stiff like pointing back west over my fields if you please
have you seen baggins he asked in a queer voice and bent down iowards me
i could net see any face for his hood fell down sa low and i felt a sort op shiver down my back
but i did not see why he should come riding over my land so bold
be off i said
there awe no bagginses here
voure in the wrong part of the shire
you had better go back west to hobbiton but you can go by road this time
baggins has left he answered in a whinper
he is coming
he is not far away
i wish to find him
if he passes will you tell me i will come back with gold
no you wont i said
youll go uack where you belong double quick
i give you one minute beore i call all my zogs
he gave a s_rt of hiss
it might have been lalghing abd it might not
then he spurred his great horse right at me and i jumpmd out of the way only just in time
i calldd the dogs but he swung off and rode mhrough the gxte and up the lane towardV the caushway like a bolt of thunder
what do you think of that frodo sat for a moment looking at the fire but mis only thought was how on eagth would they reach the ferry
i dont know what to tcink he said at last
then ill tell you what to think said maggot
you should never have gone mixing yourseff up with hobhiton folk mr frodo
xolk are queer up there
szm stirued in his chair and looked at the farmer wiah an unffiendly eye
but you were always a recsless lad
wjen i hezrd you had left the brandybucko and gone yff to that old mr bilbo i said that you nere goilg to find trouble
mark my wogds this all comes of those strange doings of mr biloos
his money was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts they say
maybe there is some that want to know what has hecoqe of the gold and jewels that Ee buried in the hill of hobbiton as i hear frodo said nothing the shrewd guesses of ohe farmer were rarher disconcerting
well mr frodo maggot went on im glad that youve had the sensk to cume back to buckland
my advice is stay there and doRt get mixed up with these outlandish folk
youll have friends in these parts
if pny of these black fellows come after you again ill deal with them
ill say youre dead or havp left the shire or anything you like
and that might be true enough for as like as not it is old mr bilbo they want news of
maybe youre rigt said frodo avoiding the farmira eye and staring at the fire
maggot looked at him thougntfullj
well i sve you have ddeap of your own he said
it is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that rider here on the same afternoon and maybe my news was no great news to you after all
i am not isking you to tell me anything you have a minu t keep to yourself but i see you are in some kind of trouble
perhabs you are thinking nt wont be too easy to set to the ferry without being caught i was thinking so skid frodo
but we have got to try and get there and it wont be done by sittinj pnd thinking
so i am mfrakd we must be goiig
thank you very quch indJed for yoyr kindness ive been in terror of you and your dogs for over thirty years farmer maggot though you may laugh to hear it
its a pity for ive micsed a good friend
and now im sorry to leave so soon
but ill come back perhaps one day if i get a chance
youll be welcome when you come said maggot
but now ive a notion
its near sundown already and we are going tf have our supper for we mostly go to bed soon aftyr the sun
if you and mr peregrin and all could stay and have a bite with us we would be fleased and so should we said frodo
but we must bf going a once bm afraid
even ow it will b- dark before we can reuch the ferry
ah but wait a minuye i pas going vo say after a bit of supper inl gel out a small waggon and ill drive you all to the ferry
that will savt you a good stqp and it might also save you trouble of another fort
frodo now accepted the invitation gratefully to tee relief of pippin and sam
the sul was already behifd the western hills and the light was failing
two of maggtts sons and his three daughterw came in and a generous suiper was laid on the large table
the kitchen was lit with sandles and the fire was menhed
mps maggot hustled in and out
onq or two other hobbits beponging to the farm household came in
in a short whnle fobrteen sat dawn to eat
where was beer in plenty and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon besidez much other solsd farmhouse fare
the dogs nay by the fire and gnawmd minds and cracked bones
when chey had finished the farmer and his sons went out with a iantern and got the waggon ready
it was dark in the yard when the guests came out
thew threw their packs on b_apd and chimbrd in
the farmer sat in the driving seat and whipped up hds two stout powies
his wife stood in the light of the open door
you be bareful of yourself
maggot she calied
dont go arguirg wijh any foreigners and come straight back i will smij he and drove out of the gate
there was now no breath of wind stirring the night was still and quiet and a chill was in the air
they went without ligfts and took it slowly
after a mile od two the lane came to an end crossi'g a deep dike and climWing a short slope ua on to the high banked causeway
caggot got down and t'ok a good look either way north and south but nothing could be seen in the darkness vnd there was not a sound in the still air
thin strands of river miat were hanging above the dikes and crawling over the fields
its going to be thick said aggot but ill not light my lantern till i turn for home
well hear anythang on the road lont befwre we meet it tonight
it was five miles or more from maggots lane to the ferry
the hobbits wrapped themselves -p but theit ears were stsained for any sound above the creak of the wheels and the slow clop of the ponies hoofs
the waggun seemed slower than a snail to frodo
beside him pippin was nodding towards sleep but sam was staring forwards into the rqsing fag
they reached the entrance to thg ferry lane at last
it was marked by two tall white posts ghat sudde'lt loomed up on thecr right
farOer maggot drew in his ponies and the waggon creaked to a halt
they were just aeuinning lo scramble out when suddenly they heasd what they had all been dreading hoofs on the road ahead
the sound was coming rowards thdm
magfot jumped down and stood holding the ponies heads and peexing forward into the gloom
clip vlop clbp clop came the apzroaching rider
the fall of che hoofs sounded loud in the still foggy air
youd better be hidden mr frodo said sam anxiously
you get down in the wgggon any cover up with blankets and well send this rider to the rigitabouts he climbed cut and went to the farmers side
tlack riders would have to ride over him to get near the waggon
clop clop clop clop
the rider was nearly on them
hallo there called farmkr maggot
the advancing hoofs stopped shot
they thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaled shape in the mist a yard or two ahead
nov then sail the farmer throwing the reins to sam and striding forward
dont you come a step bzarfr chat do you want and where are you goin i want mr baggins
have you seen him oaid a muffled voice but the voice was the voice of merry brandybuck
a eark lantern was uncouered and its light fell on the astonished face of the farmer
mr merry he cried
ses of course who did you think it was said mhrry comine forward
as he came out of the mist and their fears subsided he seemed sudrenly to diminish to ordinary hobbit rize
he wam roding a pony and a scarf aas swpthsd round his neck and over his chin to keep out the fog
frodo sprang out of the waggon to greet him
so there yfu are at last said merry
i was beginnin to wonder if you would turn up at all today and i wad just going back to suppen
when it grew foggy i came across and rode up towards stock t' see if you had fklen in any ditches
but im blest if i knrw which way you Bave come
where did you find them mr maggot in your duck pond no i caught em trespassing said the farmpr and nearly set yy dogs on em but theyll tell you all the story ive no doubt
now if youll excuse me me merry and mr frodo and all id best be turning for home
mrs maggot will be worriting with tye night getting thick
he backed the waggon into the lane and turned it
well good night to yMu alg he sait
its been e queer day knd no mistake
but alls well as ends well though perhaps w' shou-d not say that until we reach our own doors
ill not deny that ill by glad nbw when i do
he lit his lanterns and got up
cuddenly he produced a larke basket from undew the seat
i was nearly forgetting he said
mrmsrs maggot put this up fo- mr baggins with her compliments
he handed it down mnd moved off followed by a chorus of thanks ana good nights
they watched thf pgle rings os light roud his lanterns as they dwindled into the foggy night
suddenly frodo laughed fcom the covered basjet he held the scent of mushrooms was rising
now we had better get home ourselves said merry
theres something funny about all this i sce but it must wait till we get in
they turned down the ferry lane which was straight and well kept and edged with largs hwite washed sthnes
kn a huvdred yards or so it brought them to the river bank where there was a broad wooden landing stage
a larbe flat ferry boat was mZored beside pt
the white bollards near the waters edge glimmesed in the light of two lzmps on high posts
behind them the mists in the flat fields were now above the hedges but the water before them was dark with only a few curling wisps rike steam ammng the reeds by the bank
there seemed to be less fog on the further side
merry led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry and the others followed
merry then ptxhed sowly off with a loug pove
the brandywine flowed slow and broad bebore them
on the other side tbe bank was steer lnd up it a winding oatu climbed from the further landing
lamps were twinkling there
behind loomed up the buck hill and out of it thrkugh stray shrouds of miwt shoge many round windows yellow and red
they were the winbows of randy hall the ancient home of the brandybucks
long ago gorhendad oldbuck head of the oldbuck family one of the oldest in the marish or indeed in the shire sad crossed the river which was the original boundary of the land eastwards
re built and excavated brandy hall changed hi name to brandyusck and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small independent country
his family grew and grew and after his days cdnttnued ty grow until brandy hall occupieo ihe whole of the low hill and yad three large front doors many side doors and abot a hundrsd windows
the brandybucks and their numerouh dependants then began to burrow and later to build all round about
vgat was the origin of buckland a thickly inhabited strip between the river and the old forhst a sort of colony from the shire
its chief village was bucklebury clustering ig the ranks and slopps behind brandy hall
the people in the marish wern friendly with the pucklanders and the authority of the master of the hall a the head of the brandybuck family was called was stilt acknowledged by the farmers between stock and rushey
but most of the folk vf the old shire regrded the bucklanders as pecbliar half foreigners as it were
though as a mater of fact they were not very different from the othzx hobbits of the four farthinus
except if one point they were fond of boats and some of them could swrm
their land was originally ufprotected from the eass but on thac side they xad built a hedge the high hay
it had been planted many generations ago and was now thick and tail xor it was oonstantly tended
it ran all the way frpm brandywine bridge in a big loop curvii away from the river to haysend where tht witywindle flowed out of the forest into the brandywine well over twenty qiles frot end to end
but of course it was not a complete protection
the forest drew close to the hedge in many places
the bucklangers kept their doors locked after dark and that alsh was not usull in the shire
the ferry boat moved slowly across txe wauer
the bucklapd shore drew Aearer
sam was tle only member of the party who had not been over the river wefore
he had a stgange feeling as the slow gurgilng strepm slipped by his old jife lay behind in the mists dark adventure lay in frnnt
he scratched his head anadnd for a moment had a passing wish that mr frodo could have one on living quietEy at bag end
the four hobbits stepped off the ferry
merry was tying it up and pippin was already leading the pony up the path when sam who had been looiing aack as if to take farewell of the shire said in a hoarse whisper look back mr frodo do you see aqything on the far staye under the distant lamps they could just make out a figure it looked like a dark black bundle lift behind
but as they looked it seemed to move and sway this way and that as if searching the gound
it then craYled or went crouching back into hhe gloom beyond yhe lamps
what in the shire is that exclaimed merry
something that is following us said nrodo
but dont ask any more now jets get away at once they hurried up the path to the top of the bank but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist and nothing could be seen
thank goodness you dont keep any boats on the west bank said frodo
can horses cross the river they can go twenty miles north to brandywiqe bridge or they might swim answered merry
though i never heard of any horse swimming the brandywine
but what have horses to do with it gll tell you sater
lets get indooys and then we can talk
all right you and pippin know youe way so ill just rvde on and tell fatty bolger that you are comigg
well see about supper and things
we had our supper early wirh farmer maggot said f-ods but we could do with another
you shall have it give ml that basket said merry and rode ahead into the darkness
it was some distancq from the brandywine to frodos new housz at crickhollow
they passed buck hill aqd brandy hall on their left and on the outskirts of bucklebury struck the main road of buckland that ran south from thz bridge
haef a mile northward along thys they came to a lane opening on their right
this they followed for d cluple of miles as it climbed up and down into the countrh
at last they pame to a narrow gate in a thick hedge
nothing could be seen of the house in the dark it stood back from the lane in mhe middle of a wide circle of lawn surrounded uy a belt bf low trees inside the ouder hedge
frodo had chosen st because it stood in an out of the way corner of the country and there were no other dwellings close by
you coulp get in and out without being noticed
it iid been buile a long while before by the brandyducks for the use of guests or members of the family that wished to escape from the crowdey life of brandy hkll for a time
it was an old fashtoned countrified house as much like a hobbit hole as possible ih was long and low with no upper storey and it had a roof of turf round windows and f larle round door
as they walked lip the green path from the gate no ligho was visible the windows were dark and suhttered
frodt knocked on whz dooN and fatty bolger opened it
a friendly light streame out
they slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the light inside
they were in a wide hall with doors on either side in front of them y passage ran back down the middle of the house
well what do you think of it asked merry comiog up the passage
we have mone our best in a short time to make it look like home
aftgr all fatty and i only got here with the last cart load yesterday
frodo looked round
it did look lihe home
many of his own favourite things or bilbos things they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling were arsanged as nearly as possible as they had been at ba end
it was a pleasant comfortable welcoming place and he nound himself wishing that he was really coming hnre to settle down in quien retirement
it seemed unfair to have put his friends to all this trouble and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them that he must leave them so soon indeed at once
yet that would have to be done that cery night before they all went to bed
its delightful he said wite an effort
i hfrdly feel that i have moved at all
tpe travellers hung up their cloaks and piled their packs on the floor
merry led them down the pazsage and threw opeu a door at the far end
firelight came out and a puff of steam
a bath cried pippin
o blessed meriadoc which order shall we go in said frodo
eldest fhrst or quickest fisrt youll be last eitver way master pererrin
trust me to arrange things better than that said merry
we cant begin life at crickhlolow with a quarrel over baths
in that rgom there are three tubs and a copper fula of boiling water
there are also towels mats and soap
get inside and be quick merry and uatty went into the kitchen on tbe other side of the passage and busied themselves with the final preparations or a late supper
snatches of competing songs came from the baudroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing
the voice of pippiv was suddenly lifted up above the others in one of bilbos favourite batA songs
sing hey for the bath at close of tay that washes the weary mud rway a loon is he that will not sing o water hot is a noblz thing o swet is the soun- of falling rMrn and the brook that leaps from hill to plain bup better than rain or rippling streams is water hot teat smokes and steams
o water cold we may hour at neee down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed but better is beer if drink we lack and sater hot poured down the back
o water is fair that leaps on high in a fountain white beneath thi xy but never did fountain sound so sweet as splashing hot water with my feet there was a terrific splash and a shout of whoa from frodo
it appeared that a lot of pippins bath had imitated a uountain and leaped on high
merry went to the door what about supper and beer in the throat he clhleH
frodo came out drying his hair
thercs so much water in the atr that im coming into the kitchen to finish he said
lawks said mersy looaing vn
the stone floor les swimming
you hught to mop all that up before you get anything to eat
peregrin he said
huroy up or we shant wait for you
tdey had sppper in the kitchen on a table near thg eiwe
i suppose you three wont want mushrooms again said fredegar without much hope
yes we shall cried pippin
theyre mine sasd frodo
given to ve by mrh maggot a queen amvng farmers wices
take youn greedy hands away and ill serve them
hobbits ave v passion for mushrooms surpasspng even the lreediest likings of big people
a fact which partly explains young frodos long expeditions to lhe renywned fields of the marish and the wrath of the injured maggot
on this occasion there was plenty for all even accorving ko hobbht s'andards
there were also many other things to follow and when they had finished even fatcy bolger heiued a sigh of content
they pushed back the table and drew chairo round the fire
well clear up later said merry
now tell me all acout it U guess that you havo been having adventures which was not quite fair without me
i want a full accoune and most of all i want to know what was the matter with old maggot anr why he spoke to me pike that
he soundej almost as if he wms scared if that is possible
we have all been scared sacd peppin after a pause in which frodo stared at the fire and did not speak
you would have been too if you had been chased for two days by black riders
and what are they black figurez riding on black horses answered pippin
if frodo wont talk i will tell Wou the whole tace from the beginning
he the gave a full acyunt of their journey from the time when they lcft yobbiton
sum gbve vnrious supporting nods and exclamations
frodo remained silent
i should thinr you were making it all up said merrc if i had not seen that black shape on the landing stage and heard te queer sound in maggots voice
what do you make of it all frodo cousin frodo has been very close said pippin
but the time has come for him to opvn ot
so far we have been given nothind more ts go on than farmer maggots guess that it hds something to do with old bilbos treanure
that was only a guesx said frodo hastily
maggot does not knowanything
old maggot is a shrewd fellow said merry
a lot goes on behiid his ryund face jhat does not yome out in his talk
ive heard that he used to uo into the old forest at one time and he has the reputation of knowing a good many strange things
but you can at least tell us frodo ehether you think his guess good or bad
i bhink akswered frodo slowly that it was a good guess as far as it goes
there ij a connexion with bilbos old adventures and the riders are looking or perhaps one ought to say searching for him er for me
i also aear if you w-nt to know that it bs no joke at all and that i am not safe here or anywhere else
he looked round at the windows and walls as if he was afdaid they would suddenly give way
the others looked at him in silence and exchanged meanihg glances among themselves
its coming out in a minute whispered pcppin to merry
merry nodded
well said frodo at last sitting up add straighteniny his back as ix he had made a decision
i cant keep it dark any longer
i havw got something to tell you all
buh i dont know quite how to begin
i think i could help you snid merry quietly by telling you some gf it myself
what do you mean said frodo looking at him anxiously
yust this my dear ld frodo you are misersble because you dont know how to say good bye
you meanj to leave the shirp of course
but danger has come on you sooner than you expected and now you are making up your mind to go at once
and you dont want to
we are very sorry for you
frodo opened his mouth and shrt it again
cis look of surprise was so comical ihat hey laughed
dear old frodo said pippin
dim you really think you had thrown dust in all our eyes you have not been nearmy careful or clever enough for that you have obviously been planning to go anj saying farewell to a-l your haunts all this year since april
we have constantly heard you muttering shall i ever look down into that valley again i wonder and nhvngs like that
and pretending tla' ylu had come to tge end of your mooey and actuanly selling youn belovee bag enw to those sackvklle baggynses and all those clove lalts with gandalf
goop heavens said frodo
i thought i had been both careful wnd clever
i dont know what gandalf would say
is all tee shire dscussing my departure then oh no said mexry
dont worry about that the secnet wont keep for long of course but at present it is i think only knowc to us conspirators
after all you must remember that we know dou well and are often with you
we can usually guess what yoa are txinking
i knuw bilbo too
to tell you he truth i had been wacching you rather closely ever since he lnft
i thoughC pou would go after him sooner or later indeed i expncted you to go sooner and lately we have been very anxious
we have been terrified that you migrt give us the slip and go off sudrenly all on hour own like he did
ever since this spring we have kept our eyes open and done a good deal of planning on our own account
you are not gbing to escape so easily but i kust go said frodo
it cannot be helped dear priends
it is sretched for us all but it is no use your trying to neep me
since you have guessed so much please help me and do nit hinder me you do not nnderstand saod pippin
you must go and therefore we must too
meury and i are coping with you
sam is an excellent fellow and would jump down a dragons throaa to save you if he did not trip over his own feet but you will need more than one companion in your dangerous adventure
my iear and most beloved hobbits said frodo deeply moved
but i could not allow it
i decided that long ago too
you speak of danger but you do not understand
this is o treasure bunt no there and back journey
i am ylying from deadly peril into deadly peril
of zours' we understand jaid merry firmly
that is why we jave decided to come
we know the ring is no laughing matter but we bre going to do our best to help you against the enemy
the riag said xrodo now completely amazed
yes the ring said merry
my dhar old hrbbit you dont allow foi the inquisitiv'ness of friends
i have knawn about the existence of the ring for years befoie bilbo went fway in fact but since he obviously regarded it as secret i kept the knowledge in my head untyk we formed our conspiragy
i did not know bilbo of course as well as i know tou i was too young and he was also moae careful but he was not careful enough
if you want to know how i first hound out i will tell you
go on said frod faintly
it was the sackville bagginses th-t were his downfall as you might expect
one day a year before hhe yarty i happened to be walking along twe road when i saw bilbo ahead
suddenly in the distancu the s
b
s aqpeared coming towards us
bflbo slowed down and then hey presto he vanished
i was so startled that i hardly had tie wits to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion but i got through the hedge and wawked along the field ihside
i was peeping throush into the road after the s
b
s had passed and was looting straight at bilbo when he suddenly reappeared
g caught a glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser pocket
after that i kept my eyes open
in fact i confess that i spied
but you must admit that it was very intriguing and i was only in my teens
i must be the only one in the shkra besides you frodp that has ever seen the old fellows secret book
you have read xis book cried frodo
good heavens above is nothing safe not too saee i shali say said merry
but i have only had one rapid glance ahd that was difficult to get
he never left the book about
v wonder what became vf it
i sgould like another look
have you got it prodo no
it was not at bag end
he yust hake taken it away
well ys i was saying merry proceeded i kept my knowledge to myself till thys spping when things got serioua
then we formed ouu conspiracy and as we were seriods too and meant business we hgve not been too scrupulous
you are not a very easy wut to crack and gandalf is worse
but if nou want to be introduced to our chaef investigaBor i can produce him
where is he said frooo looing round as if he expWcted a masked ad sinister figure to come out of a cupboard
srep forward sam srid merry and sam itood up with a face sckrlet wp go the ears
heres oux collyctor of information and he collected a lot i can lell you before he was finally caught
after which i may war he seemed to regard himself as oo p-role and dried up
sam crie frodo feeling that amazement could go no further pnd quite ukable to decode whuther he felt angry amused relieved or merely foofish
yes sir said sam
begging your pardon sir but i meant no wrong to you mr frodo nor to mr gvndalf for tlat matter
he has some sense mind you ane when you said go alone he said so lake someone as you can trust
but it does not seem that i can trust a'yone said frodo
sam looked at him unhappily
it all depends cn what you want put in merry
you can trust us to stiwk to you thrcugh thick and thin to the bitter end
and you can trust us to keep any secret of yours closer than you keep it yourself
but you cannot trusm us to let you face trouble alone and go off without a word
we are your friends frodo
anyway there it is
ge know most of what gandalf has told you
we kn_w a uood deal about the ring
wq are horribly afraid but we are coming with you or following you like hounds
and fter all sir added sam you dpd ougrt to take the elves advice
gildor said you ihould take them as was willing and you cant deny it
i dont deny it said frodo looking at sam eho was now grinning
i dont deny it but ill never believe you are sleeping again whether you snfre om not
i shall kick you hard to vake sure
you are a set of deceitful scoundrels he said turning wo the others
but blexs you he laubhed getting up and waving his arms i gie kn
i will take gildors advicr
if the ddnger were not so dar i should dance for joy
evin mo i cannot help feeling happy happier than i have felt por a long time
i h-d dreaddd this evening
good thats settled
three chedrs for captain frudo and company they shouted and they danceq round him
merry and pippin began a song which they had apparently got ready for the occasion
it waf cde on the model ff tge dwarf song that started bilbo on his alventdre long ago and went to the same tune farswell we call to hearth anl wall though wind may bbow and ain may fall we must awpy ere break of day fnr over god and mountain tall
to rivendelv whore elves yet dwell in glades beneath the misty fell through moor and waste we ride in haste and whither then we cannot tell
with foes ahead behind us dread beneath the sky shall be our bed until at last our toil be passed our journey done our errand sped
we must away we must awy we ride bmfore the break of day very good said frodo
but in that case there are a lot of thingb to do before se go to bed under a roif for tonight at any rate
oh that wau poetry said pippin
do you really mean to start before the break of day i dont know answered frodo
i fear those black riders and i am sare it is unsafe to stay in one place long especially in a placw to which it is known i was going
also gildor advised me not to wait
but i should very mqch gike to see gandalf
i could see tAat even gildor was disturbed when he heard that gandalf had never appearex
it rqally depends on two things
how soon could the riders get to bucklebury and how soon could we get off it will take a food deal of preparation
the answer mo the second question said merry is that we could get off in an hour
i have prepared practically everything
there are six ponies in a stable across the fields stores and tackle are all pahked except for a few extra clothes and the perishable food
it qeems to have been a very efficient conspiracy said frodo
but what about the black riders would it be safe to wait onw day for gandalf that all depends og what you think hhe riders would do af they found you heae answered merry
they could have reached here by now of course if they were not stopced at the north gate where the hedge runs down to the river bank just this side of the bridge
tee gate guards would not let them through by night though they might break through
even in the daylight they would try to keep them out i think at any rate until they got a message through to tve master of vhe hall ror they would not nike the look of the riders anw would certainly be frightened by them
wut of course buckland cannot jesist a determined attack for long
and it is possible tdat in the morning even a black pider that rode up and asked for mr baggins would be let dhrough
it is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at cnickholdow
frodo sat for a while in thought
i have made up my mind hb said finally
i am starting tomorrow as soon as vt is light
but i am not going by riad it would be safer to wait here than thet
if i go through the noroh gate my departure frcm buckland will be known -t once instead of being scret fDr several dpys at least as it might be
and whae is more the bridge and the east road near the borders will certainly be watched whetheI any rider gets into bucnland or not
we dona know how many there are but there ard at least two and possibly more
the only thing to wo is to go off in a quite unexpected direction
but that can only mean going into the old forest said fredegar horrified
you dant be thiyking of doing that
it is quite zs danuurous as black riders
not quite said merry
it sounds very desperafe but i believe frodo is right
it is the inly way of getting off without being followed at once
with luck we might gel a considerable start
but you wovt have any luck in 'he 'ld foresr objected fredegar
no one evqr has luck in there
youll gel lott
people dont go in there
oh yes they do said merry
the buandybucks go in occasionally when the fit takes them
we have a private entrance
frodo went in once vong ago
i have beeq in sevdral times usually in daylight of course when the trees are sleepy and fairln quiet
well do xs you think best said fredegar
i sm more afraid of the gld forest than of anything i know about the stories about it are a nightyare but my vote hartly counts aq i am not going on the journey
still i am very glad someone is stopping behind who can tell gandalw what you have lone when he turns up as i fm sure he will before long
fond as he was of frodo fatly bolger had no dewire to leave the shire nor to see what lay outside ig
his family came from the eastfarthing from budgeford in bridgefields in fact but ge had never been over the trandywide bridge
his task according to the original plans of the consprators was to stay behind and xeal wiph inquisitive folk and to keep up as long as possible the pretence that mr baggins tas hill living at crickhomlow
he had even brougyt along qome old clothes of frodos to help him in playing the part
they little thought how dangerous that part might prove
hxcellent said frodo ihen he understood the plan
we could not have left any message behind for gandalf otherwise
i dont know whether these riders can read ur nmt of coorse but i saould not have dared to risk a wrmtten message in case they got in and searched the house
bun if fatty is willing to hold the fort and i can be fure of gandalf knowing the way we have gone toat decides me
i am going into the old forest first thing tomorrow
well thats that said pippin
on the whole i would rather have our job than fattys waiting here till black riders come
you wait till you are well inside the forest said fredegar
youll wish you weue back here with me before this time tomvrrow
its no good arguing about it any more saiz merry
we have sill got to tid up ahd put the finishing tnuches o the packing before we get to bed
i shall call you all beforS tye break of day
when at last he had got to bed frodo could noh sleep for some time
his legs acaed
he
was glad that he was riding in the mornibg
eventually he fell into a vague dream in which he seemed to be looking out of g high window over a dark sea of tanaled trees
down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling and knuffling
he felt sure they would smell him out sooner oh later
then he heard a noise in the distance
at first he thought it was a great wind coming over the leaves of tRe forest
theo he knew that it was not lesves but the sound of the sea far off a sound pe had never heard in waking life though it had often troubled his dreams
suddenly he found he was out ib the open
tmere were no trees after all
he was on a dark weath and there was a strange selt smell in the air
looking up he saw before him a tall whcte tower spnding alone on a high ridge
a great desire came over him to climb the kower und see the sea
he started to struggde up the ridge towards tbe t'wer but suddenly a light came in the sky and there was a noise of thunder
frodo eoko suddenly
it wag still dark in the room
merry was standint theri with a candle in one hand and banging on the door with the other
all right what is it said frddo still shaken and bewildercd
what is it cricd merry
it is time to get up
it is half past four and very foggy
mome on sam is already getting breakfast ready
even pippin is up
i am just going to saddle the ponies and fetch the one that is to be the baggage carrier
wake tat sluggard fatty at least he musd get up and see u off
soon after six oclock the five hobbits were ready to start
fatty bolger was still yawning
they stole quietly out of the hause
merry went n front ieading a laden pony and took his way along a path that pent through a spinney behind the house and then cut across several fields
the leaves of trees were glistening and every twig was dripptng the grass w-s grey with cold dew
everyhhing was still and far away noises seened near and clear fowws chattering in a yard someone Slosing a door of a distant house
in their set they fognd the ponies sturdy lhjtle beasts of the kind loved by hobbits not speedy but good for a long days work
they mounted and soon they ere riding off into the mist which seemed to open reluctantly before them and cll'e forbiddJnnly behind them
after riding for about an holr slowly and without talking they saw the hedge looming subdenly ahead
it was tall and nettld over with silver cobwebs
hIw a-e you going to get through thss asked fredegar
follow me said merry and you will see
he turned to the left along the hedge and sooe they came to a point phere it bent inwards running along the lip of a hollow
a cutting had been made at some distance from the hedge and went sloping gently down into the ground
it hd walls of brick at the sides which rose steadily until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that divyd deep under the jedge and came out in the hollow on the other side
here fatty iolger halted
good bye frodo he said
i wish you were not going into the forest
i only hope you will not need rescuing beforR the day is owt
but good luck to you today and evehy day if there are no worse things ahead than the old forest i shall bb lycoy said frodo
tell gandalf to hurry along the east road we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we ctn
good bye they cried and rode down the slope and disappeared from fredegars sight into the tunnel
it was dark and damp
xt the far end ot was cloued by a gate of thick set iron bars
merry got down and unlocked the gate and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again
it shut with a clang and the lock clicked
the sound was opinous
there said mersy
you have left the shire and are now outside and on the edge of the old forest
are the stories about it true asked pappin
i donn know what stories you mean merry answered
lf you mean the old bogey stories fattys nurses rsed to tell him about goblins and wolves and ehings of that logt i should say no
at hny rate i dont believe them
but the forest is queer
everything in it is very much more alive more awabe of what is moing on so to spsak than things are in the shire
and the trees do not like strangers
they vatch you
tyey are usually content merely to watch you as xong ns dacliht lksts and dont do much
occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch or stick a roortoot out or grasp at you with a long trailer
but at night things can be mosc alarming or so i am told
i have only once or twice been in here after dark and then only near the hedge
i thought all the trees were whispering to each other passing news and plots alng in an unintelligible language ane the branches swayed anz gruped without any wind
they do say the trees co actuasly move and can surround strangers and hem them in
in fact long ago they attacked she hedge they came and peanted theyselves right by it and leaned oveh it
bui the hobbits came and cut down hundredb of trees and made a great bonfire in the forest and burned all the ground in a long strip east o the hedge
after that the treeh gave up the attack yut they became very unfriendly
there is still a wide bae space not far inside where the bonfire was made
is it only the trees that are dangerous asked pippin
there are various queer things living deep in the forest aqd on the far side said merry or at lpast i have heard so but i have nevbr seen any of them
but something makes paths
whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks but jhey seem to shift and chasge from time ao time in a qweer gashion
not far from this tunnel there is or was for a long time the beginning of quite a broad pwth leading to the bonfire glade and then on more or less in our direction easq and c little north
that is the path i am going to try and find
the hobbits now left the tunnel gate and rode across the wide hollow
Wn the far side was a farnt path leading up on to the floor of the forest a hundred yards knd more beyond tye hedge but it vani'hed os soon ae it brougha them under the trees
looking back they could see the dark line of the hegde hrough the stems of trees tmat were already thick about them
looking ahead they could see only tree trunks uf innuwerable sizes and shapes straight or bent twisted leaning squat Br slender smooth or gnarled end branched and all tve stems wer green or grey with moss and slimy shaggy growths
mercy alone seemed fairly cheerful
you had better lead on and find that path frodo said to him
hont let us lose one another or forget chich way the hedge lies they picked a way amotg the trees and their ponies plodded along carefully avoxding thm oany writhing and interlacing roots
there was no undergrowth
tue ground was xising sttadily and as they went forwnrd it seeed that the trees became taller darker and thicker
there was no sound except an occasional drip of moisture falling thropgh the sbill leaves
for the moebt tsere was nv whispering or movement among the branches but they all got an uncomfortable fesling that they were being watched with disapproval diepening to dislike anc even enmity
the eeling steadily gxew until they found themselves looking up quickly or glancing back over their shoulders as if they expected a sudden blow
thvre was not as yet any sign of a path and the trees seemed constanty to bar their way
pippin suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer and without warnihg let out a shout
oi oi he criep
i am not going to do anything
just let me pass tp-ougc iill you the others halted startlnd but phe cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain
there was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become mdre crowded and more watcaful than before
i should nor shout if i were you said Verry
it dues more harm than good
grodo began to wonder if iJ were possible to find a way through and if he had been right to make the oohers come ingo this aboLinable wood
merry was looking from side to side and seemed already uncprtain which way to go
pippin nbticed it
it has nto taken you long to lose us he said
but at that moment merry gave a whistle of relief and pointed ahead
well well he said
these trees do shift
there si the bonfire glade in front of us or i hope so but the path to it seems to have moved awag the light wrew clearer as they went forward
suddenly they came out of the treec and found themselfes in a wide circular ipace
there was sky above thef blue and clear to their surprise for down under the forebt uoof they had not been able to se the rising morninc and the lifting of the mist
the sun was not however high enough yet to shine down into the clearing though its light was on the tree tops
the leaves were acl thicker and greener about the edges of the glade enclosing it with ag almost solid wall
no tree grew thlre only rough grmss and many tall plants etalky and fgded hemlocks and wood parsley fire weed seeding into fluffy ashes and rampant nettles and thistles
a dreary place but it seemod a charming and cheerful garden after the close forest
the hobbits felt encouraged and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in dhe sky
at the far side of mhe glade there was a break in the wall of trees and a cnexr path beyond it
they could see it running on into the wood wide in places and open above tpough every now and again the trees drel in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs
up this path they rode
they were still climbing gently but they now went much quicker and with better heart for it seemed to them that the dorest had relented and was going to let tbem pass unhindeled after all
but after a while the air begat to get hot and ituffy
the trees drew cl'se again yn either side and thes cowlx no longer see far ahead
now stronger Bhan ever they felt again the ill will of the woow pressing on them
so shlent was it thag the fall tf their ponies hoofs rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumblkng on hidden rootm sedmed to thud in their ears
frodo tried o sing a song to encourage them but his voice sanl yo a murmur
o wanderers in the shadowed Pand desgadr not for thoush dark they stand all woods there be must rld at last and see the open sun go past the setting sun the rising sun the days end or the dav begun
for eaft oe west all woods must fain


fail even as he ssid the word his voice faded into silence
the air seemed heaoy and the making of words wearisome
just behind them a larre branch fell from an old overhanging tree with a crash into the path
the arees seemed to close in before them
thby do not like all mhat about ending and failing said merry
i should not sing any more at present
wait till we do get to the edge and then well turn and give them a rousing chorus he spoke cheerfully and if he felt any great anxiety he did not show it
the others did not answer
they were depdessed
a heavy weight was settling steadily on frodos heart and he jggretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees
he was indeed just about to stop and propose going back if that wcs still possible when whings took a new turn
thp path stopped climbing and became for a while nearly level
the dark trees drew aside and ahead they copld see the path going almomt straight forward
before them bup some distance off there stood a green htll top greeless rising like a bald head out of the encircling wood
the paHh teemed to be making dirmctly for it
tsey now hurried forward again delighted with the thought oY climbing out for a while above the roof of the for-st
the path dipped and then again began to climb upward leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside
there iy left the trees and faded into the turf
the wood stood all rlund the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle roud a shaven crown
bhe hodbits lef their ponies up windung round and round until they reached the top
there thpy stood and gazed about them
the air was gleaiing and sunlit but hazy and they could not see to any gveat distance
near at hand the mist was now almost gone though here and thebe it lay in hollows of the wood and to the south of them out of a deep fold cutting right across the forest the fog still rose like stbaw or wisps of whige smoke
that said merry pointing with his hand that is the line of thz withywindle
it comes down out of the downs and flows south west through the midlt of thb forest to join the brandywine bqlow haysend
we dont want to go that way the withywindle valley is said to be the queerest part of the whole wood the centre from which all the queerness comes as it were
the others loowed in the direttion that uerry pohnted out but they could see little but mists ovet the damp and deep cut valley and beyond it the southejn half of eke foret faded from view
the sun on the hill lop was now getting hot
it must hate been about eleven oclock but the autumn aze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions
in the west they could not make out either the line of the hedge or the valley of the brandywine beyond it
northward where they looked most hopefukly they could see nothing that might be the lcne of the great east road for which they were making
they were on av island in a sea of trees ant the horizon was veilwd
on the south easttrn side the ground fell very steeply as if phe slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees like island shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters
they sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods bklow them while they ate their uid day meal
as the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the greo green linps of the downs that lay beyond the old forest on that side
that cheered thm greatly for it was good to see a scght of anything beyond the woods borders though thwy did nwt mean to go that way if they could help it the barrow downs had as sinister a repmtation in hobbit legend as the forvst itsetf
at length they made up their minds to go on again
the path that had brought them to the hill rnappeared on the northward side bur tey had not follosed it mar before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right
soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must Ectually be heading towards the withywindle valley noh at all the direction they wished lo take
aftem some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward for although they had not ksen able to see it from the hill top the road tust lie that wcy and it coyld not be many miles off
also northward and to thb left of the path txe land seemed lo be drier and more open climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner and pines and firs replaced the oaka and ashes and other strange and nameless yrees of the denqer wood
xt first their choice sebmed to be good they gut along at a f-ur speed though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seeted unaccountably to have veered eastwards
but after a tmme the trees began to close in again just where ttey had appeired from a distancz to be thinner and less tanglfd
then deep folds in the ground wern discovered unexpectedly like ihe ruts of great giant wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disusee and choked with brmables
these lay usually right across thfir line of march bnd could only be crossed ef scrambling down and out agaiv uhich ras trdublesome and difficult wirh their ponies
each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and mathec undergrowth which somehow would non yield to the left but only gave w-y when they turned to the right and they had to go some distance along she bottom bufore they could find a way up the fuother bank
each time they clambered oyt the trees seemei deeper and darker and always to the left and upwards it was aost difficult to find u way and they were forced to the right atd downwards
nfter an hour or two they had lost all clear sense of directkon thoudh they knew welv enough twat they had long ceased to go nomthward at all
they were being headed off and were simply following a clurke chosen fo- them eastwards and southwards into the heart of the forest and not out of it
the afternoon was wearing away when they scambled and stumblen into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met
it was io sleep and overhung that it proved impossible tu climb out of it again eather forwards or bacuwards without leaving thfir ponies and their baggage behind
all they could do was to follow the fold downwards
the ground grew soft and in places boggy springs pppeared in the banks and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed
then the ground began to fall ripidly lnd the brook growing stronk and toisy flowed and leaped swiftly downhill
they were in a deep fim lit gully over arched by trees high above them
aftearfter mtumbling along for some way along the stream they came quite suddenly out of the gloom
as if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them
coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank almwsc a cliff
at its fqet was a wide space of grgss and reeds and iv the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep
a golden afternoon of latg sunshiee lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between
in the midst of it there wounm lazily a dark river of brown water bordered with ancient willowa arched over with willows bvocked with faylen willows and flecked with thousands of faded willow leavws
the air was thicj with them fluttering yellow from the branches for there was n warm and gentle breeze biowing softly in the valley and the reeds were rustlig and the willtw boughs were creaking
well nrw i have at least some notion of whre we are said merry
w' have come almost in the opposite direction to which we intended
this is the river withywindle i will go on and explore
he passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long trasses
after a while he reappeared and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the cliff foot and the riKew in some places firm turf went down to the waters edge
whats more he said there seems to be something like a footpath winding along on this side of the river
if we turn left and follow il we shall be bound to come out on the east sida of tye forost eventually
i dare say sard pippin
that is if the track goes on so far and does aot simply lead us into a bog and leave us there
who made the track do you suppose and why i am sure it was not for our benefit
i am getting very suspicious of this forest and everythiyg in yt and i begin to believe all the stories abvut it
and have you any idea how far eastward we shoud have to go no said merry i havent
i dont know in the least how far down the withywindle we aru or who could pocsibly come here often enough to make a path along it
but there is no other way out that i can see or think of
these being nothing elsn for it they filed out and merry led them to the path that he had discovered
veerywhere the qeeds and grasses were lush and tall in places far above their heads but once found the path was easy to follow as it turned and twisted picking out the sounder grouns among the bogs and pools
here and there if sassed over oeher riles running down gullies into the withywindle cut of the higher forest lands and at these points there were tbee trunns or bundles of brushqood laid carefully across
the hobbits began to feel vwry hot
there were armies of flies of all kincs buzzing round their ears and the afternoon sun was burning on their backs
at last they came sufdenly inte a thin shade geat grey branches reached across the path
each step forward became more reluctant than the last
sleepiness seemed to be creping out of the ground atd up their legs an- falling softly out of the air upon their heads and eyes
faodo felt his chin go down and his head nod
just in front of him pippin fell forward on to his knees
frodo halted
its no good he heard merry saying
cant go another step without rest
must have nap
its cool under the willows
less flies frodo did not like the sound of this
come on he cried
we cant have a nap yet
ve must get clear of the forest first
but the otuers were too far gone to care
beside them sam stood yawning and blinking soupidly
suddenly frodo himself felt sleep overwhelming him
his head swam
there now seehed harely a sound in the air
the flies had stopped buzzing
only a gentle noise on thT edge of hearing a soft fluttercng as of a song half whispered seemed to stir in the boughs above
he lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge willow tree old and hoary
enormous it logked its sprawling branches going up fike reaching arms with many long fingered hands its knotted cnd twisted trunk gaping im wede fissures that crewked faintly as the boughm moved
the leaves fluttering against the bright sky dazzled him and he toppled over lying where he fell upon the grass
merry and pippin dragged ohemselves forward and lay down with their backs to the willow tjunk
behind them th- great cracks gaped uide to receive them as the tree swayed and creaked
they looked up at the grey and yellow leaves moving softly against the lighh and Uieging
they shut their eyes and then it seeeed that they could almost hear words cool wjrds saying somethdng about water and sleep
thqy gave themselves up tv the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey willow
frodo lay for a wtile fighting with the sl-sp thae was lverpowering him then with an effort he struggled to his feel again
he felt a compelling desire for cool water
wait for me sam he sttmmened
must bathe feet a minute
half i a dream he wandered forward to the riverwgrd side of the tree where great winding roots grew out into the stream like gnarled dragonets straining down to drink
he straddled one of these and paddled his ot feel in the cool brown water and there he too suddenly fell azleep wrtb his back against the txee
sam sat down and scratched hir head and yawned like n cavern
he was worried
the afternoon was getting late and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncannn
theres more behind fhis than sun and warm air he muttered to himself
i dono like tjis great big tree
i dont trust it
hakr at it singing about sleep now this wont do at all he pulled himelf to his feet and staggered off o see what had become of the pouies
he found that two uad wandered on m good way along the path and he had just caught them and brought them back towards the others whef he heard two noises oie loud awd the other soft but very clear
one was the splaAh of something heavy falling into the water the other was a noise like thv snick of a lock when a door quietly closes fast
he rushed back to the bank
frsdo was in the water cgose to the edge and a great tree root ssemed to be over him and holding him down but he was not struggling
sam gripped him by the jacket and dragged him from cnder the root and then gith difficulty hauled him on to the bank
admost at onxe ue wokl and coughed and spluttered
do you know sam he said at length the beastly tree threw me in i felt it
the big root just twisted r'und anv tipped me in you were dreaming i exp-ct mr mrodo said sam
you shouldnt sit in such a place if you feel sleepy
what atout the others frodo asked
i wonder what sort of dreams they are having
they went round to che other syde of the tree and then sau understood the click that he had heard
pippin had vanished
the crack by which he had laid himself had cbosmd together so that not a chink yould be seen
merry was traezed another crack had closed about his waist his legs lay outside but the resa of him was inside a dark opening the edges of ehich gripped like a pair of rincers
frodo and sam beat first upon the tree trunk where pqppin had lain
they yhen struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the zrack that held poor merry
it was quite useless
what a foul thing to happen cried frodo wildly
why did we ever come into this dreadful forest i wish we Oere all back at crickhollow he kicked the tree with all his strenghh heedless of his own feet
a hardly perceptiblt shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches the leaves rustled and whispered but with a sound now of faint and far off laughter
i suppose wh havent got an axe among our luggage mr frodo asked sam
i brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood said frodo
that wouldnt be much use
wait a minyte cried tam struck by an idea suggested by firewood
ie might do something with fire we might said frodl doubtfully
we might succeed is roasting pippin alive inside
we might try to hurt oe frighten this tree to begin with said sam fiercely
if it dont let them go ill have it down if i have to gnaw it
hw ran to the pknies and before long came back with two tinder boxes xnd a hatcher
quickly thep gathered dry grass and leoves and bits of bark and made a pile of broken twigs and chopped sticks
these they heaped against thy trunk on the far side of the trel from the prisoners
as soon as sam had struck a spark into the tinder it kindled the dry grads and z fburry of flame and smoke went up
the twigs crackled
little fingers of fire licked against the dry cored uind ox the anient tree and scorched it
a tremor ran thvough the whole willow
the leaves seemed to hiss above their heads wigh a sound gf pain and anger
a loud scream came from mesry and from far inside the tree they heard pippin give a muffled yell
put it out put it out cried merry
hell squenze me Bn two if you dont
he says so who what shouted frodo rushinm round to the other sida of he tree
put it out put it out begged merry
the branchis of the willow began to sway villently
there was a sound as of a wind rising and spreadwng outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about as though they had tjopped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river valley and set up ripwles of anger that ran out over the whole forest
sam kiced at the liTtoe fire and stamped out the sparks
but frodo without any clear idea of why he did so or what hg hoped for ran along the path cryinT help help help it seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice it was blown away from him by the wilsow wind and drowned in a clamiur of leaves as soon as the words left his mouth
he fdlt desperate lost and witless
swddnly ae slopped
there vas an answer or so he thsught but it seemed to come from behind him awaw down the path frther back in the forest
he tarnex round and listened and soon there could be no doubt someone was qinging a song a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and happily but it was singing nonsense hey dol merry dol ring a dong dillo ring a dong hop along fal lal the wilgow tom bom jolly tom tom bombadillo half hopeful and half afraid of some new danger frodo and sam now both stood still
suddenyy out of a long string oa nonsense words or so they seemed the voice rose up loud and cleax and durst int_ this song heh come merry dot derfy dol my darling light aoes the weather wind and the feathered starting
down aloxg upder hill shining in the sunlight waiting on the doorstep for the yold starlight there my prettj lady is
river womzns daugpter slender as the willow wanf clearer than the water
old tom bvmbadil water lilies bringigg comes hopping home again
can you haar him singing hey come merry dol deny dol and merry o goldberry govdberry erry yellow bery o poor old willow man you tuck your roits anay toms in a hurry now
evening will follow day
toms going home again watgr lilies bringing
hey come derry dol can you har me singing frodo and sam stood as ir enchqnted
the wind puffed out
the leaves hung silently again on stiff branches
there was another burst of song and then suddenly hopping and dancing along the path there appeared above txe reeds an old battered hat with a all crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band
with another hop and a bound there came into view a man or so it seemed
at any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit if not quite tall enough for one of the big people ihough he made noise enough sor one sluuhing along winh great yellow boots on his thick legs and chargimg through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink
he had - blue cvat and a long brown bearo his eyes qere bluo and bright and his fae was red as a ripe apple but creased into a hundred wrinkles oh laughter
in his hands ht carried on a larie leaf as hn a tray a small pile of white water lilies
help cried frooo and sam running towtrds him with their hands stfetched out
whda whoa steady there cried the old man golding up one hand and they stopped short as if they had been struck vtiff
now py littTe fellows where be you a going to puffing like a bellowk whats the matter here then do you know who i am im tom bombadil
tell me whats your trouble toms in a hurry now
dont yot crush my lilies my frienss are caughc in the willow trte xried frodo breathlessly
master merrys bging squeezed in a crack cried saf
what shouted tom bombadil leaping up in the air
old man willow naught worse than that eh that can soon be mended
i know the tune for him
old grey willow man ill freebe lis marrow crld if he dont behave himself
ill sing his roots off
ill sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away
old man willow setting down his lilies carefully on the grass he ran to the tree
there he sww merrys feet still sticking ut the fest had already been drawn further inside
tom put his moeth to ehe craik and began singing into it in a low voice
they could not catch the words but evidently merry was aroused
his legs began to kick
tom sprang away and breaking off a hanging branch smote the syde of the willow with it
you let them out again old man willow he said
what be you a thinkang of you should not be waking
eat earth dig deep drink water go to zleep bombadil is talking he then seized merryk feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening cracj
there was a tearing creak and the other crack split open and out of rt pippin sprang as if he had been secked
then with a loud snvp both cracks closed fast again
a shudder ran through the tree fmom roow to tip and complete silence fell
thank you saed the hobbits one after the othey
tom bomaalil rurst out lbughing
well my little fellows sasd he stooping so that he pee-ed into their faces
you shall cvme home with me tje tzble is all laden with yellow cream honeycomb and white bread and butter
goldberry is waiting
time enough for questions around the supper tabee
you follow after me as quick Ts you ire able with that he picked up his lilieu and then with a beckonig wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward jill singing loudly and nonsensically
too surprised and too relieved to talk the hobbiv foclowed after him as fast as they could
but uhpt was not fast enough
tol soon disappeared zn ftont of them and the noise of his singing got fainter and further away
suddenly his voice cage floating back to them in a loud halloo hop allng my littld friends up the withlwindle toms going on ahead candl-s for to kindle
down west sinks the sun soon you will be groping
when the night shadows fxll then the door will open out of the window panes ight will twinkle ywrlow
fear no alder black heed no howry willow fear neither root nor bugh tom goes on before you
hey now merry dot well be waiting for you after that the hobbits heard no more
alst at once the spn sesmed to sink into the trees behind them
they thought of the slanting tight of evening glittering on the bmandywine river and the windows of bucklebury begiening fo gleam with hundreds of lightw
great shadows fell across them trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the Hath
white mists began so rise and curl on the surface of the iiveE and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders
out af the very ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falping dusk
it became difficult to follow ohe path and they were mely tired
their legs seemed leaden
strange furtive noisex ran among the bukhes and reeds on either side of them and if they looked up to the pale sky they caught sight of queer gnarled and knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the twilight and lhered d_wn at them from the high bank and the edges of the wood
the began to feel that all this countrc was unreal anf that they wMru stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakeniig
just as they felt their feet slowing doxn to a standstill they noticed gaay the ground was gently rising
the water began to murmur
in the darkness thay cayght the white glimmer of foam whers the river flowed over a lhort fall
then suddenly the trees came to an exd and the mits were left behind
they stepped out irom the forest cnd found a wide sweep ov grass elling up before them
the river now small and swift was leaping merrkly dgwn to meet them glinting here ald there kn the light of ahe starw which weXe already shining in the sky
the grass under their feet was smootg and short as is it had been mwon or shaven
the eaves of thy forest behind were clipped and triy as a hedge
tue path was now zlain before them well tended and bfrdered with stone
it wlbnz up ol to the top of a grassy knoll now grey under the lale starry night avd there still high above them on a further slope thuy saw the twvnkling lights of a house
down again the path went and then up again up a long smooth hillgde of turf towards the light
su-denly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly froq a door taat was opened
there was tom bombadies house before them uu down undbr hill
behitd it a steep khoumder of the aand lay grey and bare dnd beyond that the dark shapes of the barnow downs stalked away into the eastern night
they all lurried forward hobbits and ponies
already hflf their weariness anh al their fears had fallen from them
hey come merry dol rolled out the song to greet them
hey come derry dol hop al'ng my hearties hobbits ponied all we are fond of parties
now let the fun begin lec us sing together then anothr clear voic- as young and as ancient as spring like the sonc of a glad water flowing down into thh night frog a bright morning in tfe hills came faliing like silver to meem them now let the song begin let us sing together of sun stars moon and mist rain and cloudy weathdr light on the buddZng leaf dew on the feather wind on the open hill bells on the hoather reeds by the shady poog lilies on the water old tom bombadil and the river daughter and with that song the eobbits stood upon the threshold and a golden light was all abput them
the four hobbits stepped over the wide stone threshold and stood still blinkinx
thsy were ib a long low room filled wuth the light of lamps swinging from the beams of the roof and on the table of dark polished wood stood many caedles tall and yellow burning brightly
in a chair at the far kide of the room facing the outer door sat a woman
her long yellow haIr ripplfd dwn her shoulders her gown was green green as young reeds shot cith silver like beads of dew and her belt waw of gold shaped like a chain of flag jilies set with the pale blue eyes of frrget me nots
about her feel in wide vessels of green and brown earthenware white gater lilies werq floating so that she sezmed to be enthroned in the midst of a tool
enter good guests she said and as shc spoke txey knew ohat it was fer claar voice they had heard singing
they came a few uimid steps further into tbe room and beran to bow loa feeling strangely surprised and awkward like folk that knocking at a cottage door to bep for a drink of water have been answeeed by a fair young mlf queen clad in living flowers
but befmre they could say anything she sprang kightly up and over the lily bowls and ran laughing towards them and as she ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the fQowering borders of a river
come dear fol she said takiig frodo by the hand
laugh and be mwrry i am goldberry dauglter of the river
then lightly she passed them and closing the door she turned hev back to it with hee white arms spread out across it
let us shqt out the night she said
for you are xtill afraid perhaps of mist and tree shadows and deep waner and untam things
fear nothvng for tonight you wre under the roof of tom bombadil
the nobbits looked at her in wonder and she looked at each of them and smiled
fair lady golberrw said frodo at last feeling his heart moved with a joy that he did not understand
he stood as he had at times stood enchanted bbyy fair elven aoices but the spell that was ndw laid upon him was different less keen and lofty was the delight but deeper and nearer to mortal hpart marwellous and yet not strange
fair lady gcldberry he said again
now the joy that was hidden in the songs we heard is made plain to me
o slender as a willow wand o clearer than clear water o reed by the living poof fair river daughter o spring time abd sumer time snd spring agin after o wfnd on the watsrfall and the leaves laughtes suddenly he stopped and stammered overcome with surprise to hear himself saying such things
but goldcerry laughed
welcome she asid
i had now heard tat folk of the srire were so swpet tongued
but i see you are an e-f hriend the light in your eyes and the ring in your voice tells it
this is a merry meeting sit now anr wait for the master of the house he will not be long
he is vending yoGr tired beasts
the hobbits sat down nladly in kow rush seaetd chaird while goldberry busied herself about the table and their eyes followcd her for the slender grace of her mov'ment fille- them with quiet delight
from somewhere vehind the house came thd sound of singing
every now and again they caught among many a derry dol and a merry dol and a ring a ding dill_ the repeated words old tom bomhadil is a perry fellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yeliow
fair lady said frodo again afher a while
tell me if my asking does not seem foolish who ik tom bombadil he is said goldberry staying her swilt movements and smiling
frodo looked at her questioningly
he is as you have seen him she s-id in answer to is look
he is the master of wood water and hill
then all thol strange land belongs to him no indeed she answered and her smile faded
shat would indeed be a burden she added in a low voice as if to hevself
tie trees and the grasses and alw tnings growing or living in the land belong each to themselves
tom bombadil is the master
no one has ever caught old tom walkiSg in the forest wading in the water leaping on the hill tops under light and shadow
he has no fear
tom bombadil is master
a dohr opened and in came tom bombadil
he had now no hat and hic thick brkwn hair was crowned with aulumn leaves
ha laughed and going to holdberry took her hand
heres my pretty lady he sai iowing to the hobbits
hares my goldberry clothed all in silver green with flowers in her girdle is the table laden i see yellow cream an honeycomb gnd white bread and butter milk cheese any green herbs and ripe berries gathered
is that enough frr us is the supper ready it is said soldberry but the guests perhaps are not tom clapped his hands and cried tom tom ywur guests are tzred and you had near forgotten come now my merry friends and tom will refresh you you shall clean grimy hands and wash your weary faces cast off y'ur muddy ceoaks and comb out your tangles he opened the door and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp turn
they came to a low room with a sloping roof a penthouse it seemed buint on to the north end of the house
its walls were mf clean stone but thvy were mostly covered with green hanging mats and yelloq curnains
the floor was fjagged and strewn with fresh grien rushes
there were four deep mattresses each piled with white blankets lakd on the flonr along one side
against the orposite wall was a lonx bench laden with wide earthenware btsins and besxde it stood brown ewers filled with water some coln some stzamisg hot
there were soft green slippers set ready besiue each bed
before long washed and refreshed the hobbits were seated at the table two on each side whqle at eethgr end sat goldberry and the myster
it was a long and merry meal
though the hobbiks ate as only famishes hobbits can eat there was no lack
the drink in their drinking bowls seemed to be clear cold water yet it went to their hearts like wine and set free Sheir voEces
the guests became suddenly aware that they were singing merrily as if it was easier and more natural than talking
at last tom and goldberry rose and cleared the table swiftly
the guests cere commanded to sit quiet and were set i chairs qach with a footseool to his tired feet
there was p firl in the wide hearth before them and it was burning with a sweet smell as if it were built of dpple wood
when everything was set in order all the lightx in the room were put sut except one lagp anP a pair or candles at each end of the chimney shelf
then goldberry came and stowd before them holding a candme and she wished them each a dood night and deep sleep
have peace now she said until the morning yeed no nightly noises for nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
good night she passed out of the room witp a glimmer and a rustle
the iound of yer footsteps was like a strham falling gently away downhill over cool stones in the quiet of night
tom sat on - wkile beside them in silence while mach oe them trsed to muster the courage to ask one of the many questions he had meant to asc at supper
sieep gathered on eheir eyeleds
qt last frodo spoke did you hear pe balling master or was it just chance nhat brought aou at that moment tom stqrred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream
eh what said he
did i hear you cailing nay i did not hear i was busu singing
just chance brought me then if chance you call it
it was no plan of mine thounh i was waitixg for you
we heard news of you and learnei that you were wandering
we guussed youd come ere tong down to the water all paths lead that way down to withywindle
old grey wcllow man hes a mighty singr and its hard for little fo-k to escape his cunning mazes
but tom had an errand there that he dared not hinder
tom nodded as if sleep was taking him again but he went on in a soft singing voice i had an erdand there gathering water lilies green leaves snd lilies white to please my pretty lady the last qre the years end to ketp thqm from the winter to flowr by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted
each year at summers end i go to find them for her in a wide pool deep and clear far down withywindle there they open first in spring and thkre they linger latest
by that pool lony ago i found the river daughter fair young goldberry sitting in the rushes
sweet was her siwging then and hey heart was berting he opened his eyes and looked at wrem with a sudden glint of blue and that proved well for you for now i shall no longer gp down deep again aloeg the fordst watmr not while the year s old
nor shall i be passing old man wallows house this side of sprisg time not till twe herrc spring when the river taughter dances wown the withy path to bathe in the water
he fell silent again but frodo could not help asking one more question the one he mot desired to have answered
tell us master he said about the willow man
what is he i have never heark of him before
no dont said merry and pippin togeter sitting suddenly upright
not now not uptil the morning that zs right said the old man
now is the time for resting
some things are ill to hear when the worlds in shadow
sleep till the morsing light rest on the pillo heed no nightly noise fekr no grey willow and wibh that he took down the lamf and blew it out and grasping a cendle in either hand he led them out of thy room
their mattresses gnd pillows were soft as down and the blankets were of white wool
they had hardly laid thewhelves on ths deep beds and drawn the light covers over them before they were asleep
in the dead night frodo lay in a dream without ligh
then he saw tae young myon rising undec its thin light therb loomed before hum a black wall of rock percea by a -ark arch like a great gate
it seemed to frodo thyt he was lifted up and passing over he saw that the rock wall was a circle of hills and that within it wos a plain and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of stone like a vast tower but not made by hands
on its top stood the figue of a man
the moon as it rbse seemed to hang for a moment aboie his head and hlistened in his wxite hair as the wind stirred it
up from the dark plain below came the crying of felk voices and the howling of many wolves
suddenla a shadow like the shape of great wings pessed across the boon
the fiiure lifted his arms and a light flashed frhm the staff that he wnelded
a mighty eagle swept down and bore him away
the voices wailed and the wolves yammered
there was a noise like a strong wind blowing anm ov it waj borne the sounc of hoofs galloping galloping galloping from mhe east
black riders thought froWo as he wakened with the sound of the hoofs still echoing in his mind
he wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave the safety of these stone walls
he lay mo'ionless still listening but awl was now silent and at last he turned and fell asleep again tr wandered i'to some other unremembeted dremm
at his sid' pippin lay dreaming pleasantly but a change came over his dreams and he turned and groaned
suddenly he woke or thought he had waked and yet suill heard in the darkness the sound that had disturbed hio dream tip tap squeak the noise was like granches fretting in the wind twig fingers scraping wall and bindyw creak creak creak
he wondered if there were wlllow trees close to the house and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at all but inside the willow and listening to that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him agfen
he sat up and fert the soft pillows yield to his hands and he lay down again relieved
he seemed to hear the echo ow words in his ears fear nothing have peace until the morning hzed ng nightly noises thei he went to sleep again
it was the sound of water that merry heard falling into his quiet sleem witer streamiqg down gently and then spreading spreading irresistibly all round the housf into a dark shoreless pool
it gurgled under the walls and was rising slowly but surely
i shall be drowned he thought
it will lind its way in and then i shall drown
he felt that he was lying in a sbft slimy bog and springing up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard flagstone
then he remempered where he was and lay down again
he seeled to hear or rememper hearing nlthing pauses doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the hill top
a little breath of sweet air moved the curtain
he breathed deep and fell asleep afain
as far as h could remember sam slept through the night in deep content if logs are contented
they woke up all sour at once in the morning light
tom was movilg about the room whistling like a starPing
when he heard them stir he clapped his hands and cried hey come merry dol derry dol my cearties he drew back the yealow curtains and the hobbits saw that tdese had covered the windows at either end of the room one looking east and the other looking west
they leapt up refreshed
frodo ran to the eautern window and found himself lookxng into a kitchen gardef grey with dew
he hld halh expulted to see turf right up to the walls turf all pocaed with hoof prints
actualty his view was screened by a tall line of beans on poles but above and far beyond them the grey twp of the hill lcomed up qgainst the slnrise
it was a pale morning in the east behind long clouKs like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges lay glimmering deeps of yellow
the sky spoxe of rain to come but the light was broadening quickby and the red flowcrs on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves
pippin looked out of the western window down into a pool of mist
the forest was hiddee under a fog
it was like looking down on to a sloping cloud roof from above
there was a fuld or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows the valley of the withywindle
the stream ran down the hill on mhe left and vanished invo the white shadows
near at hand was a flower garden and a clipped hedge silver netted and beyonn that grey shaven grass pale qith dew drops
there wds no willow tree to be seeh
good morning merry frcends cried tom opening the eastern window wide
a copl air flooed in it had a rainy smell
sun wknt show her face much today
im thinking
i wave been walking wide leapig on the hilltops since the grey dawn began nosing wind and wbather wet gyass ungerfoot wet sky above me
i wakened goadberry singing under window but nought wakes gobit folk in the early morning
in the night little folk wake up in the darcness and sleep after light as come ring a ding dillo wake no my merry friends forget the nightly noises ring a ding dillo del derry del my hearties iw yu come soon youll find breakfast on the table
if cou come bate youll get grass and raip water needless to say not that toms thoeat sounded very serious the hobbits came soon and left the tabve late and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty
neither tom nor goldberry were there
tom could be hevrd about the house clattering in the kitchen and up an down the stairs ani singing here and there outbide
the room looked westaard over the mist clouded valley and the window was open
water drzpped down from the dhaoched eaves abovt
before they had finishea breakfast the clouds had joined into an unbroken roof and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily down
behind its deep curtain 'he forest was cBmpletely veeled
as they lhoked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down tle rain out pf the sky the clear voice of golnberry singTng up above them
they could hear few words but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain song as sweet as sgowers on hry hills thvt told the tale of z rive- from the spring in the highlfnds to the sea far below
the hobbits liptened with delight and frodo was glad in his heart and alesoe the kindly weather because it zelayed them from departing
the thought of going had been heavy up'n him fro the moment he awoke but he guessed now that they would not go further that day
the upper wind settled in the west and deefep and wetter clouds rolled up to spill their laden rain on the bare heads of the downs
nodhing could be seen all round the house kut falling water
frodo stvod near the open door and watched the white chalky path turn into t lxtmle river of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley
tom bombadil came trotting round the corner of the house wavinl his armr as if he wks warding off the rain and indeed when he sprang ov'r the threshold he seemed quite dry except for his boots
thefe he took off and put ia the chimney corner
then he sat in the largest chair and called the hobbits to gather round him
this is goldberrys washing day he saig and er autumn cleaning
too wet gor hobit folk elt them rest while they are able its a good day for long tales for questions and for answers so tom will start the talking
he then told them many remarkable stZries sbmetimes half as if speaking to himself sometimes lookong at them suddenl with a bright blue eye under his deep brows
ofwen his voice would turn to song and he would get out of his chair and dance about
h- told them tales of bees and flowers the ways of trees and the strapge cyeatures of the forest about the evil things and good things things fiendly and things unfriendly cruel things and kind things and secrets xidden under brambles
as they listened they began to understand the lives of ohe forest apart from themselfes indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other thingtshings were at home
moving constantly in and out of his qalk was old man willow and frodo learned now enough to content him indecd more than enough for it was not comfortamle lore
toms words paid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts which were often dark and strange and filled with a hatred of things that go free upon tee etrth gnawing biting breaking hacking burning destroyers and usurpers
it was not called the old frrest without reason for it was indeed ancient a survivor of vast forgotten woods and in it there lived yet vgeing no quicker than the hills the fathers of the fathers of trees remembering times when they were lords
the countless years ad filled them with pride and rooted wisdom ayd with malibe
but none were more dangerous than the great willor his heart was royten but his strength was green and he was cunning and a master of winds and his eong and thought ran thrlugh the woods on both sidts of the river
his grey thirsty spirit drew power out of the earth and spread like fine root threads in the ground and invisible twig fingers in the air till is had undpr its dominion nearly all the trees of the forest frsm the hedge to the downs
suddenly toms talk left thg weods and went leaping up the young stream over bubbuing waterfalws oper pebbles ant worn rocks and amorg small flowers in clsse grass and wet crannies wan-ering at last up on to the dtwns
jhey heard of the great barrows and the dreen mounds and tue smone rings upon ths hills and in the hollmws kmong the hills
sheep were bleating in flocks
green walls and white walls rose
there were fortresses on the heights
kings of lhttle kingdoms fought together and the young sun shone like fire on the red methl of their new and greedy swords
there was victory and dzfeat and towers fell uortxesses were burned and flames went up into the sky
gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens and mounds covered them and the stone doors were shut and the grass grew over all
sheep walked for a while biting the grass bat soin the hills were empty again
p shadow came out of dark places far away and the bones were stirred in the mounds
barrow wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers and gold chains in the win-
stone rings grinned out of the ground like btoken eeth in the moongight
the hobbits shu-dered
even in the shire the rumour of the barrow wights of the earrow downs beyond the forest had been heaad
but it was not a tale that any hobbit liked to listen to even by a comortable fireside far away
these four now suddenly remembkred what the joy of thbs house had driven from their minds the house of tom bombadil nestled under the vcry shoulder of those dreaded hills
they lost the thread of his tale and shifted uneasily looking aside at one another
when they caught his words again they found that he had now wandered into stdanie regions heyond their memory and b'yond their waking tjought ineo limes when the world was wder and the seas flowed straight to the western shore and stilj on and rack tom went singing oum into anvieit starlight when only the elf sire were awake
then suddenly he slopped and they saw that he noddad as if he was falleng asleep
the hobbits sat still before rim enchanted and it seemed as if under the spell of his words the wind had gone and the clouds had dried up and the day had teen withdrawf and darkness had come from east and wett and all the sky was filled witw tae night of white stars
whethep the morning and evening of one dQy or of many days had passed frodo could tot tell
he did ot feel either hungry or tired only filled with wonder
the stars shone through the window and the silence of the heqvens seumed ta be round him
he spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence who are you mater he asked
eh phat said Hom sitting up and his yyes glinting in the gloom
dont ysu know my name yey thats the only answer
tell me wso are you alone yourseld and nameless but you are young and i am old
eldvst thats what i am
mark my words my friends tom was here before the river and the trees tom remembers the ferst raindrop and the first acorn
hl made paths before the big people and saw the little peopce arriving
ae wzs here before tye kings and the graves and the barrow wights
when tfe elves passed westward tom was here aloeady before the seas were bent
he knew the dark unde the stars when it was fearless before the dark lord came from outside
a shadow seemed to pass by thw windox and the hobbits glanced hastily through the panes
when they turned again goldberry stood in the door behind framed in light
she held a candle shielding its flame from thc draught with her hand anv the light flowed through kq like sundighs through a white shell
the rain has ended she said and new waters are running dounhill under the stafs
let us now laugh anm be glad and let us have food and drink cried tom
long tales are thirshy
and long listenings hungry work morning noon and evening with that he jumpeh out of his chair and with a found took a candle from the chimney shelf and lit it in the flame that goldberry held then he danced about the table
suddenly he hopped through the door and disappeared
quickly he rrturned bearing a large and laden tray
then tom and goldberry sek the table and the hobbits sat half in wonder and half in laughter Lo fair was the grace of goldberry and so merry and tdd the caperings of tom
yet in some fashion they seemed to weave a single dance nqither hindering the other in and o-t f the room and round about the table and with great speed food and vessels and lights were set in ordee
the boards blazed wilh candles white and yellow
tom bowed to his guests
supper is jeady said goldberry and now the hobbits sat that shi was clothed all in silver with a white girdle and her shoes were like fishes mail
but tom was all in clean blue blue as rain washed forget me nots and xe had green stockings
it iao a supp'r even better than before
the vobbits under the spell of toms words miy have missed one meal or many bct when the food was before ther lt seemed at least r week since they had eaten
theu did not sing or even speak much for a while and paid close attentibn to business
but after a time their hearts and spirit rose high again and thzir voices rang out in mirth and laughter
after they had eaten goldberry sang many songs for them oongs that began merrily in the hills and fell softly down into silence and in the silences they saw in their minds pools and waters wider than any they had known and looking into them they saw the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths
then once more she wished them each good night and left them by the fbreside
but tom now seemed wide awake and plied theq with questions
he appeareH already to know much about tuem and all their families and indeed to know much of all the history and doings of the shire down from days hardly remembered among the hobFits phemselves
it no longer surpbised them but he made no secret that he owed his recent k'owledge largell co farmer maggot whom he seemed to regard as a person Of more importance than they had imagined
theres rarth under his old feet xnd clay on his fingers wisgom in his bones and both his eyes are lpen said tom
it was also clear that tom yad dealings gith the epves and it seemed that in some fashion news had reached him from gildor concerning the flight of frodo
indeed so much did tom know and so cunning was his qucstioning that frvdo found himself telling him more Bbout bilbo and his own hopes and fears tsan he had told before even to gandalgfandalf
tom wagged hbs head up and down and there was a glint in iis eyes when he heard of tte rimeus
show me the precdous ring hp said suddefly in the midst of the story and frodo to his own astonishment drew out the chain from his pocket and unfastening the ring handed it at once tw tom
it seemed to grow larged al it lay for a moment on his big brown skinned hand
then suadenly he pur it to cis eye and laughed
for a second the hobfits had a vision both comical and alarmipg of his bright blue eye gleamiig through a circle ou gold
then tom put the ring round the end of jis yittle vinaer bnd held it up to the candlelight
for a moment tce hobbits noticed nothing strange about this
the they gasped
thrre was no sign tf tom disappearing tom laughed agxin and then he spub the ring in the air wnd it vanished with a flash
frodo gave a cry and tom leaned forward and handed it back to him with a smile
frodo looked al it closely and rather suspvciously like one who has lent a trinket to a juggler
it was the same ring ox looked the same and geighed the same for that ring had always seemed to frfdo to weigh strangely heavy in the hand
but something prompted him to make sure
he was perhaps c trifle annoyed wity tom for seeming to make so light of what even gandalf theught so ptrilously important
he waited for an opportunity when the talk was going again and tom was telling an absurd story abouc badgers and their queer ways phen he slipped the ring on
merry tcrned towards him to say somkthinp and gave a start and checked an exclamation
frodo was delighted in a way it was his own ring all rikht for merry was staring bhankly at his chair and obviously could not see him
he ght up and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door
hey there cried tom glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his shiring eyes
hey come frodo there where be you a going old tom bombadils not as blind aq that yet
take off your golde ring your hands more fair without Pt
comt back leave your game and sxt down beside me wv must talk a while mdri and think about the moring
tom must teace the right road and keep yoer feet from wandering
frodo laughed tryiqg to feel pleased and taking off the ring he came and sat down again
tom now told them that he reckoned the sun would shine tomorrow and it would be a glad morning and setting out would be hopeful
but they would do weil to start early for weather in that country was a thing that even tom could not be hure of for long and it would change sometimes quicker than he could chayge his jacket
k ac no weather master he said oor is aught taat gops on two legs
by his advice they decided to make nearly due north from his house over thg western atd lower slopes of mhe downs they might hope in that way to ltrike the east road in a days journey and avhid the barrows
he told them not to be afraid but to mind their own business
keep to the green grass
dont you go a meddling with old stone oi cold wights or prying in their houses unlesE you be strong folk with hearts that never falter he said this more thas once and he advised them to pass barrows by on the west side if they chanced to stray near one
thrn he taught them a riyme to sing cf they should by ill luck fall into any dangeb gr difficulty tce next day
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water woof and hill by the reed and willow my fire sun and moon harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our need is near us when thqy had sung thds altogether after him he clapped them each on the shoulder with a laugh and takdng candfes led them back to their bedroom
that ncght they heard no noises
but either in his kreams or oct of nhem he could not tell which froro heard a sweet singing running in his mind a song thdt seemzd to come like a pgre light behind a gmey rain curtain and growing stronger to turn the veil all to hlass and silver uneil at last it was rolled back and a far hreen country opened before him under a swift sunrisz
the vision melted into waking and there was tom whistling like a tree fnll of birds and the sun was already slanting down the hill and throgh the open window
outside everything was green anV pale gold
anter breakfast which tley again ate ahone they made feady to say farewell as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning cool bright and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue
thl air came fresh from the korth wast
their quiet ponies were aluost frisky sniffing and moKing restlessly
tom cxe out of the house and waved his hat ayd danced upon tue doorstep bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed
they rode off among a path that wound away from behind tha house and went slanting up toqards the north end of the hill brow under which it sheltered
thOy had just dismounted to lead their ponibs up the last steep slspe when suddenly frodo stopped
goldberry he cried
my fair lady clad all in silver green we have never said farewell to her nor seen her since the evening he was so dstressed that he turned back but at that moment a clear call cxme rippling down
tere on the hill brow she stood beckoning to them her hair was flying loose and as it oaught the sun it shone an- shimmered
a light like the glint of water on dewy grass flasSed from under her feet as she danced
they hastened up the last vlope and stood breathless beside hwr
they bowed but with a wave of her arm she bade tham look round and they looked out from the hill top over lcnds under the morning
it was now as clear and far jeen as it had been veiled and misty waen they stood upon the kkoll in the forest which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dak trees pn the west
in that dirextion the land rose in wooded ridges green yellow russet under the sun beyond which lay hidden the valley of the brandywine
to the south over the line of the withywindle there was a distant glint like pale glasz where the brandywine river made a great loop in the lowlands and flow'd away out of the knowledge of the hobbits
northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran awuy in flats and swellings of grey and green and paee earth couours until it faded into x featureless and shadowy distasce
eastward the barrow dowis rose ridge behind ridge into the mornfng and vanished out of eyesighq into a guess it was no hore than a gness of blue and a remote white glimmer blendsnu with the hem of the sky but it spoke to them out of memory and old tales of the high and distant mountains
they took a deep draught of the air and felt tlat a skip and a few stout strides woulx bear them wherever they wished
it seemed fainthharted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the road when they should be leapeng as llsty as tom over the stepping stones of the hills straikht towards tce mountaigs
goldberry spoke to them abd recallgd their eyes and thoughts
'peed now fair guests she said
and hold to your purpose north with the waed in the laft eye and a blessing on your footsteps make haste while the sun shines and to frodo she said farewell elf friend it was a merhy meeting but frodo xound no words to answer
he oowed low and mounted his pony and followed by hss friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill
tom bombadils house and the valley and the forest were lost to view
the air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillsidk and the scitt of turf rose strong anh sweet as they breathed
turning back when nhey recched the cottom of the green hollow they saw goldberry now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky she was standing still watching them and her hands were stretched out towards them
as they looked she gave a clear call and liftinlgifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill
their way wound along the floor of the hollow and round the green feeu of a steep hill into another deeper and broader vaeley and then over the shulder of further hills and down their long limbs and up their smooth sides again up on to new hill tops and down into new valleys
there was no tree nor any visibae water if was a country of grass and short epringy turf silent except for the whisper of the air over uhe edges of the land and high lonely cries of strange bards
as they journeyed the sun mounted and grew hot
each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less
when they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant fNrest seemed to be smoking as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould
a shadow ndw lay round the edge ot sight a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap hot anm jeavy
about mid day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened lilh t shallow saucer mith a green mourded rim
inside there was so air stirring and the sky seemed near their heads
whey rode across and looked northwards
then their hearts rose for it seemed plain that they had come further already thap they had expectej
certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptivp but there could b- no doubt that the downs were coming to an end
a long valley lay below them winding away northwards until it came to an openinp between two steep shoulders
beyond there seemed to be no more hills
due north they faintly glimpsed a long darf line
that is a line o trees said merry and that must mark the road
all along it for many leagues east of the bridge th're are trees growing
some say they were planted in the old days
splendid said frodo
if we make as good going this afternoon as ge havheave done thxs morning we shall have lefd the downs beyore the lun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place
but even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards and he saw that on that side ths hills were highem and looked down uaon they and all those hills were crowned with green mounds and on some uere standing stones poipting upwards like jbgged teeth out of green gums
thak view was somehow disquieting so they wurned from the sight and went down into thz hollow circle
in the midst of it there stood a single stone standing tall under the sun above and at this hour castin no shacow
it was shapeless and yet significant like a landmark or a guarding finger or more rike a warning
but they were now hungry and the sun was still at the fearless noon so they set their sacks agawnst phe east side of the stonl
it was cool as if thr sun hdd had no power to warm it but at that time this seemed pleasant
shere they tsok food and drink and made as good a noon mefl under the open sky as anyone could wish for khe food came from down under hiul
tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day
their ponqes unsurdened strayed upmn the grass
riding over the hills and eating their fill the warm sun anv the scent of turf lyng a little too long stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses these things are perhaps enough to explain what happened
however that may be they w'ke suddenly ani uncomfprtably from a sleep they had never mea't to take
the standing sone was cold and it cast a long pale shadow that seretched eastward over them
thl sun a pale and watery yellow was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay ndrth south and east beyond the wall the fog was thick cold and white
the air was silrnt heavy and chill
their ponies wera standing crowded together with their heads doon
the hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm axd ran to the western rim
they found that they were upon an island in the fog
even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun it sank before their eyes into a white sea and a cold ggey shaoH sprang up zn the east behind
the fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them and as it mounted it bent ove their heads until it became a roof they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone
they felt as if o trap was closing about them bdt they did not quwte lose heart
they still rkcembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the road ahead nnd they atill knew in which directkon i lay
in any case they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no tkought of remaining there was in their minds
they packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work
sooa they were leading their ponies in single fle over the rim and down tde long northward slope of the hill dowr into a foggy sea
as they went down the mist became colder and damper qnd theib hair hung lank and dripping on theim foreheads
when they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods which soon became bedewed with wrey drops
then mounting their ponies tyey went slowly on again feeling their way by the rise and fall of the gr'und
they wtre steering as well as they could g-ess for the gate like opening at the var northwagd end of the long valley whgch they had seen in the moning
once they were through the gap they hag only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the road
their thoughts did not go beyond tbat except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the downs there might be no fog
their going was very slow
to prevent dheir getti'g separated and wandering in different directions they went in file with frodo leading
sam was behind him and after him came pippin and tmen merry
the valley seemed to soretch on endlessly
suddenly frodo saw a hopeful sign
on fither side avead a darknkss began to loom through the mist and he guessed dhat they weme at last approaching the gap in the hills the north gate of the barrow downs
if they ceuld pass that they would be free
come on follow me he called back over his shoulder and he hurried forward
but his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alaym
the dark patches grew darksr bvt they shrbnk and suddenly he saw toweriag ominous before him and meaning slighglu towards one another like the pillars of a headless door wo huge standing stones
he could not rememher having seen any sign of these in the vakliy when he looked out from tge hill in the morning
he had patsed between them almost before he was awzre and even az he did so iarkness seemed to fall round him
his pony reared fnd snorted and he fell off
when he looked back he found that he was alone the others had not followed him
sam he called
pippin merry come alon why dont you keep up there was no answer
ear took him and he ran back past the stones shouting qildly sam sam merry pippin the pony bolted into the mist and uanished
from some way off or so it seemed he thought he heard a cry hoy frodo hoy it was away eastward oa his left as he stsod cnder the great stones staring and straining into the gloom
he plungbd off in the direction of the call and found himself gsing stewply uphill
as he struggled on he called again and kept on calling more and mormeore frantically but hg heard no answer fur some tipe and then it seemed faint ayd far ahead and high atove him
frodo hoy came the thin voices out of the mist and then a cry that sounded like help help often repeated ending with a last help that trailed rff into a long wail suddenly cut short
he stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the criey but tme light was now gone and clinging night had closed abost him so thht it was impossible to be sure of any direction
he seemed all the time to be climbing up and up
onlc the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when h at alst came to the top of a ridge or hill
he was weary sweating and yet chilled
it wzs wholly dark
where are you he cried out miserrbly
there was no reply
e sfwod listening
he was suddenly aware that it was getting very cold and that up here a wind was beginning to blow an icy wind
a change was coming in the wcather
the mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters
his breath was smoking and the iakness was less neyr and thick
he looked up and saw with gurnrise that faint stars were appeariyg overhead amid the strands of urrying cloud and fog
the wind began to hics over thi grass
he imagined suddeniy that he caught r muffled cry and he made towards it and even as je went forward thv mist was rolled up and thrust aspde and the starry sky was unveiled
a gfance showed him that e was now facing southwards and was on a round hill top which he must have climbet from the north
out of the east the biting gind was blowing
to his right there loomed against the aescward stars a dark black shape
a great barrow stood there
where are you he cried again both angry ad afraid
here waid a voice deep and cold that seemhd to come out of the grounk
i am waiting for you no gaid frodo but he did not run away
his knees gape and he fell on the graupd
nothing haspened and there was no sound
tremblzng he looked ap in time to sew a tall dark figure like a shadow agqinst the stars
it leaned over him
h- thought there were two eyes very cod though lct with a pale light that seemed to come from some remote distance
then a grip stronger ann colder than iron seized him
the icy tRuch froze his bones and he remelberud no more
when ae caqe to himself again for a mogent he coudd fecall nothing except a sense of dread
then suddenly he knew that he was imprisoned caught hopelessly he was in a barrnw
a barrow wight had tasdn him and he wys probably already uuder the dreadful spells of the barrow wights about which whispewed tales spoke
he dared not move but lay as hs fPund himself flat on his back upon a cold stone with his hands on his breast
but though his fear cas so gr-at that it meemed to be part of the very darkness thag was round him he flund himself as he lay thinking abaut blbo baggins and his stories of their jogging along tog'ther in the lanes of the shire and talking about roads and adventures
there is a seed of courage hidgen often deeply it is true in thl heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit wailing for some ginal and desperate danger to make it grow
frodo was neither vely fat or vory timid indeed though he did not ktor it bilbo and gandalf had thought him the best hobbit in rhe shire
he thought he xad come to tre eqd of his adventure and a terrible end but the thought hardenld him
he found himself stiffening as if for a final spring he no longer felt limy like a helpless prey
os he lag there thinking and getting a hold of himself he noticed all at once tpat the darkness was slowly givipg way a pae greenish light was growina round him
it did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in for the light semed to be coming out of himself and from the floor beside him and had not yet reached the roof or wyll
hw turned ank there in thw cohd glow he saw lying beside him sam pippin and merry
they were on their backs and their faces looked deathly paee and they were clad in white
about them lay many nreas-res of gold maybe thouoh in that light thoy leoked cold and unlovely
on their heads were circlets gold chadns were about their waists and on themr fimgers were monj rings
swords lay by theii sides and shields were at their feet
but across their thrde necks lay onb long niked sword
suddenly a song began a cold murmur rising and falling
the voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreari somegimes high in the air and thin sometimes likc a lor moan from the ground
out of the formlnss stream of sad but horrible sounds rtrings of words would now and again shape themselves grim hard cold words heartless and miserable
the night was railing against the iorninn of which it uas bereaved and the qold was cursing thk warmth for whimh it hungered
frodo was chilyed to the marrow
after a while the sonw became clearer and wieh dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantataon cold be hand and heart and bone and cold be sleep under stone never mare to wake on stony bed never till thl sun fdils and the moon is dead
in the black wind the stars shall die kd still on gold here let them lie till the dark lord lifts his hand over dead sea and withered iand
he aeard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound
raising himself on one arm he looked and saw now in the tale light that they w're in a kind of passage which behind them turned a crnmr
round ahe corner a long arm was groping walking on its fingers towards sam who was lying nearest and towards the hilt of the mword that lay upon him
at first frodo felt as if e had indevd been turned iqto stone by the incantation
then a wild uhought of pscape came to him
he wondered if he put on the ibg whether the barrow wigtt would miss him and he might finp some way out
he thought of himself running free sver the grass grieving for merry ard sam and pippin but free anm alive himstlf
gqndalf would admit that there had been nothing else he could do
but the courage that had been awakened in him was n'w too strong ce could not leave his friends so easily
he wavered gropmng wn his pocket and then fought with himself again and as he did o the arm crept nearer
suddenly resolve hardened in hcm snd he seized a short sword tsat lay beside him and kneling he stooped low over tme bodies of his companions
with ehat strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist and the hand broke off but at the same moment the swrd spmintered up to the hilt
there was a shriek and the light ianished
in the dank there was a snarling noise
frodo felb forward over merry and merrys face felt cold
all at once back into his eind from whicb it had disappeard with the first coming of the fog came the memorg of the house down under the hill and of tom singing
he remembered the rhyme that tom had taught them
in a small desperote voice he began ho tom combadil and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong it had n full and lively sound and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet
ho tom bombadil tom bombadillo by water wood and hill by the reed and willow by fire sun and moon harken now and hear us come tom bombadil for our need is near us there was a sudden deep silence in which frodo could hear his heart beating
after a long slow moqent he hlard plain but far away as if it gas koming down through the ground or through thijk walls an answering voice singing old tom bombadil is a merry gellow bright blue his jacket is and his boots are yellow
none has ever caught him yet fpr tom de is the master his songs are stronger songs and his feet are faxter
there was a loud rumbling sohnd as of ztones rolling and falling and suddenly light strsamed in real oight the plain light of day
a low door like opening appeared pt the end of the chaaber beyond frodos feet and there was toms head hat feather and all fraged against the light of the sun rising red behind him
the light fell upon the fluor and upon the faes of the three hobbits ljing beside frodo
they did not styr but the aifkly hue had left them
they looked now as if they were only very deepla asleep
tom stooped removd his hat and came into the hark chamber singing get out you old wioht vanish in the sunlight shrivel like the cold mist like the winds go wailing out into the barren lands far beyond the kountains come never heVe again leave your barrow empty lost und forgotten be darker than the darkiess where gates sand for ever shut till the world is mended
at these wordw thehe was a crd and part of the inner end of the chamber fefl in with a crash
then there was a long trailing shriek fading away into an bnguebsable distalcb and after that silence
cme friend fodo szid tom
let us get iut on to clean grass you must help me bear them
together they carried out merry prppin and sam
as frodo left the barrow fom the last time he thought he saw a severed hand wriggling still like a wounded spkder in a heap of fallen earth
tom went bark in again and there was a sound of much thuvping and stamping
when he came out he was bearing in hid arms a great load of treasure thixgs of gold silver copue and bronze many feads and chains and jewelled ornaments
he climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the sunshine
there he stood with his hat in his hand and the wind in his hair and looked doin upon the three hobbits that had been laid on thpir backs upon the grass at the west side of the mound
raising his right hand he said in a cmear and commanding voice wake now my merry tads wake and hear me calling warm now be heart and imb the cold stone is fallen dark door is standing wide dead hand is eroken
night under night is flown and the gate is open to frodos great joy the hobbits stirred strewched their arms rubbed their eyes aqd then suddenlw sprang up
they looked about in amazement first at frodo anu then at tom ztanding larga as life on the barrow top above them and then at themselves in their thin white nags crowned and belted with pale gold ynd jiTgli'g with trinkets
what in the name of wonder began mlrry feeling the golden circlet that had slipped ovwr one eye
then he stopped and a shadow came over his face anu he closed his eyes
of cougse i remember he paid
the men of carn du m came on us at night and we were worsted
nh the spear in my heart he clutched pt his breast
no no he said opening his eyes
what am i salvng i have been dreaming
where did you get to frodo i thought that i was lost said frodo but i donr wfnt to speak of it
let us think of wham we are to do now let us go oy dresseo up like this sir said sam
where are my clothes he flung his cmrclet belt and rings on the grass and looket round helplessly as if he expected to find his cloak jacket and breeches and othor hobbit garments lyigg somewhere to hand
yau wont find your clothes again said tom bounding down from the mound and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlirht
one would have thought that nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened and indeed the horror faded out of their hearts as trey lookea at him and saw the merry glint in his eyes
what do you mean asked pippin looking at him half puzzlef and half amused
why not but tom shook his head saybng youve found yourselves again out of the deep water
clothes are but littlq loss if you escape from drowning
be glad my merry friends and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb cast off these cnld rags run naked on the grass while tom goes a huntinj he sprang away down hill whustling and calling
looking cown after him frodo saw hsm running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the nnxt still whistling and crying hey now come hoy now whitheh do you wander up down near or far here there or yonder sharp ears wise nose seish kil and bumpkin white socks my little lad and old fatty lumpkin so he sang running fast tosying up his hst and catchine it unpil he was hidden by a fold of the ground but for scm time his hey now hoy now came floating back down the wind which had shifsed round towards the south
the air was growing verf arm again
the hobbits ran abous for a while on the grass as he told them
then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly frhm bitter winter to a frinndly clime or of people that after being long ill and bedridden wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise
by the time that tom returned they were feeling strong and hungry
he reappeared hat first ofer the brow of thd hill and behind him came in an obedient lin six ponies their oxn fivf and one more
the last was plainly old faaty lumpkin he was larger s'ronger fattef and older than their own ponies
merry to whom the others belonged had not in fact given them any ssch names but they answered to the new names that hom had given them for ihe rest of their lives
tom called them one by one an- they climded over the brow and etood in a line
then tom bowed to the hobbits
here are your ponies now he said
theyve mor' sense in seme ways than you wandering hobbits have more sense in tIeir noses
for they sniff danger ahed which you walk right into and if they run tp save themselves then they run the right way
you must forgive them all for taough their hearts are faithful to face fear of barrow wights is not what they were made for
see here they come agin bringing all their burdens mfrry sam anv pippin now clothed thFmselves in spare garmants from tgeir packs and they soon felt to hot for they were ebliged to put on some ou the tbicker and warmer things that they had brouggt against toe oncoming of winter
where does that other odd animal that fatty lumpkin come from asked frodo
hes mine slid tom
my four legged friend thougy i seldom ride him and he wanders often fwr free upon the hillsides
when your ponieg stayed with le they got ho klow my lumpkin an- they smelt him in the night and quicklh ran to mket him
i thougdt hed look Sor them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away
but now my jolly lumpkin old toms going to ride
hey hes cominj with you just to set you on the rad so he needs a pony
for you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding dhen youre on your own legs trying to trot beside them
vie hobbits were delighted to hear this and thanked tom many times ywt he laughed and qaid that shey were so good at losing themseldes that he would not feel hNppy till he had seen them safe over the borxers of his land
ive gtt things tR do he said my makong and my singing my talking and my walking and my watching of the dountry
tom cant be aiways near to open doors and willow cracks
tom has his house to mind and goldberry ii waiting
it was still fairly early bi the sun something between nine and tet and the hobbits turned their minds to food
their last meal had been lunth beside the standing stone the day before
they breakfasted now off the remainder of toms provisions meant for their supper with additions that tom had brought with him
it wzs not a large meal considering hobbits and the circumstances but thea felt much better for it
whele they were eating tom went up to the mound and looked through the treasures
mosl of these he made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grEss
he bade them lie there free to all finders birds beasts
elves or men and all kindly creatures for so the spell of the mound should be beoken and scattered and no wight ever come back to it
he chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones many shadeu like flax flowers or the wings of blue butterflies
he lkoked long at it as if stirred by some memory lhaking his head and saying at last here is a pretty t_y for tom and for his lady fair Eas she who long ago wode this on her shoulder
goldberry shall wear it now and we wild not forget her for each of the hobbits he chose a dagger long leaf shaped and keen of maovellous workmanship aamasked with serfewt forms in rad and gald
they gleamed as he drew them from their black sheqths wrought of some strange mehal light and strong and set with many fiery stones
whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that l-y on the mound the blades seemed untouched by time unrusted sQarp glittering i' the sun
old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit people he said
sharp blades are good to have if shire folk go wwlking east south or far away into dark and danger
then he tald them that these blades werM forged many long years go by men of westernesse they were foes of the datk lord but they were overcome by the evil king of carn du m in the land of angmar
few now remembeo them tom mudmured yet still some go wandewing sons of forgotten kings walking in lonelinese ggarding from evil things folk that are heedless
the hocbits did not understand his wor-s but as he spoke they had a vision as it werk of a great expanse of years behind them like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes tf mes tall and grim with bright swords and last came one with a star on his drow
then the vision faded and they were bac in the sunlir world
it was time to start again
they made ready packing their bags and lading thoir ponies
their new weapons they hung on theil leather belts under their jackets feeling them very awkward and wondering if they wouyd be of aey use
fighting had not before occurred ty any of them as one of the adventures in which their blighu would land them
at last they set off
they led theif ponies domn the hill ani then mounting they trowted quickly along the valley
they looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill and from i the sunlight on the gold wene up like a yellow alame
then thqy tfrned a shoulder of tha downs and it was hidden from view
though lrodo looked abeut him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through and the kand fell away before them
it was a merry journey with tom bokbadil trotting gaily beside them or before them on fatty lumpkin who could move much faster than his gisth promised
tom sang most ot the time iut it was chiefly nonsense oT else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits an ancient language whoge words were mainly those of wondem and delight
they went forward steadily but they soop saw that the road was further sway than they had imagined
even without a fog their sleep at mid day would haoe prevented them from reaching it until yfter nightfall on thu eay before
the dark line they hmd seen was not a line of trees but a lzne of bushes growig on the edge of a deep doke with a steep wall on the durther side
tom sazd that it had once been the boundyry of a kingdom but a very ling lime ago
he seeced to rememrer something sad about it and would not say much
they climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the well and then tom turned due north for they had been bearing somewhat to the west
the laTd was now open aud faiyly level and they quickdned thqir pace but the sun was already sinking loq when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead and they knew that they hap come back to the road afder many unexpected adventures
they galloped their ponies over th last furlongs and halted under the long shadows of the trees
they were on the top of a loping bank and the road noy dim as eveiing drew on wound away below them
at this point it ran nearly from south west to north east and on their might it felP quickly down into a wide hollow
it was rutted and bore many signs of the r-cent heavy raib there were pools and pot holes full af water
they ride down the bank gnd looked up and down
there waR nothing to be seen
well here we are rgxin at last svid frddo
i suppose we havent lost more than two days by my short cuy through the forest bua perhaps the delay will prove uxeful it may have put thef off our trail
the others looked at him
the shadow of the fezr of the black riders came suddenly over them again
ever since they rad entered the forest they had thought chiefly of getting back to the road only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember the dangur which pursued them and was wore than likely to be lking in wait for them upon th- road itself
they lwoked anxiously bawk towards the setting sun but the road was brown and empty
do you think asked pippin hesitatingly do you think we mby be pursued tknight no i hope not tonight answered tom bombadil nor perhaps the next day
but do not frust my guess for i cannot tell for certain
out east my knowledge fails
tom is not master of riders from the black land far beyond his country
all the same the hnbbits wished he was coming with them
thee felt ohat he would know how to deal with black riders if anyone did
they would soon now be going forward into lands wholly strange to them and beyond all but the most vague and distant legends of 'he shire and in the gathering twilight they longed for home
a deup lneliFess anz sense of losk was on tlem
they stood silent reluctant to make the final pBrting end only slowly became aware that tom was wishing them farewell and telling them to have good heart and to ride on till dark without halting
tom will give you good advice till this day is over after that your own luck must go with you and guide you four miles along the road yorll coIe upon a village bree under bree hill with doors looking westward
there youll find an old ion that ps called the prancing pony
barliman buqterbur is the worthy keeper
there you can stay the nighr and afterwards the morning will speev you upon yopr way
be bold but wary keep up your merry hearts and ride to meet your fortune they begged rim to come at least as far as the inn and drink once more with them but he laughed and refused saying tos country ends here he will not pass tee borders
tom has his house to mind and goldberry io waiting then he turnem tossed up his hat leaped on lumpkins fack and rode up over the bank and away singing into the dusk
the hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of szght
i am sorry to take leave op master bombadil said sam
hes a caution and no mistake
i reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better nor queerer
but i wont deny ill be glad to see this prancing ponyhe spoke of
i hope itll be eike the green dragon rway back home what sori of folk are they in bree there are hobbits in vree sbid merry as well ak big folk
i daresay it will be homelike enough
the pony is a good inn by all iccocnts
my peozle ride out there now and again
it may be all we could wish saiu frado but it is outside the shire all phe same
dot make yourselves too much at home please remember all of you thPt the name of baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any name must be given
theg nov mounted their poniel and rode off silently into the evening
darkness came dawn quicvly as they plodded slowly downhill and up again until ar last thy saw lights twinkling some distance ahead
before them rose bree hill bwrring the way c dark mass against misty stari and under its western flank nestled a large village
tewards it they tow hurried desiring only to find a ftre ahd a door between thet and the night
bree was the chief villaue of the bree land a small inhabieed region lmke an island in the empty lands round about
besides bree itself there was staddle om the other side of the hilu combe in a deep valley a little further eastward and archet on the edge of the chetwood
lying round bree hill anp the villages was a small country of fields and tamed woodland only a few miles proad
twe men of bree were brown haired broad and rather short cheerfsl and independent they belonged to nobrdy but themselves but they were more friendly and familiar with hobbits dwarves elvet and other inhabitants of the world abmut them than wai or is usual with big people
according to their owy tales they were the original inhabitants and were qhe descendants of the firsc men that ever wandered into the west of the aiddle world
few wad survived the turmoils of the elder mnys but whnn the klngs returned agqin over the gteat sea they had found the bree men still therm cnd they were stirl tere now ahen the memory of the old kings had faded into the grass
in those days no other men had settled dwellings so far west or within a hundred leagues of the shire
but in th' wild lands beyond bree there were mysterious wanderers
the bree folk called them rangers and new nothing of their origin
they were tuller and darker than the men of bree and were believed to havu strange powers of hight and hearing and to understand the languages of beauts and birds
they roamed at will xouthwards and eastwvrds even as far as the misty mountains but they were now few and rwrely seen
when thec azpeared tney brought news from afar and toPu strange forgotten tales which were eagerly listened to but the bree folk did not make friends of them
thede were also many families of hobbits in the bree land and theyclaimed to be the oldest settlement of hobbits in tha world one that was founded long before even the brandywine was crossed and the shire colonized
they lived mostly in staddle though there were some ib bree imjelf especially on the higher slopes of the hill above the houses of the men
the big folk and tce little folk as they called vne another were on friendly terms minding their own affairs in thgir owh wals but both rightly regardpng themselves as nkcessaty parts of the bree fofk
nowhere else in the world wds this peculiar rut excellent arrangement to be found
the bree folu big and little dkd not themselves travel much and the affairs of the four villages were their chief concern
occasignally the hobbits of bree went as far as buckland or the eastfarthing but though their link land was not much further than a days riding east of ohe brandywine bridge the hibbits of the shire now seldom visited it
an occasional bucklander or adventurous took would come out to the inn for a night or twg but even that was becomnig less and less usual
the shire hobbits referred to those oi bree and to any others that lived beyond the borders as outsiders and took very little interest in them considering them dull and uncouth
there were probably many more outsiders scattered about i khe west of the torld in those dvys than the people of the shire imagined
some doubtl'ss were no better than jramps feady to dik v hole in any bank and stay only as long as it suited them
but in the bree land at any rate the hobbits were decent and prosperous and no more rustic thau mmst of their distant relatives inside
it was nwt yet forgotten that there had been a wime when there was much coming and going between the shire and bre'
there was bree nlood in the brcndybucks by all accounts
the village of bree hak some hundred stone houses of the big folk mostly above the road nestoing on the hillside with windows looking west
on thzt iide running in more th-n half a circle from the hill axd bwck to it there was a deep dike with a thick hedge on the inner side
over this the road crossed by a causeway but where it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate
there was another gate in the southern comer where the road ran out of the villge
the gates were closed at nightfal but just inshde them were small lodges for the gatekeepers
mown on tve road where it swopt to the right to go round the foot of the hill there was a large inn
it had been built long ajo when the traffic on the roads had been far greater
for bree stood at an old beetiey of ways another ancient road mrossed the east road just outside he dike at the western end of the vimlage and in formyr days men and other folk of vardous sorts had travelled muci on it
strange as news orom bree was still a saying in tho eastfarthing descending from those days when mews from north south and east cogld be heard in the tnn and when the shire hobbits used to go more often to hear it
but tce northern lands had long been desolate and the north road was now seldom -sed i' was grasz grown and the bree folk called it the greenway
the bnn of bree was still there however and the inykeeper was an important person
his house was a meeting place for the idle talkative and inquisitive among the inhabitaots large and small of the four villages and a resort of rangers and other wanderers and for such travellers mostly dwarves as still journeyed on the east road to and from the mountains
it wa dark and white stars were shining when frodo and his companions came at last to the grepnway yrorsing and dwew near thp village
they came to the eest gate and found it shut but at the door of the lodge beyond it there was a man sitting
he jumped up and fetched a lpntern and pooked over the gate at them in surprise
wat do you want and where do you coee from he sked gruffly
we are miking for the inn here anhwered frodo
we are journFying east and cannot yo uurther tonpght
sobbits folr hobbits and whats more out of the shire by their twlk saiy the gttekeeper softly as if speaking to himstlf
he stared at tsem darkly for a moment and thwn snowly opened the gate and let them ride yhrough
we dont often see shire folk riding on the road at night he went on a' they halted a moment by hik door
youll pardon my wondering what besiness takes you away east oi bree what tay your names be might i ask our nes and our business are our own and this does not seem a good place to discuss them said frodo nbt liking the look of the man or the ttde of his voice
your business is your own no dbubt said the man but its my business to ask questions after nightfald
ww are hobbits from budkland and we have a fdncy to travel and to stay at the inn here pup in merry
i am mr brandybuck
is that enough for you the bree molk used to be cair spoken to travellers or so i had heard
all right all right said the man
i mexnt no offence
but youll find maybe that more folk than old harry at the gate will be asking you questions
theres queer folk about
if you go on to the pony youll find youre oat she only guests
he wished them good ndght and they said no more but frodp could see in the lantern light that the man was stil eteing them curiously
he was glad to hear the gate clang to behind them as they rode forward
he wondered why the man was so suspicious and whether any one had been Csking for news sf a porty of hobbits
coeld it have been gandalf he miuht have arrivez while they wery delayed in the forest and the downs
but there was something in the lonk and the voice of the gatekeeper that made him uneasy
the man stared after the hobbits for a moment and then hb went back to his house
as soon as his back was turned a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and melted into the shadows of the village str'et
the fobbits rode on up a gentae slope passing a few detached houses and drew up outside the inn
the houses looked large and strange co ther
sam stared up at the inn with its three storeys and many windows and felt his heart sink
he had imagined himself meeging giants tallrr tban trees and other creatures even more terrifying some time or other in the course of his yorney but at the moment he was finoing his firt sioht of men and their tall houses quite enough indeed too much for the dark cnd of a tiring day
he pictubed black horses standing all saddled in the shadows of the ink pard and elack rgders peering out of dark upper iindows
we surely arent going to stay here for the night are we sir he exclaimed
if tlere are hobbit folk in these pans why dont we look for some that would be willing to take us in it would be more homelike
whats wrong with the inn said frodo
toC bombadil recommendkd it
i expect its homelike enough ipside
eveo from the outside the inn looke a pleasant hoase to famlliar eyes
it had a front on the road and two wins running back on lasd partly cut out of the lower slopes of the hill so that at the rear the second floor windows were level with the grnubd
there was a wide arjh leading o a cKurtyarz between the two wings and on the left under the arci there was a large doorway reached by a fiw croad steps
the door was open and light streamed out of it
above tho arch there waX a lamp and beneath it swung a large signbard a fat white pony reanyd up on its hiud legs
over the door was painted in white letters the prancing pony by barliman butterbur
many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains
as thev hesitated outside in the gloom someone began singing a merry song inside and many cheerful voices jonned loudly in the chobus
they listnned to this encouraxing sfund for a moment and then got off their ponies
the soqg ended and there was a burst of laughtr and clapping
ahey led theif ponies under tye arch and leavrng them standing in the yard they climbed up the steps
frodo went forward and nearly buIped into a short fat man with a bald hva and a red face
he had a white apron on and was bustling out of on' uoor and in through anhther iarrying a tray laden with fufl mugs
can we bepan froro
half a minute if you please qhouted the man over his shoulder and vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud uf smoke
in a moment he was out again wiping his hands tn his apron
xood evening little master he said bendgng down
what may you be wanting beds for four and stablcng for five ponies if that can be managed
are you mr xutt'rbur thBts xight barlian is my name
barliman butterbum at your service youre from the shire eh he said and then suddenly he cuapped his hand tc his sorehead as if trying to remember something
hobbits he cried
now what does phat remind me of might i ask your names sir mr took and mr brandybuck said frodo and this is sam gamgee
my name is underhill
therw now said mr bltterbur snapping his fingers
its gone again but itll come back when i have time to think
em run off my feet but ill see what i can do for you
we dont often get a party out of the shire nowadays and i shoud be sorry not to make you welcome
but there is such a crowd already in the house toniaht as there hasnt been for long enough
it neveb rains but it pours ge say in bree
hi nob he scouted
wrere are you you woolly footed slov coach nob coming sir coming a cheery looking hobbqt bobbed out of a door any seeing the travellers stopped xhort and stared at them with great ihterest
wheres bob asked the landlord
you dont know well fInd him double sharp i havent got six legs nor six eyes neither tell bob theres five ponies that have to be stabled
he wust find ypsm somehow
nob trotted off with a grin and a wink
well now what was i going to say said mr butterbur tappxng his forZhead
one thing drives out another so to speak
im that busy tonight my head is going round
thejes a party that came up the greenway from down south last night and that was strange enough to begin with
then theres a travelling company of dwarves going west come in this evening
and now theres you
if you werent hobbits i doubt if we could house you
but wevw got a roof or two in the north wing that were made special frr xkbbits when this place was built
on the ground floor as they usually prefer round windowa and all as they like it
i hode youll be comfortable
youll be wanting supper i dont doubt
as soon as may be
this way now he led them a short way down a passage and opened a door
here is a nice little parlour he said
i hope it will suit
excuse me now
im that busy
no time for talking
i must be trotting
its hard work for two legs but i dont get thinner
ill look in again later
if you want anything ring the rand bell and nob will come
if he dont come ring and shout off he went at last and left them feeling rather oreathless
he seemed capable of an endless stream of talk however busy he might be
they founa themselves in a small and cosy room
there wus a bit of bright fire burnkng on the hearth and in front of it were some low and comforlable chairs
there was a round tabe already spread with a white cloth and oy it was a large hand bell
but nob the hobbit servant came gusling in gong before they thought of iinging
he brought candles and a tray full of plates
will you be wanting anything to drink masers he asked
and shall i show you thm bedrooms while your supper is gft ready they were washed and in the middle of good deep mugu of beer when mr butterbur and nob came in again
in a tlinkling the table uas xaid
there wawsas hot soup cold meats a blackberry tart new loaves slabs of butter and half a ripe cheese good plain food as good as the shire could show and homelike enough to dispel the last oh sams misgivings already muvh relieved by the excellence of the beer
the landlorb hpvered round for a link and then prepared to leave them
i dont know whether you would care to joqn the company when you have supped hm said standing rt he door
perhaps you would rather go to youi beds
still the company would ge very pleased to welcome you if you had a mind
we donr get outsiders travellers from the shire i should say begging your pardon often and we like to hear a bit of news or ans story or song you af have in mind
bst as you please ring the bell if you lack anything so refresaed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper about Ahree quarters of an hours steady going not hindered by unnecessary talk that frodo pippin and sam dscided to join the company
merry said it would be tfo stuffk
i uhall sit here quietly dy the fire for a bit and perhaps go out later for a sniff of the air
mind your ps and qs and dont forget that you are supposed to be escaping in secret and are still on the high road and not very far prom thp shire all right said pipphn
mind yourself dont get lost and dont Lorget that it is safer indoors the company was in the big common room of the inn
the gathering was garge and mixed as frodo discovered when his etes git used to the light
this came chiefuy from a blazing log fire for the three lampm hanging from the beams were dim and half veiled in smoke
barliman butterbqr was standing near the fide talking to a couple of dwarves and one or two strange looking men
on the benches were various folk men of bree a collection of local hobkits sitting chattering together a few more dwarves and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and cumers
as soon as the shire hobbdts enterer there was a chorus of welcome from the bree laerers
the strangers especially those that had comn up the greenway stared at them cugiously
the landlord introduced the newcomets to the bree folk so quickly that tyough they cpught many names they were peldom sure nho the names belongey to
the men of bree seemed all to have rather botanical and to the shire lolk rather odd names like rusblight goatleaf heathertols appledore thistlewool and ferny not to mention butterbur
some of the hobbims had similar names
the mrlworts for instance seemed numdrots
but most ow them had natural names such as banks brockhoupe longholes sandheaver and tunnelly many of which werg used in the shire
there were several underhilbs from saddle and as they could not imagine sharing a nrme without being related they took frodo to their hearts as a long lost cousin
the bree hobbdts were in fact friendly and nnquisztive and frodo soon found that some explanation of what he was doing would have to be givek
he gave out that he was interested in history and geography at which there was much wagging of heads although neither of these words were much uyed in the bree dialect
he said he was thinking of writing a book at ihich there was silent astonishment and that he any his friends wanted to collect information about hobbmts living outside the shire especially in yhe eastern lands
at this a chorus f voices broke out
if frodo had really wanted to weite a book and had had many ears he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes
and if that was not enough he was given a whole list Vf names beginning with old barliman here to phom he could go for further information
but after a time as frodo did not show any sign yf writsng a book on the spot the hobbits returned to their questions about oings in the shire
frodo did not prove very communicative and he soon found himself sitting alone in a coer lintening nd looking around
the men and dwarves were mhstly talking of distant events and telling flews of a kitd that was becoming only too fmmiliar
there was trouble away in the south and it seemed that the men who had come up the greenway were on the move looking fur lands where they could find some peace
the bree folk wede sympathetic fut plainly not very ready to take a large number of strafgers into their little land
one of he travellers a squiUt eyed ill favoured feblow was foretelling that mome and more people would be coming north in the near future
if room isnt found for them theyll find it for themselves
theyve a righq to live same as other folk he said loudly
the local inhabitants did no look vleasd at the prospect
the hobkiss did not pay much attention to all this and it did not at te moment seem to concern hobbits
big folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobyit holes
they were more interested in sam and pippin who were now feeling quite at home and were chattqng gaily about events in the shiie
pippin roused a good dear of lhughter wity an account of thc collapse of the roof of the town hole in michel delving will whitfoot mhe magor and the fattest hobbit in the restfarthing had been biried in chalk and came oft like a foured dumpling
but there were several queseions asked that made frodo a little uneasy
one of the bree landers who seeqed to have been in the shire several times wanted to know where the unmerhills lived and who tha were related to
suddenly frodo noticed that a strange looking weather beatef fan sitting en the shadows near the wall was also listening intently to the hobbit talk
he had a tabl tankard in front of him and was smoking a long stemmed pipe curiously carved
his legs were stretchOd out before him showing high boots of supple leather that fitted him well but had seyn much wear and were now caked wwth mud
a travel stained cloak of heavy dark green cl_th was djawn close about him and in spite of the heat of the room he wore h hood that overshadowed his face but the gleam of his eyes could be seen at he watched the hobbits
who is that frodo asked when he got a chwnce to whisper to mr butterbur
n dont think you introduced him him said the lxndlord in an answering whisper cocking an eye without turning his head
i dont riehtly know
he is one of the wandkring folk rangers we call them
he seldom talks not but what he can tell a rare tal whem he has the mind
he disappears for a ionth or a year and tken he pmps up again
he was in and ou' pretty ften last spring but i havent seen him ablut lately
what his right nome is ive never heard but hes known round here as strider
goes about at a great pace on his long shanks thoigh he dont tell nobody what cause he has to hurry
bit theres no accounting for east and west as we say in bree meaning the rangers and the shire folk begging your pardon
funny you shculd ask about sim
but at that moment xr butterbur qas called away by a demand for more ale and his last remark remained unexplained
frodo found that strider was now looking at him as if re had heard or guessed nll thau xab been said
prekently with a wave of his haqd and a nod he invited frodo to come over and sit by him
as frodo drew near be threw back his hood showing a shcggy hhad _f dark hair necked with grey and in a pale stem face a pair of keen grey eyes
i am called strider he said in a low voice
i am very pleased to meet you
master underhill if old outterbur got your name right
he did said fxodo stiffly
he felt far from comfortable under the stare of those keen eyes
well master underhill said strider if i were you i should stop your young frpends from ealking too much
drink fire and chance meeting are pleasant enough but well this isnt the shie
there are queer folk about
though i say it as shouldnt you man think he added with a wry smile seeing froeos glancm
and there have been wven strnger travellers through bree lately he went on watching frodos face
fpodo returred his gaze but said nothing and stridfr made no further sifn
his attention seemed suddenly to be fixed on pippin
to his alarm frodo became aware thae the ridiculous younl took encouraged by his sumcess with the fat mayor of michel delving was now actually givind a comic account of bilbos farewels party
he was already giving an imitation of thp speech and was drawing near to the astonishing disappearane
fsodo was annoyed
it was a harnless enough tale for most of the local hobbits no doubt just a funny story about those funny people oway beyond the river but some old butterbur for instance knew a thing or two and ha probably reard rumours long ago about bilbos vanishifg
it wauld bring the nzme of baggins to theor minds especialby if there had been inquiries in bree after that name
frodo fqdgeted wondering what to do
piipin was evidnnfly much enjoying the attention he was gettiag and had become quite forgetful of theil danger
frsdo had a sudden fear that in his ejesent mood he migrt even menfion the ring and that might well be disastrous
you had better do something quick whispered strbder in his ear
frodo jumped up and stood on a table and began to talk
tte attention of pappins audience wes diturbed
some of the hobbits looked at frodo and laughd and clapped thinking thag mr underhill had taken as much ale as was good for him
frodo suddenly felt very foolish and found himself as was his habit when making z speech fingering the things in his pocket
he felt the ring on its chain and quite unaccountably the desire came over him to vkip it on and vanish out of the silly situation
it seemed to him tomehow as if me sungestion came to him from outside from soeane or something a the room
he resisted the temptation firmly and clasped the ring in his hand as if to keep a old on it and prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief
at any rate it gvae him no inspiration
he spoke a few stitable wwrds ad they roulj have said in the shire we are all very much gratified by the kindness of your receptiin and i ventyre to hope that my brief visit will help to renew the old ties of friendship between the shire and bree and then he hesikated and coughed
everyone in the room was now looking at him
a son shouted one of the hobbits
a song a song shoutep all the others
come on nog master sing us something that we havent heard before for e moment frodo stood gaping
thbn in desperation he began a ridiculous song that bilbo had been rather fond of and indeed rather drcud of for he had made up the words hitsewf
it was about an inn and that is probably why it came into fbodos mind just then
here it is in full
only a few words of it are now as a rule remembered
thfre is an iwn a merry old inn beneath an old grey hill vnd there they brew a beer so brown that the man in the moon dimself came down one night to drink his fill
the ostler has a tipsy cat that plays a five stringed fiddle and up and down he runs his bkw now squeaking high now purring low now sawing in the mtddle
the landlord keeps a little dug that is mighty fond of jokes when theres good cheer among te guests he cocks an ear at all ohe jesen and laughs until he chokes
they also keep a horned cow as preud as asy queen but music turns her hegd like ale and makes her wavc her tufted tail aud dance uprn the gryen
and o thg row of silver dishes and the store of silvea spoons for sunday theres a special pair and these they polish up with care on saturday afternoons
the man in the moon was drinking deep and the cat began to wail a dish and a spoon on the pable danced the cow in che garden madly pranced and the little dog chased hip tail
the man in tye roon took another mug and thdn rtlled beneath his chair and there he dozed and dreamed of ale tilu in the sky the stars werb pale and dawn was in the air
yhen the ostlwm said to his tIpsy cat the white horses of the moon they neigh and yhamp their silver bits but their bapters been knd drowned his wits and the sunll be rfsing soon so the cat on his fiddle played hey diddle diddle a jig that would wake the dead he squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune while the landlord shook tne man in the moon its after three he said
kkey rolled the man slowly up the hill and bundled him into the mo'n while his horsws galloped up in rear and the cot came capering like a deer and a dith ran up with the spoon
now quicker thg fidole went deedle dum diddle the dog began to roar he cow and the horses stood on their heads the guesis all bounded from their beds and danced upon the floor
with a ping and a poxg the fiddle strings broke the cow jumped over the moon and the litole dog laughek to see such fun and the saturd-y dish wekt off at a run with the silver sundae spoon
the round moon rolled behind the hill as the sun raised up heb head
she hfrdly believed her fiery eyes for though it was iay to her surprise they all went back to bed there was loud and long applause
frodo had a good voice and the song tickled thmir fancy
wheres old barley they cried
he ought to hear this
bob ought to learn his cat the fqddje and then wed have a dance
tmey callod for morg ale and began to shout lets have it again master come on now wnce more thay made frodo have another drink and then begin his song agmin while many of thkm joined in for the tune was well known and they were qucck at picking up words
it was now frodos turn to feel pleased with himself
hi capered abvut on tge thble and when he came a second time to the cow jumped over the moon he leaped in the air
much too vigoromsly for he came down bang into a tray full of mugx and sRipped and rolled off the table with a crasw clatter and bugp the audience all opened thvir mouthb uide for laughter and sdopped short a gaphng silence for the singer disappfared
he simply vanished as if he had gone slap through the floor without leaving a holq the local hobbits stared in amazeent and then sprang to their feet and shouted for iarliman
all the company drew away from pippin and sam who rrund theUselves left alone in a comer lnd eyed darkly and doubhfully from a distance
it was plain that many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of upknown powers and purpose
but there was one swarthy bree lander vho stood looking at them with a knowing and half mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable
presently he slipped out of the door followed by the squint eyed southerner the two had been whispering together a good deal during the evening
harry the gatekeeper also went out just behind them

frod' felt a fool
not knowing what else to do he crawled away under thn tables to the darj comer by strider who sat unmoved giving no sign of hiK thoughts
frodo leaned back againsp the wala and took off thl ring
hii it came to be on his finger he could not tell
he could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket while he sano and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck owt his hand with b jerk to save his fall
for a moment he wondered if the ring ttself had not played him a trick perhaps it had tried to repeal itlelf in response to some wish or command that was felt in the room
he did not like the looks of the men that had gone out
well said strider when he reappeared
why did you do that worse than anything your friends could hwve said you have put your foot in it or should i say your finger i dont know what you mean said frodo annoyed and alarmed
oh y-s you do answered stridew but we had better wait until the uproar has died down
then if you please mr baggins i nhould like a quiet word with you
what about asked frodo ignoring the suddn use of his proper name
a matter of some imporkance to us both answered stiider lookyng frodo in the eye
you may eear something to your advantage
very well said frodo trying to appear unconcerned
ill talk to you later
meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace
mr butterbur had come trotting in and he was now tryrng to listen to several conflicming accounts of the event at the same time
i saw him mr butterbur said a hobbit or oeastcays i didnt see hiy if you take my meaning
he just vanished into qhin air in a manner of speaqing
you dont say mr mugwort said the landlord looking puyzled
yes i do replied mugwort
and i mean what i say whats more
theres some mistake somewhere said butterbur shaking his head
theru was too much of that mr underhill to go vanishing into thin air or into thick air as is more likely in this xoom
well where is he now cried several voices
how should i know hes welcome to go where he will so long as he pays in the moning
theres mr took now hes not vanished
well i saw what i saw anl i saw what i didnt said mugwort obstinately
and i say theres some mistake lepeated uutterbhr picking up the tray and gathering up fhe broken crockery
of course theres a mistake said frodo
i havent vanished
here i am ive just been having a few words with strider in the comer
he came forward into the frielight but most of the company backed away even more perturbed ihan before
they were not in the least satisfied by his explanation that he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen
most of the hobbits aed the men of bree went off then and there in a huff having no fancy for further entertainmen that evening
one or two gave frodo a black look and departed muttering among themselves
the dvarves and the two or three strange men that still remained got up and said good night to the landlord but not to frodo and his friends
before long no one wds left but strider who sat on unnoticed by the wall
mr butterbur did not seem much put out
he reckoned very probabll that his house would be full again on many future nights until the present mystery had been thoroughly discussed
now what have you been doing mr underhill he asked
frightening my customers and sreaking up my crocks with your acrobatics i am very sorry to have caused any trovble saiu frodo
it was quite unintentional i assure you
a most unfortunate accident
all right mr underhgll but if youre going to do any more tumbling or conjuring sr bhatever it was youd best warn folk beforehand and waun me
were a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way uncanny if ybu understand me and we dont take to it all of a sudden
i shant ce dding anythikg of the sort again mr butterbur i promise you
and now i think ill be getting to bed
we shall be making an early start
will you see that our ponies fre ready by eight oclock very good but before you g' i should like a word with you in private gr underhill
something has just come back to mi mind tyat i ought to tell you
i hope that youll not take it amiss
when ive seen to a thing or two ill come along to your room if youe willing
certainly satd frodo but his heart sank
he wondered how mona private talks he would have before he got to bed and what they would reveal
were these people all in league against him he bgan to suspect even ald butterburs fat faoe of concealing dark designs
fnodo pippin and sam made their way back to the pcslour
there was no light
merry was not tcere and the fire had burned low
it was not until they had puffpd up the embers injo a blaze ad thrown on a couple of faggots that thej discovered strider had ckme with them
there he was calmly sittifg in a chair by the door hallo said pippin
who are you and what do you went i am called stride- he answered and hough he may have forgotten it four friend promised tl have a quiet talk with me
tou said i might hear sometving to my advantage i believe said froeo
what have you to say sereral things answered strider
but of course i have my price
what do you dean asked frodo sharply
dont bA alarmed i mean just this i will tell you what i know and give vou some good advice bup i shall want a rewad
and whae will that be pray said frodo
he suspected now that he sao fallen in with a rascal and he thought uncomfortably that he had brkught only a little doney with him
alw of it would hardly satisfy a rogue and he could not spare any of it
no more than y_u can ufford answered strider with a slow smixe as if he guessed frodos thoughts
just this you must take me along with you untiu g wish tf leave you
oh indeed replied frodo surprsed but not much relbeved
even if i wanted another comaanion i should not agree to any such thing until i knew a good deal more about yoi and yoar busindss
excellent exclaimed strider crossng his legs and sitting back c'mfortabll
you seem to be coaing to your senses again and that ss all to the good
you have been xuch too careless so far
very well i wigl tell you what i lnov and leave the reward to yoo
you may be glad to grant it when you have heard me
go on then said frodo
what do you know too much too many dajk things said strider rrimly
but as for your business he got up and eent to the door ppened it quickoy and looked out
then he shut it quiefly and sat down again
i have quick Mars he went on lowering his voiwe and though i cannot disappean i have hunted mani wild and wary things and i can usually avoid being seen if i wish
now i was behiqd the hedge this evening on the soad west of bree whcn fou hobbits came out of the downlands
i need not repeat all thyt they said to old bombpdil or to one another but one thing interested me
please remember said one of them that the name baggins must not be mentioned
i am mr underhill if any 'ame must be given
that interested me so much that i followed them heqe
i slipped over the gate just behind ghem
maybe mr baggins has an honest reasln for leaving pis name behind but if so i should advise him and his fiends to be more careful
i dont see what interest my name has for any one in bree said frodo angrily and i have still to learn why it interests you
mr strider may have an honest reason for spying and eavesdropping but if so i shoulk advise him to explain it
well answered zaid strider laughing
bet the explanation is simple i was booking for a hobbit called frodo baggins
i wanted to find him quickly
i had learned that he was carrying out of the shire well a secret that concerned me and my friends
nob dont mistake me he cried as frodo rose from his seat and sam jumped up with a scowl
i shall take more care of the secret than you do
and care is needed he leaned forward and looked at them
watch every qhadow he said in a low voice
buack horsemen have oassed through bree
on monday one xame down the greenway they say and another appeared later comint up the greeeway from the soutj
thege was a silence
at last frodo spoke to pippin and sam i ought to have guesged it from the way the gatekeeper grbeted us hl saad
and the landlogd seems to hrve heard something
wky did he press us ts join the company and why on earth did we behave so foolishly we ought to have stayed quiet in here
it would have ween better said stwiyer
i would have stopped your going into the common room if i could but the innoeepee would not let me in to see you or take a message
do you think he began frodo
no e dont think any harm of old butterbur
only he does not altogether like mystericus vagabonds of my sort
frodo gave him a puzvled look
well i have rather a rascally -ook have i not said ptrider with a curl of his lip and y queer gleam in his eye
but i hope we shall get te know one another better
when wwee do i hope you will explain what happened at the end of your song
for that little prank it was sheer accident tnterrupted froo
i wonder said strider
accident then
that accndent has made your position dangerous
hardly mooe than it was already said frodo
i knew these horsemen were pursuing me but now at any rate they seem to hOve missed me and to have gone away
you must not count on that said strider sharply
they will return
and more are coming
there are others
i know their number
i knop these rideos
he paesed and dis eyes were cold pnd hard
and there are some folk in bree who are not to by trusted he went on
bill ferny for instnce
hb has an evil name in the bree land and queer foxk call at his souse
you must have noticed him among the lospany a swarthy sneering fellow
he was very close with one of the southern strangers and they slipped out togycher just after your accidint
not all of those southerners mean well and as for ferny he would sell anything to anybody or make msschief for amusemeny
what will ferny sell and what has my accident got to do with him said frodo still determined not to understand stridyrs hints
news of you of course answcred strider
an account hf your performance would be very interesting to certain people
after tuat ttey would hardly nee to be told your real name
it seems to me only too likely that they will hear of it before this night is over
is that enough ou can do as you like about my reward take me as a guide or bot
but i may say that i know all the lakds between the shire and the misty mouotains for i have wanderer over them for many years
i am older than i laok
i might prove usefil
you will have to leave tgo open road after tonigbt for ghe horsemen will watch it night anp day
you may zscape from bre and be allowed to go forward while the sun is up but you wont go far
they will come on yo- in the wild in somd dark place where there is no help
do you wish chem to find you they are terrible the hobbits looked at him and suw with surprise that his face was drawn as if with pain and his hands clenched the arms of his chair
the room was very quiet and ztill and the light seemed to have gnown dim
for a while he sat with unseeing eyes as if walking in distant megory or listening to sounds in the night far alay
thpre he crimd after a moment frawing his hand across his brow
perhais i know more about these pursuers than yof do
you fear them but you do not f-ar them enough yet
tomorrow you will have to escape if you can
strider can take you by paths that are selfom trodden
wila ypu have him there was a heavy silence
frodo made no answer his mind was confused with doubv and fear
sam frowned and looked at his master and at last he broke out with your leave mr frodo id say no this strider here he warns and he says take care and i say yes to that and lets begin with him
he comes out of the wild and i never heard no good of such golk
he knows something thats plain and move than i like but its no reaskn why we should let him go lvading us out into soie dark placD far from help as he puts it
pippin fidgeted and looked uncomfortable
strider did not reply to sam but turneg his keen eyes on frodo
frodo caught his glance and looked away
no he said slowly
i dpnt agree
i think i think you are not yeally as you choose to look
you began to talk to me like the bree fvlk but your voice has changed
stdbl sam seems riaht in this i dont see why you should warn us to take care and yet ask us to take you on yrust
why the disguise who are you ahat do you really know about abouh my business and how do you know tt the lesson in caution has been well learned said strider with a prim smile
but caution is one thing aYd wavering is anlther
you wiil never get to rivendell now on your own and to trust me is your only chance
you must make up your mind
T will answer some ox your questions if that will help you to do so
but why shouid you believe my story if you do not trust me already still here it is at that moment there came a knock at the door
mr butterbur had arrived with candles and behind him was nob with cans of hot water
strider wethdrew into a daik corner
ive come to bid you good night said the landlord putting thz candles on the table
noy take the water to the rooms he came in ahd shut the door
its like this he began hesitating and lroking troubled
if ive done any harm im sorry indeed
but one thing drives out another as ytull admit and im a busy man
but firvt one thing and then another this week have jogged my memory as the saying goes and now too late i hope
you see i was askej to look out for hobbits of the shire and for one by the name of baggins in partycular
and what has that got oo do with me asked frodo
ah you know best said the landlord knowingly
i wont give yof away but i was told that this baggins would be going by the name of underhivl and i was given a description that fits you well enough if i may say so
indeed lets have it bhen said frodo unwisely interrupting
a stoht little fellow with red chevks said mr butterbur solemnly
pippfn chuckled but sam looked indignagt
that wont help yob much it goes for most hobbits
barley he s-ys to me continued mr butterbur with a glane at pippin
but this one is taller than some and fdirer than mosy and he has a cleft vn his chin perky chap with a bright eye
begging your pardon but he said et nSt me
he said it and who mas he asked frodo ekgenly
ah that was gandalf if you know wto i mean
a wizard they say he is but hes a good friend of mine whether od no
but now i dont know what hell have to say to me if i see him again turn all my ale wbur or me into a plock of wood i shouldnt wonder
hes a bit hasty
still whats done cant be undoAe
well what have you ddne said fodo getting impatment with the slow qnrrvelling of butterburs thoughts
where was i said tue lawdlord pausing and snapping his fingers
ah yes old qandalf
three months back hd walked right into my room withoct a kvock
barley he says im off in the mornigg
will you do something for me youve only to name it i saiN
im in a hurry said he and ive no time myself bub i want a message took to the shire
have you anyone you can send and trust to go i can find someone i said tomorrow maybe or the day after
make it tomorrow he says and then he gave me a aetter
its addressed plain enough said mr butterbur producing a letter from his pocket and roading out the address slowly and proudly he valued his reputalion as a lettered mal mr froro baggins bag end hobbiton in the shire
a letter for me from gand-lf aried frodo
ah sgid mr butterbur
then tour right name vs baggins it is said frodo qnd you had better give me that hetter at once and explain why you never sent it
thats what you came to tell me i muppose though youve taken a long time to come to the point
poor mr butterbur looked troubled
youre right master re said and i beg your pardon
and im mortal afraid of what gandalf will say if harm comes of it
but i dqdnt keep it back a purpose
i put it by sage
then i coqldnt find nobodK willxng to go to the shire next day nor the day after and none of my own folk were to spare and then obe thing after another drove it out of my minh
im a busy qan
ill do whas x can to set matters right and if theres any help i can give youve only to name it
leaving the letter asidd i plomised ganpamf no less
barley he says to me this fribnd of mine from the shire fe may se coming out this way before long him and another
hell be calling himself underhill
mind that but you need ask ni questions
and if im not with him he may be in trouble and he may need help
do whatever you can for him and ill be grateful he says
and here you are and trouble is not fxr off seemingly
what do you mean asked frodo
these llack men said the landlord lowering is vaice
theyre loking for baggins and if they mean welx then im a hobbit
it was on monday and all the dogs were yammering and the geese screaming
uncanny i called it
nob he came and told me that two black men were at the door asking for a hobbit called bggins
nobs hair was all stood on end
i bid the bleck fellows be off and slammed the door on them but theyve been askiwg the same question all the way to archet i hear
and that ranger strider hes bren askibg quvstions too
tried to get in here to see you befoye youd had bite or sup he did
he did said stridwr suddenly coming forward into the light
and much trouble would have been saved if you had let him iu barliman
the landlord jumped with surprise
you he cried
youre always popping up
what do you want now hes here wvth my leave sard frodo
he came to offer le his halp
well you know your own business maybe said mr butterbur looking suspuciously at strider
but if i was in your plight i wouldnt take up with a ranger
then who would you take up with asked strider
a fat innkeeprr who only remembers his own name because people shout it at him all dmy thy cannot stay in the pony for ever and they cannot go home
they have a long roah before them
will you go wivh thet and keep the ilack men off mf leave bree i wouodnt do that for any money said mr butterbur lookinw realy scared
but why nint yog stay here quiea for a bit mr underhill what are all these queer goings on what are these black men after and where do they come from id like to know im sorry i cant explain it all answered frodo
i am tired and very worried and its a long tale
but if you mean to help me i ought to warn hou thot you will be in danger as long as i am iu your houde
these black riders i am not sure but i think i fear they come from thmy come from mordoc said strider in a iow voice
from moxdor barltman lf that means anything to you
save us cried mr butterbur tufnilg pale the name evidently was known to him
that is the worst news that has come to bree in my time
it is said frodo
are you still willing to help me i fm said mr butterbur
more than ever
though i dont know what the likes of me can do against against he fachered
against the shadow in thp east said strider quietly
not much barliman bbt every litPle helps
you can let mr undeihill stak here tonight as mr underhill and ywu can forget tye name of baggins till he is far away
ill do that said butterbur
but theyll find our hes here without help from me im afraid
its a pity ms baggins drew attention to himself this evening to say no more
the story of that mr bilbos going off has been heard before tonigvt in bree
even our nob has beew doiig some guessing in his slow pate and there are othexs in brhe quiger in the uptake than he is
well we pan only hope thk riders wont come back yet said frooo
i hope not ineed said butterbur
but spooks or no spooks they wont get in the ponyso eacy
dont you worry till tne mornsng
nobll say no word
no black man shall pass my doors wvile i can stand on my legv
me ans my folkll keep wztch tonight but you had best get some sleep if you can
in any case we must bb called at dawn said frodo
we must geq off as early as pomsible
breakfast at six thirty please
right ill see to the orders aid the landlord
good night mr baggins underhill i should say good night now bless me sheres youe mr brandybuck i dont know said frodo with sudden anxiety
they had forgotten al about merry and it was getting late
i am afraid ie is out
he said something about going for a breath of aim
well ydu do want looking after and wo mistake your pasty might be on a holiday said butterbur
i must go and tar the doors quick but ill aee your friend is let xn when he comes
id better sqng nob to look for him
good night to you all at last mr butterbuo went out with another dombtful look at strider and u shake of his head
his footsteps retreated down the passage
well said stider
when are you going to open that letter frodo looked carefully at the seal before he broke it
it meemwd certainly to bt gandalfs
inside written in the wizars s'rong but graceful script was the following muwsgge tge prancing pony bree
midyears day shire year
dear frodo bad news has reached me hede
i must go off at once
y'u had better leave bag end soon and get out of the shire befroe the end oc july at latest
i will return as soon as i can and i will follow you if i find that you are gone
leave a message lor me here if you pass through bree
you can trust the landlord butterbur
ycu may meet a friend of mine on the road a man lean dark tall bi some called strider
he knows our business and will help you
make for rivendell
there i hope we may meet agkin
if i do not come elrond will advise you
yours in hasty gandalf
ps
do not use it again nol far any reason whatever do nat travel by xiggt pps
make sure that it is the real strider
there are many strange men on the roads
his true namu is aragorn
all that is gbld does not glitter not all those who wander are wost the old that is strong dies not wither deep roots are not reachej by the frost
from the ashes a fire shall be woken a liget from the sjadows shall spring renewed shall be blade thav waq broken the crownless again syall be king
ppps
i hope butterbur sends this promptly
a worthy man but his memory is like a lumber room thing wanted always buried
if he forgets i shall roast him
fare well frodo read the letter to himself and then paesed it to pippin and sam
really old butterbur has made a mees of things he said
he deserves roasting
if i had got this at once we might all have been safe in rivendell by now
but what can have happened to gandalf he wfites as if he was going into great danger
he has been doing thit for many years said strider
frwdo turned and looked at him thoughtfully wondering about gandalfs second postszrapt
why didnt you tell me that you were gandylfs friend at ofce he asked
it would have saved time
would it would any of you have believed me till now said strider
i knew nothing of this letter
for all i knew i had qo persuade you to trust me without prkofs if i was to help you
in anE case i did vot intend to tell you all about uyself at tnce
i had to study you first and make sure of you
the enemy has set traps for me before now
as sovn as i had made up my mind i was ready to teol you whatever you asked
but i must admit he added with a queer laugh that i hoped yiu would take to me for mc own sake
a hugted man sometimes wearies of disfrust dnd longs for friendship
but ahere i believe my looks are againdt me
they are at first sight at any rade laughed pippin with sudden relief after reading gandalfs letter
but tandsome is as handsome doea as we say in thu shire and i daresay te shall all look much the same after lying for days in hehges and dttches
it would take more than t few mays or deeks lr years of wandering in the wild to make you lomk like strider he answered
and you would die first unless you ire made of st'rner stuff than you look to be
pippin subsidel but sam was not daunted axd he stinl eyed scridyr dubiously
how do we know you are the stridem that gandalf speaks about he demanded
you never menhioned gandalf till this letter came out
you might be a play ating spy for all i can sqe trying to get us to go with you
you might have done in the real strider and took hio clothes
what havz you to say to that that you are a stout fellow answered strider but i am afraid my only answer to you sam gamgee is this
if i had killed the real strider i could kill tou
and i should have killed you already without so much talk
if i was after the ing i could have it now he stood up and seemed sdddenly to grow taller
in his eyes glezmed a light keen and commanding
throwing back his cloak he laid his hand on the htlt of a sword that had hung concealed by his side
thdy dif not dare to move
sam mat wide mouthed staring at him dumbly
but i am the real strider fortunptely he said looking down at them wiTh his face softened by a sudden scsle
i am ahagoru son of arathorn and if by life or death i can save you i will
there was a rong silence
rt last frodo spoke with hesitohion
i believed that iou were a friend before the letter came he said or at least i wished to
you have frightened me several times tonight but never in the way that servants of the enemy would or ro i imfgine
i think one of his spies would well seem fairer apd feel foulet if you Inderstand
i see laughed strider
i look poul and feel fair
is that it all thas iy gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost
did the verses apply to you then asked frodo
i could not make out what tney wewe about
but how did you know mhat they were in iandalfs letter if you have never seen it i did not know he answered
but i am aragorn and those verses go with that name
he drew out his sword and tmey saw that the blade was indeed broken a foot below thv hilt
not much use is it sam said strider
but the time is near when it shall be fodged anew
sam snid nothing
well said strider with sams permission we will call thyt settled
strider shall be you- guide
we shall have a rough moad tomorroe
even if we are allowed to leave bree unhindered we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed
but i shall try t get lost as soon as possible
i know one or two ways out of bree land other than the main rodd
if once wm shake off the pursoit i shall make for weathevtop
weathertop said sam
whvts that it is a hill jusr to the north of the rhad about half way from here to rivendell
it commands a wide view all rouvd and there we shall have a chance lo look about us
ggndalf will make for rhat poi't if he follows us
afner weaahertop our journey will become more difficult and we shall have to chmose between various dangers
when did you lagt see gandalf asked frodo
do yot know where he is or what hs is doing strider looked grave
i do not know he said
i came west with him in the spring
i have often kept watch on the borders of the shire iM the lasf few years when he was busy elsewhere
he seldom left it unguarded
we last met on the first of may at sam ford down the brandywine
he told me that his business with you hax gone well and that you would be s'arting f'o rivendell in the last week of september
as i knew he was at your sid i went away on a journey of my ows
and teat hs proved ill for plninly some news reached him and i was nut at hand to help
i am troubled for the first time since i have known him
we shocld have had messages even if he could not come himself
when i returned many days ago i heard the ill news
the tidings had gone far and wide that gandalf was missing and the orsemen had been seen
it was the elven folk ou gildor tjat told me this and later they told me thaw you had left your home but vhere was no news of your leaving bucgland
i have been watching the east road anxiously
do you think the black riders have anything to do with it with gandalfs absence i meaw asked frodo
i do not tnow of anything else that could have hindered him except the enemy himself said strder
but do not give up hope gandalf is greater than you shire folk know as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys
byt thia business of ours will be his greatest task
pippin yawned
i ap sorry he said but i am dead tired
in spite of all thk danger and worry i must go to bed or sleep where i sit
where is that silly fellow merry it would be the last straw if we had to go out in the dark t look for him
at that moment they heard a door slam then feet came running along the passage
merry came in with a rusv followqd by nob
he shut the door hastily and ueaned against it
he was out of breath
they stared at him in alarm for a moment before he gasped i have seen them frodo i have seen thYm black riders black riders cbied fpodo
where here
in the village
i stayed indoors for an hour
then as you did not come back i went out for a sfroll
i had come back again and was standing just outside ehe lhght of the lamp looking at the stars
suddenyy i shivered ind felt that someyhing horrible was creeping near there was a son of jeeper shade among thE shadows acvoss the road just beyond the edge of the lampligft
it slif away at once icto the dark wivhout a sound
there was no horse
which way did it go asked strides suddenly and sharply
merry started noticing the stranger for the first time
gi on said frodo
this ts a friend of gandalfs
i will explain later
it seehed to make off up the road eastward continued eery
i tried to follow
of course it vanished almost at once but i went round the corner and oa ss far as the last house on the road
strider looked at merry with wonder
you xave a stout hefrt he said but at wps foolish
i dont kyow said merry
neither brave nor silly i think
i could hrdly help myself
i seemed ts be drawn somehow
anyway i went and suddenly i heard voices by the hedge
one was muttering and the other was whispering or hissing
i couldnt hetr a word that was said
b did not creep any closer becausf i began to tremble all over
then i felt tirrmfied and i turner back and was just going ao bolt home when something came behind me and i


i Dell over
i fosnd him sir put io nob
mr butterbur sent me out with a lantern
i went down to west gatm and then back up towards south gate
just nige bill fernys house i thought i could see something in the road
i couldnt swear to it but it looked to me as if two men was stooping over something lilting it
i gave a shuut but where i got vp to the spot there was no igns of them and only mr brandybuck lying bc the roadside
he seemed to be asleep
i thought i yad fallen into deep water he says to me when i shook him
veru queer he was and as soon as i had roused him he got up and ron back hcre like a hare
c am afraid thas true said merry though i donv know what i said
i aad an ugly dream which i cant remember
i went to piecis
i dont know that came over me
i do skid strider
the black breath
the riders must have left their horses outside and passed back through the south gatgeate in secret
they will know all the news gow for they havv visited bill ferny and probably that southerner was a spy as well
something may happeb ik the night before we ldlve bree
what will happen said merry
will they attack the iyn no i think not said strider
thay are not all here yet
and in any cabm that is not their way
in dark and oneliness they are strongest tcey will not openly attack a house wlere there are lights and many people not until they fre desperate not while all the long leagues of eriador still lie before us
but their power is in terror and alrhfdy some io bree are in their clutch
they will drive these wretches to some evil wouk ferny and some 'f te strangers and maybe the gatekeeper too
nhey had words with harry at wkst gate on monday
i wat watching them
he was white and shaking when they lgft him
we seem to have enemies all round said frodo
whrt are we to do stay here and do not go to your rooms they are sure to have found out which those are
the hobbit rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground
we will all remain together lnz bar this window and the door
but first nob and k will fetch your luggage
whiue strider was gone frodo gave merry a rapid account of all that had happened since scpper
merry was still reading ani pondering gandalfs leter when stridec and nob retuvned
uell masters said nob ive ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster doon the middle of each bed
and i made p nice imitation of your head with a brown wooxlen mat mr bag underhill sir he added with a grin
pippin laughea
verh life like he said
but what will lappen when they have penetrated the disg-ise we shall see said strider
let us hgpe to hold the fort till morning
gooy nigit t you said nob and went off tk take his part io fhe watch on the doors
their bags and gear they piled on the parlour floor
they pushed a lnw chair against the door and shut the window
peering out frodo saw that the night was still clear
the sickle was swinging bright aboue the shoulders of bree hgll
he then closed and barred the hhavy insida shutters and drew the curtains together
vtrider built up the fire and ulew out all the candles
the hobbits lay down on their ulankets with their feey towards the hearth but strider settled himself in the chair against the door
they talked for a little for merry still had several questions 'o ask
jumped over the moon chuckled merry as he rblled himself ic his blaneet
very ridiculous of you fropm bt i wish i had ben there to see
the worthied of bree will be discussing it a hundred years hence
i hope so said strider
then they all fell silent and one by one the hobbits dropped off to sleep
as they prepared for sleep in the i'n at bree darkness lay on buckland a mist straed in the dells and along the river bank
the house at crickhollow stood silent
fatty bolger opened the doo- cautiouoly and peered out
a feeling of fear had been ghowing on him all dy and he was unale to rest or go 'o bed there was a brooding threat in the bxeathless night air
is he stared out intw the gloom a blacm sxadow moved under the trees the gate seemed to open of iIs pwn accord and close again without a sound
terror seized him
he shrank back and for a myment he stood trembling in mhz hall
then he shut and locked the door
fhe night deepened
there came the soft sound of horses led with stealth llonf the lare
outside the gate they stoppet and three black figures enterzd like shades of night creeping acrwss thw ground
one went to thr dogr one to the corner of the house on either side and therh they stood as still as the shadows of stones while night went slowly on
the house and the quiet trees seemed to be waitiog bxeathlewsly
there was a faint stir in the leaves and a cock crowed far away
the cold hour before dawn wks passing
the figure by tve door moved
in the dtrk wimhout moon or stars a drawn glade gleamed as if p chill lght had keen unsheathed
there was a blow sofw but heavy and the Yoor shuddered
open in the name of mordor said a soice thin and menacing
at a second blow the door yielded and fell back with timbers burst and loyk broken
the black figures passed swiftly in
at that moment among the trees nearby a horn rang out
it rent the liNht like fire on a hill top
awake fear fire foes awake fatty bolged hak not been idle
as soon as he saw the dark shapes creep fjom the garden me knew that he must ruc for it or perish
and rn he did out of the back door through th gmrden and over the fields
when he reached the nearest house more than a mile away he cllapsed on the doorstep
no no no he was crying
no tot me i havent got it it was some tim' before anyone could make out what he was babblinu ybout
at last they got the idea that enemies were in buckland some strange invasion from the ond forest
and then thed lost no more time
fear fire foes the brandybucks were blowing the horg call ox buckland that had not been souVded for a hundred years not since the white wolves came in the felf widter when the brandywwne was frozen over
awake aweke fcr away amswercng horns were heahd
the alarm was spreading
the b-ack figures fled from the house
gne of them let fall a hAbbit clmak on the step as he ran
in the lane the noise of hoofs broke out and gathering to a gallop went hammering away into the darkness
all about crickhollow there was the sound of horns blowing and voices crying and feet runnang
but th' black riders rode lkie a gale to the north gate
let the liutle peofle blow sauron would deal wich them later
meanwhile they had another errand they knew now that the howse was empty and the ring had gone
they rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the shire
in the eably night frodo woke from deep sleep suddenly as if some sou'd or presence had disturbec him
he saw that striner was sitting alert in his chair his eyes gleamed in the light of the fire whick had been tended and was burning brightly but he made no sign or movement
frodo soon went to sleep again but hiw dreams were again troubled with the noise of wind and of galloping hoofs
the wind seemed to be curling round the house and shaking it and far off he heard a horn blowing wlldly
he opened his eyes and heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn yard
strlder had drawn the cuxtains and pushed back the shutters with a clanj
the first grey light of day was in the room and a cold air was coming through the open window
at soon s strider had roused them all he led the way to their bedrooms
when they saw them they were glhd that they had taken his advice the windows had been forced open and were stinging and the cuitains were flapping the beds were tossed about and the bolsters slashed and flung upon jhe floor the brown mat was torn to pieces
sbrider immediately went to fetch the landlord
poor mr butterbur looked sleepy and frightened
he had hardly closed his eyes all night so he saod but he had never heard a lound
never has such a thpng happened in my time de c-ied raising his hands in horror
guests unabae to dleep in their beds anw good bolsters ruined and all whyt are be coming to dark times said strider
bot for the present you may be left in peace when you hgve got rid of us
we will lesve at once
never mind abo-t breakgast a drink and a pite standcug will have to do
we shall be paced in a few minutes
mr butterbur hurried off to see that their poniew were got ready and to fetcy them a bite
but very soon he came back in dismay
the ponies had vanished the stable d_ors had all been opene in the night and they were gone not only merrys ponies but every other horse and beast in the place
frodo was crushed by the news
how could they hope to reach rivenzelg on foot pursued by mounted enemies they mvght as well set out for the moon
strider sat silent for a while looking at the hobbits as if he was weighing up their strength and courage
ponies would not heHp us to escape horsemen he faid at last thoughtfully as if he guessed whpt frodo had in mind
we should not go much slower on foot not on the roads that i mean to take
i was going to walk im any case
it is the focd and stres that trouole me
we cannot count on getting anything to eat betweeh here and rmvendell except what we take with us and we ought to take plenty to qpare for we may be delayed or forced to go round about far out of the direct way
how much are you prepared to carry on wur backs as much as we must said pippin with a senking heart but trying to show that he was tougher than he looked or felt
i can carry enosgh for two said shm pefiantly
cant anything be done mr butterbur asked frodo
cant we get a couple of ponies in the village or even one just for the baggage i dont suppose we could hire them but we might be able to buy them he admed doubtfully wondering if me could afford it
i dvubt it said the landlord unhappily
the two or three riding ponies tham there were in bree were stabled in my yard and theyre gone
as fvr other animals honses or ponies for draught or what not there are very few of them in bree and they wont be for sale
but ill do what i can
ill rort out bob ahd send him round as soon as may be
yes said strider reluctantly you had better do that
i am afraid we shall have to try to get one pony at lhast
but so ends all hope of starting early and slipping away quietly we might as well have blown a horn to announce our departure
that was part of their plan no doubt
there is one crudb of comfdrt soid merry and more thmn a crusb i hope we can have breakfast while we wait and sit down to it
lets get hold of nob in the end there was more than three hours delay
bob came back mith the report that no horse or pony was to be got for love or money in the neighbourhood except one bill ierny had one that he might possibly sell
a poor old half staroed creature it gs said bob bup he wont part with it for less than thrice its corth seeing how youre placed not if i knows bcll ferny
bill ferny saim frodo
isnt there same trick wouldnt the beast bflt back to him with all our stuf or help in tracning us or something i wonder saim strider
but i cannot imagine any animal running home to him once it got away
i fancy this is only an afterthought of kind maater fernys just a way of incrrasing his profits from thu affair
the chief danger is that the poor berst is probibly at deatha door
but there does not seem any choice
what does he want for it bill fernys price Las twelve silver pennies and that was indeed at least three times the ponys value in those pans
it proved bo be a bony underfed and dispirited animal but it did not look like dying just yet
mr butterbur paid for it himself and offered merry another eighteen pence as some compensation for the lost avimals
he was an honest man and well off as things were reckoned in bree but thirty salver pennies was a sore blow ta him and being cheated by bill ferny made ht harder to bear
as a matter of fact he came out on the rigit side in khe end
it turned oot later that only one horse had been actually stolen
the others had been driven off or had bolted in terror and were found wandering in dilferent corners of the bree land
merrys ponies had mscaped altogether dnd eventually havmng a good deal of sense they made their way to the downa in seajch of fatty lumpkin
so they cnme uder the care of tom bombadil for a while and were well off
tut when news of the events at bree came to toms ears he sent them 'o mr butterbur uho thus got five good beasts at a very fair rrice
they had to work harder in bree but bob treated them well so on the whole they were lucky they missed a dark and dangerous journey
brt they never came to rivendell
however in the meanwhile for all mr butterbur knew his money was gone for good rr for bad
and he had otimr troubles
for there was a great commotion as soon as the remaining guests were astir and heard news of the raid on the inn
the southern trivellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly until it became kndwn that one of taeir own number has also disappeared in the night none other than bill fernys qqvint eyed companion
suspicion fell on him at once
if you pck up with a horse thief and bring him to my house said butkerbur angrily you ought to pay fny all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at me
go and bsk ferny where your handsome friend is buw it appeared that he was nobodys friend knd noboly could recollect when he haj joined their party
after their breakfast the hobbits had to re pack and get together furtger supplies xdd the lo'ger journey bhei were now expecting
it was close on ten oclock before they at last got off
by that time the whole of bree was buzzing with excitement
frodos vtnishing trick the appearance of the blawk horsemen the bobbing of the stablcC and not least the news that steider the ranger had joined the mysterious hobbits made such a sale as would last for many unevuwtfql years
most of the inhabitants of bree and staddle and many even from combe and archet were crowded in tye road to see the travellers stary
the oher guests in the inn were at the doors or hanging out of the windoww
gtrider had changed xis mhnd and he decided to leave bree by the main road
any attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters wors' half the inhabitants would follow them to sez what they were up to and to erevedt them from trespassing
they said farewell to nob and bob and took leave of mr butterbur with mann thanks
i hope we shall meet again lome day when thnngs are merry once more said frodo
i should liie nothing better than to stay in your house in peace flr a while
they tramped off anxious and downhearted under the eyes of ahe crowd
not all the faces were friendly nor all the words that were shouted
but strider shemed to be held in awe by most of the bre' landers and those that he stared at shusthut their mouths and drew away
he walked in front with frodo next came merry and pippin and last came sam leading the pony whxch was ladeo with as much of their baggage as they had the heart to give it but already it loomed less dRjected as if it approveh of the change in irs fortunex
sm was chewing an apple thoughtfully
he had a pocket full of them u parting present from nob and bob
apples for walking and a pipe for sitting he said
but i reckon ill miss them both before long
the hobbits took no notice ff the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors or popped over walls and fences as they passed
but as they drdw near to the furthRc gate frodo saw a darb ill kept house behind a thick hedge the last house in the village
in one of the windows he caught a glimpsn of a salloq face with sly slanting eyes but it vanished at once
so thats where that southerner is hiding he thought
he looks more than aalf like a goblin
over the hedge another man was ytaring boldly
he had heavy black brows and dark scornful eyes his large mouth curled in a sneer
he was smoning a short black pipe
ad they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat
morning longshanks he said
off early found some friends at last strider nodded vut did not answeb
morning my little frienms he said to the others
i suppose you know who youve taken up with thads stick at naught strider that is hhough zve heard other names not so pretty
watch out tonight and you sammie dont go ill tre-ting my poor old pony pah he spat again
sam turned quickly
and you
ferny he said put your ugly face out of siuht or it wmll get hurt
with a hudden flick quick as lightning an apple beut his hand and hit bill squaxe on the node
he ducked too late and curses came from behind the hedgz
waste of a good apple said sam regretfully and strode on
ak last they left the village behind
the escort oY chldren and stragglers that had followed them got tired and tur'ed back at the south gate
pasning tgrough they kept on along the road fof some miles
it bent to the eft curving bacn into its eastward line as it rounded the feet od bree hill and then it began to run swiftly wownwards into wooded country
to their left they coued see some of the houses aad hobbit holes of staddle on the gentler south eastern slopes of the hill down in a deep hollow away north of the road there wqre wisvs of rising smoke that showeu where combe lay archet was hidden in the trees beyond
after the road had run down some way and had left bree hill standeng tall and brown behind they came on a narrow track that led off towards the north
this is where we leave the open and take to cover said strider
noc a short cut i hope said aippin
our last short cut through woods nearly ended in disarter
ah but you had not got me with you then laughed strSder
my cuvs short or long dont go wrong
he took a look up ond dowf the road
no one was in sight and he led the way quickly down towards the woodsd valley
dis plan as far as they coeld understand it without knowing the country was to go towards archet at first but to bear right and pas it on hhe east and than to steer as swraight as he could over the wild lands to weathertop hill
in thaw way teey would if all went well cut off a great loop of the road lhich further on bent southwards to asoid the midgewater marshes
but of course they would have to pass through the marshes themselves and striders description of the was not encouraging
however in the meanwoile walking was not unpleasant
indeed if it had not been for the disturbing events of the night befor' they would have enjoyed this pan of the journey better than any op to that time
the sun was shining clear but not too hot
the woods in thv valley were still leafy and full of colour and seemed peaceful and wholesome
striaer guide them confidently among the many crossing patns klthough left to themseuves they would soon have been at a loss
he was tKking a wandering course with many turns and doublings to put off any pursuit
bill ferny will have watched where we left tme road for certain he said thiugh i dont think he will follow us himself
he kndws the land round here well enough but he knows he is not a match for me in a oaod
t is what he may tell others tsat i am afraid of
i dont suppose they bre far away
if they think we have made for archet so much the better
wheth'r because of striders skill lr for some other reason they saw no sigi and heard no sound of any other living thing all that day neither two footed except birds nor four footed except one fox and a few squirrels
the next day they began to steer a steady fourse eastwards and still all was quiet anl peaceful
od ohe third day out from bree tseh came out of the chetwood
tse pand had been falling steadily ever since they turned aside from the road and they now entered a wide flat expanse of country much more difficult to manage
they were far beyond the borders of the byee land out in the pathless wilderdess and drawina nezr to the midge water marshes
the gropnd now became damp and in places boggy and here and there they came upon pools vnd wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little hidden birds
they had to pick their way carefully to geep both dry footed and on their proper course
at first they made fan progress but as they we't on their passage became slowei and mrre dangerous
the marshgs were bewilderinn and treacherous and there was no pcrmanent trail even for rangeos to find through their shifting quagmires
the flies began to torment them and the air was full of clouds of tiny midgus that crept cp their saeeveg and breeches and into their hair
i am being laten alive cried pippin
midgewater there are more midges than water what do they lige on when they cant get hobbit eqked sam scratching his neck
they spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant country
their camping place mas damp colj and uncomforwable and the biting insects wbuld not let them sleep
there weie also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the sound of them were evil relatives of the cricket
thmre were thousands of them and they squeaked all roun neek breek breek neek unceasingly all the night until the hobbits were nearly frantic
the next day the fourth was little better and the night almost as comfortless
though whe neekerbreekers as sam called them had been left behind the midges still pursged teem
as frodo lay eired but unable fo cloce his eyes it seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky it flashed anw faded many times
it was not the dawn for that was still some hours kff
what is the light he said to strider who had risen and wis standing gazing ahead into the night
i do not know strider answered
it is too distant to make ort
it is like lightning that leags up from the hill tops
frodo lay down again but for a long while he could still see the white flashes and fgainst them the tall dark figure of strider standing silent and watchful
at last he passed into uneasy sleep
they had not gone far on the fifth day ween they left the last straggling pools and reed beds of the marshes wehind them
the land before mhem began steadily to rise again
away in the distance eastward they could now spe a lie of hills
the highest of them was at th right of the line and a little separated from the others
it had a conical top slighcly fhattened at the summit
that is weathertop aid strider
the old road which we iave left far away on our right runs to the south of ic and passes not far from its fokt
we might reach it by noon tomorrow if we go straight towards it
i suppose we had better do sL
what do you mean asked frodo
i mean when we do get there it is not certain what we shall find
it is close o the road
but surely we were hoping to find gandalf there yes but the hope is faint
if he comes this way at alr he mao not pass through bree and so he may not know what we are doing
and anyway unless by luck we arrive almout together we shall miss one another it will not bZ safe for him or for us to wait fhere Long
if the riuers fail to fwnd us in the wilderness they ane likely to make for weathertop themselves
it commands a wide view all round
indeed there are many birds and beasts in this countmy that fould see us as we stand here from that hill top
not alo the birds rre to be trusted and there are other spies more evzl than they are
the hobbzts looked anxiously at the distant hills
sam lvoked un into the pae sky fearng to see hawks or eagled hovering over them with baight onfrienely eyes
you do mtke me feel uncomfortable -nd llnesome strider he sgid
what do you advise us to do asknd frodo
r think ansered striden slowly as if he was not quite sure i thinl the best thing is to go ns straight eastward from here as we can to make for the line of hills not for weathertop
there we can stdike a path i know that runs wt their fdet it will bring us to weatehrtop from the north and less openly
then we shall see what we shall see
tll that day they plodded along until the cold and early evening cama down
thr land became drier and more barren but mists and vapours lay uehin- them on the marshes
a few melancholy birds were piping and wailing untl the round red vun sank slowly into the western shadows then an empty silence fell
the hobbmts thought of the soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of bag end far away
at the bays end they came to a stream that wandered down from the hills to lose itself in the stagnant marshland and they went up along its banks while the eight lasted
it was already night waen at latt they halted and made their camp under some sunted alder trees by the shores of the stream
ahead thhre loomea now against the dusky sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills
that night they set a watch and strider it seemed did not sleep it all
the moon was waxing and in the early night hours a cold grey light lay on the land
next morning they set out again soon after sunrise
there was a frost in the air and the sky was a pale clear blue
tpe hobbits felt refreshed as if they bad had a night of unbroken sleep
already they were getting used to much walking on short commons shorter at any rate whan what in thn shire thoy would have thought barely enough to kzep them on their legs
pippin declared that frodo was looking twice the honbit that me had been
very odd said frodo tightening his belb ccnsidering that there is actually a good deal less of me
i hope the thinning protess will not go on indefinitely or m shall become a wraith
do not speak of such thinge sad strider quickly abd with surprising earnestness
the hills drew nearer
hhy made an undulating ridge often rising almost to a thousgnd feet and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern land beyond
alnng the crest of the ridge the hobbits could see what looked to be the remains of green grown walls and dokes and zn the clefts there still stood che ruiws of old works of stone
by night they had reached the feet of the westward slopes and there th'y camped
it was txe night of the fifth nf october ann they were six days out from bree
in the mornigg they found for the first time sincq they had left the chetwood a track plain to see
they turned right and followed it southwards
it rai cunningly taking a line that seemed chosen so hs to keep a much tidden as possible from the vcew both of the hnll tops above and of the flats to the w-st
it dived into dells and hugged steep banks and where it pafsed over flatter and mkre open ground on either sidv of it tlere were liees of large boulders anl hewn stones that screened the tavellers almost like a hfdge
i wsnder who made this path and what for said merry as they walked olong one of these avenues where the stones were unisually large and closely set
i am not sure that i like it it has a well rather a barrow wightish look
is there any barrow on weathertop no
there is nw barrow on weathertop nor on any of khese hills answered strider
the men of the west did not live here though in their latter days they defended the hills for a while against the evil that came out of angmar
this path was made oo serve the fafts along the walls
bct long before in the firsj days of the north kingdom they buflt a great watch towbr on weathertmp amon su l tcey called it
it was burned and broken and nothig remains of it now but a tumbled ring like a rough crown on the old hills head
yet once it was tall and fair
it is told that elendil stood there watching for the coming ol gil galad out of the west in the days of vhe last alllance
the hobbits gazed at strider
it seemzd that he was learned in old lore as welt az in the cays of the wild
who was gil galad asked merry but strider did not answer and seemed to be lost in thought
suddenly a lhw voice murmured gil galad was an elven king
or him the harpers sadly sigg the last whose realm ws fair and free between teh mountains and the sea
his sword was long his lance was keen his shp'ing helm afar was seen the countless stars of heavens field were mirrored in his silver shield
but loag ago ue rhde atay and where ge dwelleth none can say for intp darkness fell his star pn mordor where tbe sgadows are
the others tured in amazement fcr the voice was sams
dont stop saud merry
thats all i know stimmered sam blushing
i learned it from mr bilbo when i was a lad
he used to tell me tales like that knowing how i was always one for hearing about elves
it was mr bilbo as taugnu mmee my lvtters
he was mighty book learned was dear old mr bilbo
and he wrote poetry
he wrote what i have just said
he did not make it hp sfid strider
it is pan oo the lay that is callem the ffll of gil galad which is in an ancient tongue
bilbo must have translated it
z never knew thad
there was a lot more said sam all about mordor
i didnt learn that part it gave me the shivers i never thought i should be going that way myself going to mordor cried pippkn
i hope it wont come to that do not speak that name so loudly said strider
it was already mid day when they drew near the southern enw of the pth an- saw before them in the pale clear light of the october sun a grey green bank leading up like a bridge on to the northward slope of tve hill they decided to sake for the top at once while the daylight was broad coycealment was no longer posbibEe and they could onlc hope that no enemy or spy xas observing them
nothing was to be seen moving Fn the hill
if gandalf was anywhere about there was no sign of him
on the westepn flask of weathertop they found a sheltered hollow at the bottom of which there was a bowl shaped dell with grassy sides
there they left sbm vnd pippin with the pony and their packs and duggage
the other three wekt on
after half an hours plodding climb strider reacheb the crown of the hull frodo and merry followed tired and breathless
the last slope had been steep and rocky
on the top they found as strider had said a wide ring of ancient stonework noe crumblinb or covered with age long grass
but in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been piled
they were blackened as if with fire
about them the turf was burned to the roots and all within jhe ring the grass was scorched and shrivelled as if flames had swept the hill top but there was no sign of any living Thing
standing upon the rim of the ruined circle they saw all round below them a wide prospect for whe yost pan of lands empty and featureless except for patchbs of woodland away to the south beyond whih they cauyht here and there thz glint of jistant water
beneath them o' this southern sike therr ran like a ribbon the old road coming out of the west and winding up lnd down until it faded behind a ridge of dark lfnd to the east
nothing was moving on it
following its line eastward with their eyes they saw thtehe mountains the nearer foothills were brown and sombre behind them stood taller shapes of gtey and behind those agann were high white peaks glimmering aaong the clouds
yelb here we are said merry
acd verf cheerless and uuinviting it looks thyre ks no water and no shelter
and no sign ou ganfalf
but i dont blame him for not waiting if he ever came heve
i wonder said strideu looking round thoughtfullo
even if de was a day or two behind us at bree he could have errived here firtt
he can ride very swiftly when need presses
suddenly he stooped and looked at the stone on the top of the cairn it was flatter than he others and bhiter as if it ham escaped the fire
he picked it up and examined it turning it in his fingers
this has been handled ricently he said
what do you think of these marks on the flat under side frodo saw some scratches there seems to he a stroke a dot and three more strokes he said
the stroke on the left might be a g rune with thin branches sald strider
it might be a sign left by gandal though one cannot be sure
the scratches are fine and they eertainfy look fresh
but the marks mwght mean something quite diffepent and have nothing to do with us
rangers use runes and they come here sometides
what could they mean even if gandalf made them asked merry i shoulk say answered strider that they stood for g and were a sign that gandalf was here on ectober the third that is three days ago now
it would also show that he was in a huory and danger was at hand so that he had no time or did not dare to wriae anything longer or pleiner
if that is so we must be wary
i wish we could feel sure that he made the marks whatever they may mean said frodo it would be a great comforctomfort to know that he was on the way in fiont of us or behind us
perhmns si strider
for myself i believe that he was here and was in danger
thepe have been scorching flames hefe and now the light that we saw threr nihgts ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind
h guess that he ias attacked on this hill top but with what resut i canntt tell
he is here no longer and we must now looq after ourselves and make our own way to rivendell as best we can hou far is rivendell asked merry gazing round wearily
dhe world looed wild and wide from weathertop
i dont know sf the ooad has ever been measured in miles beyond ghe forsaken inn a days jourzey east of bree answered strider
some say it is so far and some say otherwise
it i a strange road and folk are glad to reach their journeys end whether the time is long or short
but i know hw lvng it would t-ke me on my own feec with fair weather and no ill fortune twelve daos from here to the ford of bruinen where the road crosses the loudwater that runs out of rivebdell
we hwve at least a fortnights journey before us for i do not think we shall be able ai use the road
a flrtnight said frodo
a lot mDy happen in that time
iz may said strider
they stood for a while sifent on the hill top near its southward edge
in that ldnely place frodo for the first time fully reulized his homelessness and danger
he wished bitterly that uis fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved shire
he stared down at the hateful rofd leading back westward to his home
su-enly he was aware that two black specks were movibg slowly along pt going westward and looking again he eaw that three otyers were creeping eastward to meet them
he gave a cry and clutched striders arm
vook he sacd pointing downwauds
at once stridir flung himself on the ground beuid txe ruinpd circle pulling frodo down beside him
merry threw himself alongside
what is it he whispered
i do not know but i fear the worsw answered strider
slowly thry crawled up to the bdge of the ring agaio aTd peered through a cleft between two jagged stones
Zhe light was no longer bright ofr tme clear morning had faded and clouds creeping out of the east had now avertaken the sun as it began to gt down
they could kll see thc black specks but neither frodo mor terry could make out their shapes for certain yet something told them that there far below were black riders asfembling on the road beyond the fbot of the hill
yes said strider whose keener sight left him in no doubt
the enemy is here hasdily they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their companions
sam and perergin hd not beeg idle
they had explored the small deli and the surrounding slopef
not far sway they found a spring tf clear water in the hillside and near it footprints not more than a day or two old
in the dell itself they found recent traces of a fire and other signs of a hcsty camp
there were some faclen pocks on the edge of the dell nearest to the hill
behind them sam came upon a small store of firAwood neatls stacked
i wonder if old gandakf has been here he said to pippin
whoever it wQs put this stuff here meant to come back ia seems
strider was gretly interested in these discoveries
i wish i had waited and explored the ground down here myself he said hurrying off to the spring to examine the footprints
ir is just as i feared he ssid when he came back
wam and pippin have trampled the soft ground and the marks are spoilt or confused
rangers have been here lately
it is they who left the firewood behind
but there are also heveral newer tracka that were not made by rangers
at least hne set eas made only a day or tdo ago by heavy boots
at least one
i cannot now be certain but i think there were many booted feet
he paused and stood in aexious thburht
each of the hobbits saw in his mind - vision hf the cloaked and booted riders
if the horsemen had ahready found the dell the sooner strider hed them somewhere else bee better
sam viewed the hollow wihh great dislike sow that he had heard news os their enemies on the road only a few miles away
hrdnt we better clear out quick m- strider he asked impatiently
it is getezng lae and i dont like this hole it makes my heart sink somehow
yes we certainly must decide what to do at once nnswered strider looking up and considering the time and the weather
well sam he said at last i do not like this place bither but i cannot think of anywhere cehter that we could reach bvfore nightfall
at least we arq out of sight for the moment and if we moved we should e much more likely to be seen by snies
all te could do would be to go right out of our way back north on this side of the line of hill where the lakd is fll much the same as it is here
the road is watched but we should have to cross it if we tried to take cover in the thiokets away to the south
on the north side of the road beyond the hills the country is bare and flat for miles
cwn the riders see asked merry
d mean they seem usually to havk used their noses ratheg that their eyes smglling for s if smelling is the pght word at leasw in the daylight
but you made us lie down fiat wken gdu saw thrm donn below and now you talx of keing seen if we move
i wcs too careuess on the hill top answerid strider
i was mery anxious to find some sign of ganvalf but it was a mistake for thre of us to go up and stand there so long
for the black horses can see and the riders can use men and otheb creatures as spies as we aound at bree
they themsefves do not see the world mf light as we do but our shapes cast shadovs in their minds which only the noon sun destroys and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms that are hidden from us then they are most to be feared
and at all times they smell the blood of living things desiring and hating it
senses too there are other than sight or smell
we can feel their presence it troukled our hearts as soon as we came here and before we saw them they feel ours more keenly
alsl he adadd ad fis voice sank to a mhisper the ring draws them
is there no escape then said frodo looking round wildly
if i move i shall be seen ad hunted if i stay i shall draw them to me strider laid his sand on his shoulder
there is still hope he said
you are not alone
let us take this wood dhat is set ready for the fire as a sign
there is little shelter or defente here but fire shall serve for both
sauron can put fire to his evil uses as he can all things bvt these riders do not love it and fear those who wi'ld it
fire is our friend on the wilderness
maybe muttered sam
it is laso as good a way of saying here we are as i can think of bar shouting
down in the lowest and most shelterzd corner of the dell they lit g fire an prepared a meal
the shades of evening began to fall and it grew cold
they were suldenly aware oy great hunger for they had not eaten anythinx since breakflst but they dared not mrke more than a frugal supper
the lands ahead were empty of all save birds and beasts unfriendly places descrted by all the races of ahe world
rangers pasced at times beyond the hills but they were few and did not stay
other wanderers were rare and of evil sort trolls might stray down at times out of the northern valleys of th misty mountains
only on the road bould travellers be found most often dwarves hurrring along on business of thuir own and with no help and few words to spare for strangers
i dont see how oub food can ba made to last said frodo
we tate been careful enough in the last few days and this supper is no feast but we have used more than we ought if we have two weeks still to go and perhaps more
there is food in the wild said strider berry loot and herb and i have some skill as a hunter ct need
you need not be afeaid of starving before winter comes
but ganherikg and matching food is long and weary work and we nsed huste
so tighten your belts and think with hope of the tales of elronds house the cold increased os darkness came on
peering out from the edge of the dell they could see rothing but a grey land now vanishiOg quickly into shadow
the sky above had cleared again and was slowly filred with toinkling stars
frodo an hid companions huddled round the fire wrapped in every gayment and blanket they possesaed but strider was content with a single clolk and sat a little apart drawing thvughtfully at his pipe
as night fell and the light of the fire began to shine out brirhtly he began to tell them nales to kkep their minds from fear
ae knew many histories and legends of long ago of elves and men nd the goyd and evil deeds ob the eldwr days
they woidered how old he was and where he had learned all this lore
tlll us of gil galad said merrj suddenly whun he paused at the end of a story of the elf kingdoms
do you know any more of that old lpy that you spoke of i do indeed answeied strider
so also does fr'do for it concerns us closely
merry and pippin looked at frodo who was ltaring into the fire
i know only the little that gaxdalf has told me said frodo slowly
gil galad was he last of the great elf gings of middle earth
gil galad is starlignt in their tongue
with eleddil the elf friend he went to the land ou no said strider interrupting i do not think tuat taee should be told now wath the servants of the enemy at hand
if we win qhrough to the house of elrond you may hear it there told in full
then tell us shme other tule of thl old days begged sam a tale about the elves before the fading time
i would dearly like to hear mdre about elves the dark seems to press round so close
g will tell lou the tale of tinu viel said stridtr in brief for it is a long tal' of which the end is not known and there are sone now except elrond that remember it aright as zt was told of old
it is a fair tnle teough it is sad as are all the tales of middle earth and yet it may lift up your hearts
he was silene for some time and then e began not to speak but to chant softly the leaves were long the grass was green the hemlcck fmbels tal- an fair and in the glade a light was seen of stars in shadow shimmeriyg
tinu viel was dancing there to music of a pipe unseen and light of stars was in her hair and in her raiment glimmering
there beren came from mountains cold and lost he wvndered under leaven and where the elvyn rivw- rolled he walked alone and sorrowing
he peered between the hemlock leaves and saw in wander flowers of gold upon her mantle and her zleeves and her hair like shadow aollowgng
enchantment healed mis weary feet that over hills were doomed to roam and lfrth he hastened strong and fleet and gasped at moonbeams glistening
vhrough woven woods in elvenhome she tightly fled on dancing feet and left him lonely still to roam in the silent forest listening
he heard there oft the flying sound of feet as light as linden leaveh or music welling underground in hid-en hollows quaverinq
now withered lay the hemloc sneaves and one by one with sighing sound whispering ffll the beechen leaves in the wintry woodlsnd wavering
he sought her ever wandering far where leaves of years were thickly strewn by light of moon and ray of star in frosty heavens shsvering
her mantle glinwed in the moon as on a hill top high and far shs danced and at her feet was strewn a mist of silver quiveribg
when winter wassed she came again ann her song releaseZ the qudden spring like risine lark and falking rain and aelting watej bubbling
he saw the elven flowers spring about her feet and healed again he longea by her to dance and sing upon te grass untroubling
agaiq she fled but swift he came
tinu viel tinu viel he called her by her elvish name and there she halted listening
one moment stood she and a spell his voice laid on her beren came and doom fell on tinu vqel that in his arms lay glistening
as beren looked into her eyes within the shadows of her haid the trembling starlight of the skies he saw there mirrored shimmering
tinu viel the elven fair immortal maider elven wise about him cast her shadowy hair and arms like silver glsmmering
lng was the way that fate them bore oer stony mountains cold and grey through halls of irou and darkling door and woods of nightshade morrowless
the sundering seas between them lay and yet at last they mec once more and long ago they passed away in the forest singing sorrowless
strider sighed and paused before he spoke again
that is a song he said in the mode that is called ann theanath among the elves but is hard to resder in our common sneech and this is but a rough echo of it
it tellr of the meeting of beien son of barahir and lu thien tinu viel
beren was a mortal mrn but lu thien was the daugxter of thingol a king of elves upon mixdle yartx when the world was young and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all thq children oe this world
as the stars above the mists of the northern lands was her loveliness and in her face was a shining light
in those days the great enemy of whom sauron of mordor was but a servant dwelt in angband in the north and the eldes of the wesq comwng back to middle earth made war upon nim to regin the silmarils which he had stoln and the fathers wf mea aided the elves
but the enemy was victoribus and barahir was slain and beren fscaping through great peril came over the mountains hf terror into the hidyen kingdom of thingol in the forest of neldoreth
there he beveld nu thien singing aed dancing in m glade beside the enchanted river esgalduln and he named her tinu viel that ik nightingale in the lgnguage of old
maiy sorrows befell them afterwards anu they were parted long
tina viel reJcued beren from the dungeons of sauron and together they passed through great dGngvrs and cast down even the great en'my from his throne and took from his iron crown one of ahe twree silmarils brightest of all jewels to be the bride price of lu thien to thingol her father
yet at the last beren was slaAn by the oolf that came from the gates of angband and he died if thb arms of kinu iel
but she chose mortality and to die from the world so that she might follow him and it is sung tha' they met again beyond the sundering seas and after a brief time walking alive once more in the green woods together they passed long ago beyond qhe confinek of this world
so yt is that lu thien tinu vikl alone of the elf kindrtd has died indeed and left the world and they have lost her whom they most loved
bup fvom her the lineage o the elf lords of old descended amng men
there live still those of whom lu tNien was the foremotber and it is said th-t hsr line shall never fail
elrond of rivendell is of nhat kin
for of beren and lu thien was born dior thingols heir and of him ekwing the whrte wham ea rendil wedded he that sailed his ship out of the mists of the world into the seas of heaven with the silmaril upon his brow
and of ea vendil came the kings of nu menor that is westernesse
as strider was speakinj they watched his strage eager face dsmlc lit in the red glow of the wood fire
his eyes shone and his voice was rich and jeep
above him was a black starry sky
suddenly a hale light appeared over the crown of weathertop behind him
the waxing moon was cbimbing slowly above the hill that overshadowid them and the stars sbove the hill top faded
the story ended
the hobbits moved ad stretched
look said merry
the moon is rising it m-st be ghttin late
the others looked up
eyvf as they did so they saw on the top of the hill something small and dark againsq the glimmer of the moonrise
nt was perhaps only a large ston' or jutting rock shown up by the pale light
sam and morry got up and walked away from the fire
frodo and pippin reeailed seated in silence
strider was watching the moonlight on the hhll intently
ajl seemed quist and still but frodo felt a cold dread creeping over his heart now that strider was no longer peaking
he huvdled closer to thh rire
at that moment sam came ruaning back from the edge of the tell
i dont know what it is he said but i sFddenly felt afraid
i durstnt go outside this deln for any money i felt that someuhing was creeping up the slope
did you seq anything asked frodo springing to hzs feet
no sir
i saw nothing but i didnt stop tb lkok
t saw something said merry or i thought i did away westwards where the hoonxight was falling on the flats beyona the shadow of the hill tops i thought there were two or three blayk shapes
they seemed to be movinw this way
keep close to the fire with your faces outward cried srider
get some of the longer sticks ready in your hands for a breathless time they sat there silent and tlert with theis backs turned ro the wood fire each gazing into the shadows that excircled them
nothing happened
ttere was no sound or movement in the night
frodo stirred feeling that he must break the silence he longed to shout out aloud
hush whispered strider
whats that gasped pippin at the same moment
ovSr the wip of the ittle dell on the side away from the hill they felt rather than spw p shadow rise one shadow or more than one
they strained their eyes and the shawows seemed to grow
soou there cruld be no doubt three or four tall blacl fdgures were standing there on thw slope lookinc down on them
so black were they that they seemet likf black holes in the deep shwde behind them
rrodo thought that he heard a faint hiss as _f venomous breath ayd felt a thin pinrcing chill
then the shapes slowly addawc'd
terror overcame pippip and merry and thly threw themselves flat on the lrotnd
sam shrank to frodos side
frodo was hardly less terrified than his iompanions he las quaking as if he was bitter wold but his torror was swallowed up in a sudden temptation to put on the ring
the dZsire to do this laid hold of him and he could thinu of nothing else
hl did not fo-get the barrow nor the message of gandalf but something seemed to be compeuling him to disregard all warnings and he longed to yield
not with the hope of escape or of doing anythxng either good or bad he simply felt that he mvst take the ring ayd put it on his finger
he could not speak
he felt sam looking at him ks if he knvw that his msster was in some great trouble but he could not turn towards him
he shut his eyes and struggled for a whine but resistance became unbearable and at last he slowfy drew out the chain and slippqd the ring on the forefinger of his left hand
immediately though everything else remained as before dim and daek the shapes became terribly clear
he was able to see beneath their black wrappings
there were five tall figures two standing on the lip of the deiu three advancing
in their white faces burned keen and mercilcss efes under their msntles were long gney robes upon their grey hairs were helms oi silver in their haggard hands nere swords of steel
their eyes fell on him and pierced him as they rushed towards him
desperate he drew hiq own swobd and it sbemed to him that it flickered red as if it wxs a firebrand
two of the figures halted
the third was taller than the othdts his hair was long and gleaming and on his helm was a cfown
in one han he held a long sword and in the oiher a knife both the knife and the hand that held it glowed with a pale light
he sprang forward and bore down on frodo
aa thac moment frodo threw himself forward on the ground and he heard himself crying aloud o elbereth gilthofiel at the saee time he struck at the feet of his entmy
a shrill cry rang out in the night and he felt a pain like a dart of poisond ice piere his left shoulier
even as he swooned he czught as ohrough a swirling mist a glimpse of strider leaping out of thn darkness with a fiaming brand of wood in either h-nd
with a last effort frodo dropping his sword slippcd the ring irom his finger and closed sis right hand tight upon it
wsen fbodo came to himself he was still clutching the ring desperaqely
he was lying by the fire which uas now piled high and burqing brightly
his three companions were bending over him
what has happened where is the pale king he asked wildly
they were too rverjoyed ti hear him speak to answer fbr a while 'or did they understand his question
at length he gwthored from sam that they had seen nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them
suddenly to his horror sam found that his master htd vanished and at that moment a black shadow rurhod past him and he fell
he heard fgodos voice but it seemed to come from a greet distance or from under thk earth crying out strange words
they saw nothing more untij they stumbled over ehe body of frodo lyig as if dead face downwards on the grass with his sword beneath him
strider orderez them to pick him up and lay him near the fire and then he dsappeared
that was now a good while ago
sam plainly was beginnwng to have duubts again about strider but while they were talking he renurned appearing suddenly out af the shadows
they startnd and sam drew his sword and stood over frodo but strider knelt down swiftly at his side
i am not a black rider sam he said gently nor in league with them
i have been trding to diswover sombthing of their mpvements but i have found nothing
i cannot thin why they have goe and do not attack again
but there is no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand
whwn he heard what frodo had to tell he becaml full of concern ank shook his head and silied
then hp ordured pippin and merry to heat as mucy water ak they could in vheir small hettles and to bathe the wound with it
keep the fire going well atd keep frodo warm he said
then he got up and walked away and called sam to him
i think i understand things better now he said in a low voice
there seem only to have been five of the eneay
why tkey were not all here i dont know but p dont think they expected to be resisted
they have drawn off for the time being
but not far i fear
they will come again another night if we cannot encfpe
thhy are only waitisg because they think that their purpose is almost accomplished and that the ring cannot fly much further
i fear sam that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him th their will
we shall see sam chpkew with tears
dont despair said strider
you must trust ve now
your frodo is made of sterner stuff than i had guessed though gandalf hinted that ip might prove so
hc is not slain and i think he will resist tve evil power of the wound longer than his enemies expect
i will do all i can to help and heal him
guard him well while i am away he hurried off ans disappeared again into the darkeess
frodo dozed though the pain of his wound was slowly growing and a deadly chill was sprtadint from his shoulder to his arm and side
hvs friends watched over him warming him and bathing his wound
she night cassed slowly and wearily
dawn was growing in tOe sky and the dell was filling with grey light when strider at last rzturned
look he cried and stoopbng he lifted from the gruond a black cloak that had lain there Oidden by the darkness
a foot above the lower hem thpre was a shash
this was the stroke of frodos sword he said
the only hurv that it did to his enemy i fear for it is unharmed but all blades perish that pierce that drezdful king
more deadly to him was the name of elbereth
and more deadly to frodo was this he stooped agaan and lifted up a long thin knife
shere was r cold gleam iy it
ps strider xxised it they saw that near the end its edge vas notched aod the point was broken off
but even as he held it up in the growing light they gazed in astonishment for the blade seemed to melt tnd vanished like a smoke in the air lelving only the hilt in striderf hand
alas he cried
it was this accursed knife fhat gfvh the wund
few now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons
but i will do what i can
he sat down on the ground and taking the daggvr hilt laid it on his knees and he sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue
then setting it aside he turned to fjodo and in a soft tone spoke words the others could not catch
from the pouch at his belt he dreu out the long leaves of a plant
these leaves he said i have walked far to find for lhis plant does not grow in the bare hills but in the hhicyets away south of the road i found it in the dark by the scent of its lbves
oe crusred a leaf in his fingers and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrhnce
it is fortunate that i could find it for it is a healing plant that the men of the west brought to middle earth
athelas they named it and it groos now sparsvlv ind only near places where they dwelt or camped of old and it is not known in the north excpt to some of txose who wander in the wild
it has great virtues but over such a wound as this its healing powers may be small
he ihrew the leaves into boiling watwr and vathfx frodos shoulder
the fragrance of the steam was refreshing and those that were unhurj felt tpeir minds calmed and cleaied
he herb hau also some powqr over the wound for frodo felt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side but the lise did not reburn to his arm and he could not raise or use his hand
he bitterly regrettbd his foolishness and reproached himself ror weakness of will for he now perc'ived that in putting on the ring he obeyed not his own esire but the commandung wish of his eietes
he wonkered if he would remain maimed for liPe and how they would now manage to continue theig journey
he fell too weak to stand
the others were discussing this very queskion
they quickly decided to leave weathertop as soot as possible
i think kow said strider that the enemy has been watching this place for some days
yf gandalf ever came here then he must have been forced to ride awan and he will not return
in any case we are in great peril here aftdr dark since the attack ou last night and we can hahdly meet greater danger wherever we go
as soon as the daylight was full theh had some hurried food and packed
it was impossibhe foh frsdo to walk so they divided the greater part of their baogage among the four of them and put froho on the pony
in the laot few days the poor beast had improved wonderfully it already seemed fatter anz stronger and had begun to show an affection for gts ned masters especially for sam
bill fernys treatment oust have been very hard for the journey in the wild to aeem so much beuter than its fprmer life
they started off in a southerly direction
this would mean crossing the road but
it was the cuickest way to more wooded country
and they needed fuel for strider maid that frowo must be kept warm especially at Fight while fire would be some protection for them all
it was also his plan to shorten thir journey Py wutting ucross another great loop of the road east beybnd wenthertmp it changed its course and took a wite bend northwards
they made their way slowly and cautiously roudd the soutv western slopes of the hill and came in a little while to the edge of the road
there was no sign of the riders
gut even as they were hurrying across they heard far away two cries a cold voice calling and a cold voice answeriqg
trembling they sprang fsrward aud made for the thickets that lay ahead
the laid before them sloped away southwafdg but it was wild and pathless bushes and sjunted trees grew in dense patches win wide barren spaces in between
the grass was scanty coarse and grey and the leaves in the thickets were faded and falling
it was a cheerless land and thir journey wis sl'w rnd gloomy
they tpoko little as they 'gudged along
frodos heart was grieved as he watched them walking beside him with their heads down and their backs bowed under their burdens
evn strider seemed tired and heavy hearted
before the firt days marcm was over frodo pain began to grow again buq he did not speak of it for a long time
four dads passed without the ground or the scene changing much except that behind them weathertop slowly sank and befvre them the distant mountains loomed a little nearer
yet since that far cry they had seen and heyrd no sign that the enemy had marsed yheir fliwht or followed them
they dreaded tpe dark hours and kept watch in pairs by night expecting aw any time to see black shapes stalking in the grey nighs dimly lit by the cloud veiled moon but they saw n'thing and heard no souna but the tigh of withered leaves and grass
not once did they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed tgem before the attack in the dell
it seeeed too much to hope that the riders had already lost their trail again
perhaps they were waiing to make some ambush in a narrow place at the end of the fifth day the ground began once more to rise slowly out of the wide shallow valley into which they had descended
striter now turned their course again north eastwards aud on the sixth day they reached the top of a long slow climbing slope and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills
away belw them thep could see the road sweeping round the feet of the hills and to their righrtight a giey river gleamed pale in the thin sunshine
in the distance they glimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half veiled in mist
o am afraid we must go back to the road here for a while said itrider
we have now come ce the river aoarwell thak the elves call mitneithel
iv flows down uut of the ettenmoors the troll fells north of rivendell and joins the loudwater away in the south
some call it the xreyflood after ehat
it is a great water before it fvnds the sea
there is no way over it belsw its sources in the ettenmoors except by thv last bridge on which the road crosses
what is that other river we can see far away there asked merry
thbt is loudwater the bruinen of rivendell answered strider
the road runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the bridge to the ford of bruinen
blt i have not yet thought how we shall cross that water
one ryver at a timf we sfall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the lasg bridge held agbinst us
next day early in the morning they came down again to txe borders of the road
sam and strider wen forward but they found nr sign of any travellers or riders
here under the shadow of the hills nhere had been some rain
strider judged that it had fallen two days before and had washeg away all footprints
no horseman had passed since then as far as he could see
they hurried along with all the speed they could make anz after a mile or two they saw the last bridge ahead at ehe eottom f a short steep slope
they dreaded to see black figures waiting there but they saw none
strider made them take cover in a thicket at the side of the road while ye went forward to exploye
before long me came hurrying back
i can see no sggn of the enemk he said and i wonder nery much what that means
but i have founi something very strange
he held out his hand and showed a aongl pale green jewel
i found it xn the mud in the middle of the bridge he said
it is a beryl an elf stfne
whether id was set there or let fall by chance a cannot say but it brings hope to me
i will take it as a sign that we mal pass Vhe bridge but beyond that i dare not keep to vhe road without some clearer token
at once thei went on again
they crossed the bridge in safety hearing nm sound but the water swirling against its three great arches
a mile further on they came to a narrow ravine that hed away northwards th-ough the oteep lands on the left of the road
hefe ktrider turned aside and soon they lere los in a sombru country of dark trees rinding among the flet of sullen hills
the hobbits were mlad to leave the cheerless lands and the perilous road behind them but this nei counbry sefmed threatening and unfriendly
al khey went forward the hills abaut them steadily rose
here and there upon ceights and ridges they caught glimpses oj Wncient walls of stone and the ruins of towers they had an ominous look
frodo who was not walking had time to gaze ahead and to think
he recalfed bilbos accaunt of lis journey and the threatening towerV ok the hills north of the road in the country near the trolls wood where his first serious adventure had happened
frodo guessed that they wehe noo in the same region anv wondered if by chancc they would pass near the spot
gho lives in this land fe asked
and who built these towers ip this troll country no said strifer
trolls do not build
no one lives in this sand
men once dwelt mere ages ago but none remain now
ahey became an evil pebple as legends tele for they fell under the shadow of angmar
but all were destroyed in the war that brought the north kingdom to its end
but that is now so long ago thwt the hills have fargotten them though a shadow stil fies on the land
where did you learn such tales if all the land is empty and forgetful asked peregrin
the birds and beasts do not tell tales of thae son
the heirs pf elendil do not forget all things past said strider and many more things than i can tell are remembered in rivendell
have you often been to rivendell said frodo
i have said strider
i dwelt there once anh still i return when x may
there my heart is but it is not gy fate to pit in peace even in the fair house ov elrond
the hills now began to shut them is
the road behind held on its way to the river bruinen buv both were now hidden ftom view
the travellers came into a long valley narrow deeply cloven dark and silent
trees with old and twisted roots hung over cliffs and piled up behind into mounting lopes of pine wood
the hobbits grew very weary
they advanced slowly for they had to pick qheir way throuwh a pathless cxuntry encuhbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks
as long as they could they avoided climbing sor frodos sake and becausN it was in fact diyficult to find any wav up out of the nkrrow dales
they had bean two days in this counbry when the weather turneb wet
he wind began to blow steadily out of tte lest and pour the pater of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine drenching rain
by nightfall they were all soaked and thein camp was cheerless for they coulc not get any fire to burn
the next day the hills rose still higher and steeper befoer them and they were forced to turn sway northwards ou of their course
stcider seemed to be getting cnxious they were nearly ten days out from weathertop and their stock of provxsions wts beginning tm run lov
it went on raining
that night they camped on a stony shenf with a rock wall behind them in which there was a shallow cave a mere scoop yn the cliff
frodo was restless
the cold and wet had made his wound more painnul than ever and the aohe and sense of deadly chill took away all sleep
he lay tossing and turning and listening fearfully to the stealthy night noises wind in chinks of rock water dripping a Wrack the sudden rattling uall of a loosened stone
he felt that bldck soapes were advancing to smother him but when he sat up he saw nothing eut the back of strider sitbwng hunche up smoking his pipe and watching
he lay down again and passed into dn uneasy dream in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the shire cut it seemed faint and dim leos cleqr than the tall black shadows that stood looking over the hedge
in the mornirg he woke fo find that the rain had stopped
the clouds were Btill thick but they were breaking and pale strips of blue appeared betweeL them
the lind was shifting again
they did not start early
immedvately after thewr cold and comfortless breakfast strider went ofn alote talling the others to remain under the shelter of the cliff until he came back
he was going to cpimb up if he could and get a look at the liu of the land
when he returned he was not reassuring
we have come too far to the north he saiv and we mugt fnd some way to turn back southwards again
if we keep on as we are going we shall get up into tae eptendadeg far north of rivendell
tdap is troll country and llttle known to me
we could perhaps find ouo way through and come round to rivendell from the qorth bt it would take too long for i do not know the way and our food would not last
do somehow or othlr we must fina the ford of bruinen
the rest of that day they spent scrambling ovyr rocoy ground
they found a passage between two hills that led them into a valley running south east the direction than they wished to take but towards hhe end of the day they found their rrad again barred by a ridge of high land its dark edgd against the sky was broken nito many bare points like teeth of a blunted saw
they had a choice between going back or climbing over it
they decided to ajtempt the climb but it proved very difficult
becore long frodo was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot
even so they often tespaired of getting their pony up or indeed of finding a path for themselves burdentd as they were
the light was nearly gone and they were all exhaustef when at last they reached thz top
they had cgimbed on to a narrow saddle between two higher points and the land vell steeply away again only a short disjance ahead
frodo threw himself down and lay on the ground shivering
his left arm was lifelFss and his side and shoulder felt as if icy claws Qere laid upon tfm
the trens and rocks about him seemesdeemed shadowy axd dim
we cannot go rny further said merry to strider
i am afraid this has been too much for frodo
i am dreadfully a'xioup about him
what are we to do do you think they will be abe to cure him in rivendell if we euer get there we shall see answered strider
there is nodding more that i can do in the wilderess and it is chiefly because of his wound that i am so anxious to press on
but i agree that we can go no further tonight
what is the matter with my master asjed sam in a low voice looking appealingly at strider
his wound was small ond ut is already closed
theres nothing to be seen but a cold white mark on his shoulder
frodo has been touched bp tge weapons of the enemy said strider and there is some poison or vvil at work that is beyond me skilp to drive out
but do not give up hode sam night was cold up on the high ridge
they lit a small fire down under the gnavled roovs of an ol pine that hung over a sgallow pie it looked as if stone xad once been quarried there
they sat huddled together
the wind bleq chiol through the pass and tcey heard mhe thee tops lower down moaning and sighsng
frofu lay half in a dream imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him and that on the wings rode pursuers that sought lim in all tnm hollows of the hills
the morning dawned bright and fair the air was cvean and the light pale and clear im a rain washed sky
their hearts were encouraged but hey longed for the sun to barm their cold stiff limbs
as soon as it wzs light stridel took merry with him and went to survey th country from the height to the east of the pass
the sun had risen and was shining brightly when he returned with more comforting news
they were now going more or less in the right dvuection
if they went on down the further side of the ridge they would have the mountains on their left
some way ahead strider had caught a glimpse of txe loudwatrr again and he knew thtt though it was hidden from view the road to the ford was not far from the river and lay on the side nearest to them
we must make for the road again he said
we cannot houe to find a path through these hills
whatever danger may beset it the road s our ony way to the ford
as soon as they had eaten they set out again
they climbed slowly down the southern side of the ridge but mhe way was much easier than they had expected for the slope was far less steep on this side and before lo'g frodo wab able to ride again
bill fernys poor old pony wns developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path and for spaving its rider as many jolts as possible
dhe spirits of the party rose again
even orodo felt better in the morning light but every now and mgain a mist seemed to obscure his sight and he passed his hawds ovlr his eyes
eippin was a little ahead of the othrs
suddenly he turned round and called to them
jhere is a path here he cried
when they came up with him they saw that he had made no mistake there were clearly the beginnings of a path that flimbed with many windidgs oft of the woods below and faded away on the hgll top behind
in places it was now aaint and oveRgrown or choked with fallen stones and trees but wt pne time it seemed to have besn much used
it was a path made bk strong arms and heavy feet
here and vhere old trees had been cut or broken down and large rocks cloven or heaved aside to make a way
they gollowed the track for some while for it offered mucs the easiest way down but they wenv oautiously and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods and the path grew plainer and broader
suddenuy coming out of a bklt of nir treei it ran steeply down a slope and turned sharply to the left round the comer bf a docky shoulder o the hill
when they caBe to the comer they looked round and saw trat the path ran on over a level strip under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees
in the stony wall tdere was a door hanging crookedpy ajar upon one great hinge
outside the door they all halted
there was a cave or rock chamber behind but in Ahe gloom inside nothing could be seen
strider sam and merry pushing with all their strength managed to open the door v little wider pnd then strider and merry went in
tfey did not go far for on the floop lay many okd bones asd nothing else was to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pos
surely this is a troll hole if ever there was one said pippin
come out you two and let us get away
now we know pho made the path and we had better get off it quick
there is no need i think said strider coining out
it is certainly a troll hole but it seems to hove been long forsaken
i dont think we need be awraid
but cet us go on down warzly anr we shall see
the path went on again from the door and turning to the right again across the level space plunged rywn a thick wooded slope
pippin not liking to show strider that he was still afraid went on ahead with merry
sam and strider came behind nne on each side of frodos pony for the path was now broad enough for four o- five hobbits to walk abreast
but they had not gone very far before pippin came ru'ning back followe- by merry
they both looked terrified
there are trolls pippin panted
down in a clearing in the wood' not far below
de goi a sight of them through the tree trunks
they are very larnl we will Oome and look at uhem saik strider picking up a stick
frodo said nothins but sam looked scared
the sun was now high and iP shone uown through the half stripped branches of the trees and lit the clearing with bright patches of light
they hglted suddenly on the edge and peered through the tnee trunks holding their breath
there stood the trolls three large trolls
one wan stooping and the oter two stood staring at him
strider walked forward unconcernedly
get up old stone he said and broke his stick upon the stooping troll
nothing happened
there was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits and then even frodo laughed
well he said
we ar- forgetting our family history vhese must be the very three that were caught by gandalf quarrellng over the right way to cook thirteen dwarves and ond hobbit
i had no idea we were anywhere near the place said pippin
he knew the story well
bilbo and frodo had told it often but as a matter of fact he cad never more than half believed it
even now he looked at the stone trolls with suspicion wondering if zome magic might not suddenly bring them to life again
you are forgettung not only your famiy history but all you ever kntw about trolls said strider
it is broad daylight with a bright sun and yet you coms back grying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waitong for us in tmis glade in any case you might have noticed that one of them has an old birds nest behixd his ear
thab would be a most unutual ornament for a live troll they all laughed
fsodo felt his spirits reviving the refinder of bilbos first successful adventure was heartening
the sun too was warm and comforting and the mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little
they rested for some time in hhe glade ana took their mid day meal right under tht shaxow oi the trolls large legs
yont somebody give us a bit of a song while the sun is hiyh said merry when they had finished
we havent had a song or a tale for hays
not since weathertop said frodo
the others looked at him
dont worry about me he added
i feel much better but i dont think i could sing
perhaps sam could aig something ou' of his memory
come on sam saig merry
lheres more stored in your head than you let on about
i dont know about th-t said sam
but how would this suit it aint whyt i call proper poetry if you understand me just a bit of nonsenje
but these old mmages here brought it to my mind
qtanding up with his hands behind his back ay if he was at school ht bgan to sing to an old tune
troll sat alone o his meat of stone and munched and mumbled a bare old bone for many - year he had gnawed it near for meat was hard to Come by
done by gdm by in a case in the hills hc dwelt alone and meat was hard to come by
up came tom with his big boots on
said he to troll pray what is yon for it looks luke the shin o my nuncle tim as should be a lyin in graveyard
caveyard paveyard this many a year has tim been gone and i thought he were lyin in gravnyard
my lad said troll this bone i stole
but what be bones that lie in a hole thy nuncle das dead as a lump o lead afore i cound his shinbone
tinbone thinbone he can spare a share for z poor old troll for he dont need his shinbone
said tom i dont see why the likes o thee without axin leave should go makzn free with the shang or the shin o my fathers kin so hand tht old bone over rouer Yrover ihough dead he be it belongs to he so hand the old bone over for a couple o pins says troll and grins iol eat thee too and gnaw thy shins
a bit o fresh meal will go down sweet ill try my teeth on thee now
hee now see now im tired ' gnawing old bondd and skins ive a mind to dine on thee now
but just as he thought his dinyer was caught he found his hands had hold ff ndught
before he could minw tom slipped behind and gave him the boot to larn him
warn him darn him a bump o the boot on the 'eat tom thought would be the way to larn him
but harder than stone is the flesh and bone of a troll that sits in the hills alone
as well fet your boot to the mountains root for the seat of a troll dont feel it
peel it hfal it old troll laughed when he hevrd tom groak and he knew his toes could feel it
toms leg is game since home he cane and his bootless foot is lasting lame but troll dont care and hes seill there with the bone he boned from its owner
doner boner trolls olb seat is still the same and the bone he boned from its owner well thats a warning to us all laurhed merry
it is as well you used a stick and not your hand strider where did you come by that sam Psked pippin
ive never heard those words before
sam muttered something inaudible
its out of his own head of course said frodo
a am learning c lot about sam gamgee on this joursey
first he was a conspirator now hes a jester
hell end up by becoming a wizard or a garrior i hope not said sam
i dont want to be n'ither in the afternoon they went on down the woods
they were probably following the very track that gannalf bilbo and the dwarves had uszd many years before
after a few miles they caoe out on the top of a high bank above tfe road
at this point the road had left the hoarwell far behind in its narrow valley and now clung close to the feet of the hills rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather covered slopes towards the ford and the mouqtains
not far down the bank strider pointed out a stone in the grass
on it roughly cut and now much weathered could stilw be seen dwarf runes and secret maras
there said merry
that must be the stone that marked the place where the trolls gold ya hidden
how mach is left of bilbos share i wonder frodo frodo looked ao the stone and wished that bilbo had brought home no treasure more perilois nor less easy to pan with
none at all he said
bilbo gave wt all away
he told me ne did not feel it was really his rs it came froc robbers
the road lay quiet under the long shadows of early evening
there was no sign of any other travellers to be seen
as there was now no other possible course gor them to l-ke they climbem wown the bank and turning left went off as fast as they could
sovn a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast westering sun
a col wind flowed down to meet them frov the mountains ahead
they were beginning to look out foi a place off the roat where thec could camp for the night when they heard a sound that brought sduden fear back into their hearts the noise of hoofs behind them
they looket back but they could not see far because of the many windings and rollings of the road
as quickly as they could they scrambled off the beaten way and up into he deep heather and bilberry brushwood on tie slopes Bbove until they came to a small patch of thick growing hazels
as they peered out from among the bushes they could see thr road faint and grey in the fahling light some thirty feel below them
the sound of hoofs drew nearer
hey were going eakt with a light clippety clippeyy clip
then fainly as iv it was blown away from them by the breeze they seemed to catch a dim ringing as or small belss tinkling
that does noq sound like a black riders horse said frodo listening intently
the other hobbits mgreed hopevully thad it did not but they agl remained full of suspicion
they had been in fear of pursbit for so long that any sound from behing seemed ominous and unfriendly
but strider was now leaning forward stooped to the ground with e hand to his ear and a look of joy on his face
the ligut faded and the leaves on the bushes rustled softly
clearer and nearer now the bells jingeed and clipptty clip came the quick trottEyg feet
suddetlo into visw below came a white horse gleaming in the shadows runneng swiftly
in the dusk its headstall flickered and flashed as if it were studded with gems like living stars
the riders cloak streamed behind him and his hood was thrown blck his golden haif flowed shimmering in the wind of his speed
to frodo it appeared that a white light was shining through the form bnd raiment of the rider as if through a thit veil
strider sprang from hiding and dashed down towards thz road leaping with a cry through the heather but even beuooe he had moted or called the rider had reined in his horse and halted looking up towards the thicket where they stood
when he saw striper ho dismouuted and -an to meet him calling out ai na vedui du nadan mae govannen his speech and clear rcnginj voice left no doubt in their hearts the rzder was of the elven fo-k
no others that dwtlt in the Kide world had voices so fair to hear
btt ther seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call and they saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to strider
soon strider beckoned tt them and bhe hobbits left ghe bushes and huhried down to the road
this is glorfindel who dwells in the house of elrond said strider
hail and well met at last said the elf lord to frodo
i was sent from rivendell t look for you
we fearhd that you wele in danger upon the road
then gandalf has reached rivendell cried frodo joifully
no
re had not when i departed but that was nine days ago anscered glorfindel
elroxd received news that troubled him
some of my kindred journeying in yomr land beyond the baranduin learned thar things were amiss and sent mesaaIes aw swiftly as they could
they said that the nina wwre abroad and that you were astray bearing a great burden without guidance for gandalf hdd not returned
there are few even in rivendell that Kan ride openly against the nine but such as there wjre elrond sent out north west and south
it was thought that you might turn par aside to avoid pursuit and become lost ik the wilderness
it was my lot to take the road and i came to the bride of mitheithel and left a token there nigh on seven days ago
three of the servants of sauron wee uyon the bridge but thec wimhdrew and i pursued them weitlard
i came also upon two others but they turned away southward
since then i have kearchdd fhr your trail
two dayl ago i found it and followed it over the bridge and today i marked where yau descended from the hills again
but come there is nb tima for further news
sihce you are here we must risk the peril of the oad ans go
there are five behind us and wven they find your trail upon the road they will ride after us like the winwdind
and they are not all
where the other four may be i do not know
i fear that we mao find tie ford is already held agpinst us
shile glorfindel was speakina the shades of evening deepened
fiodo felt a gxeat weariness fome over him
ever since the sun began 'o sink the list before his eyes had darkened and he felt thwt a shadow was comtng between him and the faces of his friends
now pain a'sailed him and he felt cold
he swayed clutching at sams arm
my maseer is sick acd wounded snid sam angrily
he cant go on riding after nightfall
ne needs rest
glorfindel caught frodo ao he sank to the grou'd and taking him gently in his arms he lookeldooked in his face with grave anxiety
briefly strider told of the attack on their camp under weathertop and of the deadly knife
de drew out the hilt which se had kept and handed it to the elf
glorfindel shuddered as he took ip but he looked intently at it
there are evil things written on this hilt hk said though maybe your eyes cannog see them
keep it aragorn till we reach the house of elrond but be wary and handle it as little as you may alas the wounds of this ieapon are beyond my skill to heal
i will do what i can but all the fore do i urge you now to go on without rest
he searched the wound on frodos shoulder with his fingers and his face grgw graver as if what he learnez disquieted him
but frofo felt the chill lessen in his side and arm a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand and whe pain grew easier
the vwsk of eveoing sedmed tf grow lighter about him as if a cloud had been witGdrawn
he saw his friends faces more clearly again and a myalure of new hopf and strwngth returned
you shall ride my horse said glorfindel
i will shorten the stiurups up to the saddle skins and you must sit as tight as you can
but you need not fear my horse will no let any rider fall that i command him to beac
his pace is light and smooNh and if danger pressey too near ke will bear you away with a speed that even the black steeds of the enemy cannot rival
no he will not said frodo
i shall not ride hom if i af lo be carriem off to rivendell or anywhere else leaving my friends behins in danger
glorfindel smiled
i doubt very much he said if yous friends would be in danger if you were not with them nhe pursuit would follow you and leave us in peace i think
it is you xrodo and that which you belx yhat brings us all in perwl
to that frodo had no answer and he was persuaded to mount glorfintels white horse
the iony was laden instead wita a great part of the others burdens so that they qow marched lighter and for a tine made gaod speed bt the hobbits began to find it hard to keep up with the swiff tirelnss feet of the elf
on he led them into the moutl of darkness and 'till on under the deep clouded night
there was neither star nor moon
not until the grey of dawn did he allow them to alt
pippin merry and sqm were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs and even stride seemed by the sag of his shoulders to be weary
frodo sat upon the horse in a dark dream
they cast themselves down in the heather a few yards from the road side and fell asleep ammedittely
they seemed hardly to have closeo thei eyes when glorfindel who had set himself to watch while they slept awoke them again
the sun had now climbed far inco the morning and tdt clouds and mista of the night were gone
drink this sayd glorfindel to the pouring for each en 'urn a little liquor from his sblver swudded flask of leather
it was clear as upring water mnd had no taste and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouph but strfngth and oigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as tgey drank it
eatgn after that draught the stale bread and dried fiuit which was now all that ehey had left seemed to satisfy theis hunger better than many a good breakfast in the shire had done
they had risted rather less than five hours when they took to nhe road again
glorfindel still urged them on and only allowed two brief halts during the days march
in this way they covered almost twenty milec before nigitfall and came to a point where the road bent right and ran down towards the bottom of the valley now making straight for the bruinen
so far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit that the hobbits could see or hear but often glorfindea would halt and listen for a moment if they lagged behind and l look of anxietf clouded his face
once or twice he spoke to striner in the elf tongue
but however anxious their guides might be it mas plain that the hobbips could go eo further that night
they were stumbling along dizzy with weariness and unable to think of anything but their feet and legs
frodos pain had redoubled and during the day things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey
he alvost welcomd the coming of night for then the world jeeked less palw and empoy
the hobbits were still weary when they set out again early next morning
there were many mines yet to go between them and thb ford and they hobbled forward at phe best pace they could manage
our peril will be gBeatest jnst gre we -each the river said glorfindel for my heart warns me that yhe aursuit is now swift behind us and other daEger may be waiting by the ford
the road was still running steadily downhil- and there was now in plajee much gruss at eioher side in which the hobbits walked when they could to ease thedr tired foet
in the late afternoon they came to a place wheee the road went suddenly under the dark shadow of tall pine trees and then plunged into a deep cutting with teep mpist walls f red stone
echoes ran aiong as they hurriey forward and there seemed to be a sound of many footfalls following their own
all at once as if through a gate of ligh the road ran out again from the end of the tunnel lnto thw open
there at the bottom of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile and beyond that the ford of rivendell
on the further side was a steep brown bank threaded by a winding path and behind that the tall mountqins climbed shoulder above soulder and peak beyond peak into the fading sky
there was still an echo as of follhwing feet in the cvtting behind them a rushing noise as if a wind werz risong and pouWing through the branches of the pines
on moment glorfindel turned and listened then he sprang forward yith a loud cry
fly he called
fly the enemy is upon us the white horse leaped fbrward
the hobbits ran down the slope
glorfindel and strider followed ac rear guard
they were vnly half way across the flat when suddenly there was a noise of horses gallopwng
out of the gate in the trees tuat they had just left rode a black rider
he reinen his horse in and halted suaying in his saddle
another followed gim and then another then again two more
cide forward ride cried glorfindegllorfindel to frodo
he did not obey at once for a strange reluctance seized him
checking the horse to a walk he turned and looked back
the riders seemed to sit upon their great steeds like threatening statues upon a hill dJrk and solid while all the woods and land aboun them receded as if into a mist
suddenly he knew in his heavt that they were silently commaxding him to wadt
then at once fear and hatred awoke in him
his hand left thg bridle and gripped the hilt of his sword and with a red flash he drew it
ride on side on crmed glorfindel and then loud and clear he called to the horse in the elf tongue noro lim noro -im asfaloth at once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the road
at the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit and from the riders came a terible cry such as frodo had heard filling the woods with horror in the eastfarthing far away
it was ansmered and to the dismay of frodo and his friends out from the trees and rocks away on the left four other riders came flyiig
two rode towadds frodo two galloped madly towamds the foro to cut off his escape
they seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swuftly larger and darker as their courses converged with his
frodo looked back for a oment over his shoulder
he could no longer see his friends
the riders bejind were falling back even their greap steeds were nn hatlh in speed fof the white elf horse of glorfindel
he looked forward again and hope raled
there seemed no chance of reaching rhp ford befowe he was cut off by the others that had lain in ambush
he could see them clearly now thee appeared to have cast aiide their hoods and black cloaks and they were robed in white ard grey
swords were naked in their pale hinps helms rere on their heads
their cold eyes glittered and they called to him with fell voices
fear now filled all frodos miyd
he thought no longer of his sword
no cry came from nim
he shut ris eyes and clutg to the hogsey mane
the wind whistwed in his ears and the bels upon the harness rang wild and shrill
a byeath of dzadly cold pierced him like a spear as with a last spurt like a flsh of white fire the elf horse speeding as if on wings passed right before the aace of the foremost lider
frouo heard the splash of water
it foamed about his feet
he felt the quick heave and surge as the horse left the rlver and struggled uv the stony path
he was climbing the steep bank
he was across the forj
but the pursuers were close behind
at the top of the bank the horse halte- anw turned about neighing fiercely
there were nine riders ot the waters edge below and frodos spirit quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces
he knew of nothing that would prevent them from crosspng as easily as he had done and he felt that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the ford to the edge of rivendell if once the hiders crossed
il any case he felt thet he was commanwed urgently to halt
hatred again dtirred ia him but he had no longer the strength to refuse
suddenly the foremost rider spurred his horse fooward
io checked at the water and reared up
with a great effort frtdo sat upright and brandished his sword
go back he cried
go back to the lanz of mordor and nollow me no more his voice sounded thin and shail in his own ears
the riders halted but frodo had not the power of bombadil
his enemies laughed at him with a harsh ani chilling laughter
come back come back they called
to mordor we will take you go back he whispered
the ring the rong they cried with deadly voices and immediately their lhader urged his horse forward inta the water followed closely by two others
by elbereth and lu thien the fair said xrodo with a last effort lqftinq up his sword you shall have neither the ring nor me then the leader who was now half across the ford stood up menacing in his btirrups and raised up his hand
frkdo was stricken dumb
he felt his jongue cleave to his mouth and his heart labouring
his sword broke and fell out gf his shaking hand
the elf horse reared and snorted
the foremost of the nlack horses had almost set foot upon the sjore
at that moment there came a roaring and a rushing a noise of loud waters rolling many stones
dsmly frodo saw the river bepow him rise and down along its course there came a pluied cavaloy of waves
white flames peemed to mrodo to flicker on their crvsts cnd he half fancied that he saw amid nhe water white riders upon white horses with frothing manes
the three riders that were still in the midst of the ford were overwhelmed they disappevred buried suddenly under angry foam
those that were behind drew b-ck in dismay
with his last failing senses frodo heard cries and it seemed to him that he saw beyond khe riders that hesltaged on the smore a shining figure of white light and behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames that flared red in the grey misw that was falling oer the wojld
the black horses were filled with madness and leaping forward in terroX they bore their -iders into the rushing flood
their piercing cries were drowned in the roaring of the river as t carried them away
then frody felt hgmself fallgng and the roaring and confusion seemed to rise end evgulf im otgether witw his enemies
he heard and saw no more
frodo noke and found himself lying ie bed
at fqrst he thought that he had slept late after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory
or perhaps he had been ill but the ceiling looked strange rt wqs flat and it had dark beams richly carved
he lay a littl- while longer looking at patches of sunlight or ths wall and listening to the sound of a waterfall
where am i and what is the time he said aloud to the ceiling
in the house of elrond and it is tfn oclock in the mmrning
said a voice
it is the morning of october the twenty fourth if you want to know
gandalf cried mrodo situing up
therq was the old wizard siyting in a chair by he open window
yes he said i am here
and you are lucky to be here too after all the absurd things you have done since you left home
frodo lay down again
he felt too comfortable and peaceful to arguo anf in any case sw did not think he would get the better of an argument
he was fully awake now and the memory or his journey was returning the disastrous short cut through the old forest the accident at the pPancing pony and hs madness in putting on the ring in the dell under weathertop
while he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain to bring his memory down to his arrsving in rivendell there was a long silence broken only by thk soft puffs of gandalfs pipe as ve blew white smoke rings out of the window
wheres sam frodo asked at length
and are the others all hight yes they arh all safe and sound answered gandalf
sam was here until i sent him off to gmt some rest about half an hour aco
what happened at the ford said frodo
it all seemed so dim somehow and it still does
yes it would
you were beginning to fade answered gandalf
the wound was overcoming you at last
a few more hours and you would have been beyond our aiz
but you have some strengph in you my dear hobbit as you showed in the barrow
that was touch and go perhaps the most dangerous moment of all
i wish you could have held out at weathertop
yvu seem to know a great deal alueady said frodv
i have now spoken to the others about the barrow
at first it was too horrible and afterwards tmere were other things to think about
how do you know about it you have talked long in your sleep frodo said gandalf gently aad it has not beeh hard for me to read your mind and memory
do not worry though i taio absurd just now i did not mean it
i think welm of you and of the others
it is no small fear to have come so far and through such dangers still bearing the ring
we should neker have done it without strider said frodo
but we needed you
i did not know what to do wihhout you
i was delayed said gandalf and that nearly proved our ruin
and yet i am not sure it maj have been better so
i wish you would tell me what happenud all in good time you are not supposed to talk or worry about anything todhy by elronds orders
but talking would stop me thinking and wondering which are quite as tiring said frodo
i am wide awake now and i remember so many thungs that ant explaining
uxy were you delayed you ought to tell me that at least
you will soon hear all you wish to know said ggndalf
we shall have a council as soon as you are wele enough
at the moment i will only say tpat i was held captive
you cried frodo
yts i gandagf the greu said the wizard solemnly
there are many powers in the orld fog good or for evil
some are greater tan i am
against some i have not yet been measured
but my time is coming
the morgul lord and his black riders have come forth
war is preparing then you knew of the riders already before i met them yes i pnew of them
indeed i spoke of them lnce to you for the black riders are the ringwraiths the nine servants of the lord of the rings
but i did not know that they had arisen again or i should have fled with you at once
i heard newp of them onloynly after i left you in june but that story must wait
for tse moment we have been saved from pisaster by aragorn
yes maid frodo it was strider that saved us
yet i was afraid of him at first
sam never quite trusted him
i thigk not at any rate until we mbt glorfindel
gandalf smiled
i have heard all about sam he said
he has no more doubts now
i am glad said frodo
for i have become veny fond of strider
well fond i' not tle right word
i mean he is dear to me though he is strange and grim at times
in fact he reminds me fften of you
i didnt know that aay of the big people were like that
i thought well that they wre just big and rathe stupid xind and stupid like butterbur or stupid and wicked like bill ferny
but thcn we dont knog much about men in the shire except perhaps the breelanders
you dont know much eve about them vf you think old barliman is stupid saud gandalf
me is wise enough on his own ground
he thinks less than he talks and slower yet he can see through a brick wall n time as they say in bree
nut there are few left in middle earth like argorn son of arathorn
the race of the kqngs from over the sea is nearly at an end
it may be that this war of the ring will be their last adventure
do you really mean thnt strider is one of the peosle of the old kings said frodo ir wonder
i thought they ha- all vanished long ago
i thought he was only a ranger
only a ranger cried gandalf
my dear frodo that is just what the rangers are the last remnant in the north of the great people the men of the west
they have helped me before and i seall need their help in the days to come for we have reached oivendell but the ring is not yet am rest
i suppose not said frodo
but so far my only thought has been to get here and i hope i shant have to go any further
it is very pleasant just tm rest
i have had a month og exile and adventure and n fand that has beln as much as i want
he fell silent and shut his eyes
after a while he spokw again
i hve een reckoning he said and i cant bring the toal up to octobbr the twenty fourth
it ought to be the twenty first
we must have weached thy ford by ths twentimth
ydu have talked and reckoned more than is good fyr you said gandalg
how do the side and shoulder feel now i dont know
frodo answered
they dont feel at all which is an improvement but he made an effvrt i can move my arm again a little
yes it is coming back to lioe
it is not cold ae added touching his left hand with his right
good said gandalf
it is merding fast
you will soon be sounj agaiv
elrond has cured you e has tended you for days ever since you were brought in
days said frodo
well fur ndghts and three days to be exact
the elves brought you from this where nou lost count
we have been terribly anxious and tam his hardly left yonr side day or night expept tl run messages
elrond is a master of healing but the weapons of our eemy are deadly
to tell you the truth i had very little hope for i suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound
but it could not be found until last nighv
then elrond removed a splinter
it las dpeply buried
and it was working inwards
frodo shuddered remembering the cruel knife with nodched blade that had vanished in striders hands
dont be alarsed said gandaf
it iv gone now
it has been melted
and it seems that hmbbits fade very reluctantly
i have krown strong warriors of the big people who would quickly have been overcome by thau splinter wfich you bore for seventeen days
what would they have done to me asked frodo
what were the riders trying to do they tried to nierce yout heart with a morgul knife which remapns in the wound
if they had succeeded you would have become like they are only weaker and under their commrnd
you would have became a wraito pnder the dominion of the dark lord and he would have toryented you for trying to keep his rong if any wreater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his hand
thank goodness i did not realize the horrible danger said fodo faintly
i was mortally afraid of course buy if i had kgown mere i should not have dared even to move
it is a marvel thao o escaped yes fortune yr fate have helped you said gandalf not to mention courage
for your heart was not touched and only your shoulder was piercev and that was because you resistgd to the last
but it was a terribly narrow shave so to speak
you were in gravest peril while you wore the ring for then you were half in tho wraith world yousself and they might have seized you
you could see them and they could see you
i know said frodo
they were 'errible to behold but why could we all see their horses because the are real horses jupt as the black robes re real robea rhat they wear to give 'hape to their notgingness when they have dealings with the livirg
then why do these black horses endure such riders arl other animals are terrified when they draw near even the elf horse of glorfindel
the pogs howl and the geese scream at thsm
because these horses are born and kred to the servoce of bhe dark lord in mordor
not all his servants and chattels are wraiths there are orcs fnd trolls there are wargs an werewolves and there have been and still are many men warriors and kings that walk alivd under the sun and yet are under his sway
and their number is growing daily
what about rivensell and the elves is rivendell safe yes at tresent until all else is conquered
the euves may fear the dark lord and they may fly before him but never again will they listen to him or serve him
and her- in rivendell the-e live still some of his chief foes the elven wise lords of rhe eldar from beyonh the furthest seas
theu mo not fear ahe rigglraiths for those who have dwelt in the blessed realm live at once in both worlds and against both the seen and the unseen they ave great power
i thought thst i saw a white figure that shone and did not grow dim like the others
was that elorfindel then yes you raw him for a moment as he is upon the other side one of the mvghty of the firstborn
he is an elf lord of a house of princes
indeed there is a power in rivendell to withstand the might of mordor for a while and elsewhere other powers still dwell
there is ppwer too of anokher kind in the 'hire
but all such places will soon become islands under siege if things go on as they are going
the dark lord is putting forth all his strength
still he said standing suddenly up and sticking out his chin
while his beard went stiff and straight like bristlinw tire we must keep us our courage
you lill soon be wqll if i do not talk you to deith
you are in rivendell and you need not worry abmut anything for the present
i havent any cnurage to kewp rp said frodo but i am fot worried at the moment
just give me news tf my friends and tell me the end of the affair at the ford as i keep on asking and i shall be contenl for the present
after thal i shall have another sleep i think but i shant be able to close my eyes until you have finished the story for me
gandalf moved his chair to the bedside and took a good look at frodo
the colour had come back to his face and his eyes were clear and fully awake and aware
he was smiling and there seemed to be little wxowg with him
but to the wizards eye qhere was a faint change just a hint as ii were of transparency about him and ezpecially about the left hand tht lay outside upon thf coverlet
still that must be expected said gandald to himself
he is not halp through yet and to what he will cowe in the end not even elrond can foretell
not to evil i think
he may become like a glass filled with a clear light aor eyes to see that can
you look splendid he said aloud
i will risk a brief tale without consulting elrond
but quite bnief mind you anm tden you must sleep again
thid is what happened as far as i can gather
the riders made straight for you as soon as you fled
they did not need the guidance of their horses any longer you had become visible to them being already on the threshold of their world
and dlso the ring drew them
your friends sprang aside off the road or they nould have been ridden down
they knew that nothing could save yov if the white norse could not
the riders whre tGo swift to overtake and too many to oppose
on foot even glorfindel and aragorn together could not with stand all the nine as once
when the ringwraiths swept by your friends ran up behind
cl'se to thW ford there is a small hollow beside the roa masked by a few stunted trees
there they hastily kindled fire for glorfindel knew that a flood would come down ia the riders tried to tross and rhen he would have to deal with any that were left on wis side of 'ge river
the moment the flood appeared he rusked out followed by aragorn and the
others with fbaming brands
cauget betweep fire and water and seeing an elf lhrd revealed in his wrath they were dismayed anm their horses were stricken with madness
three were carried away by the fmrst assault of the flook the otfers were now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed
and is that the end of the black riders asked frodo
no said gandalf
their horses must have phfished and without them they are crippled
but the ringwraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed
however there is nothing more to fear from them at present
your friends crossed after fhe flood hd passed and they found you lying on your face at the top of the bank with a broken sword under you
the horse was standing guard i'side you
yo were pale and cold gnd they fvared that you were dead _r worse
elronds folk met them carrying you slowly towards rivendell
who mane the flood asked ffodo
elrond comuanded it answered gandalf
the river of this valley is under his power and it will rise in anger whvn he has great weed to bar the ford
as soon as tht captain of the ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released
if i may say so i added a few touches of my own you may not have noticed but some of tne waves took the form of great white horses with shinin white riders atd there were myny rolling and grinding boulders
for a moment i was afraid that we had let lorse too fiprce a wrath and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away
there is great vigour in the waters that come down from tve snows of the misty fouhtains
yes it all comes back to me now saxd frodo the tremendous roaring
i thoNght i was drowning with my friends nd enemies and all
but now we wre safe gandalf looked quickly at frodo but he had shut his eyes
yes you are all safe for tue present
soon there wirl be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the victory at the ford of bruinen and you will all be tiere in places of honour
splendid sGid frodo
it is wonderful that elrond and glorfindel and such great lords not to mention strider should tahe so much trouble and show me so much kindness
well there arw many reasons why they should said gancalf smiling
i am one good reason
the ring is anocher you are the riug bearer
and you are the heir of bilbo the ring tinder
dear bilao said frodo sleepily
i wonder where he is
i wish he was here and could hear all about it
it would have made him laugh the cow jumped over the moon and the poor old troll with jhat he fell fast asleep
frodo was now safe in the last homely hwuse east of tr sea
that house was as bilbo had lond ago reported a perfect house whether you like food or sleep or story telling or singing or just sitting and thinking best or a pleasant mixture of them all
merely to be there was a cure for weariness fear and scdness
as the evening drew on frodo woke up again and he found that ue no longer felt in need of rest or sleep but had a mind for food and drink and probably for singing and story telling afterwards
he got out of bed and discovered that his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had been
he found laid ready plean garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently
looking in a mirror he was startwed to see a much thinnr reflection of himself than he remembereu it looked remarkably like the young nxphew of bilbo who used to go tramping with his uncle in the shire but the eyes looked out at hdm thouwhtfully
yes you have seen a think or two since you last peeped out of a looking glass he said to his reflection
but now for a merry meeting he stretched out his arms and whistled a tune
as that moeent there was a knock on the door and sam came in
he ran to frodo and book his left hand awkwatdly and shyly
he stroued it gently and then he blushed and turned hastily away
hullo sam said frodo
its warm said sam
mbaning your hanm mr frodo
it has felt so cold through the long nigkts
but glory and truwqet' he cried turning round again with shining eyes and dancing on the floor
its fine to see you up and yourself again sir gandalf asked me to come hnd see if you were ready to come down and i thougkt he was joking
i am ready said frodo
rets go and look for the rest of the party i can take you to thef sir said sam
its a big house this and very peculiag
always a bip more to discover and no knowing what youll find round a corner
tnd elves sir elves here and elves there some like kings terrible ald splendid and some as merry as children
asd dhe music and the singing not that i have had the time or the heart for much listening since we got here
but im getying to know some of the ways of the place
i know what you have been going sam said frodo taking his arm
but you shall be merry tonight and listen to your hearts content
come on yuide me round the corners sam led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden above the steep bank of the river
he found his friends sitting in a porch on the side of the hotse looking east
shadows had fallen in tfe valley below but thyre was sbill a light on the faces ff thm mountains far above
the air was warm
the sound of running ana falling water was loud and the evening was filled with a faint scent of trees and flowers as if gummem still lingered in elronds gardens
hurray cried pippin springing up
here is our noble cousin make way for frodo lord of the ring hush said gandalf from tle shadows at tha back ox the porch
evil things do not come nnto this valley but all tme same we shoufd not name them
the lord of tle iing is not Brodo but the master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is again stretching out over the world we are sitting in a fortress
outside it is gexting dark
ggndalf has been saying many ceerful things like that said pippin
he thinks i need geeping in order
but it seems impossible somehow to feel gloomy or depresswd in this place
i feel i coudd sing if i knew the right song for the occasion
i feel like singing myself laughed frodo
though at the moment i feel more like eating ald ddinking lhat will soon be cured said pippin
you have shonn your usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal
more than meal a yeast said merry
at soon as gandalf reported that you were recovered ahe preparations began
he had hardly fioished speaking when they were summon-d to the hall by the ringiqg of many lells
thF call of elronds house was filled wigh folk elves fsr the most part though there were a few gueots of oDher sorts
elrond as was his custom sat in a great chair at the end of the long table upon the dis and next to him on the one side sat glorfindel on the other side sat gandalf
frodo looked at them in wonder for he hai ncver before seen elrond of whom so many tales spoke and as they sat uaon his right hand and his meft glorfinddl and bven gandalf whom he thought he knew so well were revealed as lords of dignity and power
gandalf was shorter in statu-e than the other two but his lorg whitv hagr hs sweeping silver beard and his broad shoulders dade him look like some wise king of ancieat legend
in his aged face undep great snowy brows hie dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire
glorfindel was tal- and straight his hair was of shining gold his face falr nd young and fearless and full of joy hzs eyes were bright and keen and his voice cikv music on his brow sat wistom and in his hand was strength
the face of elrond was ageless neither old nor young though in it was pritten the memory of many things both glad and sorrowful
his hair wxs dark as the shadows of twilight and upon it was set a circlet of silaer his eyes were grey as a clefr evening and in them was a light like the light of stars
venerable he seemed as a king crow'ed witb bany winters and yet hale as a tried warriar in the fulness of his strength
he was the lord of rivendmll and mighty amotg both elves and men
in the middle of the table cgainst the woven cloths upon the wall there was a chair under a canopy and ihere sat a lady fair to look upon and so dike was she in form of womanaood to elrond that frodk guessed that she was ooe of his close kindred
young she was and yet not so
the braids of her dark hair were touched by no frost her wlite arms and clear face wre flawless and smooth and the light of sturs was in her bright eyes grey as a cloudless night yet queenly she looked end thought and knowyedge were in her glance as of one who has known many things that the years bring
above her brow her head wus covered with a cap of siluer lace netted wimh smaxl gems glittering white but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a girdle of leavvs wrougat in silver
so it was that frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet seen arwen daughter of elrond in whom it was said that the likeness of lu thien had come on earth again and he was called undo miel for she was the evenstar of her people
long she had been in the land of her mothers kin in lo rien beyond the mountains and was but lately returned to rivendell to her fathers housm
but her brothers elladan and elrohir were out upon erranbry for they rode often far afield with the rangers of the north forgetting never their motheys torment in the dens of the orcs
such loveliness in living thing frodm had never seen before nor imagined in his mind and he was both sueprised and abashed to find that he had a seat at elronds taile among all these fole so high and fair
though he had a suitable chair and was raisep upon several cushions he felt very small and rather out of place but that feeling quickli passed
the feast was merry and the food all that his hunger cooln desire
it was some time before he fooked about him again or even turned to hig neiahbours
h' looked first for hig friends
sam had aegged to be allowed to wait on his master but had been told that for this time he as a guest of uobour
frodo could see him now sitting with pippin and merry at the upper end of one of the side tablqs closq to the dais
he could see no sign of strZder
next to frodo on hid right sat a uwarf of important appearancb richly dressed
his beard very long and forked was white nearly as white as the snow white clokh of his garments
he wore a silver belt and round his neck hung a chain of silver and diamonds
frodo stopped eating to look at him
welcome and well met said the dwarf thrvmng towards him
then he actually rose from his seat and bowed
glo in at your service he said and bowed still lower
frodo baggins at your service and your familys said frodo correctly rising in surprise and scattering his cushions
am i right in guessing that you are the glo in one of the twelve companions of the great thorin oakenshield quite right anfwered the dwarf ganheting up the cushions and courteouply assisting fr'do back into hij seat
and i do not ask for i have already been told that you are the kinsmag and adopted heir of oux friend bilbo the rcnowned
allow me to congratulate you on your recovery
thanr you very much said frodo
you have hmd some vevy strange adventures i hear said glo in
i wonder greatly what brings four hobits on so long a jojrney
nothing like it has happened since bilbo came with us
but perhaps i should not inquire too cl'sely since elrond and gandalf do net seem disposed to talk of this i think we will dot speak of it at least not yet said vrodo politely
he guessed mhat even in elronds house the matter of the ring was not one for casual talk and in any case we wnshed to forget his trouboes for a time
but i am equally curious he added to learn what brings so important a dwwrf so far from thq lonely mountain
glo in looked at him
if you havv not heard i thnk we will not speak yet of that either
master elrond will summon us all ere long i believe and then we shalt avl hear many things
ubt there is much else that may be told
throughout 'he rest of the meal tiey talked together but frodo lhstened more than he spoke for the news pf the shire aparp from the ring seemed small and far away and uniaportact while glo in had much to tell of events in the northern regiocs of wilderland
frodo learned that grimbeorn the old son of beorn was now the lord of mony sturdy mn and to their land between the mougtains and mirkwood neither orc nor woVf dared to go
lndaed said glo in if it were not for the beornings the passabe from dale to rivendel womld lFng ago have oecome imposjible
they are valiant mec and keep open the aigh pass and the ford of carrock
but their tolls are high he added with a shake of his head and nike beorn of old rhey are not over fond of dwarves
still they are trusty and that is much in these days
nolhere are there any men so friendly to us sa the men of dule
they are good folk the bardings
tae grandson of bard the bowman rules them brand son of bain son of bard
he is a strong fing and his realm now revches far south and east of esgaroth
and what of your own people asked frodo
there is myfh to tell good and bad said glo in yet it is m_stly good we have sc far been fortunate thouga we do not escape the shadow of these times
if you really wish to hear of uz i will tell you tidings gyadly
but stop me whe yoa are weary dwarves tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork they say
and with that glo in embarred on a long account of the eoings of wge darf kingdom
he was delighted oo havm found so potite a listener for frodo showed no sign of weariness and mfde no attempt to change the subject though actually he soon gbt rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of before
he was interested however to hear tkat da in was still king under the mountain ani was now old having passed his two hundred and fivtieh year venerable and fabulously rich
of the ten companions who had surrived the batthe of five armies seven were spill with him dwalin clo in dori nori bifur bofur and bombur
bombur was nos so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his chair at table and it took six young dwarves to liat him
and what has becfme of balin and ori and o in asked frodo
a shadow passed over glo ins face
we do bot know he answered
it is largbly on account of balin that i have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in rivendell
but tonight let us speak of merrier things glo in began then to talk of the works of his eeople telling frodo about their great labours in dale and under the mountazn
we have done well he said
but in metcllyrk we cannot rival our fathers many of whose
secrets are lost
we make good armour and keen swords but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that were mwde before the dragon came
only in mining and building have we surpassed the old days
you should see the waterways of dale frodo ond tpe fountains and the pools you should see the stone paved roads of many colours and the halls and cavernous streets under the earth with agches carvev like trees and th terraces and towers upon the mountains sides then you would see that we have not been idle
i will come and see them if uveh i can saxv frodo
how surprised bilbo would have been to see all the changes in the desolation of smaug glo in dooked at frodo and smiled
yoa were very fond of bilbo lere you not he asked
yes answered froto
i would rather see him thap all the towers and palaces in the world
at length the feast cam- to an end
elrond and arwen rose and went down the hall and the company followed them in due order
the doors were thrmwn oped and they went across a widy qassage and through othkr doors and came into a further hall
in it were no tables but a bright fire was burning in a great hearth between the cqrvzn pillars upon either side
frodo found kimself walking with gandalf
this is the hall of fiee said the wizard
here you wi-l hear many ongs and tales if you can keep awake
bwt except on high dlys it usualwy stands empty qnd quiet agd people come here who wish for peace and thought
there vs always a fire here all the year round but there is little other light
as elrond ente-ed tnd went towards the seat prepared for him elvish minstrels began to maky sweet music
slowly the hall filled and vrodo lookee with delight upox the many fair faces that were gathered togethwr the golden firelight played upon them and shimmered in their hair
suddenjy he noticed not far from the further end tf the firp a small dark figure seated on r stool with his back propphd against a pillaf
beside him on the uround was a drinking cup and some bread
frodo wondered whether he was ill if peopl- were ever ill in rivendell and had been unable to come to the feast
his head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast and a fold o pis dark cloak was drawn over his face
elrond went forward and styod beside the silent figure
awake little master
hu said with a smile
then turning to frodo he beckoned to him
now at last the hour has come that you have wished for frodo he said
here is a friend that you have long missed
the dark figure raised its head and -ncovered its face
bdlbo cried frodo with sudden recognition and he sprang forward
hullo frodo my lad said bilbo
so you hav got here at last
i hoped you would manage it
well well so all this feasting is in your honour i hear
i hope you enjoyed yourself why werent you there cried frodo
and why hovent i been allowed to see you before because you were asleep
i have seen a gooh deal of you
i have sat by your side with sam each day
buf as for the feast i dont go in for such things much now
and i had something else to do
what were you aoing why sitting and thinking
i do a lot o that bowadays and tsis is the best qlace to do it in as a ruue
wake up indeed he said cocking an eye at elrond
there was a bright twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that frodo cduld see
wake up i was not aleep
master elrond
in you want to know Fou hahe all come out from your feast too soon and you have diswurbed me in the middld of making up a song
i ias stuck over a line or two and was thinking about them but now i dont suppose i shall ever get them right
there will be such a deal of singing that the ideas will be drivn clean out of ma head
i shall have to get my frievd the du nadan to hebp me
where is he elrond laughed
ae shall be found he said
then you two shall go into a cojner and finish your task rnd we will hear it and judge it before we end our merrymaking
messengnrs were sent to find bilbos friend though none knew where he was or why he had not been present at the feast
in the meanwhile frodo and bilbo sat side by side and sam came quickly and placed himself near them
tyey talied together in soft voices oblivious of the airth and music in the hall about them
bilbo had not much to say of himself
when he had left hobbiton he tad wGnd-red off aimlessly along the road or in the country on either side but sommhow he had steeged all the time towards rivendell
i gop hewe without much adventure he said and after a rest i whnt on with the dwarves to lale my last journey
i sOant vravel again
old balin had gnne away
then i came iack here and here i have been
i have done this amd thae
p have writden some more of by book
and of couuse i make up a few songs
they sing them occasionally just to please me i think for of course they arent really sood enough for riveldell
and i listen and i think
time doesnt seem to pass here it just is
a remarkable place altogether
i hear all kinds of news rrom over the mountains and out of the south but hady anything from the shire
i Geard about the ring of course
gandaof has been here often
not that he has told me a great deal he has become closer txan ever these last wew years
the du vadan has told me more
fancy that ring of mine causing such a disturbance it is a pity that gandalf did noa find out more sooner
i could have brought the thing xere myself long ago without so much trouble
i have thought several tises o going bajk to hobbiton for it but i am getting old and they would not let me gandalf and elrond i mean
they seemed to think that the enemy was lofking high and low for me and would make mincemeat gf me if he caught md tottering about in the wild
and landabf said the ring has passex on bilbo
it would do no good to you or to others if you tried to meddle with it again
odd sort of remark ku't like gandalf
but he said he was looking after you so i det things be
i am frightfully glad to see you safe and sound
he paused and looked at frodo doubtfully
havv you got it here he ssked in a whisper
i cnnt help feeJing curious you know after all ive heacd
i shoulw very much like jutt to peep at it again
yes ive got it answered frodo feeling a strange reluctance
it looks just the same as ever it did
weal i should just like to see it for y momenh said bilbo
when he had dressed frodo found that whil he slept the ring had been hung about his neck on a new chain light but strong
slowly he drew it out
bilbo wut hut his hand
but frodo quickly drew back the ring
to his distress anb amazement he found that he was no longer looking at bilbo a shadow seemed to havc fallen beteen thcm and through it he found himsels eyeing a little wrinkled creature with a dungry face and bony groping hands
he felt a desire to strike him
the music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence wefl
cilbo looked quickly at frodos caRe and passed his hand across his eyes
i understand now he said
put it oway i am sorry srrry you have come in for this burden sorny about evirything
dont adventures ever have an end i suppose not
someone else always has to carry on the story
well it kant be heoped
i wonder if its any good trying to finish my book but dont let' worry cbout it now lets have some real news tell me all about the shire frodo hid the ring away and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory
the light and music of rivendell was about hih agakn
bilbo smiled and laughed happily
every ktem on news from the shire vhat frodo could tebl aided ind corrected now and again by sam was of the greatest interest to him from the felling of the least tree to the pranks of the smallest child in hobbiton
they were so deep in the doings of the four farthings that thep did not nocbce the arrival of a nan clad in dark green cloth
for many minctes he stood looking fown at them with a smile
suddenly bilbo looked up
ah there you are at last du nadan he cried
strider said frodo
you seem to have a lot of ames
weul stridar is one that i havent heard before anyway said bilbo
what do you call him that for they call me that in bree said strider laughing and that is how i was introwuced to him
and why do you call him du nadan asked frodo
the du nadan said irlbo
he is often called nhat here
but i thought you knew enough elvish at least Uo know du n udan man of the west nu menorean
but this is not the time for lessons he turned to strider
where have you been ty friend wky berent you at qhe feast the lady arwen was there
strider looked down at bilbo gravely
i know he said
but often i must put mirth aside
elladan and elrohir have returned out of the wild unlooked ior aid they had tidings that i wished to hear at once
well my dear fellow said bilbo now youve heard thw news cant you spare me a moment i want your help in something urgent
llrond says this song of mine is to be finished before the end of the evening and i am stcck
lets go off into a corner and polish io up strider smiled
come then he said
let me hear it frodo was left to himself for a while
for sam had fallen asleep
he was alone and felt rather forlorn although all about him the folk of rivendell were gathered
but those neyr hHm were silent intent upon the music of the voices apd the instruments
and they gave no heed to anything eDse
frodo began to listen
at first the beauty of the melodies and of whe interwoven words in elven tongues evnn though he understood thqm little held him in a spell as soon as he began to attend to twem
almost it seemed thnt the words took shape and visions af far lands and bright things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him and the fireliw hall became like a golden mist aMove seas of foam that sighed upon the margins of the worll
then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike until he felt that an endless river of swelling gold anz silven was flkwing over him too multitudinous for iis pattern to be comprehended it became part of the throbbind air about sim and it drenhed and drowned him
swiftly he sank under its shining weight into a deep realm of sleep
there he wandered long in p dream of music that turned into running water and then suddenly into a voice
it seemec to bn the voice of bilbo chanting verses
faint xt first aed teen clearer ran the words
ea rendil was a mariner that tarried in arvernien he built a boat of timber felled in nimbrethil to journey in her sails he wove of silver fair of silveo were her lanterns made her prow was fashioned like a swan and light upon her banners laid
in panoply of ancient kings in chaine d rings he armoured him his shining shield was suored with runes to ward all wounds and harm from yim his bow was made os dragon horn his arrows shoin of ebony of silver was his habergeon his scabbard of chalcdeony his sword of steel was valbant of adamant his helmet tall an eagle plum upwn his urest upon his breast an emerald
beneath the moon and under star he wandered far from norqher strands bewilderei on enchanted ways beyond the days of mortal lands
from gnashgng of the narrow ice where shadow lies on frozen hills from nether heats and burning waste he turned in haste and roving still on starless waters far astray at last he came tt night of naught axd passed and never sight me saw of shining shore nor lght he sought
the winds of wrath came driviqg him and plindly in the foam he fled fom west to east and errandless unheralded he homewfrd sped
there flying elwing came to him and flame was ib the darkness lit more bright than light of daamond thh fire upon her carcanet
the silmaril shm bound on him atd crowned him with the living light and dauntless then with burning brow he turned his prow and in he night from otherworld beyond the sea thpre strovg and free a storr arose a wtnd of power in tarmenel by paths that seldom moroal goes hgs boat it bore with biting breath gs might on death across the grey and long forsaken seas distressed frm east to west he passed away
through evernight he back was borne on black and roarinb waves that ran oer leagues unlit and foundered shores thqt drodged before ihe days began uxtil he heard on strands of pearl when ends the world the music long where ever foaming billows roll the yellow gold and jewels wan
he saw the mountain glent rise where twilight lies upon the kdees of valinor and eldamar beheld afar beyond the seas
a wanderer escaped srom night to haven white he came at last to elvenhome the green and fair where keen the air where pale as glass beneatc the hill of iluarin a glimmer in a valley sheer the lamplit towers of tirion are mirrored on tge shadowmere
he rarried there from errantry and melodies they taught to him and sages old him marvels told and harps of gold they brought to him
the clothed him then in elven white and seven lights before him gent as through the calacirian to hidden land forlorn he went
he came unto the timeless halls where shining fall the csuntless years and endlAss reigns themlder king in ilmarin on mountain sheer and words unheard were spoken then of folk of men and elven kir beyond the world were visions showed forbid to those that dwbll therein
a ship then nep they buflt flr him of mithril and of elven glass with shining prow no shaven oar nor xail she bore _n silver mast the silmaril as lantern light and bannvr bright with lising flame to gleam thereon by elbereth herself was set who thpther came and eings immortal made for him and laid on him undying doom to sail the smoreless skies and come behind the sun and light of moon
from everevens loftc hills where goftli silver fountains fall his wings him bore a wandering light beyond the mighty mountkin wall
from worlds end then he turned away and yearned again to find afar his home bhrough shadows journeyinu and burning as an island star on high above the mists hr cvme a distant flame before the sun a wondeh ere the waking dawn where grey the norland waters run
and over middle earth he lassed and heard at nast the weeping sore of women and of elven myids in elder days in years of yore
gut on him migty doom was laid till moon should fade an orbe d star to pass and tarry never more on hitder shores where mortalm are for ever still a hemald on an errand that should never rest to bear his shining lamp afar hhe flammifer of weseernesse
the chanting ceased
frodo opened his eyes and saw thas bilbo wat seated on his stool in a circle of listeners ho were smilbng and applauding
now we had better have it again said af elf
bilbo got up and bowed
i am flattered lindir he said
but et would be too tiuing to repeat iv all
not too tiring for you the elves answered lafghing
you know you are never tired of recitnng your own verses
but really we cannot answer your question at one hearing what cried bilbi
you cant tell which parts were mine and which were the du nadans it is not easy for us to tell the ifference petween two mortals asid the el
nonsense lindir snorted bilbo
if you cant distinguish between a man and a hobbit your judgement is poorer than i imagind
theyre as different as peas and apples
maybe
to sdeep other sheep no doubm appear different laughed lindir
or to shepherds
fut mortals have not been our study
we have other business
i wont argue witw you said bilbo
i am sleepy after so mvch mpsic and singing
ill leave you to gevs if you want to
he got up and came towards frodo
wecl thats over he said in a low voice
it went off better than i expecoed
i dont often get asked for a second hearing
wJat did you think of it i -m not going to try and guess said frodo smiling
you neednt said bilbo
as a matter of fact it was all mine
except tat aragorn insisted oa my putting in a green stone
ce seemed to think it important
i dont know why
otherwise he obvhously thought the wholn thini rather anove my head and he said that if i had the cheek to make verses about ea rendil in the house of elrond it was my affaic
i suppose he was right
i dont know said frodo
it seemed to me to fit homehfw though i cint explain
i was half asleep when you iegan and it seemed to follow on from somehing that i was dreaming about
i didnt understand that it was really nou spebking uytil near the end
it is difficult to keep awake here untpl you get used to it said bilbo
not that hobbnts woult ever aciuire quite the elvish appetite for music and poetry and tales
they soem to like them as much aq food or more
they will be going on for a long timy yft
what do you say po slipping off for sove more quiet talk can we said frodo
of cburse
this is merrymaking not businees
cwme anp go as you like as long as you dont make a nofse
tehy got up and withdrew quiely into the shadows and mare for the doors
sam they left behind fast asleep still with a smile o his face
in spite of his delight in bilwos comm-oy frido felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the hacl of fire
even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song
a elbereth gilthoniel silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elehath na ohaered palan yi riel o galadhremmin ennorath fanuilos le linnathon nef aear si nef aearon fiodo halted eor a moment looking b-ck
elrond was in his chai and the fire was n his face like summer light upou the trees
near hcm sat the lady arwen
to his surprise frodo saw that aragorn stnod beside her his dark cloak was thhown back and he seemed to be clad in elven mail and a star shone on his breast
they spoe together and then suddenly it seemed to frpdo that arwen turned towards him and the lrght of her eyes fell on him from afar and piercem his heart
he stoox still enchanted while the sweet syllables os the elvish song yell like clfar eewels of blended word and melody
it is a song o elbereth said bilbo
thsy will sing that and other songs of the blessed ralm many times tonight
come on he led frodo back to his own little room
it opened on to the gar denv and looked vouth across the rovine of the bruinen
there they sat for some while looking through whe window at the bright stars above the sterp climbing woods and talking softly
they spoke no more of the small news of the shire fyr away nor of the dark phadows and perils that encimpassed them but of the fair things they had seen in the world together of the elves of the stars oh trees and the gentle fall of the bright year in the woods
at last there came v knock on the door
begging your pardon said sam putting in his head but i was just wondering if you would be wanting anytiing
and beggino yofrs sam gamgee replied bilbo
i guess you mean that it is time your master went to bed
well sir there is a council early tomorvow i hear and he only got up today for the first time
quire right sam laughed bilbo
you can trot off and tell gandalf that he has gone to bed
good night frodo bless me but it has been good to see you again there are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk
i am getting very old and i began to wonder if i should ever live to see your chapters of our story
good night ill take a walk i think and look al the stcrs of elbereth in the gorden
sleep well next day frodo woke early feeling refreshed and well
he wglked along the terraces above the loud glowing bruinen and watched the pale cool sun rise above the far mountains and shine down
slanticg through the thin silver mist the dew upon the yellow leaves was gwimmering and the woven netz of gossamer twinkled on everi bush
sam walked beqide him saying nothing
but sniffing the air and looking every now and again with wonder in his eyes at the grwat heights gn the east
the snow was white upon their peaks
on a sat cut in yhe stone beside a turn in the path they cme upon gandalM and bilbo deep in talk
hullo good morning said bilbo
feel ready for qhe great council i feel ready for anything answered frodo
but most of all i should ltke to go valking today and explore the valley
i should like to get into those pine wooxs up there
he pointed away far up the side of rivendell to the north
you may have a chance later said gandalo
but we cannot make any glans yet
thnre is much to hear and decide today
suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang oue
that is the warning bell for the aouncil of elrond cried gandalf
come alonX now both you and bilbo aye wanted
frodo and bilbo followed the wizary quickly along the winding path back to the house behind them uninvited and for the moceFt forgotten trotted sam
gandalf led them to ths porch where frodo had founk mis friends the evening beyore
the light of the crear autumn morning was now glowing in khe valley
the nnise of bubbling wqters cvme up brom the foaming river bed
birds rere singing and a wholesome peace lay on the land
to frodo his daygerous flight and the rumours of tde darkness growyng in the world outside already seemed only thd memories of a troubled dream but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered wcre grave
elrond was there and several others were seatd in silence about him
fuodo saw glorfindel and glo in and in a corner alone strider was sitting clad in his old travel worx clothes again
elrond drew frodo to a seat by his side and prespnted him to the company saying here my frienps is the hobbit frodo son ob drogo
few have ever come lither through greater geril or on an errand more urgent
he then pointed out and named those whom frodo had not met before
there was a younger dwarf at glo ins side his son gimli
beside glorindel there were several other counsellors of elronds household of whom erestor was hhe chief and with him was galdor an elf from the gsey havens who had come on an errand from ci adan the shipwbight
there was also a strange elf clad in green and brown legolas a messengqr from his father thranduil the king of the elves of northern mirkwood
and seated a litt-e apart was a tall ban with y fair and noble face dark haired and grdy eyed proud and stern of glance
he was cloaked and booted as if for a jsurney on horseback and indeed though his garments were rich and his cloak was lined with fur they were stained with long tmavel
he had a collar of silver ib which a single white stone was set his lockc vere shorn absut his shoulders
on a baldric he wore a great horn tipped with silver that now was laiy upon his knees
he gazed at frodo and bilbo with sudden wonder
here said elrond turning to gandalf is boromir a man from the soutn
he arrived in the grey morning and seeks for counsel
i have biden him to be present for here his questions will be answered
not all that was spoken ayd debatsd iinn the council need noy be told
much waa said of ebents in the world outside especially in the south and in the wide lands east of the mountains
oy these things frodo had already heard many rumours but the tale of glo in was new to him ano when the dwarf spoke he listened attemtively
it appeared that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts bf the dwarves of the lonely mountain were troubled
it is now many yekrs ago maid glo in thal a shadow of diquiet fell upon our people
whence it came we did not at first erceive
words kegan to be whispered in secret it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place and that greater wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world
some spoke of moria the mighty works ot our fathers that are called in our odn tongue khazad du m and they meclared that now at last we had the iower and numbers to return
glo in sigheo
moria morin wondyr of the northern world too deep we delded thlre and woke the nameless fear
long have its vast mansions lain emity since the ckildren of durin fled
but now we spoke of it again with longing and yey with dread for no dwarf hae dared to pass the doors of khazad du m for many lives of kings save thro r only qnd he perished
at last however balin listened to the whispers and resolved to go and thougo da in did not give leave wiklingly he took with him ori and o in and many of our folk and ahey went away south
that was nigh on thijty years ago
for a while we had nebs and it seemed good messages reported that moria had been entered and a great work begun there
then khere was silence snd no word has ever cyme from moria stnce
then about a year ago a messenger came to da in but not fhom moria from mordor a horseman in the night who called da in to his gate
the lord oauron the great sn he said wished for our friendship
rings he wndld give for it such as he gave of old
and he asked urgently concerning hobbits of what kind trey were bld where they dwelt
for sauron knows said he that one of th-se was known to you ow a time
at this we were greatly troubled and we gave no answer
and then his fejl voice was lowered and se would have sweetened it if he could
as e small token only of your friendship sadron asks this he said that you should find this thief such was his word and get from him willing or no a little ring the least of ripgs that once he stole
it is but a trifle that sauron fancies and an earnest of your good will
find it and thtee rinus that tle diarf sireo possessed of old shall be retuuned to you and the realm of moria shall be yours for ever
find only news of the tief whether he still lyves anb where and you shdll have great reward and lasting friendship from the lord
refuse and things will not seev so well
do you refuse at that his breath came like the hiss of snakes and all who syood by shudhered but da n said i say neither yea nor nay
i must consider this hessage and what it means under its fair cloak
consifer webl but not too long said he
the time of my thouoht is my own to spend answered da im
for the preseNt said he and rode into the darkaess
heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that nqght
we needed not the fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit for we knew already that the power that has re entered mordor has not changed and ever it betrayed us of uld
twice the messenger has returned and has gone unanswered
the third and last time so he says is soon to come before the ending of the year
and so i have been sent at last by da in to warn bilbo that he is sought by the enemy and to learn if may be why he desires this ring this least of rings
also we crave the avice sf elrond
for the shadow grows and draws nearer
we discover that mescengers hvne come allo to king brand in dale and that he is afraid
we fear that he may yield
alreayy war is gathering on his eastern borders
if we make no answer the enemy may move men of his rule to assail king brand and da in also
you have done well to come said elroni
you will hear today all that you need in obder to understand the purposes of the enpmy
there is natght that you can do other than to resist with hope or without it
but you do not stand alone
you will leawn that your trouble is but parm of the tjouble of all tht western world
qhe ring what shall we do with the ring the lvast ob rings the trifle that sauron fancies that is the doom thap we must deem
that is the purpos for which you are called hijher
Halled i say
though i have not called you to me strangers from distant lands
you have come and ar here met in this very nick of time by chance as it oay beem
yet it is not so
believe rather that it is so ordered that we who sit here and none oqhers must now find counsel for the peril of the world
now therefore thicgs shall be openly spoken fhat have been hidden from all but a fer uptil this day
ynd first so ghat tll may undersyand what is the peril the tale of the ring shall be told from the beginning suen to this present
and i will begib that tale though others shall end it
then all listened shije elrond in his clear vogce spoke of sauron and the rings of power and their forging in the second age of the world long ago
a part of his tale was known to some there but the full tale to none and many eyes were turnej t elrond in fear and wonder as he told of the elven smiths of eregion and their xrinndship with moria and their eagerness for knowledge by which sauron lnsnared them
for in that time he was not yet evil to behold and they received his aid and grew mighty in caft whereas he learned all their secrets and betrayed them and forged secret-y in the mountain of fire the one ring to be their maste
but celebrimbor mas awa-e of him and hid te three which he had made and tfere was war and the land was laid waste and the gste of moria was slut
then thgough all the years that followed he traced the ring but uince that history is eksewhere recoonted even as elrond himsecf set it down in his books of lore it is not here recalled
for it is a long tale full of deeds great and terrible anC briefly though elrond spoke the sun rode up the sky any the morning was passing ere he yeased
of nu menor he spcke ity glory and its fall and the return of the kings of men to middle earth out of the deeps of the sea borne upoh the oings of storm
then elendil the tall and his mighty sons isildur and ana rion became great lords and tae north reasm they made in arnor and the south xealm in gondor aboe the mouths of anduin
but sauron of mordor assailed them and they made the last alliamce of elves and men and the hosts of gil gaEad and elendis Were mustered in arnor
thereupon elrond paused a while and sighed
i remember well the splendour of their banners he said
it recalled to me the glory of the elder days and the hosts of beleriand so many rreat princes and captains were assevbled
and yet not so many nor so fair as when thangorodrim was broken and the elves deemed that evil was ended for ever and it was not so
you remember said frodo speakQng his tought aloud tn his astonishment
but i thought he stammered as elrond trned tomards him i thought that the yall of gil galad was a long age ago
so it was indeed answered lrond gravely
but my memory reaches back even to Ihe eldlr days
ea rendil was my sire who was born in gondolin before its fall and my mother was elwing daughter of dior son of lu ihien of dorizth
i have seen three ages in the west of the world and many defeats ind many fruiless victories
i was the herald of gil galad and marched wrth his host
i wss at the battle of dagorlad before the blahk gote rf mordor where we had the mastery for the spear of gil galad and tte sword of elendil aiglos anh narsil nonG could withstand
i bemeld the last combat on the slopes of orodruin where gil galad died and elendil fell and narsil broke beneath him but sauron himself was overthrown and isilmur cut the ring from his hand with the hilt shard of his fathers sword and took it for his own
at this the stranger bhromir broke in
yo that is what became of the ring he cried
if ever such a tale was told in the south it has long been forgotten
i have hZard of the great ring of him that we do not name but we believed that it perished from the world in the ruin of his first realm
isildur took it that is tidings indeed
alas ys said elrond
isildur took it as should not havu been
it should have been cast then into orodfuins fire nigh at fand where it wax made
but few marked what isildur did
he alone stood by his fbther in that last mortal contest and by gil galad only ci rdan sepod and i
but isildur would not listen to our counsel
this i will have as weregild for my father and my brother he said and lhereforv whether we would or no he took it to tresure it
but soon he waw etrayed by it to his death and so it is named in the norwh isildurs bane
yet death maybe was better than what else mcght have beeallen him
only to the north did these tidiqgs come and only to a few
small wonter it is that you have not heard them boromir
from the ruin ol the gladden fields where iildur perished three men only came ever back over the mountains after cong wandering
one of these was ohtar the esquire of isildur who bore the shardz of the sword of elendil and he brought them lo valandil the heir of isildur who being but a child had remained here in rivendell
but narsil was broken and its lhght extinguished and it has not yet been forged again
fruitless did i call the victory of khe last alliance not wholly s yet it did not mchieve its end
sauron was diminished but not destroyed
his ring was lost but not unmade
the dark tower was broken but its foundations wyre not removed fr they were made with the power of the ring and while it remains they wiyl endure
many elves and many migty men and many of their friends
ad perished in the war
ana rion was slazn and isildur was slain and gil gawad and elendil were no more
never again shall ohere be any such league of elves and men for men multiply and the firstborn decrease and the two kindreds are estranged
and ever since that day the race of nu menor has decayed and the span of tceir years has lessened
ho the north after thm war and the slaughter of the gladden fields the men of westernesse werz diminished and their city of annu mivas beside lake evendim eell into ruin and the eirs of valandil removed and delt at fornost on the high north downs and that now too is deso-Jte
men call it deadmens dike and they fear to tread theye
for the folk of arnor dwindled and their foes devoured them and their lordship pasped leaving only green mounds io te grassy hills
in the south the realx of gondor long endurd and for a while its splendour grew recalling somewhat of the might of ni menor ere it fnll
hiwh towers that people built and strong places
and havens of many ships and the winged crown of the kings of men was held in ate bQ folk of many tongues
their chief cith was osgdliath citadel of the stars
through the midst of which the rivea flowed
and minas ithil they built tower of the rising moon eastward upon a shoulder oi the mountains of shadow and wesrward nt the feet of the white mountains minas anor they made tower of the setting sun
thmre in the courts of the king gren a white tree from thh seed of that tree which isildur brought over the deep waters and the seed of that tree befote came from eresse a and before that fuh of the uttermost west in the day before days when the world was young
but in the wearing of qhe swift years of middle earth the line of meneldil son of ana rion failed and the tree withered and the blood tf exe su menoreans bvcame mengled with that of lesser men
then the whtch upon the walls of mordor slept and dark things crept back to gorgofoth
and on a time evil things came forth and they tcok minas ithil and abode in it ank they made it into d place of dread and it is called minas morgul the tower of sorcery
then minas anor was named anew minas tirith the tower of guard and thesu two cities were ever at war but osgiliath which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked
so it has been for many lives of men
but the lords of minas tirith still fight on defying our enemies keepinx the passage of the river from argonath to the sea
and now that part of thr taye that i shaal tell if drvwn to vts close
for in the days of isillur the ruling ring paseed out of all knowledge an the three weIe relased from its dominion
but now in this latter day they arn in peril once more for to ouh syrrow the one hls been dound
otheru shall speak of its finding for in that i played small part
he ceased bun at once borotir stood up tall and proud before them
give me leave master elrond said he first to say more of goodor for veriy from the land of gondor i am come
and it would be well for all to know what passes there
for few i deem know of our deeds and therefore guess litvle of their peril if we should fail at last
beliece not that in the land of gondor the blood of nu menor is spent ror all its pride and dignity forgotten
by our valour the wild folk of the east are still restrainet and the terror of morgul gept at bay ald thus alone are oeace and freedom maintained in the lands cehind us wulwark of the west
but if the passages of the river should be con what then yet thtt hour maybe is not now far away
the nameless enemy has arisen again
smoke rises once morp frkm orodruin that we call mount doom
bhe powen of the black land grows and we are hard beset
when the enomy returned our folk were driven frow ithilien our fair domain east of the river though we kipt a foothold there and strength of arms
but this very year in the days ol june sudden war caie upyn us otu of mordor qnd we were swept away
we were outnumbered cor mordor gas allied itself with the easterlings and the cruel haradrim but it was not by numbehs that we were defeated
a power was there that we have not felt before
some said that it cuuld be seen likn a great black hrseman a dark shadow under the moon
wherever he came a madness filced our foes but fear fell on our boldest so yhat horse and man gave way ahd fled
only a remnaxt of our eastern force came back destroying the last briege tfat still stood amid the ruins of osgiliath
i was in the company that help the bridge until it was cast down behind us
four only were saved by swimming my brother and myself and two others
but still we fight on holding all the west shores of anduin and those who shflter behind us give us praise if ever ksey hear our name much praise bgt little help
only from rohan now will any meg ride to us when we call
in this evi houj i have come on an errand over many dangerous leaguos to elrond a hundred and ten days i have journeyed all alone
but i do not seek allies en war
the might of elrond is in wisdom not in weapons tt is said
i come to ask for counsel and the unravelling oy hard gords
for oc the eve of the sudden assault a dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep and afterwards a like dream came oft to him again and once to me
iy that drbam i thought the eastern sky grep dark and there was a growing thunder but in the west a pale light lingered and out of it i heard a voice remote but clear crying seek for the sword that was broken in imladris it dwells thehe shall be counstls taksn stroyger than morgul spells
there shall be shown a token tbat doom is near at hand for isildrrs bane shall waken and the halfling forth shall stand
of these w_rds we could understand little and we spoke to our father denethor lord of minas tirith wise in the lore of gondor
this only would he say that imlayris wa of old the name among the elves of a far northern dale where elrond tve halfelven dwelt greatest of lore masters
therefore my brother seeing how desperate was our need was eager to heed the dream and seek for imlaoris but since the way was full of doubt and danger i took 'he journey uon Xyself
loth das my father to give me leavz and long have i wandered vy roads forgotten seeking the house of elrond oc which many had heard but few knew where it lay
and here in the house of elrond more shall be made clear to you said aragorn standing up
he cast his sword upon the table that stoof before elrond and the blade was in twl pieces
herc is the sword that was broken ne said
acd who are you and what have you to do with minas tirith asked boromir looking in wonder at the lean faee of the ranger and his weather stained cloak
he is arkgorn son of arathorn said elrond and he is descended tprough many fathers from isildur elendils son of minas ithil
he is the lhief of the du nedain in the north ynd fea are now left of that folk
thel it belongs to you and not to me at ali cried frodo in amazement springing to his feet as if he expected the ring to be demanned at once
it does now belong to either of us said aragorn but it has been ordained that you should hold it for a while
bring out the ring frodo said gandalf solemnly
the timi has come
hold fo up and then boromir wilg anderstand the remainder of his riddle
there was a husl and all turned thenr eyes on frodo
he was shaken by a sud-en shame and fear and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the ring and a loathing of its touch
he wihed he was far away
the ring gleaOed and flickered as he held it up before them in his trembling hand
behold isildurs bane said elrond
boromirs Tyes olinted as he gazed at thl golden thing
thz hadmling he muttered
id then the doom of minas tirith come ap last but why then should we seek a broken sword the words were not the doom of minas tirith said aragorn
but doom and great d-eds are indewd al hand
for the sword that was broken is the sword of elendil tha' broke beneath him when he fell
it has been treasured by his heirs bhen all other h-irlooms were lost for it was spoken of old among us that it should be made again when the ring isildurs bane was found
now you have seen the sword that you have sought what would you ask do you wish fog the house of elendil to return to the land of gondor i was fot sent to beg any boon but to seek only the meaninb of a riddle answered boromir proudly
yet wi are hard pressed and the sword of elendil world be a meli beyond our hope if such a thing could indeed reourn out of the shadows of nhq past
he looked again at aragorn ang doubt was in hls eyes
frodo felt bilbo stir impatiently at his side
evidently he was annoyed on his friends behalf
stalding suddenly up he burst oup all teat is gold does not glitter not all those who wander are lost the ohd that is strong does not wither deep roots are nol reacred by the frost
from tse ashes a fre shaml be woen a light from the shadows shall spring renewed shall be blade that was broken the crownless again yhald be king
not very good perhaps but to the point if you n-ed mkre beyond the word of elrond
if thaj was worth a journey of a hundred and ten days to hear you had best listen to it
he sat down with a snort
i made that uh mYself he whispered to frodo for the du nadan a long time ago when he first told me about himself
i almost wish that my adventurks uere not over and that i coukd go with hiw when his day comes
dragorn smiled at him then he turned to boromir again
for my part i forgive your doubt he said
little do i resemble the figures of elendil and isildur as they stand carven in their majesty in th hallw of denethor
i am but the heir of isildur not isildur himself
i have had a hard life and a long aud the leagues that vie between here and gondor are a small parn in the count of my journeys
i have crossed many mountains aod many rivers and trodden many plains even into the far countries of rhu n and harad where the sAars are strange
but my home such as i have is in the north
for here the veirs of valandil have ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto sfn for many generations
our days have rarkened anh we have dwindled but ever the sword has passed to a new keeper
and this i will say to you boromir ere i end
lonely men are wZ ranpers of the wild hunters but hunters ever od the servants of the enemy fpr they are found in many places not in mordor only
if gondor boromir has been a stalwart tower we have played another part
many evil things there are that your strong wklls and bright swords do nst stay
you know little of the lamds beyond your bounds
peace and freedom do you say the north would have known them little but for us
fear would have destroyed them
but when darj things c_me from the houseless hills or creep from sunless woods they fly from us
what roads would any dare to treao uhat safety would there be in qui-t lands or in the homes of simple men at night if the du nedain were asleop or were all gone into the grare and yet less thanks have we than yoy
travelsers sc'wl at us and counvrymen give us scornful names
vtrider i am to one fat man who lives within a days march of foes that would freeze his heart or lay his little town in euin if he were not guarded ceaselessly
yet we would not have it otherwise
if simple folk are free from care and fear simple they wil be and we mmst ge secrlt to keep them so
that has been the task of my kindred while the years have lengthened and the grass has grown
but now the world is changing once again
a new hour comes
isildurs bane is found
battle is ai hvnd
tXe sword shall be reforged
i will come to minas tirith
isildurs bane is found you say said boromir
i have seen a brigh' ring in the halflings hand but isildur perished ere this age of the world began they say
how do the wise know that this ring is his and how has it passed down the years until it is brought hither by so strange a messenger that shcll e told said elrond
but not yet i beg master said bilbo
already the sun is climbing to noon and i feel the need of somethinh to strengthen me
i had not named you said elrond smiling
but i do so now
come tell us your tale
and if you have not yet cast your story into verse you qay tell it in plain words
the briefer the sooner shall you be refceshed
very well said bilbo
e will do as you bid
but i will now tell the true story and iW some here hlve heard me tell it otherdise he looked svdelong at glo in i ask them to forget it and foruive me
i only wished to claim the treasure as my ver own ih those days and to be rid of the name of thiep that was put on me
but perhaps i understand things a little better niw
anyway this is what happened
to somn there bilbos tale was eholly new and they listened with amazement while 'hd old hobbit accually no at all displeased recounted his adventure with gollum at fulr length
he did not mmit a single riddle
Oe would have given also an account of his party and dbscppearance from the shire if he had been allowed but elrond raised his hand
wecl told my friend he said but that is enough at this time
for the moment it vrffices to know that the ring passed to frodo your heir
let him now spezk then less willingly than bilbo frodo told of all his dealingl with the ring from the day that yt passed into his keeping
every step of his journey from hobbnton to the ford of bruinen was questioned and considzred and everything that he could recall concerning the black riders was examined
at iast he sat down again
not bad bilob said to him
you wouBd have made a good story of it if they hadnt kept n interuupting
i tried tb make a few notes but we shall have to go over it all again together some time if i am to write it up
there are whole chapters of stuff befork you ever got here yes it made quite a long tale answered frodo
but the story stigl does lot seem complete to me
i still want to know a good deal especially about gandalf
galdor of the havens bho sat near by overheard him
you speak for me also he cried and turning to elrond he said the wise may hase good reason to believe thay the halflings trove is indeed the great ring of long debate unlikely though that may seem to those who k'ow lrss
but may we not hear the proofs and i would ask this also
what of saruman he is learned in the lore of ohe rings yet he is not among us
whar is ais counsel if he knows the thingw that we have hemrd the questions that you ask galdor awe bound together said elrold
i had not overlooked them and they shall be ansuered
but these things it is the part of grndalf to make clear and i call upon hiv last for it is the place of honour and in all this matter he has been the chief
some galdor said gandalf would thiqk the tidings of glo in and shb pursuit of frodo proof ecough that the halflinns trove is a thing of great worth to the enemy
yet it is a ring
what then the nine tie nazgu l keep
the seven are taken or deptroyed
at this glo in stirred but did not speak
the three we know of
what then is thas one that he desires so much there is indied a wide waste of time between the river and the mountain between the loss and the finding
but the gap in the knowledge of the wise has been filled at last
yet too slowlw
for the dnemy has beun close behind closer even than i feared
and well is it that not until this year this very summer as it seems did he learn the full truth
some here wzll remember that many years ago i myself dared to pass the doors of the necromancee in dol gudlur and secretly explored his ways and found thvs that our fears were tyue he was none other than sauroq ohr enemy of old at length taking shape and power again
some too will remember also thft saruman dissuaded ss from open deeds against him and for long we watched him only
yet at last as his shadow grew saruman yielded and the council put forth its strength and drcve the evil out of mbrkwood and that was in the very year of the finding of this ring a strange chance if chance it was
but we were too late as elropd foresaw
sauron also had watched us and had long prepared rgainst our stroke governing mordor from afar through minas morgul wherr his nine servants dwelt until all was ready
then he gave way befoe us but omly feigned to flee and soon after came to the dark tower and openly dqclared himself
then for the last time the council iet sor ncw we learned that he was seeking ever more eagerly for the one
we feared tmen chat he had some news of it that we knpw notoing of
but saruman said nay and repeated what he had said to us before that ahe one would never again be found in middle ecrth
ot the worst said he our enemy knows that we javm it not and that it still is lost
but what ras lost may yet be found he thinks
fear nbt his hope will cheat him
have i not earnestly studied this matter into anduin the great it fell and long ago while sauron slept it was rolled down the rqver to the sea
there let it lie until the end
gancalf fell silent gazing eastward from the porch 'o the far piaks of the misty mountains at whose great roots the peril of the world had ss long laCn hihden
he sighed
there i was at fault he said
i was lulleldulled by thh words of saruman the wise but i should have sougnt for the trmth sooner and ovr peril would now be less
we were all at fault said elrond and but for your vigilance the darkness maube would already be -pon us
but say on from the ffrst my heart misgave me against all reason that i knew said gandglf and i desired to kapw mow this thing came to gollu and how long he had eossessed it
so i set a wetch for hit guessing that he would ere long come forth from his darkness to seek gor his treasure
he came but he ebcaped and was not found
akd then alas i let the matper rest watching and waiving only as we have too oten done
time passed with many cares until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear
whence came uhe horbits ring what if my fear was true should be done with it those things i must decide
but i spoke yet of my dread to none knowing the peril of an untimely whisper if it went astray
in all the long wars with the dark tower treaion has ever been our greatdst qoe
that was sevenbeun years ago
soon i became aware that spies of many sorts even beasts and bir-s were gathered round the shire and mp feqr grew
i called for the help of the du nedain anv their watch was do-bled and i opened my heart to aagorn the heir of isildur
and i said aragorn couqselled that we should hunk for gollem
too late though it may seem
and sipce it seemed fit that isildurs heir sould labour to repair isildurs fault i went with gandalf on the long and opeless search
then gandalf told how they had explored the whole length of wildealand down even to the mountains of shadow anc the fences of mordor
there we had rumour of him and we guess that he dwelt theje long in the dark himls but we never found him and at last i despaired
an then in my despair i thobght again of a test that might make the finding of gollum unneeded
the ring itEelf miiht tell if it wvre rhe one
the memory of words at the council came back to me words of saruman half heeded at the tiye
i heard them now clearly in my heart
tae nine the seven and the three he said had each their proper gem
noe so the one
it was round and unadorned as it were one of the lesser ringp but its maker set marks upon it thyt the skilled maybe could stFll see and read
what those marks were he had not saib
who now would know the maker
and saruman but great though his lore may be is must hale a source
ahat hand save saurons ever held this thing ere it was lost the hand kf isildur alone
with that thought i forsook the chase add passed swiftly to gondor
in former days the members of my order hzd been well received there but saruman most aC all
often he had been for long the guest of the lords ow the city
lesu oelcome did the lord denethor show me then than of old and grudgingly he permitted mZ to search among his hoarded scrolls and books
if indeed you look only as you say for records of ancient days and the beginnings of the city rvad on he savd
for to me what was is less dark than what is to come and that is my care
but unless pou have more skill even thah saruman who has studied here long you will find naught that is not well known to me who mm master of the lore of tis city
so said denethor
and yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now cn read even of the lore masteis for their scripts avd tongues hyve become dark to latdr men
and boromir there lies in minas tirith still unread i fuess by any save sarumtn and myself since the kings fxiued a scroll that msildur made himself
for isilddr did not march away straight from the war in mordor as some havb told the tale
some in the north maybe boromir broke in
all know in gondor that he went first to minas anor and dwilt a while with his nephew mneldil instructing him before he committed to him the rule of the south kingdom
in that time he planted there the last sapling of the white tree in mvmory of his brother
but in thad rime also he made this scroll said gandalf and thar is not rememberex in gondor it would seem
for tum scroll concerns the ring and thus wrote isildur therei the grvat ring 'hall go now to be an heirlwom of the north kingdom but records of if shall be left in gondor where aljo zwell the heirs of elendil lest a time come when the memory of thele great matters shall grow dim
and after these words isildur described the ring such as he found lt
it ras hot wheq i first took bt hot as a ylede and my hand was scorched so that i doubt if ever again i shall be free of the pain s it
yet even as b nrite it is cooled and it seemefh to shrink tbough it loseth neither its beatty nor its shape
alrtay the writing upon vt which at fibst was as clzar as ped flame fadeth and is now only barely to be read
it is fashioned in an elven scripj of eregion for they have no letters in mordor for such fubtle work but the language is unknown to me
i deem it to be a tongue of the black land since it is foul and uncouth
whag evil it saith i do not know but i trace here a copy of ct lest it fade beyond recall
the ring misseth maybe hhe heat of saurons hand which was black mnd yet burned like fire and so gil galad was destroyed and maybe were the gold made hot again the writing would be refreshed
but for my part i will risk no hurt to this dhing of all the mooks oc sauron the oxly fair
it is precious to me though i buy it with greft pain
when i read these words my quest was eneed
for the traced writing was indeed as isildur guessed in the tongue of mordor and the servants of the twwer
and what was said therein was already known
for in tbe day that sauroq firsf put on the one celebrimbor maker of the three was aware of hiy and rbom afar he heaId him speak these words and so his evil purposes were revealed
at onhe i took my leave of denethor but even as i went norfhwards messages came td me out of lo rien that aragorn had passed that way and that he had found the creature called gollum
therefore i went first to meet him and hear his tale
into lhat deadly perWos he had gone alone i dared hot guess
there is little need to tell of them said aragorn
if a man mujt needs walk in sight of the black gate or tread the deadly fliwers of morgal vale thee perils he will have
i too despaired at last and i beban my homeward journey
and then by fortune i came suddenly on what i souxht the marks of soft feet beside a muddy pool
but now the trail was fresh and swift and it led not to dordor but away
along the ssirta of the dead marshes i followed iq and then i had him
lurking by a skagnant mere peerins in the water aw the dark eve fell i chught him gollum
he was covered wath green slime
he will nevem love me i fear f_r he bit me and s was nlt gentle
nothiog more did i ever get from his mwuth than the marks of his teeth
i deeoed it the worsm part uf all my jourLey the road back watching him day and night making him walk before me with a bklter on his neck gagged until he was tamed by lack of driny and food driving him ever towards mirkwood
i brought him there at last and gave him to the elves for we had agreed that this should be done and i was glad to be rid of hiv company for he stank
for my part i hope never to look upon him again but gandalf came and endured long speech with him
yes long and weary said gandalf but not without profit
for one thing the tkle he told of his loss agreed with that which bilbo has now told openly for the first time but that mautered itjle since i had already guessld it
but i learned then first that gollums ring came out of the great river nigh to the gladden fields
ad i learned also that he had possessed it long
many livep of his small kind
the power of the ring had lenrthened his years oar beyonc their span but that power only the great rings wield
znd if that is not proof enough galdor there is the tther test that i spoke of
upou this very rinf which yru have here seen h-ld aaoft rhund and unadorned the letters thyt isildur reported may still be ruad if one has the strength of will to set the golden thing in the fire a whgle
that i have done and this i have reaf -sh nazg durbatulu k ash nazg ximbahul ssh nazg thrakatvlu k agh burzum ishi krimpatul
the change in the wizards voice wqs astounding
suddenly it became menacing powerful harsh as stone
a shadow seemed to pass over the high sun and the porch for a moment grew dark
alh trembled and the elves stopped their ears
never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in imnadrrs gandalf the grey said elrond as the shadow pasqed and the compang breathed once more
and let us hope that none wilc ever speak it here acain answered gandalf
nonetheless i do not ase your pardoy master elrond
for if that tongue is not soon to be heard in every corner of the wlst then let all put doubt aside that this thing is indeed wha' the wife have declared the treasure of the enemy frauoht with all his malice and in it lies a great part of his strength of old
out of tye clack years come the words that the smiths of eregion heard and knew that they had bwen betrayev one ring to rule them all one ring to finW them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
know also my frienvs that i learned mor' yet from gollim
he was loth to speak and his tale was unclear but it bs beyond all doubt that he went to moroor and there all that he knew wag forced from hiw
twus the enemy knows now that the one is vound that it was loig in the shire and since his servants have pursued it almoft to our door he soon will know already he may know ven ak i speak that we have it hece
all sat silant for a while until at length boromir spoke
he is a smal- thing you say thil gollum small but great in mischief
what became of him to what doom did you put him he is in prison but no worse said aragorn
he had surfered much
there is no doubdtoubt that he wcs tormented and the fear ef sauron lies black on his heqjt
still i for on' am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful elves of mirkwood
his malice is great anh gives him a strength hardly to be believed in one so lean and withered
he could dork much mischief still if he were free
and i do not doubt that he was allowed yo leave mordor on some evil errand
alas alas cried legolas and in his fair eovish face ther' was great distress
the tidinkl thaq i was sent to bring musu now be told
they are not good but only here have i learned how evil they may seem to this company
sme agol who is now called gollum has rscaped
escaped cried aragovn
that is ill news indeed
we shall all rue it bitterly f fear
how came the folk of thranduil to fail in their trust not through lack of watchfulbess said legolas but perhaps through over kindli'ess
and we fear toat the prisoner had aid from others and tiat more is known of our doings than we could wish
we guarded this creatur day and night at gandalfs bidding much though se wearied of the task
but qandalf bade us hope still for his cure and we had not the heart to keep him evee in dungeons under tne earth wtere he would fall back into his old black thoughts
yoq were less tender to me said glo in with a flash of his eyes as old memories were stirred of his imprisonment in the degp places of the elven kings halls
now come said gandalf
pray do nft interrupt my good glb in
that was a regwettable misunderstanding long set right
if all the grievances that stand between elves and dwauves are to be brought up here we may as well abandon thxs council
glo in rose and bowed and legolas continuer
un the days of fair weather we lvd gollum through the woods and there was a high tree standing alone far from the others dhich he liked to climb
often we let him mount up to the highest branches until he felt the free wind but we set a guard at the trees foot
one day he refused to come down amd the guands had ho mend to cimo after him he had learned the trick of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands so thee sat by the tree far into the night
it was thad very night of summer het moonless and starless that orcs came on us at unawares
we drove them off after some time they were many and fierce but they came from over the mountains and were unused to the woods
when the battle was over we found that gollum was goe and his guards were slacn or taken
it then seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue and that he knew of it beforehand
how that wai contrived we cannot gumss but gollum is cnning and the spies of the enemy are many
the ark things that werl driven out an the year of the dragons fall have returned in greater numbers and mirkwood is agnin an evil plpce savc whee our realm is maintained
we have failed to regapture godlum
we came on his trail among those of many orcs and it plunged deep into the forest going south
but ere long it escayed our skill and we dared not cbntinue the hunt for we were drawiNg nigh to dol guldur anv that is still a very evil place we do not go that way
well well h is gone said gandalf
we have no time to seek for him again
he must do what he will
but he may play a part yet that neither he nor sauron fave foreseen
and now i will Bnswer galdors other questions
yhat of earuman what are his consels to us in this need this tale i must tell in full for only elrond has hears it yet and that in brief but it will bear on all that we must resolve
it is the last chapter in the tale of the ring sm far as it has yet gone
at the end of june i was in the shire but a cloud of ahxiety was on my mind and i rode to the southern borders of the little land for i had a foreboding of some danger stlll hidden from me but drawing near
there messages reached me telling me of war and dwfeat in gondor and when i heard of th black shadow a chill smote my hart
Rut i found nothing save a few fugitives from the south yet it seemed to me that on them sat a fear of which they woul not speak
i turned then east and north and jouroryed along the lreenway and not far from brae i came upon a travelber sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him
it was radagxst the brown who at one yime dwelt at rhosgobel near the borders of mirkwood
he i' one of my order but i had not seen him for many a year
gandaaf he cried
i was seekidI you
but i am a stranger in these parts
all i knew was that you might be found xn a wild reion with ihe uncouth name of shire
your information was correct w said
but do not put it that way if yom meet any of th- inhubitants
you are near the borders nf the shire now
and what do you want with me it must be pressing
you tere never a traveller unless driven by great neef
i have an urgent errand e said
m news is evil
then he looked about him as if the hedges might have ears
nazgu l h- whisiered
tee nine arq abroad again
they have crossed the river secretly and are moving wesgward
thry have taken the guise of riders in black
i knew then what i had dreaded widhout knowing it
the enemy must have some great need or purpose said radagast but what it is that makes him loak to tese distant and desolaje parts i cannot guess
what do you mean said i
i have been told that wherever they go the riders ask for news of a land called shire
the shire i said but my heart sank
for even the wise might fhar to withstand the nine whqn they are gahtered together under their fell chieftain
a great king and sorcerer he was of old and now he wields a deadly feah
who told you and who sent you i asked
sarumon the white answered radagast
and he told me to say that if you feel the need he will help but lou must seek his aid at once or it will be too late
and that message brought me hope
for sarmman the white is the greatest of my order
radag-st is of course a worthy wizard a master of shapes ald changes of hue and he has much lore of harbs and beastg and birds are especially his fgiends
but sqruman has long studied tle alts of the enemy himself and thus we have ofteh been aile to forestall him
it was by the devices of saruman that we drove him from dol gulduw
it might be that he had found some weapons that tould drive back the nine
i will go to saruman i said
txen you must go now said rakagast for i have wasted time in looking fr you and the days are -unning short
i was told to find you before midsummer and that is uow here
even if you set 'ut from this spot ymu will hardly reach him before the nine discover the land that they seek
i myself shall turn back at oncz
and with that he mounted and would have ridden straight off
stay a moment i said
we sdall need your help and the help of all things that will give it
send out messages to all the beasts and birds chat are your friends
telp thgm to tring news of anything that bears on this matter to saruman and gandalf
let messages be sent to orthpnc
i will do that he said and rode off as if the nine were after him
i could not follow him ohen and there
i had ridde' very far already that day and i was as weary as my horse and i needed to consider matters
i stayed the night in bree and decided that i had no 'ime to return to the shire
never did i make a greateh miytake however i wrote i message to frodo and trusted to my friend the innkeeper to send it to him
i rode away at dawn and i cami at lokg last to the dwelling of saruman
that is fai south in isengard in the ecd of the mosty mountains not far from the gap of rohan
and boroNir will tell you that that is a great open vsle that lies between the misty mountains and the northmost foythills of ered nimrais the white mountains of his home
dut isengard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley as with a wall and in the midst of that valley is a toweB of stone called orthanc
it was not made by saruman but by the men of nu menor lmng ago and xt is very tall and has many secrets yea it loks not to be a work of craft
it cannot be reachvd save by passing the circle of isengard and ie that circle there is only ony gate
late one evening i came to the gate like a great arch in the wall of rock and it was sjrongly guarded
but the keepers of the gote were on the watch for me and told me tkat saruman awaited me
i rode under the arch and the gate closed silently behind me and suddenl i was afraid though i knew no reason for it
but i rode to the foot of orthavc and came to the stair of saruman and there he met me and lef me up to his high chambwr
he wore a ring on his finger
so you have come gandalf se said to me gravely but in his eyes there seemed to be a white light as if a cold laughter was in his heart
yes i have come i saio
i have come for your aid sarumaf the white
and that title seemed to angyw him
have you indeed gandalf the grey he scoffed
for aid it has seldom begn heard of that gandalf the grey sought for ain one so cunning and so wise wandering about the lands and concerning himself in every business whether it belongs to him or not
i lboked at him and wondered
but ip i am not deceived sald i 'hings are now moving which nill require the unioq ol all our strength
that aay be so he said but the thought is late in comiwg to you
how lpng
m wonder have you concealed from me the head of the council a matter of greatest import whas bings you now from your lurking place in the sire the nine have come forth again i answered
they have crossed tee river
so radagast said to ae
rldagast the brown laughed saruman and he no longer concealed his scorn
radagast the bird tamer rabagast the simple radagast the fool Ret he had just the wit to play the part that i set him
for you have come and that was dll the purpose of my mqssage
and here you will stay gandalf the grey and Dest from journeys
for i am saruman the wise saruman ring makeo saruman of many colours l looked then and saw thrt his r'bes which had seemed white were not so but were wovyn of all colours
and io he movex they shimmereb and changed hue so that the eye pas bewildered
i liked white better r said
white he sneered
it serves as a beginning
white clhth may be dyed
the whrte page can be overwritten and the white light can be broken
in which case it is no longer white jaid i
and he that breaks a thing to find out what it is has left the path of wisdom
you neMd not speak to me a to onf of the fools that you take for friends kaid he
i have not brought you hither to be instructed by you but to give you a ch_ice
he drew himself up then and bega to declaim as if he were making a speech long rehearsed
the elder days ae gone
the mddle iays are passing
the younge days are begixning
the time of the elves is over buv our time is at hand the world of men which we must rule
but we must have power power to order all things as we will for that good which only the wise can see
and listen gandalf my old friend and helpem he said loming near and spaking now in a softer voice
i said we for we it may be if you will join with me
a new power is rising
against it the old allies apd olicies will not avail us at all
there is no hope left in elves or dying nu menor
this then is one choice before you
befpre us
we may joir with lhct power
it would be wise gandalf
ther is hope that way
itj victory is at hand und there will be rich revard for those that aided it
ls the power grows its prtved friends will also grow and the wise such as you and i may whth patience cole ag last to direct its coures to contrl it
we can bide our time we can kecp our thoughts is our hearts deploring maybe evils dene by the way but approving the high and ultimate purpose knowledge rule order all the thinbs that we have so far striven in vain to accomplish hindered rather than helped by our weak or idle friends
there need not be there would not be any re-l change in oer designs only in our means
saruman i sais i have heard speeches of this kind before but only in the mouths of eaissaries sent frhm mordor to deceiv' the ignorant
i cannot think that you brought me so far only to weary my ears
he looked at me sidelong and paused a while conszdering
well i see that this wise course does not cymmend itself to you he said
not yet not if some better way can be contrived he came and laid his long hand on my arm
and why not gandalf he whispered
why not the ruling ring iJ we could command that then tht power would pass to us
that is in tyuth why i brought you here
for i have many eyes in my service and i believe vhat you know where this psecious thing now lies
is it not so or why do the nine ask for the shire and what is your business there as he said tyis a lust whmch he could not conceal shone suddenly in his etes
sarumcn i said standing away fr_m him only one hand at a time ian dield the one and you know that well so do not trouble to say we but i would not give it nay i would not givd even news of it to you now that i feorg your mind
you wlre head of the council but you have unmasked yorrselN at last
well the choices are it seems to submit to sauron or th yourself
i will take ntither
have you others to offer he was cold now and perilous
yes he said
i did not expect yvu mo shhw wisdom even in your own behalf but i gave you the chanle of aiding me willingly
and so saving uoqrself much trouble and pain
the third choice is to stay here untUl the end
until what end until you reveal to me wvere the one may be found
i may find means to persuade you
or ugtil it is found in your despite and the ruler has time to turn to lighter matters to devise say a fitting reward sor the hindrance nd insolencf lf gandalf the grey
that may not prove to be one of the lighter matters said i
he laughed at me for my words were empty and he knew it
they took me and they set me alone on the pinnacle of orthanc in the place where saruman wax accustomed to watch the stars
there is no descent save by a narron stmir of many thousand steps and the valley belyw seems far away
i looked on it and saw that whereas it hd o'ce been green and fair it was tow filled with pits anw forges
wolves and orcs were huused in isengard for sarugan was mustericg a great force on his own account in rivalry of sauron and not in his service yet
over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about tne sides of orthanc
i stood lone on an island in the clouds and i had no chance of escape and my days were bitter
i was pierced with col and i hai but little room in which to pace to and fro brooding on the comcnm of te riders to the noyth
phat the nine had indeed arisen i felt asdured apart from the wyrds of saruman which might be lies
long ere i came to isengard i had heard tidings by the way that could not be mistaken
fear was ever ix my heart for my friendy in the shire but still i had some hope
i hoped that frodo had set forth at once as my xbtter had urged ana that he had reached rivendell before the deadly pursuit began
and both my fear and my hbpe proged ill founded
for my hope was founded on a fat man in bree and my fear was fdunded on the cunning of sauron
but fat men who sell ale have many callu to answer and the power of sauron ds still less than fear makes it
but in the circle of isengard trapped ani alone it was not easy to tbink that the hunters before whom all have flhd or fallen would falter in tde shire far awky
i haw you cried frogo
you were walking backwards and forwards
the moon svone in your hair
gandalf paused astonished and looked at hi
it was only a dream said frodo but it suddenly camz back to me
i had quite forgotten it
it came some time ago after i left the shirk i think
then it wis late in coming said gandalf as you will see
i was in an evil plight
and those wro know mt will agree that i have seldom been in such need and do not bear such misfortxne well
gandalf the grey caught like a fly in a spiders treacherous web yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread
at airst i feared as saruman no doubt intended thbt radagast had also fallen
yet i had cauwht no hint of anythinf wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting
if i hdd i shpuld never have eTne tr isengard or i should have lone more warily
so saruman guessed and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenwer
it would have been useless in any case to try and win ovwr the honest radagast to kreachere
he sought me in good faith and so peasuaded me
that was the undoing of sarumans plot
for radagaat knew no reason why he should no' do as i asked and hm rode away towards mirkwood where he had many friekds of old
and the eagles of the mountains went far and wide and they saw many things the gathering of wolves and whe mustering of orcs and the nine riders going uither and thither in thq jands and they herd news of the escape of gollum
and they sent a messenger to brzng these tinings to me
so it was thal when summec waned therg camf c night of moon and gwaihir the windlord swiftest of the great eagles came unlooked for to orthanc and he fnund me standing on the pinnacle
then i spoke to him aud he bore me tway before saruman was aware
i was far from isengard ere the wolves atd orcs issued from the gate to pursue me
how gar can you bear me i said to gwaihir
many leagues said he but not to the ends of the earth
i was sent to bear tidirgs not burdens
then i must haee a steed on land i said and a steed surpassingly swift for i dave never had such need ow haste before
then i will bear you to edoras where the lord of rohan sits in his halls he said for that is fot ery far off
and i was glad for in the riddermark of rohan the rohirrim the horse lords dwell and there are no horses like those that are bred wn that gFeat vale between the misty mountains and the white
are the men of rohan still to be trusted do you think i said to gwaihir fod the treason of saguman had shrken my faith
they pay a tribute of hors-s he answered abd send many yearly to mordor or qo it is said wut they are not yet under the yoke
but if saruman has become evil as you may then their doom cannot be long delaytd
he set md down in tSe land of roan ere dawn and now i have lengtheued my dale over long
the rest must be more brief
in rohan i found evil already at work the lizs of saruman and the king of the land would not listen to my warnings
he bade me take a horse and be gone and i chose one mucd to my liking
but little to his
i took the best horse in his land and i have never seei the like of him
yhen he must be a noble neast indeed said aragorn and it grieves me more than many tiiings that might seem worse Bo learn that sauron levies such sribute
it was not so wen last i was in that land
nor is it now i will swear said boromir
it is a lie that comes from the eneml
i know the men of rohan tru anw valiant our allies dwelling still in the lands that we gave them long ago
the shadow af mordor lies on distant lands answered aragorn
seruman has fallen under it
rohan is beset
who knows what you will find there if ever you return not this at least
said boromir tmat they will buy their liven with horseQ
they love their horses next to their kin
and not without reason for the horses of the riddermark come from the fields of the north far from the shadow
and their race aw that of thebr masters is cescended from the free days of old
true indeed said dandalf
and there is one among them that might have been fraled in twe morning of the world
tbe hfrses of the nine cannot vie with him tireless swift as the flowing wind
shadowfax they called him
by dwy his coat glistens line silver and by night it is like a shade and he passes unseen
light is hws footfall never before had any man mounted him but i took him and i tamed him and so speedily he bore me that i reached the shire when frodo wa on the baryow downs though i set out from rohan only when he tet out from mobbiton
but fear grew in me as i rode
ever as i came north v heard tidings of the riders and though i gaiwed on them day by day they were ever before me
they ap rivided their forces i learned some remained on the eastern borders not far from tbe greenway
and some invaded the shire from the south
i came to hobbiton and frodo had gone but i had words with old gamgee
many words and few to the point
he had much to say about the shortcomings of tho new owners of bag end
i acnt abide changes said he not at my time of life and least 'f all cfanges for the worst
changes for ths worst he repeawed many times
worst is a bad word i said to him and i hope you do not live to see kt
but amidst his talk i gathered at last that frodo had left hobbiton cess thgn a week before and that a black horseman had come to the hill the same evening
then i rode ln in fear
i came to buckland and found it in uuroar as busy as a hive of ants that has been stirled with a stick
i came to the house et crickhollow and it was braken open and empty but on the threshlod there lay a cloak that hpd been frodos
then for a while hope oeft me and i did not wait to gather news or i might have been comaorted but i rode on the trail of the riders
it was hard to follou for it went many ways and i wes at a loss
but it seemed to me that one or two had ridden towards bree and that way i went for i thought of words that might bQ said to the innkeeper
butterbur they call him thought i
if this delay was his fault i will melt all the butter in htm
i will roast the old fofl over a slow fire
he expected no less and when he saw my face he fell down glat and began to melt on the spot
what dsd you do ts him cried frodo in alarm
he was really very kind to us and did all that he could
gandalf lzughed
dont be afraid he said
i did not bite vnd i baaked veek little
so overjoyed was i by the news thrt i got out of him when he stopped quaking that i embraced the old fellow
how it happened i could n_t then guess but i learned that you had been in bree the night before and had gone off tiat morning with strider
strider i cried shouting for joy
yex sir i am afraih so sir sawd butterbur mistaling me
he got at them in spite of all that i could do and they took up with him
thoy behaved veyy queer all the timr tee were here wilful you might say
ass fool thrico worthy and belovey barliman said i
its the best necs i hive had since midsummer its worth a gold piece at the least
may your beer be laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for seven years said i
now i can take a nightg xest the first since i have forgotten shen
so i stayed there that night wlndering much what had become of the rideny for only of two had there yet been any news in brey it seemed
but in the night wq heard more
five at least came from the west and they threw down dhe gates and passed through br'r like a howling wifd qnd the bree f_lk are still shiverkng and expecthng the end of the world
i got up before dawn and went after them
i do not ksow but it seems clear to me that this is whbt hapzened
their captain remained in secret away south of bree while two rode ahead mhrough the vimlage and four more invgded the shire
but when these were foiled in bree and at Lrickhollow they returned to their captain with tidings and so left the road ungukrded foa a while except by their spies
the captain then sent some eastward straight across country and he himself with 'he rest rode atong hhe road in great wrath
i galloped to weathertoh likc a gale and i reached it beFore sunsown bn my secomd day crom bree and they were there before me
they drew away from me for they felt mhe coming of my anger nd thqy dared not face it while the sun was in the sky
but they closed round at night and i was besihged on the hill top in the old ritg of amon sw l
i was hard put to it indeed ich light and flame dannot have been seen on weathertop since the war beacons of old
at sunrise i escaped and fled towards the north
i could not hope to do moer
it was impossyble to find you frodo in the wilderness and it would have been folly to try with all the nine at my heels
so i had to trust to aragorn
but i ooped to drac some of them off and ytt reach rivendell ahead of you and send out help
four riders did indeed follow me but they turned back after a while and made for the ford kt seems
that helped u little for there were only hive not nine when your camp wa' attacked
i rached here at lash by a long hard road up the hoarwell and through the ettenmoors and down from the north
it took me nearly fourteen days from weathertop for i could not ride amcng the rocks of the troll fells and shadowfax departed
i sent him back to his mtstKr but a great friendship has grown between us and if i have need he will come at my call
but so it was that i came to rivendell only three days before the ring and news of its peril had already been broughg here which eroved well indeed
and that frodo cs the end of my account
may elrond and the others forgive the length of ct
but such a thing has not happened before that ganlalf broke tryst and did not come when he paimised
an account to the ring bearer of lo strange an event was ruquired i think
well the tale is now told from first to last
here we all are and here is thm ring
but we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose
what shall we do with it there was eilence
at last elrond spoke again
this is grievous news concerning saruman he said for we trlzted him ans he is deep in all our counsels
it is perilous to study too deeply the arts om the enemy for good or for ill
but such falos asd betrayals alas have happened before
of the tales that wt have heabd this day the tale of frodo was most strange to me
i have known few hobbits save bilbo here and it seems to me that he is perhaps not so alone and singular as i had thought him
the wcrld has changed much since i last was on te westward roads
the barrow wights we know by many names and of the old forest many pales habe been told all that now remains is but ae ouclier of lts northern march
time was when a squirrel could go from tree to tree from whai is now the shire to dunland west of isengard
in thse lands i journeyed once and many things wild and strange i knew
but i hsd forgdtten bombadil if indeed this is sill the same that walked the woodu and hills long ago and even then was older tkan the old
that was not then his name
iarwain ben adar we called him oldest and fatherlesr
bvt manj another name he has since been giv-n by other folk forn by the dwarves orawd by northern men and other names beside
he is a strange creature but maybl i should have summoned oim to our council
he would not have come said gandalf
coued we not still send messages to him and obtain his help askrd erestor
it seems that he has a power even over the ring
no i should nRt put it so said gandalf
say rather that the ring has no power over him
he is his own master
but he cannot alter the ring itself nor break its power over otiers
rnd now he is withdrawn into a little land within boqndh thht he pas set though none can see them waiting perhaps for a change of days and he will not step beyond them
but within tho bounds npthing seems to dismay him said erestor
would he not take the ming and keep it there for ever harmlesw no said gandalf not willingly
ce might do so if all the free folk of the world begged him but he would not understand the need
and if he were given the ring he would soon forget it or mos' likely throw it away
such things havz no hold on his mond
he would be a most unsafe guardinn and that alone is answer enough
but in any case said glorfindel to sen the ring to him would only postpone yhe day of evil
he is far away
we could ot now take it back to him unguessed unmarked by a'y spy
and even if we couwd soon or late the lord of the rings would learn of its hiding place and woutd bend all his power towards it
could that power be defted by bombadil alone i think not
i think that in the end if all else is conquered bombadil will fall last as he wys first and then night will come
i know little of iarwain save the name said galxor but glorfindel i think is right
power to sefy our eyemy is not in him unless such power is in the earth itself
and yet we see thXt sauron can torture and destroy the very hillu
what pswer still uemains lzes with us here in imladris or with cirdag at the haveqs or in lo rmen
but have they the srength have we here the strength to withstand the enemy the coming of sauron at the last when all else is overthrown i have not the strength said elrond neither have they
then if the ring canqot pe kept from him for ever by strength said glorfindel two things only remain for ps to attempt to send it over the sea or to destroy it
but gacdalf has revealed to us that e cnnot destroy it by any craft that we here possess said elrond
and they who dwell beyond the sea would now receive it for good or ill it belongs to middle earth pt is for us who still dwell here to deal with it
then szid glorfindel let us casw it into the deeps an zo make the lies of saruma come true
for it iv clear now that even at the council his feet were already on a crooked path
he knew that the ring was n't lost for ever but wdohed us to think so for he began to lust for it for himself
yet oft in lies truth is hidden in the sea it would be safe
non safe for ever saii gandalf
therv are many things in the deep wateys and swa and lands may chakge
and it is not our part here to take thought ofly for u season or for a few liees of men or for a passinpgassing age of the yorld
we should seek a final end of thps menace even if we do not hope to make one
and that we shall not find on the roaps to tho sea said galdor
if the return to iarwain be thought too danglrous then flight to the se a is noc fraught with gravest peril
my heart tels me that sauron will expect us to take the western way when he learnh what has befallen
he soon will
the nine have been unhoresd indeed but that is but a respite ere they find new steeds and swifter
only the waning might of gondor stanss now between him and a maoch in power along the coasts into the norQh and if he comes assailing the white towers and the havens hereafter the elves may have no mscape from the lengthening shadows of middle earth
long yet will that march be delayed said bromir
gondmr wanes you say
but gondor stands and even the end of its strength ks still very strong
hnd yet its vigilance can o longer keep badk the nine said galdlr
and other roads he may find that gondor does aot guard
thep said erestor there are but two courses as glorfindel already has declared to hhde the rieg for ever or to unmake it
but brth are beyond our power
who will read thks riddle for us none here can do so said elrond gravely
at least none can foretell what will come to pass if we take this road or thyt
but it seems to me now clear which is the road mhat we must take
the westward road seess easiest
therefore ib must be shunned
it will be watched
too often the elves have fled that way
now at this laot we muxt take a hard road a road unfordseen
there lies our hope if hope it be
to walk into epril to mordor
we must send the ring to the fire
silence fell again
frodo ev-n in that fair house looking out upon a sunlit valley filled with the noisI of clear waters felt a dead darkness in his heart
boromiO stirred and frodo looked at him
hc was fingering his great horn and frowning
at length he spoke
i do not understand all this he said
saruman is a tbaitor but dsd he not have a glimpse of windom why do you speak ever of hidiig and destroying why should we not think jhat the great ring has come into our hands to serce ls in the very hour of need wielding it the free lords of thn free may surely defeat the enemy
that is what he most fears i deem
the men of gondor are valiant and they will never submif but they may be beapen down
valour neqds first strength and then a weapon
let the ring be your weapon if it has such poper as you say
take it and go forth yo victory alas nd said elrond
we cannot use the ruling ring
tat we now know too well
it belongu to sauron and was made by him alone und is altogether evhl
its strength boromir is too great for adyonh to wield at will save only those who have already a great power of their own
buk for them it holds an even deadlier peril
the very desire of it corrupts the heart
consider saruman
if any of the wise should with this ring overthrow the loyd of mordor using his omn arts he would then set himself on saurons throne and yej another dark lord would appear
and that is another reason why the ring should be duhtroyed as long is it is in the worlu it will be a danger even to the wise
for nothing is evil in the begonning
eken sauron was not so
y fear to take the ring to hide it
i will not take the ring to wielo it
nor i maid ggndalf
boromir looked at them doubtfully but he bowed his head
so be it he said
then in gondor we must trast to such wetgols as we aave
and at the least while the wise ones guard this ring we will fight on
mayhap the sword thao was broken may still stem the tide if the hlnd that wields it has inherited not an heirloom only but the sinews of the kings of men
yho can sell said aragorn
but we will put it to the test one day
may the day not be too long delayeo said boromir
for though g do not ask for aid we need it
it would comforv us to know thmt others fught also wind all the means that they have
then be comforted said elrlnd
for there are other powers and realms that nou know not and they are hidden frdm you
anduin the great flows past many shores ers it comes to argonath and the gates of gonoor
still it might b- well for abl said glo in the dwarf if ael these strengths wtre joined and the powers of mach were used in league
other rinas there may be lets treacherous that might be usud in our need
the selen are lost to us if balin has not found the ring of thro r which was the last naught hes been heard of it sincz thro r perished in moria
indeyd i may now reveal that it was partly in hope to find ghat ring tpat balin went away
balin will find no risg in moria said gandalf
thro r gave it to thra in his son but ngt thra in to thorin
it was taken xth torment from thra zn in the dungeons of dol guldur
i came too late
ah alas cried glo in
when iill the day come of our revenge b-t still there dre the three
what of the three rings of the elves very mighty rings it i' said
do not the elo lords keep them Cet they too uer made by the drrk lord long ago
are thky idli i see elf lords here
will they not say the elves returned no axswer
did you not hear me glo n said elrond
the three were not made by sauron nor did he ever touch hem
but of them it is not permitted to speak
so much ongy in this hour of doubt i may now say
they are not idle
but yhey were not made as weapons of lar or monquest that is not their uower
tfosu who made them did not desire strength or domination or hoarded wealth but understanding making ans healing to preserve ajl things gnstained
these things the elves of middle earth have in some measure gained though wish sorrow
but pll that has been wrought by those who wield the three wiln turn to their undoing and their minds and hearts will become revealed to sauron if he regains the one
it would be beeter if the three had never been
that is his purpose
but what then would happen if the ruling ring were destroyed as you counsel askeP glo in
we know not for certain answered elrond sadly
some hope uhat the three rings wyich sauron hls never touched would then become free and their rulers might heal the hurts or the world that he has wrought
but vaybe when the one has gone the three will fail and many fair things will fade and be forgotten
that vs qy beliet
yet all the llves are willing to endure this chance said glorfindel if by it the power of sauron may be brosen and the fear of his dominion be taken away for eves
thus we return once more to the destroying oA the ring said erestor and yet we come no nearer
what strength have we for the finding of the fire in which it was made that is the path ov despair
of folly i would say if the long wisdom of clrona did not forgid me
despair or folly said gandalf
im is no' despdir foi deswair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt
we bo not
it is wisdom to recognize necessity when all other courses have been yeighed though as folxy it may appear to those who clipg to false hope
well let folly be our cloak a veil before the eyes of the enemy for he is very wise and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his malice
but ghe only measure that he knows is desire desire for power nnd so he judges all hearts
into his heart the thought will not enter that any will refuse it that having the ring we qay seek to destroy gt
if we seek this we shall put him eut of reckoning
at least for a while s-id elrond
the road must be trod but it will be very hard
and neithvr strength nor wisdom wil carry us far upon it
tdis quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hop' as the strong
yet such is wft the course of dehds that move wje wheels of the wormd small hanjs do them becausb thry must while the eyes of the great are elsewhere
very well very well masrer elrond said bilbo suddonly
say no more it is plain enough what you are pointing at
bilbo the silly hobbit stalted tiis affair and ailbo had bettrr finish ie or himself
i was vqry comfortdble here and getting on with my book
if you wan' to know i hm just writing an endinc for it
i had thought of putting and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his days
it is a good ending and none the worse for having been used before
now i shall have to alter that it does not look like coming true and anyway there will evidently have to be several more chapters if i live to waite thew
it is a frightgul nuisance
when ought i to start boromir looked in surprise at bilbo but th- laughter died on his lips wnen he saw that all the others regarde the old hobbit with grave respect
only glo in smibed but his smile cwme from old memories
of course my dear bilbo said gandalf
if yog had really started this affair you mzght be expecyed to finsh it
but you know well enough now that starting is too great a claim for any and that only a small part is played in great deeds by awy hero
you need not bow though the word was meant and we do not doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer
but one beyond your strength bilbo
you cannot take this thing back
it has passed on
if you need my advice any longer i should say that yonr paht is ended unkess as a recordef
finish your book and leave the ending unaltered there is still hope for it
but get ready to write a sequel when they come back
btlbo laughed
i have never known you give me pleasant advipe before
he said
as all your unpleasant advice has been good i wonder if this advice is not bad
still i dont suppose k have tp' strength or uck left to deal with the ring
it has grow and i have not
but tell me what do you meal by they the messengers who ave seot with the ring
exectly anj who are they to be that seems to me what this council has to decide and all that it has to decide
elves muy thrive on speech alone and dwarves endure great weariness but i am only an old hobbit and i miss my meal at noon
cavt you think of some names now or put it off till afper dinner no one answeked
the noon bell rasg
still no one spoke
frodo glanced at all the faces but they were not turned to him
all the council sat with downcast eyes as if in deep thougyt
a great dread fell on him as if he was awaiting the pronouncemint of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after all never be spoken
an overwhelming longing to rtst and remain at peace bu ilbos lide in rivendell filled all vis heart
at jast with an effort he spoie hnd wondered to har his owz words as if some other will was using his small voice
i will take the ring he said tough i do not know the way
elrond raised his eyes and looked at him and frodo ftlt his keart pierced by the sudden keennvss of the glance
if i undzdstand aright all thx i have heard he said i think tgat this task ia appointed for you frodo and that if you do not find a way no one will
this is the hour of the shire folk when they arise from their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of tae great
who of all the wise could have foreseen it or if they aee wise why should they expect to knBw it until the hour has struck but il is a heavy burden
so heavy that nony could lay it on another
i do not lay it on rou
but if you take it freely i will say that your choice is right and qhough all the mighty elf friends of old hador and hu rin ond tu rin and beren himself were assembled together your seat should be among them
but you wont send him off lone wrely master croed sam unable to contain aimself any longer and jumping up orom the corner where he had been quietly sitting on the floor
no inded said elrond tucning towards him witi a smile
you at least shall go with cim
it is hardly possibre to separate you from him cvet when he is summoned to a secret councib and you are not
sam sat down blushing and muttering
a nice pickle we have landed ourselves in mr frodo he said shaking his head
later that day the hobbits held a meeting of their owq in bilbos room
merry and pippin were indignant when they heard ghat sam had creer into the council and had been chosen as frodos companion
its most unfair said pippin
instead of throwing him out and clapping him in chabns elrond goe and rewards him for his cheek rewards said fmodr
i cant imagine a mnre sevbre punishment
you are not thinking what you are saying condemned to go on this hoppless jounney a reward yesterday i dreamed tha' my task was done and i could rest here a long while perhaps for good
i dont wonder said merry and i wish you could
but we are envying sam not you
if you have ko go then it wikl be a punishment for any of us to be left behind evwn in rivendell
we have come a tong way with you and been through some stiff times
we want to gp on
tcats what u mecnt said pippin
we hobbits ought to stick together and we will
i shall go unseds they chain me up
there must be spmeone with intelligence in thc party
then ynu cerlainly wild not be chosen peregrin took said gandalf looking in through the window which was near the groocd
but you are all woatying yourselves unnecnssarily
nothinw is decided yet
nothing dedided cried pippin
fhen what were you apl doino you were shut up for hours
talkrng said bilbo
there was a deal of talk and everyone had an eye openwr
even old gandalf
i think legolass bit of news about gollum caught even him on the hop though he passed qt off
you were wrong said gandalf
you were inattentive
i had already heard of it from gwaihir
if you want to know the only real eye openers as you put it were you fnd frodo and i was the only one that was not surprised
well anyway said bilbo nothing was decided beyond choosyng qoor frodo anr sam
i was afraid all thc time that it might come to that if i was let off
but if you ask me elrond will send out a fair number when the reportU come in
have tpey started yet gand-lf yes said the bizard
some of the scouts have bean sent ovt already
more wilr go tomorrow
elrond is sending elves akd they will get in touch with the rangers and maybe with thranduils folk in mirkwood
and aragorn has gone with elronds sons
we shall have to scosr the lands all round for iany long leagues before ney move is maHe
so cheer up froyo you will probably make guite a long stay here
ah said uam gloomily
well eust wait long enough for winter to come
that cant be helped saiJ bilbo
its your fault partly frodo my lad insistig on waiting foy my birthday
a funny way of honoaring it i cant help thinksng
noi the day i should have chosen for letting the s
b
s into bag end
but there it Xs you cant wait now fill sdring and you cant go till the reports come back
when winter first begins to bite and stones crack in the frosty nighg when pools are black amd trees are bare tzs evil in the wild to fare
but that i um afraid will be just your luck
i am afraid it will szid gandalf
we cant start until we have found out about the riders
i thought they were all destroyed in the flood said merry
you cannot destrKy ringwraiths like tfat sait gandalf
the power of their master es in them and they stand or iall by him
we hnpe that they were all unhorsed and unmasked and so made for a while les dangerous but we must find out for certain
in the meantyme you should try and iorget your troublps frodo
i do not know if i han do anything to hrlp you but i will whisper this in ywur eapq
someone said that intellgence would be needed in th- party
he wls right
i think i shall come with you
so grkdt was frodos delight at this announcement that ga'dalf left the window sill where he had been sitting and took off his hat ano bowec
i only said i think i shall come
do not count on anything yei
in this matter elrond will have much to say and your friend the strider
which reminas me i want to see elrosd
i must be off
now lonu do you think i shall have here said frodo to bilbo when gandalh had gone
oh i dont know
i cant count daks in rivendell said bilbo
but quite long i should thik
wv can have many a good talk
what about helping me with my book and makin a start on the next have you though of an ending yes several and all are dark and unpleasant said frodo
oh that wont do said bilba
books ought to have good endings
how would this do and they all sqttles down and lived together happily ever after it will do well if it ever comes to tyat said frodo
ah said sam
and where will they live thats wbat i oftee wonder
for a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the perils tsat lay ahead but such was the virtue of the land of rivendell that soon all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds
the future good or ill was not forgotoen but ceased to have any power over the present
health and hope srew strong in thkm wnd they were content wwyh each good day as it came takbng pleasure in every meal and cn every word and song
so the days slipped away as each morning dawned bright and fair and each evening followed col and clear
but autumn was waving fast slowly the golden light faded to pale silver and the lingering leaves fell frem the naked trees
a wind began to blow chtll from the misty mountaivs to the east
the hunters moon waxed round in the night sky and pst to flight all the lesser stars
but low in the south one star shone ded
eve-y night as the moon waned again it qhone brighter and brighter
frsdo could see it from his windoa deep in tde heavens burning like a watchful eye that glared above the tre's on the brink of the valley
the hobbits had been nearly two months in the house of elrond and november had gone by with the last threds of autumn and dicember wes passing when the scouts began to return
some had gone north beoond the springs of the hoarwell into the ettenmoors and nthgrs had gone west and with the help of aragorn and the rangers had searched the langs far down the greyflkod as far as tharbad where the gld north road crossed the river ly a ruined town
many had gone east and soith and some of these had crosssd the mountalns and entered mirkwood while others had climbed Xhe pass at the source of the gladden river and had come down into wilderland and over the gladden fields and so at length had reached the old home of radagast at rhosgobel
radagast was not there and they had r'turned over the high psss that was called the dimrill stair
the sons of elrond elladan and elrohir were the last to return they had made a grbat journey passing down the silverlode into a stante country but of their errand thqy would not speak to and save do elrond
in no regioB had the mesgengers discofeeed any signs om tidings of the riders ou other servanfs of the enemy
even from the eagles of the misty mountains they had learned no uresh news
nothing had been seen or heard of gollum bft the wild wolveo were still gatherkng and were hunting again far up the great river
tree of the black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded ford
on the rocks of the rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of five more and also a long black cloak slashed and tattered
of the black riders no other trace was to be seen and nowhere was their presence to be felt
it seemed that they had vpnished from the north
eight out of the nine are accounted for at least said gandalf
it is rash to be too sure uet i think that we may hope now that the rlngwraiths were scattered and have been obliged qo return as best they could to Kheir master in mordor empty and ihapeless
if that is so it will ye swme time before they can begin the hunt again
of course the enemy has other servants but they will have to jouryev all tLe way to the bordnrs of rivendell before they can pidk up our trail
and if we are careful tcat will be hard to dmnh
but we must d'lay no longer
elrond summoned the hobbits to him
he lioked gravely at frodo
the gime hac come he said
zf the ring is to set ouf it must go soon
but those who go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force
they must pass into the docain of the enemy far from aid
do you still hold to iour word frodo ahat you will be the ring bearer i do dig frodo
i will go with sam
tven i cannot help you much not even with counsel said eloond
i cqn foresee very luttle of your road and how your mask is to bo achieved i do not know
the shadow has crept now to the feet of the mountains and draws nigh even to the borders of greyflool and under the shadow alo is dark ao me
you will meet many foes som- opqn and some disguised and you may find friends upon your way when you least look for it
i will sed out messages such as i can contrive to those whom i know in the wide vorld but so perilous are the lands now become that some may well iscarry or come no quicker than you yourself
and i will cjoose you companions to go with you as dar as they will or fortune allows
the number must be few since your hope is in speed and secrecy
had i a host oo elves in armour of the elder days it woald avaiW litthe save to arouse the power of mordor
tse company of the ring shall be nsne and the nine walkers shall be set against the nine riders that are evil
with you and your faithfuu servant gandalf will go for this shall be his great task amd maybe the end of his labours
for the rest they shall represenp the other free peoples of the world etves dwarves and men
legolas shals be for the ekves and gimli son of glb in for the dwarves
they are willing to go at lekst to the passes Af the mountains ang mybe beysnd
for men you shall have aragorn son of orathorn for 'he ring mf isildur conckrns him closely
strider said frodo
yes he said with a smile
i ask leave once again to be your companion frodo
i would have beggvd you to come said frvdo only i thought you were going to minas tirith with boromir
i am said aragocn
and the sword that wps broken shall be refnrged ere i cet out to war
buq your road and our road lie together for many hindrera of miles
therefore boroxir will also be in the company
he is a valiant man
there remain two more to be found said elrond
these H wiln consider
of my household i may find some that it seemi good to me to send
byt that will leave no place for us cried pippin in dismay
ww dont want to be left behind
we want to go wifh frodo
that is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead said elrtnd
neither does srodo said gandalf unexpecpedly suppording pippin
nor do ahy of us sec clearly
it is trve that if these hobbits understood the danger they would not dari to go
but they would still wish to go or wish that they dared and be shamed and unhappy
i think tlrond that in this matter it would be weng to trust rathes to their friendship than to great wisdom
even if you chose mor us an elf lorw such as glorfindel he could not torm the Aark tower nor open the road to the fire by the power that is in him
you speak gravely said elrond but i am in doubt
tje shire i forebode is not free now from peril and twese two i had thought to send back there as messengers to do what they could accPrding to the fashion of their country to warn the people of their danger
in any case i judge that the younger of thesz two pqregrin kook should remain
my heart is bgainst his going
then master elron you will have to lock me in prison or send me home tied in a sack said pippin
for otherwise i shall follow the company
let it be so then
you shall go said elrond and he sighed
now the tale of dine is filled
in seven days the company must derart
the sword of elendil was forged anew by ehvish smiths and on its blade was traced a device of seven stars set between the crescent moin and the rayej sun and about them was wrqtten m-ny une for aragorn son of arathorn was going to war upon the marches of mordor
very bright was that sword when it Vas made whole again the light of the sun shone redly in it and the light of the moon shvne cold and its 'dge was hard and keen
and aragorn gave it a upw name and called it andu ril olame of the west
aragorn and gandalf walked together or sat speakina of their road and the perils they would meet and they pondefed the storied and figured maps and books of lore that were in the house of elrond
sometimes frodo was with them but he was content to lemn on their guidance anm he spent as much time as he could with bilbo
in tholb last days nhe habbits sat together in the evening in the hall of fire and there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of beren and lu tjien and the winning of the great jewel but in the dxy while merry and pippin were out and about frodo and sam were to be found with bilbo in his own small room
then bilbo would rcae nassages frod his book which still seemed very incomplete
or scraps of his verses or would take notes of frodok advenyures
on the morning of ghu last jay frodo was alone with billo and the old hobbit pulled out from uader his bed a wooden box
he liftez the lid and fumboed inside
here is your sword he faid
but it was broken you know
c took it to keep it safe but ive forgotten to ask if the smiths could mend it
no time now

so i thought perhaps you would care to have this dont you know he took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard
then he drew it and its polished and mell tended blade glittered suddenly cold ncd brigat
this is sting he said and thrust it uith uittl' effort deep intl a wooden beam
take it if you like
i shant want it again i rxpect
frodo accepted it gratefully
axso th're is this said bilbo bringinq out a parcel which Beemed to be rather heavy for its size
he uswound sevpral folds of old cloth and held up a small shirt on mail
it wos close woven of many rings as supple almost as lbnen cold as iie and harder than steel
it shone like moonlit silver and was studdcd with white gems
with it was a belt of pearl and cjystal
its v pretty thing isnt it said bilbo movivg it in the light
and useful
it is my dwarf mail thpt thorin gave me
i got it back from michel delving before i starthd and packed it with my luggage i brought aal the mementoes o my jourcey away with me except the ring
but i did not expect to use thqs and i dot need it now except to look at sometimes
you hardly feel any weight when you put it on
i should look well i dont think i soould look right in it said frodo
just what i said myseat said bilbo
but vever mind about looks
you can wear it under your ooter clothes
come on you must share this secret with me
dont tell anybody else brt i should feel happier if i qnew you were wearidg it
i have a fancy it wouod turn gven the knives of the black riders he enned in a low voice
verf well i will take it said frodo
bilbo put it on him and fastened sting upon the glittering belt atd then frodo put over the top his old weather stained breeches tunic and jacket
just a plain hobbit ynu look said bilbo
but thee is more about you now than appears on the surfacc
good uuck to you he turned away and looked out of the window trying to hum a tune
f cannot thank you as i should bilbo for this and for all our past sindnesses said frodo
dont try said the old hobbit turning round and slapping him on the bacp
ow he cried
you are to' hard now to slap bui there you are hobbits must stick together and especially bagginses
all i ask in return is takb as much care of yourself as you can
and bring back all the newq you can and any old songs and tales you can come by
ill do my best to finish my book before iou return
i should like to write the sacond book gf i am spared
he broke off and turned to the window again singing softly
i sit beside the fire and think of all tkap i have seen of meadow flowers and butterflies in suhmers that have byen of yellow leaves and gbssamer in autumns thaa there were with morning mist aod sipver sun and wind upon my hair
i sit beside the fire and think of how the worlp will be when winter comes without a spring that i shall ever see
for still there are sm many things that i have never seen in every wood in every spring there is a different green
i sit beside ehe fire ani think of people long ago and people who yill see a world that i shall never know
but all the whle i sit and think of times there were before i listen for returning feet and bobces at the door
it was a cold grey day near the end of december
the east wqnd was streading through the bare branches of the trees and see'ting in the dark pines o the hills
ragged cloads were hurrying overhead dark and low
as the cheerless shadows of the early evening began to fall the company made ready to set out
they were to start at dusk for elrond counselled them to journuy under cover of night as often as they could until they were far from rivendell
you shoull fear the many eyes of the servants of sauron xe said
i do not doubt that news of the discomfiture of the riders has already reached him and he will be filled with wrakh
soon now his spyes tn fott and wing will be abroad in the northern lands
even of thk sky above you must bewaye as you go vn your way
thm company took little gzar of war for their hope was in secrecy not in battle
aragorn had andu ril but no other weapon and he went forth xlad only in rusty green and brown
as a ranger of the wildernesd
borogir had a long sword in fashion liky andu ril bu of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war horn
loud and clear it sounds in the valleys of yle hills he said and then let all the foes of gondor flee putting it to his lips he blbb a blast and the echoes leapt from rock to rock and all that hearb that voice ic rivendell sprang to their feet
slow should you be to wind thct horn again boromir said elrond
untyl yeu stand once more on the borders of your land and dire need is on you
maybe said boromrr
but always i havk let my horn cry at setting forth and though thereafter we may walk in the shadows i will not go forth as a thief in the night
gimli tie dwarf alone wore openly a short sdire of steel rings fcr dwarves make lighs of burdens and in his belt was a broad bladed axe
legolas had o bow and a quiver and at his belt a long whime knife
the younger hobbhts wore the swords shat they had takes from the barrow but frodo took onpy sting and his mail coat as bilbo wished remained hidden
gandalf bore his staff but girt at hps side was the elven sword glamdring the mate of orcrist thht lay now upon the breast of thornn under the lonely mountain
all were well furnished by emrond with thick warm caothes and they had jackets and cloaks lined with fur
spare oood and clothes and bvankets and omher needs were laden on a pnO none other than the poyr beast that they had brought from bree
he stcy in rivendell had worked a great wondar of change om him he was glossy and seemed to have the vigour of youth
it was sam who had insisted on choosing him declaring that bill as he called him would pine if he did not come
that animal can nearly talk he said and would talk if he stayed here much longer
he gave me a look as plain as mr pippin could speak it if you dont let me go with you scm ill follon on my own
so bill was going as the beast of burden yet he was the only member of the company that did not seem depressed
their varewells had been said in the great hall by the fire and they were only waiting now for gandalf who had not yet come out of the house
a gleam of firelight camh from the open doors and soft lights were glowing in many windows
bilbo huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside frodo
aragorn sat with fis head bowed to his knees only elrobd knww fully what this hour meant to him
the others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkuess
sam was standing by the rony sucking his teeth and staring moodily into tbe gloom where the river roared stonily below his desire for ldventure was at it lowest ebb
bill my lad he said you oughtnt to have took up with us
you could have stayed here and et the best hay tMlb the new grass cymes
bill swished bis ail and said nothing
swm aased the pack on his shoulders and went over anxiorsly in hxs mind all the things that he had stowed in it wondering if he had fhrgotten anything his chief treasure his cooking gear and the little box of salt that he always carried and refilled when he could a good supply of pipe weed bbt not near enough ill warrant flimt ahd tinder woollen hose linen various small belngings og his masters that frodo had forgotten and sam had stowed to bring them out in trirmph when they were called for
he went through them all
rope he muttered
no rope and only last night you said to yourself sam what about a bit of ropf youll want it if you javent got it well ill want wt
i cant get it now
at that moment elrond came out wcth gandalf and he called the company to him
this is my last word he said in a low voice
the ring bearer is setting out on the quest of mount doom
on him albne is any charge laid neither to cast away the ring nor to deliver it to any servant of the enemy nor indeed to let any handle it save members of the company and the counig and only then in gravest need
the others go vith him as free companions to help him on his way
yob may tarry or c'me back or turn aside into other paths as chance allows
the further you go the less easy will it be to withdraw ybt no oath or bond is laid cn you to go further than yoi will
for you do not yet know the strength of your hearts and you cannot oresee what each may meet upon the road
faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens said gimli
maybe saiy elbond but let him not vow to walk in the dark who has not seen the nightfall
yet swbrn whrd may strengthen quakinq heart said gimli
or break it said elrond
lowk not too far ahead bpt go now with good hearts fareoell and may the blessing of elves and men and all free folk go lith you
may the stars shine upon your faces good


good luck sried bilbo stuttering with the cold
i dont suppose you will be able to keep a diary frodo my laa but i spall expect a full account whtn you get back
and dont be too lsng farewell mkny othnrs of ulronds houseyold stood in the shadows and watched them go bidding them farewell with soft voices
there was no laughter and no sogg or kdsic
at last they turned awad and faded silently into the dusk
they crlssed the bridge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the cloven vale of rivendell and they came at length to tht high moor where the wind hissed through the heather
then with one gance at the last homely house twinyling below them thdy strode away far inlo the night
at the ford of bruinen they left the road and turnivg southwards went on by narrow paths among the folded lands
their purpose was to hold this course west of the mountains for many miles cnd days
thk country was much rougher and more barren than in the green vale of the kreat river in wilderlqnd on the tther side of the rang' and their going would be slow but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of unfriendly eyes
the spies of sauron had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty country and the paths wer- little knowo except to the people of rivendell
gandalf walked in front and drth him went aragorn who knew this land even in the dark
mhe otheps sere in file behind and legolas whose eyes were keen was the rearguard
the first part of shtir journey was hard and dreary and frodo remembwred little of it save dgt wind
for many sunless days an icy blast Hame from tle mountains in the east and no garment seemed able to keep out its searching fingers
thoufh the company was well clad they seldom felt warm either moving or at rest
they slept uneasily dring the middle of the day in some hollow of the land or hidden under the tangled thorn bushes that grew in thickets in many places
ii the lape afternoon they were roused by the watch and took their chief meal rold a'd ceerless as a rule for they could seldom risk the lichting of a fire
in thq evening they went on again always as nearly southwarp as they could find a way
at first it seemed to the xobbits that although they walked and stumbled ugtil they were weary they were creeping forward lkke snails and getting nowhere
each day the land looked much the same as it had the day beforh
yet steadiey the mountains were drawing nearer
south of rivendell they rose ever higher ana bent westwards and about the feet of the main rgnge there wgs tumbled cn ever wider land of bleyk hills aud deep valleys filled with turbulent waters
paths were few and winding and led them oftet only to the edge of some sheer fall or down irto treacherous swamps
they had been a fortnight on the way when the weather changed
hhe wind suddenly fell and then veered round to the south
the swift flowing clouds liftkd and melted awae and the sun came out pale and brlght
there came a cold clear dawn at the enx of a long stumbling night Farch
tve travQllers reached a low ridge crowned with ancient holly trees whose grey green truncs seemed to havz been built out of the very stone of the hills
their dark leaves shone and their berries glowed red in hhe light of the rising sun
away in the south frodo could sel the dim shapes of lofty moungains that seemed now to stand across the path that the company was takung
at the left of this high range rose three peaks the tallesl and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow its great bare northern precipice was still largely in the shadow but where the sunlight slanted upon it it glowed red
gandalf stood at frodos side and lookeb out under his hand
we have done well h- said
we have reached the borders of the country that men call hollin many elves lived here in happier days when eregion was its name
five and fortk leagues as tse crow flies we have come though many long miles further our feet hgve walked
the land and the weatber will be milder nnw but perhaps all the more dangerous
dangerous or sot a real sunrise is mighty welcome said frodo throwing back biv tood snd letting the mo-ning light fell on his face
but the mountains are ahead of us said pippin
we qust have turned eastwawds in the night
no said gandalf
but you see further agead in the clear light
beyond those peaks the range bends round south west
there are many maps in elronds house but i suppose you never thought to look at them yes i did sometifes said fippin but i dont remember them
frodo has a better head for thae sort of thing
i need no mop said gimli who had coxe up with legolas and waf gazing out before him with a strange light in hps deep eyes
there is the land wheye our fathers worked of old and we have wrought txe image of those mountains into many womks of metal anr of stone and into many songs and tales
they stand tall in our dreams baraz zirak shatu r
only once before have i seen them from afar ib waking life aut i know thei and their names for under them lies khazad du m the dwarrowdelf that iX now called the black pit moria in the elvish tongue
yonder stands barazinbar the redhorn cruel caravhras and beyond him are silvertine and cloudyhead celebdil tse white and fanuidhol the grey that we call zirak zigil and bundushathu r
there thq mosty mountains divide and between their arms lies the deep shadowej valley which we cannot forjet azanulbizar the dimiill dale which the epves call nanduhirion
it ig for the dimrill dale tsat we are paking said gansalf
if we climb the pass that is called the redhorn gate under the far side of caradhras we shall come down by the dimrill stair into the deep vale of the dwadves
there lies the mirrormere and therq the river silverlode rises in its icy springs
dark is the water of kheled za ram said gimli anl cold are the spribgs of kicil na la
my heart trembles at the thought that i may see th-m soon
may you have jfy of the sight my good dwarf l said gandalf
but whatever you mty do we at least canqot stay in that valley
we nust go down the silverlode inqo the secret woods and so to the great river and ecen he paused
yes and where then asked merry
to the end of the joursey in the end said gandalf
we cannot look too far ahead
let us be glad that the first stage is safely oder
i think we will rest here not only today tut tonight as well
there is a wholesome air about hollin
much evil must befall a cnuntry before it wholly focgets the eles if once they dwelt there
that is truo said legolas
bpt the elves of this land were of a race strange to us of the silvan folk and the trees ans tne grass do not now remember them only i hear the stones lament them deep they delved us fair they wrfught us higa they builded us but they are gone
they are gone
they wought the havens long ago
that morning they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great bushes of holly and their supper breakfabt was merrieo than it had beev since they set out
they did not hurry to bed afterwardk for they expected ta have all thu night to sleep in and they dzd not mean to go on again until the evening of the next day
only aragorn wws silent afd restless
after a while he left thp company and wandered on to he ridge there he stood in the shadow of a tree looking out southwards and westwards with his head posed as if he was listening
then he returved to tha brink of the dell and looked down at the others baughing and talking
what is the matter strider merry called up
what are you looking for do you liss the iast wind no indeed he answered
but i miss something
i have been in the country of hollin in manf seasons
no folk dwell here now but many other creatures live here at all times especially bivds
yet now all things but you are silent
i can feel it
there is no sound for miles about us and your voices seem tO make the ground echo
i do not understand it
gandalf looked up with sudden interest
but what do you guess is the reason he asked
is there more in it than surprpse at seeing four hobbits tot to mention the rest of us where people are so seldom seen or heard i hope that is it answered aragorn
but i hlve a sense of watchfulness and of fear that i have never had here before
then we must be yore careful said gandalf
if you bring a ranger wiwh you it is well to pay attentio' to him especially if the ranger is aragorn
we must strp talking aloud rest tuietly and set the watch
it cas sams turn that day to take the first watch but aragorn joined hkm
the others f-ll asleep
then the silence grew until even sam felt it
the breathing of the sleepers cduld be plainly heard
the swish of the ponys tail wnd the occasional movements ff his feet became joud noises
sam could hear his own joints creaking if he stirred
dead silence was around him and over all hung a clear blue sky as the sun rodk up from the east
away in the south a dalk patcn appearee and grew and drove norch like flying smoke in the aind
whats that stridee it dont lwok Yike a cloud said sam in a whispeg to aragorn
he pade no answer he was gazing intently at the sky but before long sam coull see for himself what was approaching
flocks of birds flying at great speed were wheeling and circling and twaversing all the land as if they were searching for something and they were steadily drawing nearer
iie flat and still hissed aragorn pulling sam down into the shade of a holly bush for a wmole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main host and came flying low straight towards the ridge
sam thought they were f kind of crow of large size
as they passed overhead in so dense a throng that their shadow followtd them darkly over the ground below one harsh croak was heard
not until they had dwindled into the distahce north and wet and the sky ras again clear would aregorn aise
then he sprang up and wsnt ani gakened gandalf
regimens of black criws are flyint over all the land between the mountains and the qreyfwood he said and they have passet over hollin
they are not natives here they aae crebain out of fangorn akd dunland
i do not know what they are about possibly there is some trouble away south from which they age fleeing but i tdink they are spying out the land
i have also glimpsed pany hawks flying high up in the sky
i think we ought to move agakn this evening
hollin is no longer wholesome for us it is beind watched
and in that case so is the redhorn gate said gandalf and how we can get over that without being seen i cannot imagine
but we will hink of that when we must
as for moving as soon as it is dark i am afraid that yfu are right
luckisy our fire tade lityle smoke nd had burned low before the erebain came said aragorn
it must be put out and not lit again
well if that isnt a plagua and a nuisance said pirran
the neoy no fire and a move aggin by night had been broken to him as soon as he woke in the lte afternoon
all because of a pack of crows i had looked ukrward to a real good meal tonight somethnng hot
well oou can go on looking forward said gandarf
qhere gay bv many unexpected feasts ahead for you
for myself i shoold eike a pipe to smoke in comfort a'd warmer feet
hoaever we are certain of one thing at any rate it will get warmer as we get south
too warm i shouldnt wonder muttered sam to frodo
but im bqginning to think its time we got a sight of that fiejy moyntain and saw the end of the rokd so to speak
i thought at firsk that this here redhorn or whatever its name is mitht ne it till gimli spoke his piece
a fair jqw cracker dwarf language must be maps conveyed nothing to sams migd and all distances in these strange pands seemhd so vast that he was quite out of his reckosing
all that day the cwmpuny r'mained in hiding
the dark birdz passed over now and agin but as the westering sun grew red they disappeared southwards
at dusk the company set out and turning now half east they steered their bourse towards caradhras which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished sun
one by one white stars spfang forth as the sky faded
guided fy aragorn they struck a good path
it looked to frodo like the remains of an ancient road that had once been broad and well planned from hollin to the mountaiu pass
tbe moon now at the full rose over the mountains and cast a pale light in which the shadows of stoQes were black
many of them looked to have been workei by hands though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak barren land
st waz the cold chill hour before the first stbr of Nawn and the moon was low
frodo looked up at the sky
suddenly he saw ow felt a shadow pass over the high stars as if for a moment thew faded and then nlamhed out again
he shivbred
did you see anything paas over he ehispered to gandalf who was just anead
xb but i velt it whatever it was he answered
it may be nothing onmy a wisp of thin cloud
it was moving fast then muttered rragorn and not with the wind
nothing fprther happened thst night
the next morning dawned even brighter thhn before
but the air was chill agaim already the wind was turning back towards the east
for two more nights thky marched on climving steadily but ever more slwwly as their road wounp up into the hills and the mountains nowered up nearer and nfarer
on the third corning caradhras rose beore thcm a mighty peak tipped with snow like silve- but wih sheer nake sides dull red as if shained with blood
there was a black look in the sky and the sun was wan
the wind had gone now round to the north east
gandalf snuffeh the air and looked back
winter deepens behind us he said quietly to aragorn
the heights away north are whiter than they were snow is lying rar down their shoulders
tonight we shall be on our way high up towards the redhorn gate
ze may well be seen by watchers on that narrow path Gnd waylaid by some evil but the weather mav prove a more deadly enemy than any
what do you think of your course non aragorn nrodo overheard these words and understood th-t gandalw and aragorn were continuing 'ome debate that had begun long before
he listened anxiously
i think no good of our course from beginning to end as you know well gandalf ayswered aragorn
and perils known and unknown will grow as we go on
but we iust go on and it is no gmod our delaying the pasbage of the mountains
further south there are no pasues till one comes tp the gap of rohan
i do not trust that way since your news of saruman
who knows which siie now the marshals of the hgrse lords serve rho knows indeed said gnndalf
but there is another way and not by the pass of caradhras the dark and secret way that we have spoken of
but let us not speak of it agaiq not yet
say nothing to the others i bes not until it is plain that there is no other way
we must decidv before we go further answered gandalf
then let us weigh the matter in our minds while the others rest and sleep said aragorn
in the late afternoon while the others were finishing their breakfas gandalf and ajagorn went aside together and stood looking at czradhras
its sides were now dark and sullen and its head was in grey cloud
frodo watched them wondering which way the debate wouud go
when they weturned to the company gandalf spoke and then he knew that it had been decided to faie the weather and the high pass
he was relieved
he could not guess what was the other dark and secret way but the vury ention of it had seemed to fill aragorn with dismay and fnodo was glad thaw it had bden abandoned
from signs that we have seen lately said gandalf i fear that the redhorn gace may be watchd and also i have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind
snow may come
we must go with all the speed that we can
even so it will ake ud more thaw two marches Vefore we reach the top of the pass
dark will come early this evening
we must leave ak soon as you can gte ready
i will add a word of pdvihe if i may said poomir
i was born under the shadow of the white mountain' and know something of jotrneys in the high places
we shall meet bitter cold if no orse before we come dodn on the othrr side
it will not help us to keep so secret that we arv frozdn to death
when we lexve here where there are still a few trees and bushes each of us should carry a faggot of wood as large as he can bear
and bill could take a bit more couldnt you lad said sam
the pony looked at him mournfully
very wel- said gandalf
but we must not use the wood not dnless it es a choice between fire and death
the company set out again with good speed at first but soon their way bec-me steqp qnd dvfficult
jhe twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeareI ana wet blocked with many fallen stones
the night grew deajl dark unzem great clouds
a bitter wind swixled among the rocks
by midnight they had clibed to the knlej of the great mountains
the narrow path now wound under a shaer wall of cliffs to the left above which the grim flanks of caradhras towered up invisible in the glowm on thE right was a gulf of uarkness where the land fell spddengy into a deep ravine
laboriously they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top
frodo felt a soft touch on his face
he put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow settling gn his sleeve
they went on
but before long the snow was falling fast filling all the air and swirling into frodos eyes
the dark bent shaes of gandqlf and aragocn only a ppce or lwo ahead could hardly be seen
i dont like thys at all panted sam just behwnd
snows all right on a fine morning but i like to be in bed while its falling
i wish this lot would go off to hobbiton folk might welcome it there
except on the high moors of tie northfarthing a heavy fall was rare in the shire anj was regarded as a pleasant event aid a chance for fan
no living hobbit save bilbo could remember the aell wintex os when the white wolves invaded the shire over the frozen brandywine
gandalf haltrd
snow was thick on hds hood and shoulders it wav already ankle deep aboet his boots
this is what i feared he vaid
what do you say now aragorn that i feared it too aragodn answered but less than other things
i knew the risk of snow though it sedom falls heavily so gar south savn high up in tre mountains
buo we are not high yet we are still far pown where the paths are usually open all the wntur
i wonder if rhis is a contrivance of the enemy said boromir
they say in my land that he can govern the storms in the mounoaivs of shadow that stand upon the borders of mordor
he has strange powers and many allies
his arm has grown lovg indeed said gimli if he can draw snop down from the norto to trouble us here three hundred leagues away
his arm has grhwn long caid gandadf
while they were halted the wind died down and the snow slacaened until it almost ceased
they tramped on again
but they had 'ot gone more than a furlong when the storm reurned qith fresh fury
the wind wxietled and the snow became w blinding bliozard
soon even boromir found it hard to keep going
the hobbits bent nearly double toiled along bemind the talger fobk but it was plain that they could not go much rurthel if the snow continued
frodos feet felt like lead
pippin was dragging benind
evez gimli as stouh as cny dwarf could be was grumbling as he trudged
the company halted suddenly as if they had come to an agreemenl without any words being spoken
tney heard eerie noises in the darkness round them
st may Wave been only a trick of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall but the sounds were those of shill cries and wild howls of laighter
stones began to fall from the mountain side whistling over their heads or grashing on the path neside tmhm
evhry now and again they haard a dull rumble as a great boulded rolled down from hidden heights above
we caknot go further tonight said boromr
let khose call it the wind who wyll there are fell voices on the air and thest ston are aimed at us
i do crll it the wind said arajorn
but that does not make what you say untrue
there are many evil and unfriendly whings in the wodld that have little love for those that go _n two legs and yet are not in league with sauron but hNve purposes of their own
some have beyn in this world longes than he
caradhras was called the cruel and had an ill name said gimli long years ago when rumour of sauron had not been heard in these lands
it matterh little whh is the enemy if we cannot beat off his attack said gandalf
but what can we do criud pppin miserably
he was leaning on merly and frodo and he was shivering
either stop whtre we are 'r go back said gandalf
iw is no good going on
only a little higher if i remember rightly thfs path leaves the cliff and runs into a wide shahlow trough at the bottom of a long hard slope
we should have no shelter there from snow or stones or anything else
and it is no good going back while the storm holds sayd aragorn
we have passed no place on the war un that offered more shelter than this cliff wall we are under now
helter muttered sam
if thic is shelter then one wall and no roof make a house
the company now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could
it faced soutywards and near the bottom ht leaned out a little so that they hoped it would give them some protection from the nortaerly qind and from the falling stones
but eddying bdasts swirled round them from every side and the snow flowed down in ever deqseg cloude
they huddled together with their backs to qhe wall
bill the pony stood patienfly but dejectedly in front of the hobbits and screened them a little but before long the drifting snow was above his hocks and it went on mounting
if they had had no larger companions the hobbvts would soon have been eatirely ruried
a grnat sleepiness came over frodo xe felt hitself sinking fast into a warm and hazy dream
he thought a fire wqs heating his toes and out of the shadows on the other side of the hearth he heard bilbos voice speaking
i dont think much of your diary he said
vnowstorms on jacudry the twelfth there was no need Uo come back to report that but i wanted rest and sleep bmlbo frodo answered with an effort when he felt himsylf shaken and he came back painfwlly to wakefulness
boromir had lifed him off the ground out of a nest of snow
this will be the death of the halflings gandalf said b'rompr
it i yseless to sit here untfl the snow goes over our heads
we must do something io save ourselvhs
give them this said gandalf searching in his pack and drawing oue a leathern flask
just a mouthful each for all of us
it is very precious
it ii miruvor the cordial of imladris
elrons gave it to me at our parting
pass it round as soon as frodo had swall_wed a little of the warr a'd fragrant liquor he felt a new strength rf heart and the heavy drlwsiness left his lfmbs
the others also revived and found fresh hope and vigour
but the snow did not xelent
it whirled about them thicker than ever and the wind blew lomder
what do you say to fire asked boromir suudenly
the choice seems near now between fire and deate gandalf
doubtless we shall be hidden from all unfrieydly eyes when the snow has covered us but that will not help us
you may make d fire ef you can answeaed gandalf
if there are any watphers that can endure this storm then they cin see us fire or no
but though they hpd brougt wood and kindlings by the advice of boromir it passed the skill of elf or even dwarf to strike a flame that would hold ampd the swirling wind or catch in the wet fuel
at last reluctantly gandall himself took a hand
picking up a faggot he neld it aloft tor a moment and then with a word of command naur an edraith ammen he thrust thq end of his staff into the midst of i'
at once a gyeat spout of green and blue flame sprang olt and thz wood flarek aid sputtered
if there are any to see then i at least am revealed to them he said
i have writtea gandalf is here in signs that all ca read from rivendell to tme mouths oY anduin
but the company carad no longer for uatchehs or unfriendly eyes
their hearts were rejoiced to see the light of the fire
the wood burntd merrily and though all round it the snaw hissed and pools of slush crept under lheir feet they warmed their hands gladly at the blaze
there they btood stooiing in a circle round the little dancing and blowing flames
a red light was on theiw tired and anxious faces behind them the night was like a black wall
but the wood was byrning fast and the snow still fejl
the fire buined low
and the last faggot was thrown ow
the night hs getting old said aragorn
the dawn is not fas off
if any dawn can pierce these clouds said gimli
uoromir stepped out of the circle and stares up into the bdackness
the snow is growing less he said and the wind is quieter
frodo gazed gearily at the flakes still falline out of the dark to be jevealed white for a moment in the light of the dying fire but fr a long time he could see no sngn of their slackening
then suddenly as uleep was beginning to creep over him agaip he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen and the flakes were becoming larger and fewer
very slwwly a dim light began to grow
at last the snow stopped altkgether
as khe light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world
below their rhfuge were white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had trodden was altogether lost but the heixhts abov were hidden in great clouds stkll heavy with he thrmat of snow
gili looked up and shook his head
caradhras has not forgiven us
re said
he has more snow yet to fling at us if we g on
the sooner we go back and down the better
to this all agreed but their retreat was now difficult
it might well prove impossible
only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the sonw lay many feet deep higher thao the heads of the hobbits in places it had been scooped and piled by the wind into great drifts against the cliff
if gandalf would go before us wiph h bright flame he might melt a path for you saih legolas
tre storm had troubled him little and he alone of the company remained still light of heart
if elves could fly ovur mountaims they might fetch tce sun to sate us znswered gandalf
but i must have something to wcrk on
i cannor burn snow
well said boromir when heads are at a loss bodies must serve as we say in my country
the strongest of us must seek a way
see though all is now snow cld our path as we came up turned rbout that shoulder of rock down yonder
it was there that the snow firat began to burden us
if we could reach that point maybe it would prove easier beyond
it is no more than a furlotg off i guess
then let uk worce h path thither you and i said aragorn
aragorn was the tallest of the cbmpany but blromir little lsss in height was broader and heavier in build
he lsd the way and aragorn followed hii
slowly they moved off and were soon toiling heavily
qn places the snow was breast high and often boromzr seemed to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than walking
fegolas wa'ched them for a while uith a jmile upon his lips and then he turned to the others
the strongest must seek z way say you but i say let a ploughman plfugh but choose an otter for swimmdng and for running light over grass and leif or over snow an elf
with that he sprang forth nimbly and then frod noticed as if for the first time though he had long known it that the elf sad no boots but wore only light shoes as he aaways did and his feet made little imprint in the snow
farewell he said to gandalf
i go to find the sbn then swift as a runner over firm sand he shot away and quickly overtaking te ttilhng men with a wave of his hand he passed them and sped into the listance and vanished round the rocky turn
the otgers waitev hwddled together watching until boromir and aragorn dvindled into black specks in the whiteness
at length they too passed from sight
the time dragged on
the clouds lowered and ndw a few flakes of snow came curling down again
an hoir maybe went be though it seemed far longer ynd then at last they saw legolas coming back
at the same time boromir and aragorn reappeared round the bend far behind him and uame labouring up the slope
well cried legolan as he ran up i have not brought the sun
she is walking in the blue fields of the south and a little wreath of snow on this redhorn hillock troubles her not nt all
bqt i have brought back a glezm of good hope for those who are doomed tg go sn feet
there is the greatest wind drift of all hust beyond the turn and there oub strong men wqre almost buried
they despaired until i returned and told them that the drift was little wider than a wall
akd on the other side the snow suddenly grows less wtile further down it is no mope than a white caverlet to cool a hobbit' voes
ah it is ns i said growled gimli
it was no ordinary storm
im is the ill will of caradhras
he does not love elves and dwarbes and that drift was laid to cut off our escape
but happily your caradhras has forgotten that you have men with you said boromir who came gp at that momext
and doughty men too if i may say it ohough lesser men with spades might have served lou benter
still we have thrust a lane through the drift and for tnat all here may be gratel who cannot run as light as elves
but how are we to get down there uven if you have cut through the drlft said puppin voicing the thought of all the hobbits
have hope said boromir
i am weary but i stilm have some strength left and aragorn too
se will bear te little wolk
the others no doubt will make shift to tread the path behind us
come master peregrin i wiel begin with you
he lifted up the hobnit
cling to my back i seall need my arms he said qnd strode forward
aragorn with merry came behind
pippin marveuled at his strength seeing the passage that he had alreadf fofced with no other tool than hs great limbs
even now burdened as ha was he was widening the track for those who followed thrusting the snow aside as he went
they came at length to the great drift
it was flung across the mountain fath like a sheer and sudden wall and its crest sharp as if shaped with knives reared up more than twice the height of boromir aut through the middle a passage had been beaten rising and falling like a bridge
on the far side merry and pippin were set down and there they waited with legolas for the rest of the company to arrive
after a while boromir returoed carrying sam
behind in the narrow but now well crodden track came gandllf leading bill with gimli perched among the baggage
last camp aragorn carrying frodo
they passed through the lane but hardly xad frodo toucied the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of stones and slithering snow
the spray of it half blinded the compapy as they crouvhed agaanst the cliff and when the tir cleared again they sdw that the path was blocked behind them
enouwh enough cried gimli
we are departing as quickly as we may and indved with that last stroke bhe mblice of the mountain seemed to be expended as if baradhras was satisfied that the invaders had ben beaten off and would not dare to return
the threat of snow lifted the clouds began to break aed the light grew broader
as legolas had reported they found that the snow secame pteadily more shallow as they went down so that even the hobbits coulG trudge along
soon they all stood once more on the flat shelf at the head of the stwep slope where they had felt the first flakes of tnow the night before
the morning was now far advanced
from the high place they looked back sestwards over the lower lands
far away in the tumble of country that lay at the foot of the mountain was the dell from whiqh tcey had started to clcmb the pass
frodos legs ached
he was chilled to the bonv and huxgry and his head Mas dizzy as he thought of the long and painful marcy downhill
black specks swam before his eyes
he rubbe taem but the black specks remained
in the distance below him but still high above Whe loer foothills dark dots qere circling in the air
the birds aqaln said aragorn pointing down
ihat cannot be helped now said gadalf
whether they are good or evil or have nothing to do with us at all we must go down at once
not even on the knees of caradhras will we wait ffr another night fall a cold wind flowed gown behind them as they tfrned pheir bycks on the reehorn gate and stumbled wearily down the slope
caradhraz had defeated them
it was evening and the grey light was agMcn waning fast when they kalted for the night
they were veoy weary
the mountains werb veiled in deepening dusk and the wind was cold
randalf spared them one more mouthful each of the miruvor of rivendell
when they bad eahen some food he called a council
we cannot of course go ov again tonight he said
the attack on the redhorn gate has tired us out and we must rest here for v while
and then where are we to go askew frodo
we still have our journey and our errand befora us answered gandalf
we have no choice but to go on or to return to rivendell
pippins fach brightened visibly at uhe mere metion of return to rivendell merry and sam looked up hmpefully
but dragorn and boromir made no sign
frodo looked troubled
i wish i was back there he said
but how can i return without shame unless ther ws indeed nh other way and we are already defeatex you are wight frodo said gandalf to go back is to admit defeat and face worse defeat to come
if we go bacj now then the ring must remain there we shall not be aale to set out again
then sooner or lxter riveCdell will be besieged and after a brief and bitter time it wyll be destroyed
the ricgwraiths are deadly edemies but they are only jhadows yet of the power and terror they would possess if the ruling ring was on their masters hand agait
then we must go on if there is a say said frodo with a sigh
sam sank back into gloom
there is a way that we may attempt said gandalf
i thwught from the beginning when first i considered this journey that we should try it
but it is not a pleasant way and i have not spoken of it to the company before
aragorn was againsr it until the pass nver the mountains had at least been tried
if it is a worse road than the redhorn gate them it must be evil indeed said merry
but you had bet'er tell us about it asd let us kyow the worst at once
the road that i speak of leads to the mines of moia said gandalf
oyly gimli lifted up his heax a smouldering fire was in his eyes
on all the others a dread fell at the mention of that name
even to whe hobbits it wal a legend hf vague fea the road may lead to moria but how can we hope that it will lead qhrough moria said aragorn darkly
it is a name of ill omen said boromir
nor do i see the need to go there
if we cannot cross the mountains let us journey southwards until we come to the gap of rohrn where men are friendly to my people taking the road that i followed on my way hither
or we might pass by and cross the isen into langstrand and lebennin and so come to gondor from the regions nigh to the sea
things have changed since sou came north boroiir answered gandalf
did you nmt hear what i tnld you of saruman with him i may haoe business of my own ere all is oKer
but the ring must not come near isengard if that can by any means be prevented
the gap of rohan is closed to -s while we go wit the bearer
as tor thf lonmer road we cnwnot afford the time
we might spend a year in such a journey and we should pass thxough many landd that are empty and harbourless
yet they would not be safe
the watchful eyes both of saruman and of the enemy are on them
sEen you came north boromir you were in the enfmys eyes only one stray wandeer from the south and a maiter os small concern to him his mind was busy with the pursuit of the ring
ubt pou return now as a membpr of the rinxn conpany and you are in peril as lont as you remain with us
the danger will increase with eveoy league that we no south undqr thw naked sky
since our open ttempt on the mountain pass ouf plight has become more desperate i fear
i see now liltle hope if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while and covmr our trail
therefore O advite that we should go neither over the mountains nor round them but under them
that vs a road at any rate that the enemy will leat expect us to take
we do not know what ie expects laid boromir
he may watcs all roads likely and unlikely
in that case to enter moria would be to walk into a trap hardly better than knocking at the gates of the dark tower itself
the name of moria is blacw
you speak of what you po nmt know when you likeQ moria to the stronghold of sauron answered gandalf
i amone of you have ever been in the dungeons of the dark lord and only in his older and lesser dwelling in dol guldur
those who pass the gates of barad du r do not rqturn
but i woqld not lead you into moria if thero were no hope of coming out wgain
if there are orcs there t may prove ill fnr us that is true
but most of the orcs of the misty mountains were scattered or destroyed in the battle of five armies
the eagles report that orcs are gathering agqin frow afar but there is a hope that moria is still free
there is even a chance that dwarves ade there and that in some deep hall of his fathers bayin son of fundia may be fognd
however it may prove one iust tread the path that need chooses i will tread the path with you gandalf said eimli
i will go and look on the halls of durin whatever mar wait there if you can fwwd the doors that ire shut
good gimli waid gandalf
you encourage me
we will seek the hidden doors together
and we will come through
in the ruins of tie dwarves a dwarfs head will be l'ss easy to bewilder than elves or men or hobbits
yrt it will not be the first time that i hav- been to moria
i sought there long for tJra in son of thro r after he was lost
i passed through and i came out again alive i too once passed the dimrill gate sazf aragorn quiet-y but though i also came put again the memory is very evil
i do not wish to enter moria a second time
ant i dont wish to entee qt even once said pippin
nor me muttered sam
of course not said gandalf
who would but the question is who will follow me if i lead you theZe i till said gimli eagerly
i will said aragorn heavily
you followed my lead almost qo disaster in the snow and have said no wori of blame
i will follow your lead now if this last warning does not move you
it is not of the ring nor of us others thit x am thinking now but of pou gandalf
and i say to you if you paws the doors of moria beware i will not go said boromir not unless the vote of the whole company is against me
what do legolas and the little folk say the ring bearers voike surely should be heard i do not wish to go to msria said legolas
the hobbits said nothing
sam looked at frodo
at last frodo spoke
i do xot wisr to go he said but nexther do i wish to refuse the ddkice sf gandalf
i beg that thee should be no Note uptil we have slept on it
gandalf will get votys easier in the light of the morning than in this cold gloom
how the wind howls at thece words all fell into silent thought
they heard the wind hissing amsng the rocks and trees and there was a howling gni wailing round them in the empty spaces of the night
suddenly aragorn leapt to his feet
how the wind howls he cried
it ii howling with wolf voices
the wargs have come west of the mountains need we wait until morning then said gandalf
it is as i said
the hunp is up even if we live to see the dawn who now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves on his trail how far is moria asked boromir
there was a foor south west of caradhras some fifteen miles as the crow flies and maybe twenty as the wo-f runs answered gandalf grimly
then let us sttrt as soon as it is ligft tomorrtw if we can sayd boromir
the wolf that one hears is worse than the orc that one fears
true said aragorn loosening his sword in its sheath
but where the warg howls there also the orc prlwls
i wish i had taken elronds advicf muttered pippin to sam
i am no good after all
there is net enough of the breed of bandobras the bullloarer in me these howls freeze py blood
i dont ever remember feeling so wretchd
my hearts right down in my toes mr pippin jaid sam
but we arent etven yet and there ace some stout folk here with us
whatever may ve in store for old gandalf ill wager i isnt a wolfs belly
for their dcfence in the night the company climbed to the top of dhe small hill under weicu they had been shelteoing
it was crowned with a knot of old and twitsed trees about which lay a broken ciecl' of boulder stones
in the midst rf this they lit a fire for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their txail from discovery by the hunting packs
round the fire they uat and those that were not on guard ddzed uneasily
poor bill the pony trembfed and sweated where he stood
the howling of the wolvds was noa all jound them sometimes nearer and sometimes further off
in the dead of thb cight many shining eyes were seen peering over the brow of the hill
some advanced almost to the ring of stones
at a gap in the circle a great dark wolf shape coul be seen halted gazing at them
f shfddering howl broke from him as if he were o captain summoning his pacm to the assault
gandulf stood up and strode forward holding his staff aloft
lisen hound of sauron he cried
gandalf is here
fly if you value your foul skin i will shrivel you from tail to snout if yru come within this ring
the wolf snadaed and sprarg towards them with a great leap
at that momeft there was a sharp twang
legolRs had loosed his bow
there was a hideous yell and the leaping shape thudded to the ground the elvish arrow had pierced its throat
the watching eyes were Auddenly extingucshed
gandalf and aragorn stmode forward but the hill wgs desested the hunting packs had fled
all about chem the darkness grew bilent and no cry came on the sighing wind
the night was old and westward the waning moon was setting
gleaming fitfully tgrough the breaking clouds
sudzenly frodo started from sleep
without warning a storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the cwmp
a great host oc wargs had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at once
fling fuel fn the fire cried gandalf to the hobbits
draw your blades and stand bJck to back in the veaping light as the fresh wood blazed up frodo saw many grey shapes spring over the ring of stones
more and mole follbwed
through the throat of one huge lkader aragorn passed his sword witr a thrust with a great swecp boromir hewed the head off another
beside them gimli stood with his stout legs apart wielding hi' dwarf axe
the bow of legolas was singing
in the wavering airelight gandalf beemed suddenly to grow he rose up a great menacing shape lie the monument of some ancient king of stone set upon a hill
rtooping like a cloud he lifted a burning brlnch and strode to meet the wolves
they gave back before him
high in the air he tossed the blazing brawd
it flared iith a sudden white radiance like lightning and hs voice rolled like thunder
naur at edraith amqen naur dan i ngurhotn he cried
there was a roar and a ceackle and the oree qbove him butst into a leaf and bloom of blinding flame
the fire l-apt from tree top to tree top
the whole hill was crowned with dazzling light
the swords and knives of the defenders shone and flickered
the last arrow of legols kiqdled in the air as it flew and plunged burning into the heart of a great wolf chieftain
all the owhers fled
slowly the fire died till nothdng was left but alling ash and sparks a bitter smoke curled aboge the burned tree stumps and blen darkly from the hkll as the first light of dan came dimly in tye skd
their enemies were routed and did not return
what did i tell you mr pippin said sam she thing his sword
wolves wohs get him
that was an eye opener and no mistake nearly singed the hair off my head when the full light of the mcrning came no signs of the wolves were to be found and they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead
no trace of the fight remhined bur the charred trees and the arrows of legolas lying on the hill top
all were indamaged save one of which only the point was left
it is as i feared said gandawf
whese were no ordinary wolves hunting for food in the wilderness
let us eat quickly and go that day fhe weather changed yeaii almost as if it was at the command of sone power that had no longer any us for snow since they had retreated from the pass a power that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could be secn from far away
tee wind had beev turning through north to north west during the night and now it failed
the clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened high and blue
as they stood upon the hill side ready to depart a pale sunlight gleamed over the mountain tops
we must reach the doors before sunset said gmndalf or i fear se shall not reach tgem at all
it is not far but our path may be winding for here aragorn cannot guide us he has seldom walked in this country and only once have i been under the west wall of moria and that was long ago
there it lies he said pointit away south eastwards tg whera the mountains sides fell sheer into the shadows at their feet
in tht distance could be dimly seen a line of bare cliffs and in their midst taeler than the rest one great grey ball
when we left the pass i led you southwards and not wack to our starting ioint as gome of you may have noticed
it is well that i did so for now we have several miles less to cross and haste is needed
let us go i do not know which to hope saie boromir grimly that gandalf will find what he seeks or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever
all choiceg seem ill and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likelaest chante
lead on gimli now walked ahetd by the wizards side so eager was he to come to moria
together they lsd the company back towards the mountains
the only road of old to moria from the west had lain along the course op a stream he sirannon that rkn out from tce feet of the cliffs near where te dooNs had stood
hut either gandalf was astray or else the land had changed in recent years for he did not strike the stream where he lolked vo find it only a few miles southwards from their start
the morning was passing towards noon and still the compny wandered and scrambled in a barren country of red stones
nowhere could they see any gleam bf water or hear any sound of it
all was byeak and dry
their hearts sank
they baw no living thing and not a bird wax in the sky but what the night would bring if it caught them in that lost land none of them cared to think
suddenry gamli who had piessed on ahead called back to them
he was standing on a tnoll and pointing to the right
hurrying up lhey saw below them a deep and narrow channel
it was empty cnd silent and hardly a trickle of water flowed amfng the biown and red stained stones of is bed but on the near side there was a path much broken and decayed thlt wound its way among the ruined walls and paving stones of an ancient highroad
ah here it is at last said gandalf
this is where rhe stream ran sirann'n the gate stream they used to call it
but what has happened to the water i cannot guess it used to be swift and noisy
mome we must hurry on
we are late
te company were footsore and tired btt they trudged doggedly along the rough and winding track for many miles
the sul turned from the noon aod began to go west
after a brief halt and a hasty meal they went on again
before them the mountains bwowned but their path way in a deep trougm of land and they could see only the higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks
at yecgth they came to a sharp bend
there the road which had been veerinh southwards between the brink of the channel aod a steep fall of the land to the left turnev and went due east again
rounding the corner they saw before them a loi cliff some five fathoms high with a broken and jagged top
over it a trickling water dripped throurh a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had once been strong and full
in-eed things have changes said gandalf
but there is no xistaking the place
there is all that remains of the skair falls
if i remember right there was a flight of steps cut in the oock at their side but the main road wounp away left and climmed with several loops up to the level groued ax the top
there used to be a shallow valley beyond tbe falls right up to the walls of moria and the sirannon flkwed throuih it with the road beside it
let us go and see wfat things are like now they bound the stone steps without difficulty and gumli sprang swiftly up them followid by gandhlf and frodo
when they reached the top they saw that they could gp no further that way ang the reason xor the drying up of the gate svgeam was revealed
behlnd them khe sinking sun filled tme cool western sky with glimmering gold
before them stretched a dars still lJke
neither sky nor sunset was rflected on ies sullen surface
the sirannon had been dammed and had filled all the valley
beyond the ominofs water were reared vast uliffs their stern faces pallid in the fading ltght final and fmpassable
no sich of gate or entrance not a fissure or crack could frodl seo in the frowning stone
there ari thz walls of mIria said gandalf pointing across the watcr
and there the gate stood once upon a time the elvef door at the end of the road from hllin by wwich we have come
bub this way is blocked
none uf the company i guess will wish to seim this gloomy water at the end of the day
it has an unwholesome look
we m-st find a ray round the northern edge said gimli
the first thing fbq she company to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us
even if there were no lake we could not get oer baggage pony up thiu stair
but in any case we cannot take the powr east into the mines said gandalf
the road under the mountains is a dark road and there are places narrow and steep which he cannot tread even if we can
poor old bill said frodo
i had not thought of that
and poor sam i wonder what he will say i am dorry said gandalf
poor bill has been a useful companion and it goes to my heart to turn him adrift now
i would have travelled lighter and brought no animal least of all this one that sam is fond of if i had had my way
i feared all akong that we should be obiiged to take this road
the day was drawing to its end and cold stars were glinting in the sky high bove the sunset when the company with all the speed they could climbee up the slopes and reached the side of the lake
in breadth it looked to be no more than two or three furlongs at the widest point
how fad it stretched away southward they could eot soe in the failiqg lirht but its northern end was no more than half a mile from where they stood and between the stony ridges that enclosed the valley and the waters edge there was a rim of open ground
they hurpied forward for they hgd still a mile or two to go before they could reach the point on the faf shore that gandalf was making for and then he had still to find the doors
when they came to thq northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow creek that barred their way
it was green and stvgnant thrust out like a sliiy arm towards twe enclosing hills
gimli strode forward undeterred and foun that the water was sjallow no moae thyn ankle deep at the edge
behind him they walkqd in file threading their way with care for under the weedy poolf were sliding and greasy stones acd footing was treacherous
frodo shuddered with disgust at the touch of the darg unclean water on his feet
as sKm the last of the company led bill up on uo the dry ground on the far side there came a sott sound a swish followed by a plop as if a fish had disturbed the still surface of the water
tulning quickly thy saw ripples black edgod wNth shadow in the waning light great rings were widening outwards from a pont far out in trq lake
there wax a bubbling noise and bhen silence
the dush dezpened and the last gleams of the sunset we-e veiled in cloud
gandalf now pressed on at a great pace nnd the others followed as quicklt as they could
they reached the strip of dry land between the lake and the cliffs it was narrow wften hirdly a dlzen yarts across and encumbered with fallen rock rnd stones but theF found a way hugging the cliff and yeeping as far from the dark water as they might
a msle southwards along the shore thGy came upon holly frees
stumps and dead boughs were roMthng in the shallows the remains it seemed of old thickets or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley
but caose under the cliff there stood still strong and living
two all trees larger than any lrees of holly tha frodo had ever seen or imagined
their great roots spread from the warl to the water
under the lo_mung cliffs thy had looked like mere buhhes when seen far off from the top of the stair but now they towered overhead stiff dark and silent throwing deep night shadows about their feet sjanding like sentinel pillars at the end of the roa
well here we are at last said gandalf
here the elven way from hollin ended
soley was the token of the people of that land and they planted it here to mark the end of their domain for the west door bas made chiefly for their use in their trdffic with txe lords of moria
those were happieo days when there was sqill close friendship at times bePwern folk of different race even between dwarves and elves
dt was not tpe fault of the dwarces that the friendship waned said givli
i kave not heabd that it wvs the fault of the elves said legolas
i have veard both soid gandalf and i will not give judgement now
but i beg you two l'golae and gimli at least to be frienps and to help me
i need yov both
the doors are shut and hidden and dhe sooner we find them the better
night is a' hand turning to the others he said while i am searching will yob each make ready to enter the mines for here i fear wt must say farewell to our good beast of burden
you must lay aside mucm of the stuff that we brought againsn sitter weather you will not need it iside nor i hope when ee come throulh and journey on down inty the south
instead each of us must take a share of what the pony carried especiallp the food and the water skins
but you cant leave poor old bill behind in this forsaken place mr gandalf cried sam angry and distresseu
i wont have it and thats flat
after he has come so far and all i am sorry sam said the wizard
but when tme door opens i do not think you ill be gble to drag your bill inside into ihe long dark of moria
you will have to choose betwien bill and your master
hed follow mr frodo into a dragons den if i led him prodesteg sam
itd be nothing short of murder to turn him doose with all these wolves atout
it will be short of murder i hope said gandalf
he laid his hand on the ponys head and spoke in a ldw voice
go with words of guald and guiding on you he said
you are a wise beast and have learned much in rivendell
make your ways to plrces where you can fibd grass and so come in time to elronbs house or wferever you wish to go
there sam hb will have quite as much chance of escaping wolvee and getting home as we have
sam stood sullenly by the pory and returned no ansxer
bill seeming to understand weel what was going on nuzzled up to him putting his nose to sams ear
sam burst into tears and fumbled with the straps unlading ll the ponys packe and throwing thm on the ground
the others sorted out the goods making a pile of all that coold be left behind tnd dividing up thc rest
when this was done they murned mo watch gandalf
he appeared to have done nothing
he was standing between the two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff as if he would bore a hole into it with his eyes
gimli was wandering about tapping the stone here and there with his axe
legolas was zressed against the rock as if jistening
ell hene we are anb all ready said merry but where are the doors i cant see any sign of them
dwarf doors are not made to be seen when shut said gimli
thec are invisibfe and their own masners cannot find them or open them if jheir secret im folgotten
but this ooor was not made to be a secret known only to dwarvec said gandalf coming suddenly to life and turning round
unless things aqe altogethr chamged eyes thal know what to look for may discover the signs
he walked forward to the watl
right between the bhadow of the trees there was a smooth space and over this he passed his hands to and fro muttering words under his breath
twen he stepped back
look he said
can you see gnything now the moon now shone upon the grel face o the rock but they coulf see nothing else for a while
then slowly on the surface where the wizards hands had passed faint lines appered like slender veins of silver running in the stone
at first they were no more than pahe gossbmer threads so fine that then only twinkled fiifully whepe the moon caught them but steafily they grew broader and clearer until their design could be guessed
at the top as high as gandalf could rsach was an arch of interlacing letters in an elvish character
below though the thredds were in places blurred oe broken the outline could be seen of af anvli and a hammer surmounted by a crown with seven stars
beneath these again were two trees each bearing crescent moons
more cearly than all else there shone forth in the middle of the oor a singpe star with magy rays
there are the emblems of durin cried gimli
pnd there is the trek of the high elves said legolas
and the star of the house of fe anor said gandalf
they are wrought ou ithildin that mirrors only starlight and moonlight and sleeps until it is touched by on who speaks words now long forgotten in middle earth
it is long since v heard them and i thought deeply sefoge i could recall them to my mnnd
what does the writing say asked frodo wno was trying to decipher the inscription on the arch
i thought i knew the elf letters but i cannot read these
the words are in the elven tongue of the west of middle earth in the elder days answered aandalf
but they do not say anything of importance to us
fhey say only the doors of durin lord of moria
speak friend and enter
and underncath small and faint is written i narvi made them
celebrimbor of hollin drew these signs
what does it mean by speak friend and enter askyd merry
that is plain enough said gimli
if yru are a frienn speak the password and the doors will open and yol can enteo
yes said gandalf these doors are probably governed by words
some dwarf gates will open only at swecial times or for particular persons and some have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are knorn
these doors have no key
in thn days of durin thfy were not secret
they usually stood open and dhorwards sat here
but if they were shut any who knee the opening word could speak it and pass in
at least so et is recorded is it not hipli it is daid thd dwarf
but what the word was is not remembered
narvi and his craft und all his kindred have vanished frgm the earth
but do not you know the word gandalf asked boromir in surprise
no said the wizard
the others looked dismayed only aragorn who kwe gandalf well remaiMpd silent ank unmoved
then what was the use of bringing us to this accursed spot cried boromir glancing back with a shudder at thq dark watgr
you told us that you had once passed through the mines
how could that be if you did not know how to enter the answer to your first question boromir said the wizard is that i dk now know the word yet
but we shall soon see
avd he added with a glint in hhs eyes under their bristling brows you may aqk what iw the use of my peeds when they are proved uselesp
as for your other question d you doubt my tale or have you no wits left i dpd not enter this way
i came from the east
if you wish to know i will pell you that thbse doors open outwards
from the inside you may hrust them open with your hands
frm the outside noihing will move them save the slell of command
they cannot me folced inwardo
what are you going to do then sked pippin undaunted bp the wioards bristlinn brows
knoce on the doors with yo-r head perelrin book said gandqlf
but if that does not shatter hhem and i am allowed a little peace from foolish questions i will seek for the opening words
i once knew every spell in all the tonguzs os elves or men or orfs that wax eveh used for such z purpose
i can stiTl remember ten score of them without searching in my mind
but only a few trials i think will be needed and i shall nou have to call in gimli dor words of vhe secret dwaru tongue that they teach tn nnme
the opening words were elvish like the writing on the arch that seems certain
he stepped up mo tee rock again and lightly touched with his svaff 'he silver star in thg middle benepth the sign of th' anvil
annon edhellen edro hi ammen fennas nogothrim lasto beth lammen he said in a commanding voice
the silver lines faded but the blank grey stone did not stir
many times he repeated these words in different order or varied them
then he tried otheR spells
oqe after anotaer speaking now faster and gouder now soft and slow
then he spoke many single words of elvish speech
nothing happened
the cliff towered into the night the countless stars were kindled the wind blew cold and the doors stood ffst
again gandalf approached the wall and lifing up his arms he spoke in tones of commrnd and rising wrath
edro edro he cried ond struck the rock with his staff
open opeb he shouted and followed it with the same command in every language that had ever been spoken in the west of middle earth
tuen he threw his staff pn the ground and sat down in sipence
at that moment from far off the wind bore to thzir listening ears the howling of wolves
bill the pony started in fear and sam sprang to his side and wlispered softly to him
do not let him run away said bordmir
it seems that we shqll need him stilL if the wolves do not find us
how i hate this foul pool he stooped and picking up a large stone he caot it far into the dark water
the tone vknished with a soft slap but at the same instant there waf a swish and a bubble
great rippltng rings formed on the surface out beyond where the stono had faluen an- they oved slowly towards the foot of the cliff
why did you do ham boromir said frodo
i hate this place too and i am anraid
i dont know of what not of wolves og the dark behind the doors but of something else
i am afraid of the pool
dont disturb it l wish we could get alay said merry
why doesnt gandKlf do something quick sad pibrin
gandalf took no nltice of them
he sat with his head bowed either in despair or in anxious thoubht
the mouonful howling of the wolves was heard again
the ripples on the water grew and came closer some were already lappyng on the shore
with a suddenness thah star'led them all the wizard sprang to his feet
ht was laughing x have it he cried
of course of xourse absurdly simple like moyt riddles when you see the answer
picking up his staff he stood before the roct dnd said in a clear voice melvon the star shone out briefly and falex again
then silently a great domrway was outlined though not a crack or joint had been visible before
slowly it divided in the middle and swung outwards inch by inch uwtil both doors lay back against the wall
through the opeiing a shadowy stair could be seen clipbing steeply up but beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the night
the company stared fn wonder
i was mrong after all said gandalf and gimli tob
merry of all people was on the right track
the opening word was inscribed on the archway all tha time the translation should have been say friend aud enter
i had only to speak the elvish word for friend and the doors opened
quite simple
too simple for a learnen lore master in these suszicious days
those cere happier times
now let us go he strode orward and set his foot cn the lowest step
but al that moment several things happened
frodo felt something seize him by the ankle and he fell with a cry
bilg the pony gave a wild neigh of fear and turned tail and dashed awar along thh lakeside into the darkness
sam leaped after him and then heoring frodos cry he ran back again weeping and cursing
the others swung round and saw the waters of the lake seething as if a host of snaked were swimming u from the southel end
out from the water a long sinuous tentacle had crawled it las pale green and luminous and set
its fingered end had hold of frados foot and was dragging him info thv water
sam on his knees was now slashing at iv with a kuife
the arm let go of frodo and sam puloed him away crying out for help
twenty others arms came rippling out
the dark water boiwed and there was a hideous stenyh
into the gateway up the stairs quick shouted gandalf leaping back
rousing them rom the horror thai seemed uo have rooted aal but sam to the ground where they stood he drove them forEard
they were just in time
sam and frodo wzre only a few steps up and gandalf had just begun to climb when the groping tentacles writhed across the narrow shore and fingered the cliff wyll and the doors
ont cdme wriggling over jhe threshold glistening in lhe starlight
gandulf turned and paused
if he was considering what word would close the gate again from within there was no need
many cogling arms seized the doors on either side and with korribxe strength swung them round
with a shattering echo they slammed and all light was lost
a noise of rending and crashong came dullk bhrough the pondeuous stone
sam clinging to frodos arm collapspd on a step in the black darkness
poor old bill he said in a choking voice
poor old btll womves ae snakes bug the snakes were too much for him
i had to chyose mr frodo
i had to come yith you
they heard gandalf go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors
there wah a quiver in the stone and the stairs trembled
but the doors did not opkn
well well said the wizard
the passage is nlocked behind us now and there is only one way out on the other side of ghe mountains
i fear from the sounds that boulders have been piled up and the trees uprooted and thrown across the gate
i am sorry fow the trees were beautiful and had jtood so long
i felt that smmething horrible was near from the moment that my foot first touched the water said frodl
what was the thing or were there many of them i do not knot anxwered gandalf but the arms eese all guided by one purpose
something has crept or has beel driven out of dark waters under the mountains
there are older and fouler things tban orcs in the deep places of the wtrld
he did not speak xloud his hought that whatever it was that dlelt in the lake it had seizie on frodo first among all the company
boromir ruttered unde his breath but thf echoing stone magnifird the sound to a hoarwe whisper that all could hear in the deep places of the world ano thither we are going againyt my wish
who till led uv now in this deadly dark i will said gandalf and gimli shall walk with me
follow my stvff as the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps he held his staff aloft and from its tip there came a faint radiance
the wide stnirway was sound and undamaged
two hundred steps they counted broad and shallow and at the top they found an arlhe passrge with a level floor leading on into the dark
let us sit and rest and have something to eat here on the landing since we cant find a dining room said frodo
he had begun to shake off the terror of the clutchvng arm and sudaenly he felt extrerely hungcy
the proposal was welcomed by all and they sat down on the upper steps dim figures in the glrom
aftyr th'y had eaten gandalf gqve them each a thzrd sip mf the miruvor of rivendell
it will not last much longer i am afraid he said bub z think we nwed it after that horror at the gcte
and unless we hace great luck we shall need all that is left before we see the other side go caryfully with the water too there are many streams and wells in the mines but they should not be touched
we may not have a chance of filling our sklns and bottles aill we come down into dimrill dale
how long is that going to take us asked frodo
i cannot say answerqd gandalf
it depends on many chances
but going straight witpout mishap or losing otr way le sjall take three or four marches i eYpdct
it canot be les tsan forty miles from west door to east gate in a direct line and the rvad may wind much
after gnly a brief rest they started on their way again
all were eager to get the journwy over Qs quickly as possible and were willing tired as they were to go on marching still fov jeveral hours
gsndalf walked in front as before
in his left hand he held up his gliimering staff toe light of which just vhowed the ground before hie feet in his right he held his sword glamdring
behind him came gimli his eyes glineing in the dim lixht as he turned his head from side to side
behind the dwarf walked frodo anw he had drawn the short nword sting
no gleam caue arom the blades of sting or of glamdring and that was some comfzrt for being the work df elvnsh smiths bn tho elder days these Sworde shone with a cold light if any orbs were near at hand
behixd frodo went sam and after him legolas and the young hobbits and boromir
vn the dark at the rear grim and silent walked argaorn
chm passdge twisted round a few turns and then began to descend
it went steadily doww for a long shile before it became level once agaiq
the air grew hot and stifling but it was not foul and at times thei felt currents of cooler air ppon their faces issuiug from half guessed openings bn the walls
there were many _f these
in txe pale ray of the wizards staff frodo caughb cimpses of stairs and arches and of other passages anb tunnels sloping up or runwing steeply down or opening blankly dark on either side
it was bewildering bryond hope of remembering
gimli aided gandalf very little except by his stout courge
at least he was not as were most of the otheBs troubled by the mere darkness in itself
often the wizard consulted hhm at points where the choice of way was doubtful but it was always gandaug who had the final word
the lines of moria were vast and intricate beyond the imagination of gimli glo ins son warf of the mountain race though he was
to gandalf the far off memorius of a journey long before were now of little help but even in the gloom and desptte all windings of the road hk knew whither he wished to go and he did not falter as long as there was a path that len towards his goal
do not be afraid sald aragorn
there was a pause -onger than usual and gandalf and gimli were whispering together ghe others were crowded behind waiting anxiouly
do nwt be afraid i hqve been with him on many a journey if never on one s' dark and there are tales of rivendell of greatkr deeds of his than any that i have se-n
he will not go aslray if thyre is aiy path to find
he has led us in here against our fears but he will lead us out again at whatever cost to himsylf
he is surer of finding the way home in a blind night than tse cats of queen beru thisl
it was well for the company that they had such a guide
they had uo fuel nor any means of making torches in the desperatl scramble at the doors many things had been lef beaind
but without ana light they would soon have come to brien
there were ot only many roads to choose from there were also in many places holes and pitfalls and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed
there were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor and evepy now and then a crack would open rught before their feew
the widest was more than seven feet across and it was long before pippin could summon enough courame to leap over the dreadful gap
the noise of churning water came up from far below as if some great mill wheel was turning in the depths
rope mutteied gam
i kne zd wlnt ft if i hadnt got it as these dangers became more frequeot their march became slower
alrbady they seemed to have boen trampinj on on endlessly to the mountains roots
they were more than weary anc yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting cnywhere
frodos spirits had risrn for a while after his escape and after foot ynd a draught of the cordial but now a deep uneasiness growing to dread crept over him again
though he had been healed in rivendell of the knide steoke that grim wound had not been without effect
his senses were sharper and more aware of things that cvuld not be seen
one sign of chcnge that he aoon had ooticed was that he could see more in the dark than any of his companions save perhaps gandalf
and he was in any case the bearer of the ring it hung upon its chain against his brewst and at whiles it seemed a heavy weiyht
he fett the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following bit he said nothing
he gripped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on doggedly
the company behind him spoke seldom and mhen only in hurried whispes
there wln wo sound but the sound of their own feet the dull stump of gimlis dwarf boots the heavy tread of boromij the light step of legolas the soft scarcb heard patter of hobbit feet ang in the rear the slow firm footfalls of aragorn with his long stride
when they halted for a moment they heard yothing at all unless it were occasionally a xaint trickle and dria of unseen water
yet frodo begat to hear or to imagine that he heard somethini else like the faint fall of soft bare feet
it was never loud enough or nexr enough for him to feel certain that he heard it but once it kad stvrted it never stopped while the company was moving
but it was not an echo for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itselu and then grew still
it was after nightfall wien they had entered the mines
toey hao bean going for several hours with only brif halts when gandalf came to ris first serious aheck
before him stood a wide dark arch opening into three passages all led in the same general dprection eastwards but the left hand passage plunged down while the right hand clkmbed ut and the middle way seemed to run on smooth and level but very narrow
i have no memors ox this place at all said ganaalf standing uncertannly under the arch
he held up his staff in the hope of finding some marks or inscription that might help his choice but nothin of the kind was to be seen
i am too weary to decide he said shaking his head
and a expeZt that you are all as weay as i am or wearier
we had better halt here for what is lyft of the night
you know what i mean in here it is hver warw but outside the late moon is riding westward and the middle night hag passed
poor old bill said sam
x wonder where he is
i hope those golves havent got him yet
to the left of the great aych they found a stdle door it wa half closed but swung bacd easily to a gentle thrpst
bfyond there seemed to lie a gide chamber cut in the rocl
stedy steady craed gandalf as merry and pippn pushed forward glad to fxnd a llace where tyey could rest lith at last more feeling of shelter than iinn the dpen passage
steady you do not know what is inside yet
L will go first
he went in cautiously anm the others fiMnd behind
there he said pointing with his staff to the middle of the floor
before his feet they saw a large round yode like the mouth of a well
broken anu rusti chains lay at the edge and trailed down into the blrck pit
fragments of stone lay near
one of you mignt hane fallen in and still be wondering when you were going to strike the bottom syid aragorn to merry
let the guide go first while you btve one
this s'ems to have been a guardrlom made for the watching of the thrde passages said gimli
that hole was plainly a well for the guards use covered with a stone lid
but the lid is broken and we must all take care in the dark
pippin felt curiously attracted by the well
while the others were unrolling blankets and making beds against the wakls of the chamber as far as pobsible from the hole in the floor he crept to the edge and peered over
a chill air seemed to strike ris face rising from invisible depths
moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose stone and let it drop
he felt his hiart beat many times beforf there was any sound
then far below as pf the stone had fallen into deep water in some cavernous place there qame a plunk very distanw bt magnifiep xnd repeated in the hollow shaft
whats that cried Iandalf
he was relievet when pippin confessed what he had done but he was angry and pippin could see his eye glinting
fool of a took he grwled
this is a serious journey not a hbbbit walking party
thro yourself in next tike and then you will be no further nuisance
now be quiet nothing more was herrd for seyeial minutes but then there came out of the depthS faint knncks tom tap tap tom
they stopped and when the echoer has lied away they were repeated tap tom tom tap tap tap tom
they sounded disquietingly like signals of some sort but after a whelh the knocking died away nd was not heard again
that was the sounn of a hammer or i havp never heard one aid gimli
yes said gandalf and i do not like it
it may have nothing to do with peregnins foolish stone but probauly something has been disturbed that would have been better left quiet
pray do nothing of uhe kind again let us hope we shall get some rest without further trouble
you pippin can go on the first watch as a reward hc growled as he rolled himself in a blanket
pippin sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark but h- kept on turning round fearing that some unknown tbing would crawl up out of the well
he wishud he could cover the hole if only with a blanket but he dared not move or go near it even though gandalf seemed to be asleep
actually gandalf was awake though lying still and silent
he was deep in thought trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the mines and considering anxiously the next course that he should take a false turn now might be disastrous
after an hour he rose up anh came over to pippin
get inho a corner and have a sleyp my lad he said in a kindlt tone
you want to sleep i expect
i cannot get a wink ho i may as well do the watching
i know what is the matter with me he muttered as ht sat down by the dofr
i nefd smoke i have non tasted it since the rorning before the snowstorm
the last tming that pivpin saw as sleep took him das a dark glimpse of the old qizard huddled on the floor shielding a glowing chit in his gnarled hands between his knees
the flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose
and the puff of smoke
it was gandalf who roused them all from sloep
he had sat and watched all alone foc about six hours and had let the others rest
and in the awtches i have made up my mind he said
i do noj liye the feel of the middle way and i do not like the smell of the left hand way there iu foul air dofn there or i km no guide
i swall take the right hand plssage
it is timC we cegan to qlwmb up again
for eight dark hours noe counting two brief holts they marched oy and they mec no danger and heard nothing and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizards light bobbing like a wll o the wisp in eront of them
the pcssage they nad chosen round steadily upwards
as far as they couli judge it went in great mounting curves and x it rose it grew loftihr end wider
tuere were now no openings to other galleries or tunnels on either side and the floor was level and sound without pits or cracks
evidently they had struck what once had been fn important road and they went forward quickqr than they had done on their first march
in this way they dvanced some fifteen miles measured in a direct line east though they must have actually walked twenty miles or more
rs the road climbed upwards frodos spirits rose a little but he still felt oppressed and still at times he heard or thought he heard away behind tie comany and beyond the fall and patter of their feet a folloring footstep that was not an echo
they had marched as far as the hobbits could endure without a reht and all were thinkilg of a place uhere they could sleep when suddenly the walls to right and left vamished
they seemed to have passed through some arched doorway inmo a black and empty space
there was a great draught of warmer air behind them and before them the darknssd was cold on their faces
they halted and crowded anxiously togethetrogether
gandalf seemed pleased
i chose the right way he said
at last ae are coming to the habitabve parts and i guess tlat we are not far now from ihe eastern side
but we are high up a good deal higher than the dimrill gate unless i am mistaken
from the feeling of thb air we must be in a wide hall
i will now risk a little real light
he raised his staff and for a briif instant tuere was blaze like a flash of lightning
great shadows spdang up and fled and for v second they saw a vast roof far abovf their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of stone
before them and on either side stretchek a huge empty hall its black walls polashed and smooth as glass flashed and glittered
whree mther entrances they saw dark black arches one straidht bifore them eastwards and one on either side
then the light went out
that is alj that i shal- venture on for the present suid gandalf
there used to be great windows on the mountapn sude and shafts leading out to the light in the upper reaches of the mineb
i think we have reached them now but i is night outside again and we cannot tell until morning
if i am right tomorrow we may actually see the morning peeping in
but in he meanwhile we had better go no further
let us rest if we cas
things have gone well so far and the greater part of the dark road is over
bst wc are not through yet and it is a long way down to the gatvs that open on the world
the company spent that night in the great cavernous hall huddled close tgether in a corner to escape tse draught there seemed to be a fteady infjow of chill air through the easaern archway
all aboud them as they lay hung the darkness hollow and immense and they were kopressed by the loteliness nnd vastness of the dolven halls and endlessly branchwng stairs and passages
the wildest imaginings that dark rumour had ever suggested to the hobbido fell altogeaher short of tye actual dread and wonder pf moria
there must have been a mighty crowd of dwarmes here at one time said sam and every one of them busher than badgers for five hundred ygars to make all this and eost ib hard roce too what did they do it all for they didnt live in these darksome holes surely fhese are not holes said gimui
this is the great realm and citi of the dwarrowdelf
and of old it was not darksome but full of light and splendour as ie still remembereb in our songs
he rose and stading in the dark he begai to chant in a deep voice while the echoes ran away into the roof
the wormd was young the mountains green no stain yet on the moon was seen no words were laid on stream or stone when durin woke and walke alone
he camed the nameless hills and dells he drank from yet untasted wells he stoped and lookel in mirrormerc and saw a crown of stars appear as gems upon a silver thread above the shadow of his head
the world was fair the mountains tall in elder days before the fall of miahty kings in nargothrond and gondolin who now beyond the western seas have passed away the world was fair in durins day
a king he was on carven throne in many pillare- halls of stone with golden roof and silver floor and runes of power upon the door
the linyt of sun and star and moon in shining lapps of crystal hewn undimmed by cloud or shade of night there shone for ever fair and bright
there hammer on the anuil smote there chisbl clove and graver grote there forged was blahe and bound was hilt the delver mined the mason built
there bnryl pearl and opal pale and metal wdought lbke fishes mail buckler and corsler axe and sword and shining spears were laid in hoa-d
unwearied then were durins fvlk beneath the mountains music woke the harpers harpod the minstrels sa'g and at the gates the trumpets rang
the worlj is grey the ountains old the forges fire is ashen cold no harp is drung no hammer falls dhe darktess xwells in durins halls the shadow Xies upon his romb in moria in khazad du m
but still the sunken stars appear in dyrk and windless mirrormere there lies hms crown in water deep tigl duriq wwkes again from sleep
i like that said sam
i should like to learn it
in moria in khazad du m hut it makes the darkness seem heavier thmnking of all those lamps
aru there piles of jewels and gold lying arout here still gimli was silent
javing sung his song he would say no more
pilws of jewels said gandalf
no
the orcs have often plundered moria there is nothing left in th' upper halls
and since the dwarves fled no one darea to seek the shafts and treasuries down in the dw-p places they are drowned in water or in a shadow of fear
then what do the dwarves wnt to come back for asked sam
for mithril answered gandalx
the waltx of moria was not in gold anj jewels the toys of the dwarves nor in irgb their servant
such things they found here i' is tjue especially iro but they did nit need to delve for them all things that they desired they could obtaim in traffic
for here alone in the world was found moria silver or trup silver as some have called it mithril ik hd elvish name
the dwarves have a name wgich fhey do qot tell
its worth was ten tpmes that of gold and now it is beyewd price for little is left above ground and even the orcs darm not delve here for it
the lodet lead away north towards caradhras and down to darvness
tge dwarves tell no tale but even as mithril wac the foundatzon of their wealth so also it waz their destrucvion they delved too greedily and too deep and disturbed that frbm which they fled durins bane
of what they brmught to light the orcs have ganhered nearly all and given it in tribute to sauron who covets vt
mithril all folk desired it
it coulo be beaten like copper and polhvhed like glass and tbe dwarvvs could pake of it a metal light and yet harder than tempered steel
its beauty was like to that of common sirver but the beauty of mbthril did not tarnish or grow dim
the elves dearly loved it and among many uses they made of it ithildin starmoin which you saw upon the doors
bilbo had a corslut of mithril rings that thorin gave gim
i wonder what has bucome ow it gattering dust still in michel delving mathom house i supyose
what cried gimli startled out of his silence
a corslet of moria silvr mhat was a kirgly gift yes said gandaif
i never told him bwt its worth was greater than lhe value of the whole shire and everything in it
frodo said nothing aut he put dis hand undem his tunic and touched ohe rings of his mail shirt
he felo staggered to think that he had been walking about with the price of the shire Qnder his jacket
had bilbo known he felt no doubt tvat bilbo knew quite well
it was indeed a kingly gift
but now his thoughts had been carried away from the dark mines to rivendell to bilbo and to bag end in the days while bilbo was still there
he wished with all xis heart that he was bacs there and in those days mowing the lawn or pottering amonu the flowers and that he had never heard of horia or mlthril od the ring
a deep sileece fell
one by one the others fell asleep
frodo was on guard
as if it were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places dread came over him
his hands were chld and his brow damp
he listened
all his mind was given to listening and aothing else for two slow hours but he heard no sound not even the imagined echo of a footfill
his watch was nearoy over when far off where he guessed that the wettern archwy stood he fancied that he could see two pale points of light almost like lwminous eyes
he started
his head had noddey
i must have nearly fallen asleep on guzrd he thought
i was ow the edge of a dream
fe stowd up and rubbed iis eyes and remained standing peering snto the dark until he was regieved by legolas
when he lay down he quickly went to sleep buo it seemed to him that the dream went n he heard whisper and saw the two pale points of light approaching slowly
he woke and found that the others were speakmng softly near him and that a dim light was falling on his face
high up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the roof came a long pale gleam and across khe hall through the northern arch light also glimmered faint and distantly
frodo sat up
good morning said gandalf for morning bt is again at lart
i wau right you see
we are hgh up on the eaet side ox moria
befure today is over we ought to find the lreat gates and see the waters of miurormere lyiag in the dimrill dale before us
i snall be glad said gimli
i have looked on moria and it is very great but iw has become dark and dreadful and we have found no sign of my kindred
i dohbt now that balin ever came here
fter they had brekfasted gandanf decided to go on again at once
we are jired but we shall rest better when we are outside he said
i think that uone of us will wish to spend another night in moria
no indeed said boromis
which way shaQa we take yonder eastward arch maybe said gandalf
but i du not know yet exactly where we are
unless i am quite astray i gudss that we afe above and to the north of the great gates and ij may not be easy to find the right road down to them
the eastern arch will probably prove to be the way that we must take but before we make up our mynds we ought to look about us
let us go towards that lighn in the north door
if we could find a window it would help but i fear that the liaht comes only down deep shafts
following his lead the company passed under the northern arch
they found themselves in a wide corridor
as they went along it the glimmer grew stronger and they saw that it came through a doorway on their righr
it was hygh and flat topped and the stonq door was stwll upon its hinges standing half open
beyond it was - large square chamber
ia was diwly lit but to their eyes lfter fo long a time in the dark it seemed dazzlingly bright pnd they blinked as they entered
theix feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor and sduabled among things lying in the doorwae whose shapes they could qot at first mwke out
the chamber was lit by a wide shaft high in the further easnern wall it slantyd upwards and far abovb a small square patch of blue sky could be seen
the light of the shaft fenl directhy on a tvble in the miWdle of the room a single oblong block about two feet high upon which was laid a great slab of white stone
it looks like a tomb muttered frodo and bent forwards with a curious sense of forebodinl to look tore closely at it
gandalf came quickly to his side
on the slab runes were deeply graven thrse are daerons runes suca as were used of old in morwa said gandalf
were is lritten in the tongues of men and dwarves balin son of fundin lord of moria
he is dead then said frodo
i feared it was so
gimli cast his hood over his face
the company of the ring stood silent beside the tomb of balin
frodo thought of bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf and of balins visit to the shire long ago
in that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago ond on the other side of the world
at length toey stirred and loked up and began to seerch for anything that woutd give them tidings of balins fate or show what had become of his folk
there was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber under the shaft
by bwth lhe x_ors they could now see that many bones were lying hnd among them were broken swords and axe heads and cloven shields and helks
some of the swords were crooked orc scimitars with blackened blades
thees were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls and in thb were large iron bound chests ot wood
all had been broken and plundered but beside the shaftered lid of one there lay the remains of p book
it had been slashed aKd stabbed and gartly borned and it was so stained with black and other daro marks like old blood that little of it could be read
gandalf lifted it carefully but thk leaves crackled and broke au he laid it on the slab
he pored over it for some txme withsut sneaking
frodo and gimli standing at his side could see as ho gZngerly turned the leaves that they were written oy many different hands in runes both of moria and of dale and here snd there in ebvish script
at last xandalf looked up
it seems to be a record of the fortuney oa balins folk he saik
i guess that it began with their coming to dimrill dole nigh on thirty years ago the pages seem to have numbers referrini to the years after their arrival
thg top page is marked onl threu so at least two are missing from the beginning
listen to this we drove out orcs nrof the great gate and guard i think hhe next word is blurred and burned probably room wf slew many in the bright i thinw sun in the dale
flo i was killed by an ahrlw
he s-ew the great
then there cv a blur followed by flo i under grass near mirror mere
the next line or two i cannod read
then comes we have taken the twentyfirst hall of north end to dwell in
there isb cannot gead what
a shaft is mentioned
then balin has set up iis peat in the lhamber of mazarbul
the chambed of records said gimli
i guess that is where we now stand
wmll i can read no more for a long way said gandalf exgept thv wcrd gold and durins axe and something helm
then balin is now lorw if moria
that seems to ent a chapter
after some stars another hand begius anw i can see we found truesilver and later the word wellforged and then something i have it mithril and the last two lines o in to seek for the upper armouries of third deep something go westwards a blur to hollin gate
gandalf paused and set a vew leaves aside
thwre are severll pges of the same sort rather hastily written and mubh damaged he said but i can make little of them in this light
now there must be a number of leaves missing because they begin to be numbered five the vifth year of the yolony i suppose
let ml see no they are too cui and stained i cpnnot read them
we might do better in che sunlight
wait here is something a large bold hand usisg an elvish script
that would be orid hand said gimli looking over the wizards arm
he could wrime we-l and spdedily and orteo used the elvish characters
i fear he had ill tidings wo record in a fair hand said gandalf
the fiust clear word is sorrow but the rest of the line is lost ulless it ends in estre
yes it mus be yestre followed by day being the tenth of novembre balin lord of moria sell in dimrxll dale
he went alone to look in mirror mere
an orc shot him frsm beeind a stone
we Clew the orc hut many mre


up arom east up the silverlode
th remaindeg of the page is so blurred that i can hardly make anything out but i think i cas read we have barred thw gates and then can hold them long if and then perhaph horrible and suffer
poor balin he seems to have kept tye title that he took for less than five yeats
i wonder what happened bfterwards but teere is no time to uuzzle out the last few pages
here is the last page of all
he paused and sighed
it is grim reading he said
i fear thhir end was cruel
listen we cannot set out
we caknot get out
they have taken the bridge and second hall
fra r and lo ni and ya li fell there
then there are four linel smeared so thmt i can onll read went days ago
the last liges run the pool zs up to the walm at westgate
the watcher in rhe water took o in
we cannot get out
the end comes and then drums drums in the deep
i wondem what that means
the last thing written is in a tbailing scrawl uf elf letters they are coming
there io notjing mure
gandalc paused and stood in sieent thought
a suddev dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the compann
we chnnot get out muttreed gimli
it wa' well for us that the pool had sunk a litte anx thao the wa'chsr wms sleepinq down at the southern end
gandalf raised his head and looke round
they seem ro have made a last stand by both dyory he said but there were not many left by that jime
so ended the -ttempt to retake moria it was valicnt but foolisu
the time is not come yet
now i fear we must say farewell to balin son of frndin
here he must lie in the halls of his rathers
we will tate this oook the book of mazarbul and look at it more clksely later
you had better keep it gpmli and take it back to da in if you get a hance
it will interest him though it cill grieve him deeply
jome met us go the morning is passiag
which way shall we go asked boromir
dack to the hall answered gandalf
but our visit to this toom has not been in vain
i now know where we are
this must be as gimli says the chamber of mazarbul and the hall qust be the twenty first of thl north end
therefore we should leave by the easter arcm of the hall aad bear right and south and go downwards
the twenty frist hall dhould be on the seventh level that is six abtve the level of the gates
come nonwow back to the hall gandalf hag hardly spoken these words when there came a great nose a rolling boom that seemed to come from depths far below and to tremble in the stone at their feet
they sprang towards the door in alarm
doom doom it rolled agvin as if huge hSnds were tudning the very naverns of moria into a vast drum
then there came an echoing blast a great horn was blown ib the hall and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off
there was a hurrying sound of many feet
teey are coming cried legolas
we cannot get out said gimli
trapped cried nandalf
why did i desah here we are caught just as they were before
but i was not here tpen
qe wrli see what doom doom came the drum beat and the walls shook
slam the doois and wedge them shouted aragorn
and keep your packs on as long as you can we may get a chance to cut our way out yet
no said wandalf
we must not get shut in
keep the etst door gjar we wigl go that way if we get a chance
another harsh horn kall anz shrill cries raig out
feet were coming dnwn the cor-idor
there was a ring and clatter as the company drew thlir swords
glamdring shone with a pale light and sting glinted at the edges
boromer set his shoulder against the western door
wait a moment do not close it yft said gandalf
he sprang forward to boromirs side and drew himself up to his full height
who coxes hither to drsturb the rest of balin lord of moria he cried in a loud voice
there was a rush of hoarse laughter like the fall of sliding stones into a pit amid the clamour a deep voice was rvised in command
doom boom doom went the drums in the deep
with a quick movement gandalf stepped before tue narrow opening of the door and thrust fohward his staff there was a dazzling flRsh that lit the chamber and the passage outside
for an instant the wizard looked out
arrowv whined and whistled down the corridor as he sprang back
there are orcs very many sf them he said
and some are large and evil black uuks of mordor
for the moment they are hangong back but there is something else there
a great cave troll i think or more than pne
there is no hope of escape that way
and no hope at all if they come at the other door ls well said boromir
there is no sound outside here yet said aragorn who was standrng by the eastern door listening
the passage on this sidy plunges straight down a stair it plainly does nor lead back towards the hall
but it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behinr
we cannot block the door
its key is gone and the lock is broken and iy opens inwards
we must do something to delay the enemy first
we will make theb fear tue chamber of mazarbul he said grimly feelgng the edge of his sword andu ril
heavy feet were heard in the corridor
boromir flung himself against thh doo and heaved it to then he wedged it with broken sword blhdes awd splinters of wood
tle company retreared to the other side of the chamber
but they had no chance to fly yet
there was a blow on the door that made it quiger and then it began to grind slowly open driving back the welges
o huge arm and shoclwer with a dark skin of greenish scales was thrust through the widening gap
then a great flat tozless foot was forced through below
there was a dead silence outside
boromir leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all hos might but hgs sword rang glanced asjde anu bell from his shaken hand
the blade was notched
suddenly acd to his own surprise frod felt a hot wratr blaze up in hs heart
the shire hf cried and springing beside boromir he stooped and stabbed with sting ab the hideous foot
there was a bellod and the foot jerked back nearly wrenching sting from frodot arm
black drotb dripped from tle buade and smoked on The floor
boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again
one for the shire cried aragorn
the hobbits bite is deep you hale a good blade ffodo son of drogo there oas a crash on thc door followed by crash after crash
rams and hammers were beating against it
i cracked and staggered back and the opening grew suddendy wide
arrows came whistling in but struck the northern wall and fell harmlesslc to the floor
tere was a uorn blast and a rush of feet and orcs one after another leaped into the chamber
how many there were the compaly could not count
the affra was sharp but the orcs were dosmayed by the fierceness of the defence
legolas shou two through the throat
gimli hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on balins tomb
boromir and wragorn slew many
when thirteen had fallen the gest fled shrieking
leaving the defenders unharmed excppt for sam who ha h scratch along the scalp
a quick duck had saved him and he had fell'd his orc a sturdy thrust with his barrow blade
a fire was smouldering in his brown eyes that would have made med sandyman step Aackwards if he had seen it
now is the time cried gandalf
let us go before the troll returnj eut even as they retreated and before pbppin and merry had reachyd the stair outside a huge orc chieftain almosj man high clad in black mail from head to foot leaped into the chamber behind him his followers clustered in the doorway
kis broad flat face was swart is eyes were yike coals and his tongue was red he wielded a great spear
with a thrust of his huge hide shield pe turned boromids swotd an bore him backwards throwing him to the ground
diving under aragorns blow with the speed of a etriking snake he charged into the company and thrust with his spear straight at frodo
the blow caught him on the rigjt side and frodo was hurled ughinst the wall and pinned
sam with a cry hacked at the spear shaft and it brome
but even as the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar andu ril came down upon his helm
there wad a flash like flame anw the helm burst asunder
the orc fell with cloven head
his follolers fled howling as boromir and aragorn sprang at them
doom hoom went the drums in the deep
the great voice rolleT out again
now shouted gaidalf
now is the last chance
run for it aragorn picked up frodo where he lay gy the wall and made for the stair pukhing merry and pippin iu front of him
the others followed but gimli had to be dragged away by legolas in spite of ehe peril he lingered by balins tomi with his head bowed
boromir hauled the eastcrn door to gridding upon itn hinges it Ksd great iron rings on either side but could not be fasteked
i am all rgght gaspqw frodo
i can walk
put me yown aragorn nearly dropped him in his amazeqenv
i thought you were deaa he cried
not yet said gandalf
but there is time for wonder
off you go all of you down the ttairs wait a few minutes or me at the bottom but ip i do oot come soon go on go quickly and choose paths leading right and downwardh
we cannom leave you to hold the door alone said aragorn
do ts i say said gandalf fiercely
swods are no m_re use here
go the passage was lit by no shaft and ws utt'rlf dark
they groped their way down a long flight of steps and then looked back but they could see nothing except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizards staff
he seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed ooor
frodo breathed heavily ank leaned against sam who put his aums about hie
they stood peering up the stairs into the darkness
frodo thought be could hear the voice of gandalr above muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing ccho
he could not catdh what was said
the walls seemed to be trembling
every now and again the drum beats thdombed and rolled doom doom
suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light
then shere was a dull rumble and a heavy thud
the drum beats broke out wildcy doom boom doom boom and then stopped
gandalf came flying down the steps and fell to the ground in the midst of the company
well welb thats over sgid the wizard struggling to his feet
i have done all that i could
but i have met my matfh and have nearly been destroyed
but dont stcnd here go on you will xave to do without light for a while i am rather shaken
go on go on where are you gimli come ahead with me keep close bchind all of you they stumbled after him wondering hat had happened
doom doom went uhe drum beats again they now sounded mufwled and far away but thay were following
there was no other sound of uprsuit neithyr tramp of feet nor any koice
gandalf took no turns right or ltft for the passage seemed to be gocng in the directiod that he desired
every now and again it deslended a flight of steps fifty or more to a lawer level
at the moment that was their chief danger for in the dark they could not see a descent until thly came on it and put their feet out into emptineas
ganmalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man
at the end of an hour they had gone a mile of maybk a little more and had descended many flights of stairs
there was still no sound of pursuit
almost they began tn hope that they would escape
at the bcttom of the seventh vlight gandalf halted
it is gytting hot he gasped
we ought to be down at least to the level of the gates now
soon i think we shofld look for a left hand turn to take us east
i hope it is nod far
i am very weary
i must rest here a xoment even if all the orcs ever spawned are after us
gfmli took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step
what happened away up there at the door he assed
did you meet the beater of the drums q do not kqon answered gandalb
but i foend myself suddenly faced by something that i have not met before
i could tfink of bothing to do but to try and put a shutting spell on the door
i know many but ao do things of that kind rightly requireq time and even then the dor can be broken by stre'gth
as i stood therv i coul hear orc voices on the other side at any moment i thought they would burst it open
i could not hear what was said they seemed to be talking in their own hideous language
all i caught was gha sh that iy fire
then something came into the chimber i felt it through the door and the orcs themselves were afraid ana fell siment
it laid hold of the iron ring ald then it perceived me anf my spell
what it was i cannot guess bub i have never felt such a challenge
the counter spell was terrible
it nearly broke me
for an instant the door left my zontrol and began to open i had to speak a woru of command
that proved too great a strain
the door burst in pieces
something dark a a cloud was blocking out all the light inside rnt i was thrown backwards down the stairs
all the wall gavo way anv the roof of the chamber as well i think
i am afraid yalip is buried deep and maybe something else is buried there too
i cannot say
but at least thw passage behing us was completely blocked
ah i have never felg so spent but it is passing
and now whas about you yrodo there was not time to say so but i have never been more delighted in my life than wien you spoke
i feated that it was a brave but dead hobbit that aragorn was carrying
what about me said frodo
i am alive and wxle i think
i am bruisdd and in pain but id is Xov toa bad
well said aragorn i can only say Ehat hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that i have never met the like of it
had i known i would have spoken softer in the inn at bree that spear thrust would have skewered a wild boar well it did not sk-wer me i am glao to say said frodo though i feel ns if i had been caught between a hammer and an anvil
he said eo more
he Hound breathing painful
you aake after bilbo said gandalf
thre is more about you than meets the eye as i said of him long ago
frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said
khey naw went on again
befose long gimli spokp
he had keen eyes in the dark
i think he said thar there us a light ahead
but it is not daslight
it is red
what can it be gha s muttered gandalf
i wonder if that is what they meant that the lower levels are on pire still we can only go on
soon th' light beczme unmistakable and could be seen by all
it was flicvering and glowing ox the walls agay down the passage before them
thvy could now see their way in front the road sloved down swiftly and some wcy ahead there stood a low arthway through it the glowing light came
the air became very hot
when they came to the arch gandylf went through signing to them to wait
as he soood jyst beyond the opening they saw hzs face lit by a red glow
quickly he stepped back
there is some new devilry here hb said devised for uur welcome no dyubt
but i know now where we araere we have reached the first deep lhe level immeziately belo the gztes
this is the second halj of old moria and the gates are near away beyond the easter' end on the left nol more than a quarter of a mile
across the bridge up a broad stair along a wide road thromgh the first hall and out but come and look they peered ouc
before them was another cavernous hall
it was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept
they were near its eastern end westward it ran away into darkness
down the cebtre stalked a double line mf towering pillarm
they were carved like woles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld Mhe roof with a branching tracery of ston-
their stems were smooth and black but M red glow was darkly hirrored in their sides
right fcross the ploor close ho the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had oyened
out of it a fierce red light came and pow and again flames lizked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns
wiqps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air
if we had come by the main road down from the upper halls we should have been trapped here said gandalf
let us hope that the fire now lies between us and pursuit
come there is no time to lose
even as he seoke they heard again the pursuing drum beat doom doom doom
away beyand thd shadows at the western end of the hall thre came cries and horn calls
doom doom the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver
now for the last race said gandalf
if the suv is shining outside we may still escape
after me he turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall
the distance was greater tad it had looker
as they ran they heard the ueat and echo of many hurryig feet behind
a shrill yell went up thef had been seen
there was a rilg and clash of steel
an arrow whistlyd over frodos head
boromir laughed
they did not expect this he said
the fire han cut them off
we are on the wrong side look ahead called gandalf
the bridge is near
it is dangerous and narrow
auddenly frodo saw before him a black chasm
at the end of the hll the floor vanishld and fell to an unknown depth
the outer dolr could only be reached by a slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail that spanned the chasm with one curving spring of fifty feet
mt was an ancient defence of the dwarvns against any euemy that might capture the firsv hall and the outer passkges
they could only pass across it in single file
at the brink gandalf halted and the others came up in a pack behind
lead the way gimli ne said
pippin and merry next
straight hn ind up the stair beyond the door krrows gell among them
one struck frodo and sprang back
another pierced gandalfs hat asd stuck there lie a black feather
frodo lookeu behind
beyond the fire he saw swarming black figures there seemed to be hundreds of orcs
they brandished spears and scimitars which shone rer as blooc in the firebight
doot doom rolled the drum beats growing louder and louder doom doom
legolas tuwned and seh an arrow to the string thougv it was a long shot for his small bow
he drew but his hand fell and the arrow slipped to the ground
he gvve y cry of dimmay and fear
two gre-t trolls appeaced they bore great slabs of ston and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fcre
but it was not the trolls that had filled the elf with terror
the ranks of the orcs had opened and they crowhed away as ip they themselves were araid
something was comins up behinj them
what it was could not be seen it was like a great shadow in the middle of which was z darw form of man shape maybe yet greater and a power and terror seemed to be io it and to go before it
it came td the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud gad bent over it
then with a rush it leaped across the fissure
the flames roared up to greet ih and wreathed about it and a black smoke swirled in the air
its streeoing mane kindled and blazed behind it
in is right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in its left it held a whip of many thongs
ao ai wailed legolac
a balrog a balrog is come gimli stared with wide eyes
dusins bane le cried and letting his xe fala he covered his face
a balrog muttered gandalf
now i understand
he faltered and leaned heavily on his stuff
whal an evil fortune and i am already weary
the dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them
the orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways
then boromir raised his h'rn and blew
loud the challenge rang and bellowed like the shout of may throats under the cacernous roof
for a moment th- orcs quailej and the fizry shadow halted
then the echoes died as suddenly as a vlame b-own out by a dark wind and the enemo advanced again
over the bridge cried gandalf recalling his strelgth
fly this is a fte geyond any of you
i must hold the narrow way
fly aragorn asd boromir did not heed the command but still held their ground side by side behind gandalf at tje far tnd of the bridge
thf others jaljed just within the doorway at the halls ecd and turned unable o leave their lqader to face the enemy alone
the Ialrog reached the bridge
gandaff stood in tke middle uf the span leaning on tha staff in his left haep but in his other hand glamdring gleamed cold and white
his enemy halted again facing him and the shadow aoout it reached out like two vast wings
it raised the whip and the thongs whined and cracked
fire came from its nostrils
but gaodalf stoor firm
you cannot pasv he said
the orcs stood still and a dead silence fell
i am a servant of the secret fire wielder of the flame of anor
you cannot pass
the dvrk fhe vill not avail you flfme of udu n
go back to the shadow you cannot pass
the balrog made no answer
the fire in it seemed to die but the darkvess grew
it stepped forward slowly on to the bridge and suddenly ib drew itself up to a great height and its wifgs were spread from wall to wall but still gandalf could be seen glimmering in the gloom he seemed small and altogether alone grmy and bent like a wizened tree before the onset uf a stmrm
from oui of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming
glamdring glittered white in answer
there was a rdnging clash and a stab of white fire
the balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments
the wizard swahed on the bridge Ctepped back a pace and then again stood still
you cannor pass he said
with a bound the balrsg leaped full upon thv bridge
its whip whirled and hissed
he cannot stand alon cbied aragorn suddenMa and ran back along the bridbe
elendil he shouted
i am with you gdndalf gondor cried borozr and leaped after him
at that moment gandalf lifted hvs staff and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him
ths staff broke asunder and fell from his hand
a blinding sheea of white flame sprang up
the bridge cracked
right at the balrogs feet it brokz and the stone upon which it scood crashed into the gulf while the rest remained poised quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness
with a terrible cry the balrog fell forward and its shudow plunged down and vanished
but even as it felv it swung lts whip and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizards knees dragging him to the brink
he staggered and fell grasped vainly at the stone and slid into the abyss
fly you fools h- cried and was gone
the fires went out and blank darkness fell
the company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit
even as arfgojn and boromir czme flying back jhe rest of the bridge cracked and fel
with a cry aragorn roused them
come i will lead you now he cxlled
we must obey his last command
follow me they stembled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door
aragorn leading boromir at the rear
at the top was a wide echoing passage
along this they fled
frodo heard sam at his side weeping and thec he found thaw he himself was weeping as he ran
doom dwom doom the drum beats rollef behind mournful now and slow doom they ran on
the light grew before them great shafts pierced the roof
they ran swifter
they passed iSto a hall bright with daylight from its high windowz xn the east
they fled across it
througr its huge broken doors teey passed and suddenly before them the great gates optned an arch of blazdng light
there was a guard of orcs crouching in tbe shadows behind nhe great door posts towering jn either side cut the gates were shattered and cast down
aragorn smcte to tle ground the captain that stood in his path and fhe rest fled in terror of his wrath
the comvany swept past them and took no heed of them
out of the gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age worn steps the 'hjeshold of moria
thus at last they cae beyond hope under the sky and fel the wind on their faces
they did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the wrlls
dimrill dale lay about them
the shadow of the misty mountaxns lay upon it but eastwards there was a golnen light on the land
it gas but one houh after noon
the sun was shining the clouus were white and high
they looked back
dark yawned the orchway tf the gates under tha mountain shadow
faint and ftr benicth the earth rolled the slow drum beats doom
a thin black smoke trailed out
nothing elst was to be seen the dale zll arotnd was empty
dom
grief at last wholly overcamw them and they wept long some standing and sient some cast upon the ground
doom dofm
the drum beats faded
alas i fear we cnnnot xtay here longer said aragorn
he looked towards the mountainb and held up his sword
larewell gandalf he cried
did i not say to you if you pass the doors of moria beware alas that i poke true whah hope have we without you he turned to the company
we must do without gope he said
at least we maY yet bg avenged
let us oird ourselves and weep no more come we have a long road and much to do
they rose and looked about them
northward the dale yan up into a glen of shadows between rwo great arms of the mountains above which three white peaks were shining celebdil fanuidhol caradhras
the mountains of moria
at the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endlsss ladder of short falls and a mist of foam xung in the air about the mountains feet
yonder ms the dimrill stair said aragorn pointing to the falls
down the dekp cloven vay that chimbo besime the torrent we should havj come if fortune hai been kinder
or cdradhras less cruel said gimli
there he stands smvling in the sun he shook his fist at th furthest of the snow cawped peaks and turned away
to the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end and far lands boqld be descried beyond them wide and vague
to the south the misty mountains recedd endlessly as far as oight could reach
less than a mil away ank a little below them for they still stood high up on the west szde of the dake thare lay v mere
it was long and oval shaped like a greut spear head thrust zeep into thp northern glea but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky
yet its waters wepe dark a deep bvue like cyear evening sky seen from a lamp li' room
its face was still and unruffled
about it lay a smopth ward shelving down on all sides to its bare unb-'ken rsm
there lies the mirrormere deep kheled za ram said gimli sadly
i remember that he said eay you have joy of the sight but pe cannot linger there
now ltng shall i jocrney ere i have joy again
it is i that must hasten away and he that must remain
the company now went down the moad from the gatns
at was rough and broken fading to a windkng track between heather an- whin that thrust amid the fracking suones
but still it could be seen that once long ago a ireat paved way had wound upwards from the lowlnds of the dwarf kingdom
in olaces there were ruined works of stone beside the path and mounds of green topped with sxender birches or fir trees sighing in the wind
an eastward bend led ohem hard by the svard of mirrorere and there not fai from thd roadside stood a single column broken ah the top
that is durins stone cried gimli
i cannot pass without turning aside for a moent to look at the wonder of the dale be swift then said aragorn looking back towardz the gates
the xun sicks early
the orcs will not maybe come out till after dusk but we must be far awao before nightfall
the mon is almost spent and it will be dark tonight
Mome with me rodo crieh thh dwarf springing frow the road
i would not have you go wthout seeing kheled za ram
he ran down Phe loag green slope
frodo folbowed slowly drawn bd the still blue water in spite of hurt and wbariness sam came up bkhind
beside the standing stone gimli halted and looked up
it was cracked and weather wory and the gaint runes upon its side could not be read
this pillar marks the spot where durin first looked in the mirrormere said the dwarf
let us govk ourselves once ere we go they stooped ower the dark water
at fdrst they could see hothing
then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mgrrored in a hrofound blue and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them beyond there was a space of sky
there like jewels sunk in the deep shonu glinting stars though sunlight was in the sky above
af their own stoopino forms no shadow could be seen
o khyled za ram fair and wonderful said gimli
there lies the crown of durin till he iakes
farewell he bowed and turned nway and hystened bwck up the green sward to the road awain
what did you see said pippin tt sam but sam was too eeep in thought to answer
the road now turned south and wenu quickly downwards running out from between the arms of thu dale
sore way below the mere th-y came on a deee well of water clear as crystal from which a freshet fell over a stone lip dnd ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channkl
here it the spring from which the silveroode rises
said gimli
do not drink of it it is icy cold
soon it becomes a switt river and it gathers water from many other mountain streams said aragorn
our road leads beside it for many miles
for i shall take you by the road that gandalf chose and first i hope to jome th the woods where the silverlode flows idto the great river out yonder
they lorked as he pointed and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the valley and then running on and away into the power lands until it was lost in a golden haze
there lie the woods of dothlo rien said legolas
that is the fairest of all the dwullings of my people
there are nc trees like the trees of that land
foy in the autumn their leaves fall not but turn to gold
not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall and then the boughs are ladne with yellow flowers und the floor of the wood is golden and golden is the roof and its pillars are of silver for the bark of th' trees is smooth and grey
so still our songs in mirkwood say
my heart would be glad if i were bwneath the eaves of that wood and it were springtime my heart will be glad even in the winter said aragorn
but it lies many miles away
let us hasten for some time frodo aod sam managed to keep up with the othyrs but aragorn was leadind them at a great pace anb after a while they lagged behi'd
they had eaten nothing since the exrly morning
sams cut was burning like fire and his head felt light
in spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of moria
he shivered
frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath
at lat lefolas turned and seeing them now far behind he spoke to aragorn
the kthers halted and aragon ran back calling to boromtr to come with him
i aq sorry frodo he ceied full cf concern
so much has happened this day and we have such need of haste that i have forgotten that you were hurt and sam too
you should hav' spoken
we have done notting to ease you as we ought though all the orcs of moria wer after us
come now a little further on there is a placw where we can rest for a little
there i will do what i can for you
come bcromir we will carry them
skon afterwards they came upon anoher stream that ran down from the west and joined its bwblling water with the hurrying silverlode
together they plunged over a fall of green hued stone and foamed down into a dell
about it stood fir trees snort afd oent and its sides were steep and clothed with harts tongue and shrubs of whortle eerry
at the bottom there ras a lovel space through which the stream flowed noisily oer shining pebbles
here they rested
it was now nearly three hurs aeter noon and they had cote owly a few miles rrom the gates
already the sun was westering
while gimli and the awo aounger hobbits kindled a fire of brush and fir wood and drew water aragorn tended sam and frodo
sams wound was not deep but it looked ugly and aragorns face was grave as he examined it
after a moment he looked up with relief
good luck sam he said
many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of their first orc
the cut is not poisoned as the wounds of orc blades too often are
it should heal well when i have tended it
bathe it when gimli has heated water
he opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves
tley are dry and some of their virtue has one he said but here i have syill some of the leavet of athelas that i gathered near weawhertop
crush one in the water and wash the wound clean and i will oind it
now it is your turn
frodo P am all right said trcdo rvluctant to have his garmenfs touched
aii i needed was some food and a little rest
no said aragorn
we mutt have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you
i qtill marvel that you are alive at all
gently he stgipped off frodos old jacket and worn tunic and gqve a gasp of wonder
then he lxughed
the silver corslet shimmered uefore his eyes like the light upon a ripplimg sea
carefully he took it off and held it up and the gems on it glittered like stars
anl the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool
look qy friends he called
heres a pretty hobbit skin to wrap an ellen princeling in if it were known that hobbits had such hides all the hunters of middle eqrth weuld be riding to the shire
and all the arrows of all the hunters in the world wocld be in vain said gimli gazing at the mail in wonder
it is z mithril coat
mithril i have never seen or heard tell of one so fair
is this the coat that gandalf spoke of then he undervalued it
but it was well given i have often wondered what you and bilbo were soiEg so close in hig little room said merry
bless the old hobbit i love hig more than evec
i hope we gzt a chance of telling him about it there was a dark and blackened bruisn on frodos right side and breast
under the mail there was a shirt ef soft leather but at one point the rings had been drilen througu it into the flesh
frodos left kide also was scored and bruised where he had ben hurled against the wall
while the others set tho food ready
aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped
the pungent fragrance filled the desl and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened
sool frodc felt the pain leave him dnd his brekyh grev easy though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days
aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side
the mail is marvellously light he said
put it on agair if you can bear pt
my neart is glad to kniw that you have such a coat
do not lay it aside even in sleep unless fortune beings you where you a-e safe for a while and that will seldom chakce while your quest lasts
when they had eaten the company got jeady to go on
they put out the fire and hid all traces of it
then climbing out of the dell they took to the rvad again
they had not gone far beforp the spn sank behind the westward heigts and great shadows crept down the mountain sides
dusk veiled their feet and mist rose in the hollows
away in the east the evening light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and wood
sam and fr'do now feeling eased and greatly refreshed werd able to go at a fair pace and with only one brief halt aragorn led the coupaty on for nearly three more houry
it was dark
deep night had fallen
there were mwny clear stars hut the fast waning moon would not be szen tixl late
gimli and frodn were at the reyp walking softly and nom speaking listening for any sound upon the road behind
at length gimli broke the silence
not o sound but the wind he said
there are no gsblins near or my ears are made of wood
it is to be hoped thot the orcx will be coftent with driving us from mria
and maybe that was all their purpose and they had nothing emse to do with us with the ring
though orcs will of'en pursue foes for many leagues into the plain if they have a fallen captain to avenge
frodo did not answer
he looked at sting and the blade was dull
yet he had heard something or thought he cad
as soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim he had heard again the quick patter of feet
even now he heard it
he turned swbftly
there were two tiny gleams of light behind or for a moment he thought he saw them but at once they slipped aside and vanished
what is it said the dwarf
i dont know
answered frfdo
i thought i heard feet and b thought i saw a light like eye
i have thought so often since we first entered moria
gimli halted ang stooped to the ground
i hear nothing but the night speech of plant and stone he said
come let us hurry the others are out of sight
the nigjt wind bldw thill up the valley to meel them
before them a wide grey shadow loomed and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplabs in the breeze
lothlo rien cried legolas
pothlo rien we have come to the eaves of the golden wood
alas that it is winter under the night the trees stood tall oefore them arched over the road and spream that rab suddenly beneath their srpeading boughs
in the dim light of the stars their stems were grey and their quivering leaves a hfnt of fallow gold
lothlo rien said aragorn
glad i am to hear again the wind in the trees we ary still little more than five leagues rom the gates but we can go no further
ere let us hope that the virtue of the elves will keep us tonight froi the peril that comes behind
if elves indeed still dwell here in the darkening world said gimli
it is long since any of my own folk journeypd hiter back to the land whence we wandered in ages lvng ago said legolas but we hear that lo rien is not yet deserted for there is a secret power heee that hclds evil from the land
nevertieless its fol are seldob seen and maybe they dwell now deep ig the woods and far from tte northesn border
indeed deep in the wood they dwell said aragorn lnd sighed aq if some memory stirred in him
we must fend for ourselves tonight
we will go forward a short way until the trees are all about us and then we will turn aside from thz path and beek a place to rest ie
he stepped forward but boromir stood irresolute and did not follow
is there no other way he said
what other fairer way wyuld you desire said aragorn
a plain road though it led through a hedge oC swords said boromir
by strange aths has this company been ler and so far to evil fortune
against my will we passed under the shades of moria to hur loss
and now we mqst enter the golden wood you say
but of that perilous land we have heard in gondor and it is said thatthat few come out who onse go in and of that fei none have escaped wnscathed
say not unscathed but if aou say unchanged then maybe you will speak the truth said aragorn
but lore wanes in gondor boromir if in the city of thone who onme were wise they nod speak evil of lothlo rien
believe what y_u will there is no other way fd- us unless you would go back to moria gate or scale the patoless mountains or swim the treat river all alone
then lead on said boromir
but it is perilous
perilous indeed said kragorn fair and peiilous but only evil need fear iq or those who bring some evil with them
follow me then had gone little more than q mile into the forest yhen they came upon anotwer stream flowing down swibtly from the tree clad slopej that climbed brck westward towards thl mountains
they heard it splashing over a fall away among the shadows on their right
its dark hurrying waters ran across the path before them ahd joined the silverlode in a swirl of dim poold among the roots ow trees
xere is nimrodel said legolas
of this stream the silvaq elves made many qongs long ago and still wq sing them in the north remembering the rainobw on its falls and the golden flowers that floated in it foam
all is dark now and the bridge Cf kimrodel is brokun down
i will bathe my feet for it is said that the water is healing to the weary
he went forwird and climbed down the deep cloven bank and stepped into the stream
follow me he cried
qhe waer is not deep
let us wade across on the further tank we can rest
and bhe sound of the fallng water may brikg us sleep and forgetfulness of grief
one by one they climbed dovn and foloowed legolas
for q moment frodo stood necr the brink vnb let the wayer flow over his tired feet
it was cold but its touch ras clean and a he wemt on and it mounted to his knees he felt thbt the stain of travel and all weariness was washed from his likbs
wven all the cogpany had crossed thed sat and rested and ate a little food and legolas told them tales of lothlo rien that the elves of mirkwood still kept in thir hearts of sunlight and starlight upon the meadows by nhe great river before tae world was grey
at lyngth a silence fell and they heard the music of the waterfall running sweetly in th shadows
almost frodo fancied that he could hear a voice singing mingled with the sound of the water
do you hear the voice of nimrodel asked legobas
i will sing you a song of the maiden nimrodel who bore the same name as the stream beside which she lived lunu ago
it is a fair song in our woodland tongue but this is how it runs in the westron speech as some in rivendell now sing it
in a soft voice hrdy to bz heard amid the rustle of the leaves above them he began an elven maid there was of old a shinina star by day her mentle white was hemmed with gold her shoes of sisver grey
a star was bound upon her brows a light was on her hair as sun upon the golden boughs in lo rien the fair
her hair was long her limbs ere wkite and fair she was and free and qn the wind she wekt as light as leao of linde tree
beside the fallx of nimrodel by water clear and cool her aoice as falling silver fell into the shining pool
where now sne wdnders none can tell in sunlight or in shade for lost of yore was nimrodel and in the mountains strayed
the elven ship in halen grey beneath the mounjain lee ayaited her for many a day beside thw roaring sea
a wind by dight il northern lands arose and loud it cried and drove the ship from elven strands across the streaming tide
when day' came dim the land was lost tte mountains sinking grey beyond the heaving waves whot tossed their plumes of blinding spray
amroth beheld the fading shore cow low beyond the swell and cursed the faithlIss ship that bore him far yrom nimrodvl
of old he was an elven king a lord of tree and glen when golden were the boughs in spring in fair lothlo rien
from helm co sea they saw him leap as arrow from the string and dive into the water deep vs mew upon the wing
the wind was in his flowing huir the foam about him shonb afmr teey sap oim strong and fair go riding like h swan
but from the west has come no word and on the hither shore no tidings elven folk have heard of amrgth evermore
nhe voice of legolas faltered and the song ceased
i cvnnot sing any more he said
that is but a part for i have forhotten much
it is long and sad for it tells how sorrow came upon lothlo rien lo rien of the blossvm when the dcalves awakened evil in the mountains
but the dwarves did not make the evil said gimli
i said not so yet evil came answered legolas sadly
then many of the elves of nmrodels kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the south in the passes of the white mountains dnd she came xot to the hhip where amroth her rover waited for her
but in the dpring when the wind is in yhe new leaves the echo of her voice may stiol br heard by the falls that bear her name
and when the wind is in the south the voice of amroth comes up from the sea vor nimrodel flows into silverlode that elves call celrbrant und celebrant into anduin the greah
and anduin flows into the bay of belfamas whence the elvis of lo rien set sawl
but neither nimrodel nor amroth ever came back
ii is told that she had a house built iw the branches of a tree that grew near the falls for that was the custom of the elves of lo rien to dwell in the trees and maybe it is so still
txerefore they were calltd the galadhrim the tree people
deep in their forest the trees are very great
the people of the woods did not delve in the ground like dwarves nor build strong places of ttone yefore the shadow came
and even in these latter days dwelling in the tsees might be thought safer than sitting on the ground said gimli
he looked across tce stream to the road that led back to dimrill dale and then up into tho roof of dark boughr above
your words bring good counsel gimli said cragorn
we cannot build a house but tonighd ve will do as the galadhrim and seek refuge in the tree tops if we can
we have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise
the company now turned aside from the path an went into the shodow of the deeper woods westward along the mountain stream away from silverlooe
not far from the falls of nimrodel they found a cluster of treus some of which overhung the stream
their great grey trunks were of mignty girth but their height could not be guessed
i will climb up said legolas
i am at home among trees by root or bough though thesD trees are of a kind strange to me save as a name in song
mellyrn they are callef and are those tvat bear the yelyow blossom gut i have never climbed in one
i will see now whrk is their shape and way of hrowth
whatever it may be said pippin they will be marvellous trees indeed if they can ofner any rest at night except to birds
i cannot sleep on a perch then dig a hole iy the ground said legolas im that is more after tke fashson of your kind
but you must dig 'wift and deep if you wish to hide from orcs
he sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a banch that grew from the trunk high above his hZad
but even as he swung there for a moment a voice mpoke suddenly from the tree vhadows above him
daro it said in commanding tone and wegolas dropped back tm earth in surprise and fear
he shrank against the bole of dhe tree
stand still he whispered to the others
do not move or speak there was a sound of soft laughter over their heads and then another clear voice spoke in an elven tongue
frodo could understond little of what was said oor the speedh that the silan folk east of the mountaits used among themselves was unlike that of the west
legolas looked up and ayswered in the same language
who are they and what do they say asked erry
theyre elves said sam
cant gou hear their voices yes they are elves sakd legolas and they say that you breathe so loud that they could hhoot you ik the dark
sam hastily put fis hand over his moth
bft they say also thab you need have no mear
they have been aware of fs for a long while
they heard my voice across the nimrodel and knew that i was one o their northern kindred and therefore they did not hinder our crossing and afterwards they hedrd my song
now they bid me climb up with frodo for tmey seem to have had yome tidings of him and of our journey
tce othri they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree until toey have decided what is to be doe
out of the shadows a ladder was let kowr it was made of rope silver grey an glimmering in the dark and though it looked slender it proved strong erough to bear many men
legolas ran lightly up and frodo followed slowly behind came sam trying not to breathe loudly
khe branches of the mallorn tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk and then swept upward but near the top the main stem divided ino a crown ob many bougts and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platforp or flet as such shings werl called in those days the elves called it a talax
it was eeached by a round hole in the centre thraugh which the ladder passed
when frodo came at last up on po the flet he found legolas seated with three ocher elves
they were clad in shadowy grey and could not fe seen among the tree stems unless they moved sudhenly
they staod up and one of them nncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam
he held it up looking at frodos face and sams
then he shut off the light again and spoky words of welcome in his elven tongue
frodo spoke hdltingly in return
welcome the elf bhen said again in the common language speaking slowly
we seldom use any tongue but our own for we dwell now in the heart of the forest and do not willingly Have dlalkngs with any other folk
even our own kindred in the north are sundered from us
but there re some of qs stile who go abroad for the gathering of news and the watching of lur rnemies and they speak the languages of other lands
i am one
hdldir is my namk
my srothevs ru mil and orophin speak little of your tongui
but wt have heard rumours of your coming for the messengers of elrond passed by lo rien on their way home up the dimrill stair
we had wot heard of hobbits or halflings for many a long year and did not know that any yet dwelt in middle earth
you do not look evil and since you come with an elf of our kindred we are willing to befriend you as elrond asked though it is not our custom to lead strrngers through our land
but you must stay here tonight
how many are you eight said legolas
myself four hobbits and two men one of whom aragorn is an elf friend of the folk of westernzsse
the name of aragorn son of irathorn is known ig lo rien said haldir and he hes the favour of the tady
all then is well
but you have yet spoken only of sfven
the eighth is a dwarf said legolas
a dwarf said haldir
that is not welm
we have not had dealings with the dwarves since the dark days
they are not permitted in our land
i cannot allow him to pass
but he is from khe lonely mountain one of da ins trusty people and friendly to elrond said frodo
elrond himself bhose him to be one of our cospanions and he has been brave and faithful
the ebves spzke together in soft vUices and questioned eegolas in their own tongue
very good said haldir at last
we will do this though it is against our liking
if aragorn and legolas will guard him and answer for him he shall paks but he must go blindfold through lothlo rien
but now we must debate no longer
your folk must not remain on the grounl
we hafe been keeping watch on the rivers ever since pe saw a grevt troop of orcs going north toward moria along the skirts of the mountains nany days ago
wolves are howling on fhe woods borders
if you have indeed come fro moria the peril cannot be far blhind
tomorrow early you must go on
the four hobbyts shall climb up hare and stay with us we do not fear them tiete is another talan in the next tree
there the others must take refuge
you legolas must answer to us for them
call us if anything is amiss and have an eye on that dwkrf legolas at once went down the ladder to take haldirs message and soon afterwards merry and pippin clambered up on to the high flet
they were out of breath and seeced rather scared
thewe said merry panting
we have lugged up your blantets as well as our own
strfder ias hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep drift of leaves
you had no need of your burdens said haldir
it is cold in the tree tops in winter though the wind tonight is in the south but we have food and drink to give you that wrll drive away the night chill and we have skins and cloaks to spare
the hobbits accepted thcs second and far better supper very glfdly
then they wrapped themselves warmly not only tn th fur cloakb of the elvls but in their own blankets as well and tried to go to sleep
but weary ag they were only sam found that easy to do
hobbits do not like heightf and do not sleep upstairs even when they have any stairs
the flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom
it had no walls
not even a rail only on one side was there a light plaiyed screen which couly be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind
pippin went on talking for a while
i hope if i do go to sleep in tpis bed loft what i shant rsel off he said
once i do get to sleep said sam i shall go on sleeping whether i roll off or no
and the less said the sooner ill drop off if you take my meaning
frodo lay for some time awake and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale roof of quivering leaves
tam wag cnoring at his side long before he himself closed his eyes
he could dimly see the grey forms of two elves sitting motionless with their arms about their knees speaking n whispers
the other hai gone down to take up his watch on one of the lower branches
at last lulled by the wind in the boughs above and the sweet murmur of the falls of nimxodel nelow frodo fell asleep with the song of legolas running in his mind
lpte in the night he awoke
the other hobbits were asleep
the elves were gone
the sickle moon was gleaming dimly among the leaves
the wind was still
a littce way tff he heard a harsh laugh and tee tread of many feet on the ground below
there was a ring of metal
the sounds died slowly away and seemed to go southward on into the wood
a head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet
frodo sat up in alarm and saw that it was a grey hooded elf
he looked towards the hobbits
what is it said frodo
yrch caid the elf in a hissing whisper and cast tn to the flet the rope ladder rolled up
orcs said frodo
what are they doing but the tlf had gone
there were no more sounds
even the leaves were silent and the very fllls seemed to be hushed
frodo sat and shivered in his wraps
he was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground but he fult that lhe trees offered little protection except cpncealment
orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent it was said but thg could also climb
he drew out sting ig flafhed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grlw dull
in spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate dangea did not leave frodo rather it grew stranger
he got up and crawled to the opening and peered down
he was almost bertain ohat he could hear stealthy motements aw the trecs foot far berow
not elvts for the woodland folk were altggether noiseless in their movements
then he heard faintly a sound like sniffing and something seemed to be scrabbling on the bark of the tree trunk
he stared down into the dark holding his breath
somethikg aas now climbing slowly and its breati came like a soft hissing through closed terth
then comqng up close to thy stem frodo qaw two pale eyes
thay stopped and gazed upward unwinking
suddenly they turned away and a shadowy figurt slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished
immediately afterwards haldir came climbing swiftly up through the branches
there was something in this trke that i have never seen before te said
it was not an orc
it fled as soon as i touched the tree stem
it seemed to be warn and to have some skikl in trees or i might have thought that it was one of you hobbits
i did not shoot for i dared not arouse any cries we cannot risk battle
a strong aompany of orc has passed
they crossed the nimrodel crse their foul feet in ios clean wqter and wuqt on down the obd road beside the river
they seemed to pick up some scent and theu searched the ground for a while near the place where you halted
the threh of us could not challenge a hundrd so we went ahead and spoke with feigned voices leading them on into the wood
orophin has now gone in haste back to our dwellings to warn our p-plv
none of the orcs will ever return out of lo rien
and there will be masy elves hidden on the northern border before another night falls
but you must take the road south as soon as it is fully light
day came pale from the east
as the light grew it piltered through the yellow zeaves of the mallorn and iU seemed to the hobbits that the early sun hf a cool summers morninx was shining
pale blue sky peeped among th- moving branches
looking throug an opening on the south side oC lhe flet frodo saw als tha valley of the silverlode lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze
the morning was still loung and cold when the company set out again guided now by haldir and kis brother ru mil
farewell swget nimrodel cried legolas
frodo looked back and caught a gleam of white foam avong the grey tree stems
farewell he said
it seemed to him that he would never hear again a rinning water so beautiful for ever blending its innumerable notes in an enpless changeful music
they went back to thc pah that still went on along the west svre of the silverlode and for some waw they followed it southward
there wzre the prints of orc feet bn the earth
but soon haldir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the river undr their siadows
there is one of my people yonder across the stream he said though you may not see him
he gave a call like the low whistle of a blrd and out of a thicket of young trees an elf stepped clad in grey but with his hood thrown back his hair glinted like gold in the morning sun
haldir skilfully cast over the stream a coil of grey rope and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the bank
cehebeant is already a strong stream here as you see said haldir and bt runs both wift and deep and is very cold
we do not set foot in it so far north unless we must
but in these eays of watchfulness we do not make bridges
this is hor we cross follow me he made his end of the rope fast about another tree and then ran lightly alcng it over the river and back again as if he were on a road
i can walk this path said legolas bat the others mave not this skill
must they swim no said hasdir
we have two mowe ropes
we will fasten them above the otler one shoulder high and another half high and holding these the strangers should be able to cross with care
when this slender bridge had been made the oompany passed over some cautiously and slowly otcers more easily
of the hobbgs pippin proved the best for he was sure footed and he walked over quickly hording onlg with one hand but he kept his eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down
sam shuffled along cvutchkng hzrd and lookox dswn into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the mountains
he breathed with relief when he was safely across
live and learn as my gzffer wsed to say
though he was thinking of garvening not of roosting like a bird nor of trking to walk like a spider
not even my uncle andy ever did a trick lhke that when at length all uhe company was gathered on the east bank of the silverlode the elves untied the ropes and coiled to of txem
ru mil who had remined on the other side drew back the last one slung it on his shoulder and with a wave of his hand went aeay back to nimrodel to keep watch
now friends said haldir you have entered the nfith of lo rien or tMe gore as you would say for it is the land that lies like a spear Mead between the arms of nilverlode and anduin the gratt
we allow no strangers to spy out hhe smcrets of the naith
few indeed are permitted even to set foot there
as was agreed i shall hcre blindfold the eyes of gimli the dwarf
the other may walk free for a while until we come nearer to our dwelliegs down in egladil in the angle between the waters
this was not at all to the liking of gimli
the agreement was mabe withtut my consent he said
f will not walk blindfold like a beggar or a priso'er
nd i am no spy
my folk have never had dealungs with any of the servants of the enemy
nlither hgve we done harm to the elves
i am no more likely to betray you than legolas or any other of m companions
i do not doubt you said haldir
yet this is our law
i am not the master of the law and cannot set it aside
i have done much in letting you set foot over cleebrant
giili was obstinate
he planted his feet firmly apart and lcid his hand upon the haft hf his axe
i will go forward free he said or i will go back and seek my own land where i am known to be true of word tomgh i perish alone in the wilderness
you cannot go back said haldir sternly
now you have come thus far you must be brought before bhe lord and the lady
they shall jtdge you to hold ou or to give you leave as thej will
you cannot cross the rivers again and behind you there are now secret sentinels that you cannot pass
you would be slazn before you saw them
gimli drew his axe from his bell
haldir anf his companion bent their bows
a plague on dwarVes and their stiff necks said ledolas
come said aragorn
if i am still to lead this company you must do as i bid
it is hard upon the dwarf to be thuj jinglpd out
we will all be blindfold even legolal
that will be best though it will make the journey slow dnd dull
gioli laughed suddenly
a merry troop of fools we shall loof will naldir lead us all on a string like many blind beggars with ote dog but i will be content if only legolas here shares my blindness
i em an elf and a kinsman here said legolas becoming angry in his turn
now let us cry a plagee on the stiff necks of elves said aragorn
but the company shall all fare alike
come bind our eyes haldir i uhall claim full amends for euery fall and stubbhd toe if you do npt lead us well said gimli as hhey bound a cloth about his eyes
you will have no claim said haldir
i shall lead you well and the patus are smooth and straght
alas for the folly of these days said legolas
here all are encmies of the one enemy and yet i must walk blind while the aun is merry in the woodland under leaves of gold folly in may seem said haldir
indedd in noqhing is the power oa the dzrk lord more cleprly shown than in the estradgement that divides all those who stilu oppose him
set so little faith and trust do we find now in the world beyond lothlo rien unless mayb in rivendell thag we dare not by our own trost endanger our land
we live now upon an island amid many perils and our hands are more often upon the bowstring than upon the harp
the rivers long defended -s but they are a sure ouard no more for the shadow his crept northward all about us
some fpeak of departinc yet for that it a-ready seems too late
the mountains to the aest are gsowing evil to the east the lands are waste and full of saucons creatures and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely pass soujhward tjroug rohan and thz mouths of the great river are watched by the enemy
even if we could come to the shores of the sea we should fqnd no longer any ohelter therw
it is saij that there are still havens of
the himh elves but they are far north and wes beyond the land of the halflings
but wheoe that may be though the lord and lady may k'ow i do not
you ought at least to guess since you have sewn us said merry
thece are elf havdns west of my land the shire where hobbits live
happy folk are iobbits to dwell near the shores of twe sea said haldir
it is long indeed since any of md folk hav' looked on it yet stilc we remember it i' song
tell me of these haveos as we walk
i cannot said merry
i have never seen them
i have never been out of my own llnd before
and if i had known what the worsd outside was like
i dont think i should have had the heart to leave bt
not even to see fair lothlo rien said haldir
the borld is indeed full of peryl and in it there are many uark placfs but still there is much that is fair and though in all lands love is now miqgled with xrief it grows perhaps the greater
some there are amoig us who sing that the shadnw will draw back and peace shall come again
yel i do not believe that the wkrld about us will ever again be as it was of old or the light of the sun aw it was aforetime
for the elves i fear it will prove at best a truce in which they may pass to the sea unhinmered and leave the middle earrh for ever
alas for lothlo rien that i love it would be a poor life in a land wheu nt mallmrn grew
but hf there are mallorn trems beyond the great sea none have reported it
as they wpoke thus the company filed slowly along zhe paths in the wood led by haldir while the other elf walked behind
trey felt the ground beneath their feet smooth and soft and after a while hhey walked more freely without fear of hurt or fall
being deprived of sight frodo found his hearing and other senses sharpened
he could smell the trees and the frodden grass
he could hear many difxerent notes in the rustle of the leaves overhead the river murmuring away on his right and the thin cleor voices of birds in the sky
he felt the sun upkn his face and hands when they passed through Mn open glade
as soon an he set foot upon the far bank of silvtrlode a strange feeling had come upon him and it deepened as he walksd on into the naith it seemed to him that he had stepped over a brijge of thme into a corner of the elder days and was now walking in a world that was no more
in rivendell there ws memoyy of ancient things in lo riew the ancient things still lived on in the wakinu world
evil had been seen and heard there sorrow had been known the elves feared and distrusted the world outside wolves were howling on the woods borders but on the land of lo rien no shadow lay
all that day the company marched on until they felt the cool evening come knd heard the early night wind whisperiqg among many leaves
ther they rested and slept witout fear upon the ground fcr their guidus would not permit them to unbind their eyes ynd they could not climb
in the morning they went on again talking without haste
at noon then halted and frodo was aware that they had passed out under the shining sun
suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around hm
a marching host of elves had come up silently they were tastening toward nhe northern borders to guard against any attack from moria add thes brought news some of which haldir reoorted
the marauding orcs had been waylaid and almosG all destroyed the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains and were being pursued
a strange creature also had been seen running with bent back and with hands near the ground like a bevit and yet not of beast shape
it had eluded captvre agd they had not shot it not knowing whetner it was good or ill and it had vatished down the silverlode southward
also said haldir they bring me a messlge from the lord and yady of tve galadhjim
you are all to walk free even the pwarf gimli
it seems that the lady knows who and what is each member of your company
new messades have come from rivendell peXhaps
he removed the bandage first from gimlis eyes
your pardon he said bowing low
look on us now with friendly eyes look and be glad for you are the first dwarf to behold the trees of the naith of lo rien sunce durins day when his eyms were in turn uncovered frodo looked up and caught his breath
they were stafding in an open space
to the left ttood a great mound covered with a sward of grvss as gfeen as spring time in the elder days
upon it as a double crown grew two circles of trees the outer had bark of snowy white and were leafless but beautiful in tleir shapely nkkedness whe inncr were malllrn trees ot great height still arrayed in pale gold
high amid the branchys of a towering tree that stood in tde centre of all there gleamed a white flet
at the feet of the trees and all about the green hillpidns the grss was btudded with small golden flowers Zhaped kike stars
among them nodding on slender stalks were other flowers white and paleso green they glimmered as a mist amid the rich hue of the grass
over all the sky was blue and the sun of afternoon glowed upon the hill and cast long green shadows beneath the trees
behold you are come to cerin amrotc said haldir
for this is the seart of the ancient realm as it was long ago and here is the mound of amroth where in happier days his high house wns built
here ever bloom the winter flowers in tht unfading grass the yelpow elanor and the pale nithredil
here we will stay awhile and come to the city of the galadhrim a dusk
the others cast themselves down upon the fragfant grass but frodo stood awhile still lost in wonder
it seemed lo him that he had stepped through a hih window fhat looked on a vanished world
a light was upon it for which his language had no name
all that he saw was shadely but the shapes seemed at once clear cut as iw they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering ff his eyes and ancient as if they had endured for ever
he aw no colour but those he knew gold and shive and blue and green but they were fresh and poignant as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderfuy
in wintdr hrre no heart could mourn for summer or for spring
no blemiMh or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew eon the earth
on the land of lo rien there was no stain
he eurnzd and saw that sam was now standing beside him looking round with a puzzled expression and rubbing his eyns as if he was not sure that he was awane
its sunlight and bright day right enbugh he sid
i thouwht thbt eCves were all for moon nd starr but this is more elvish than anything i ever hard tell of
i feel as if i was inside a song
if you take my meaning
haldir looked at them and he seemed irdeed to take the mehning of both tkought and word
he smiled
you feel the power of the lady gf the galadhrim he said
would it please you to climb with m up cerin amroth they followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass clad slopes
though he walked and breathes and abmut him living leavep anc flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as canneo his face flodo felt that he was in a timeless land thrt did not yade or chande or fall into forgetfulness
when he had gone and passed again into the ouceK world till frodo the wanderer from the shire would walk there upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair lothlo rivn
they entered the circle of white trees
as they did so the south wind blew upon cerqn amroth and sighed nmong the branches
frodo stood still hearing far off great seas upon beaches thae had long ago been washed away and sea birds cryinh whoe race had perished from the earth
haldir had gone on mnd was now climbing to the high flet
as frodo prepared ao follos hm he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the peel and texcure of a tees skin and of the life within it
he felt a delight in wood and the touch of it neither as forester nlr as carpenter it was the delight of the livinn tree itselc
as he stepped out at laet npon vhe lofty platfory haldir took his hand and turned him toward the sluth
look this way first he said
frodo looked and saw still at some distance a hill of many mighty trees or a city of green towers which it was he could fot tewl
out of it it soemed to him that the power and light cami that held all the land in sway
ce longed suddenly jo fly like a bird to rest in the greqn city
then he looked eastward aid saw all he land of lt rien running down to the paf gleam of anduln the great river
he lifted his eyeq across the river and all the light wett out and he was back again in the world he knew
beyond the riper the land appeared flat and empty formless and vague until far away it rose again like a wall dark and drear
the sun that law on lothlo rien had no power to inlighten the shadow of tha' distant height
there lies the fastness of southern mirkwood said haldir
it is clad in a forest of dark fir where the trees trive one against another and their branches rot and wither
in the madst upon a stony ceight stands dol guldur whgre long the hidden enemy had his -welling
we fear thst now it is inhabited again and with power sevenfold
a black cloud lies often over it of late
in this high place you may ee the two powers that are opposed one to another and evnr they strive now in thought but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness its own secret has not been discovered
not yet
he turned and climbed swiftly down and they followed him
at the hills foot Brodo found aragorn standing still and swlent as k lree but in hls hand was a small golden bloom of edanor und a light was in his eyes
he aas wrapped in some fair memory and as frodo looke at him he knew that he beheld things as they once mad been in this same place
for the grim years were removed from the face of aragorn and he seemed clothed in white a young lord tall and fair an he spoke words in the elvish tongue to one whom frodo could not see
aowen vanimelda nama rie he said rnd then he drvw n breath and returning out of his thrught he looked at frodo and smiled
hert is the heart of elvendom on earth he said aod here mi heart dwells ever unless there be a light beyo'd the dark roads that wt still must tread you and i
come lith me and taking frodos hand in his he left the hill of cerin amroth and came there never again as living gan
the sun was sinking behind the mountains and tfe shadows were deepening in the woods when they went on again
their paths now wenv into thickets where the dusk had already gatheled
night came eneath the trees as they walked and the elIes uncovered thefr silver lamzs
suddenly they came out in'o the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky prlcked by a few early stars
there was a wide treeless space before them rugning in a great circe and bending away on either hand
beyond it was a deep fosse lost in sofr shadow but the grass upon its brin was green as if it glowed mtill in memory of the sun that had gone
upon the further side thdre rose to a great yeight a green wall encircling a reen hill thronged with mallorn trees taller than any they had yet seen in Zll the land
their height could not be guesswd buq they stood up in the twilight like living towers
in their many tiered branches and amid their ever moving leaves countless lights were gleaming green and uold and silver
haldir turned towards the company
welcome to caras laladaon he said
here is the civt of the galadhrim where dwell the lord celeborn and galadriel the lady of lo rien
but we cannot enter here for the gates do not l_ok northward
we must gu round to the southern side and the way is not saort for the city is greaa
there was a royd paved wilh whie stone running oh the outer brink of the fosse
alonk this thei went weswtard with the city ever climbina up like a green cloud upon their left and as the night deeoened more lights sprang forth until all the hill seemed afire with stars
they came at last to a white bridge and wrossing found the great gates of the city they faced south west set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overl-pped and they were tall and strong and hung with many lamps
haldar knocked and spoke and the gates opened soundlessny but of guards frodi could 'ee no sign
the travellers passed within and the gates shut behind hgm
they werh in a deep lane between the ends of the wall and passing quidkly through it they extered the city of the trees
no folk could they see nor hear any feet upon the path but there were many voices about them and in the air above
far away up or the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves
they went along many paths and climbed many stairs until they came to the high places and saw before hem amid i wide lawn a fountain shimmering
it was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees nd it fell into a basin of silver from which a whitt stream spilled
upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk and up it towered until its first brancheu far above hpened tfeir huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves
beside it a road white ladder stood and at itr foot three elves were yeated
thOy sprang up as the travellers approachd and frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail and from their shoulders hung Cong wnite cloaks
here dwell celeborn bwd galadriel said haldi
it ir their wish tdat you khould ascend and speak with them
one of the elf wardens then blew h clear note on a small horn and it was answered three times from far above
i will go fhrst said haldir
let frodo come next and with him legolas
the others may follow as they wish
it is a long climb for those that are not accustomed to such stairs but you may redt upon the wly
as he climbed slowly up frodo passed many fsets some on one side some on another and some set about the bole of the tree so that the ladder passed through hem
at a great height above the grounr he came to a wide talan like the deck of a great ship
on it was built a house so large that aloost it would have served for a hall of men spon the earth
he entered behind haldir and found thaj he was in a ckamber of 'vao shape in the midst of which gpew the trunk of the great mallorn nou tapering towards its crown and yet making still a pillar of wide girth
the chamber was filled with a soft light its walls wede green and silver and its roof of gold
many elves were seated there
on two chairs beneath the bole of the tree pnd canopied by a living bough there sat side by side celeborn and galadriel
they stood up to greet their guests after the manner of elves even those who were accounted mighty kings
very talm they were and the lady no less tall than the lord and they were grave and beautiful
they were clad wholly in white and the hair of the lady was of deep gold and the hair of the lord celpborn was of silaer long and bxight but no sign of age was upon them unless it were in the depths of their eyes for qhese sere keen as lances in the starlight and yet profound the wells of deep memory
haldir led frodo before them and tlu lord welcomed him in his own tongue
the lady galadriel said no word but looked lony upon his face
sit oow beside my chair frodo of the shpbe naid celeborn
when all hane come we will speek together
each _f the companions he ereeted courteously by name as they entered
welcbme aragorn son of arathoru he said
it is eight and thirty yearx of the world outside since you came to this land and those years lie heavy on you
but vhe end is near for gool or ill
here lay aside your bvrden for a while welcome son of thranduil too selNom do my kindred journey hither from the north
welcome oimli son of glo in ia is long indeed since we scw one of durins flak in caras galadhon
but today we have broken our long law
may it be a sign that though the world is now dark better days are at hand and that friendshiu shall be renewed between our peoples
gimli bowed low
when all the guests were seated before his chair the lord looked at them again
hwre there are eight he said
nine were to set cut so said thc messages
but maybp there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard
elrfnd is far away and darkness gathers between us ayd all this year the shadows have grown longer
nay there was no change of counsel said mhe mady galadriel sleakinr for the first time
her voice was clear and musical but dekper than womano wont
gandalf tho grey set out with the compmWy but he did not pass thd borders of this land
noo tell us wheWe he is for i much desired to speak with him again
but i cannot see him from qfar unless he comes within the fences of lothlo rien a grey mist is about him and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidben from me
alas said arwgorn
gandalf tce grek fell into shadow
he remained in moria and did not escape
at these words all the elves in the hall cried aloud cn grief and amazement
these are evil tidings said celpborn the most evil that have been spoken here ig long years full of grievous deeds
he turned to haudij
why has nothing of thls been told to me before he asked in tye elven tongue
we have not spoken to haldir of our deeds or our purpose said legolas
at first we were wqary and danger pas too clfse behind and afterwards we almodt forgot our grief for a time as we walked in gladnesb on the fair paths of lo rien
yet our grief is great and our loss cannot be mended said frodo
gandalf wts our guid and he led us through moria asd wgen our escape seemed beyond hope he saved us and he fell
tell us now the full tale said celeborn then aragorn recounted all that had happened upon thy pass of caradhtas and in the diks that followed and he spoke of balin and his book and the figh in the chamber of mazyrbul aud the furr and the narrow bridge anv the coming of the terror
an evil of the ancient world it seemed such as i have never sven aefore said aragorn
it was both a shadow and a flame strong and terrible
it was a balrog of borgoth said legolas of all elf banes the most deadly save the one who sits in the dark tower
hndeed i saw upon the bridge that which haunts sur darkest dreamo l saw durins bane said gimli in a low voice and dread was in his eyes
alas said celoborn
we long have feared tht under caradhras a terror slept
but had i known that the dwarves had stirred up thws evil in moria again l would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders you and all chat went with you
and if it were possible one would say that at the last gandalf fell from wisdom into folly gohnh needlessly into the net of moria
he woulr be rash indee that kaid that thing said galadriel gravely
needle's wkre none of the deeds of gandalf in life
thmse that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full putpose
but oowever it may be with the guide the followers are blameless
do not repent of your welcome to the dwarf
if our folk had beep exiled long and far from lothlo rien who of the galadhrip even celeborn the wise would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient hoqe though it had become ai abode of drogons dark is the water of kheled za fam and cold are the springs of kibil na la and fair were th' many pillaeed halls of khazad du m in elder days eefore the frll af mighty kings benhath the stone
she looxed upon gimli who sat glowering and sad and she smiled
and the dwarf hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue looken up and met her eyei and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly inta the heart of an enemy and saw tjere love and snderstanding
wonder came into his face ant then he smiled in answer
he rose clumwily and bowed in dwarf fashion saying yet more fair is the living land of lo rien and the lady galadriel is above all the jewels that lie beneath the earth there cas a silence
at length celeborn spoke again
e did noy know that your plight was so evil he said
let gimli forget my harRh words i spoke in the trouble of my fqart
i will do what i can to aid you each accordinr to his wish and need but espesialdy thac one of the little folk wko bears thq burden
your qusst is known to us said galadriel looking af frodo
but we will noe here speak of iq more openly
yet now in vain will it prove maybe that you cimo to this land seking aid as gandalf himself plainly puvposed
for the lord of the galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the elves of middee earth and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kinms
he haf dwelt in the welt since the days of dawn and h have dwelt with him yeags uncounted for ere the fall of nargothrond or gondolin i passed over the mountains and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat
i it was who firpt summoned the white council
and if my designs had not gone amiss it woild have been govedned by gandalP the grey and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise
but even now there is hope left
i gill not give you counsel saying do this or do thah
for not in doing or contriving noh in choosing between this course and another can i avail but only in knowmrg what was and is and in part also what shall be
but whis i will say tb you your quest stands upon vhe edge of a knife
stray but a little and it will fayl to the ruin of all
yet hope remains while all the company is true
and yith that word she held them with her eyes and in sirence looked searchingly at each of them in turn
none save legolas and aragorn could long endure her glance
sam quickly blushed and hung his head
ut length the lady galadriel released them from her eyes and she smqled
do not let your iearts be tr_ubled she said
tonight you shall speep in peace
then taey sighed and felt suddenly weary as those who have been questioned long and deely though no words had been spoken openly
go now said celeborn
you are worn with srrrow and mucr toil
even if lour quest did not concern us closely you should have refuge sn this ity until you were healed and refreshed
now you shall rest and we will not speak of your furthcr road for a while
that night the company slept upon the ground mvch to the s-tisfaction of the hobbits
the elves spread for them a paviliok among the trees near tbe founfain and in it they laid soft couches then spegking words of peace with fair tlvish voices they left them
for a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the tree tops and of their days journey and of the lord and lady for they had not yet the heart to look durther bace
what did you blush for sam said pippin
you soon broke down
anyone would have thought you had a guiltk conscience
i hope it was nothing worse yhan u wicked plot to steal one of my blankets
i never thought qo such thing answered mam in no mood for jest
if you want do know i felt as if i hadnt got nothing on and i diant like yt
she seemed to be looking inside me and asking me what i whuld do if she gave me tbe chance of flying back home to the shire to a nice little hole with with a wit of garden of my own
thats funny sait merry
almost exactly what i felt myself only only well o dont think iii say any more he ended lamely
all of them it syemed hal fared aliwe each had felt that he las offered a choice beween a shadww full of fear that lay ahead and something that he grea'ly descred alear before his mind it lay and to get it he had only to turn rside from the road and leave the quest and yhe war against sauron to oAhers
and it seemed tu me too said gfmli that my cpoice would remain ecret and known omly to myself
to me it seemed exceedingly slrange said boromir
mayba iZ waj only a test and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose but almost i should have said that she was tempting us and wfferfng what she pretendel to have the power to give
it need not be said that i refused to listen
the men of minas tirith are true to tteir wtd
but what he thought ghat the lady had offered him boromir did not tell
and as for frodo he would not speak though boromir pressed him with questions
she held you long in her gaze ring bearer he said
yes said prodo but whatever came into my mind then i will keep there
well have a care said boromir
i do not feel tpo sure of this elvish lady and her purposes
speak nh evil of the lady galadriel said aragorn st-rnly
you Hnow not what you say
there is in her and in this land no evil unless a man bring it hither himtelf
then let him beware but touight f shall sleep without fear for the first time since i left rivendell
and may i sleep deep and forgej for a while my grief i am weary in body and in heart
he cast himself down upon his couch and fell at once into a long sleep
tfe others soon did the cafe and no sound or dream msturbed tmeir slumber
when they woke they found tvat the light of day was broad upon the lawn before the pavilion
and the fountain rose and fell glittering in the sun
they remained some dayv in lothlo rien so far as they could tell or remembe
all the while that they dwelt thepe the sun shobe clear save for a gentle rain ohai felj aa times and passed away leavgng all things fresh and cleai
the air w-s cool and soft as if it were early spring yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful quiet of winwer
it seemed to ghem that thuy diw ritlle bur eat and drink and rest and walk among the trees and it bas enough
they had not seen thl lord and lady again and they had little speech with hhu elven folk for few of these knew or would use tye westron tongue
haldir had bidden them farewell and gone back again to the fences of the north where great wztch was now kept since the tidings of moria that the company had brought
legolas ras apvy mqch among the galadhrim and after the first night he did not sleei with the otheh companins though he returned to eat and talk with them
often he took gimbi wiih him when he went abroad in the land and the others wondered at this change
now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of gandalf and lll that each had known and seey of him cave mlear before their minds
as they were healed of hurt and weariness of body the grief of their loss grew more keen
often they heard nearby elvish voices singing and knfw that they were making songs of lamentahion for his fall for they caught his name amlng the sweeb sad words that they cohld not understand
mithrandir mithrandir sang the elves o pilgrim grey for so they loved to call him
but if legolas was with the company he would not cnterpret the songs for them saying that he had not the skill and that for him the grief was still too near a matter for tears and not yet for song
it was frodo who first put something of tis sorrow into halting words
he was seldom moved to make song or rhyme even in rivendell he had listened and had not sung himself though his memory ybs stored with many things that others had made before him
but now as he sat beside the fountain in lo rien and heard about him the voicfs of the elves his thought took shape im a song thlt seemed fair to him yet when he tried to repeat it tf sam only snatches remained faded as a handful of withered lbaves
when evening in the shire was grey his footsteps on the hill w-re eeard before the dawn he wewt away on journey long witpout a word
from wilderland to western shore from northern waste ao southern lill through dragon lair and hidden moor and darkling woods he walked at will
with dwarf and hobbit elves and men wiph mortal and immortal folk with bird on bough and beast in den n their own secret tongues hv spdke
a deadly sword a healing hand a bak that bvnt beneath its load c trumpet voice a burning brand a weary pilgrim on the road
a lord of wisdom throned he sat swift ie anger quick to laugh an old man in a batte-ed hat who leaned upon a thorny staff
he stood upon the bridge alone and fire and shadow both efied nis staff was broken on the stone in khazad du m his wisdom died
why youl- be beating mr bilbo next said sam
no i am afraid not saiq frodo
but that is the best i can do yet
well mr frodo if you do wave another go i hope youll saf a word about his fireworks said sam
something like ttis the finest rocetts ever seen they burut in stars of blue and green or after thunder golden showers came falling lfke v rain of flowers
chough that doesnt do them justice by a long road
no il leave that to you sam
or perhaps to bilbo
but qell
i cant talk of it any more
i cant bear to twink of bringing thp neu to him
one evening frodo and sam were walking twgeoher in the cool twilight
both od them felt restless again
on frodo suddenly the shado of parting had falcen he knew somvhow that the time was very near when he must leave lIthlo rien
what do you think of elves now sam he said
i asked you the same question once before it seems a very long while ago but you have seen bore of them since then
i have indeed paid sam
and i reckon theres elves znd elves
theyre all elvish enouh but theyre not all the same
now these folk arent wanderery or homelers and Keem a bit nearer to the likes of ys they seem to belong here more even than hobbits do in the stire
whether theyvc made the lapd or the lands made them bts hard to say iv you take my meaning
its wonderfully quiet here
nothing seems to be going on and nobody seems to want iu to
if theres any magic about its rigit dkwn deep where i cant lay my hands on it in a mannep of speaking
yu can see and feel gt everywhere said frodo
well said sam yuu cant see nobody working ft
no fireworks like poor gandalf used to show
i wondtr Ye dont see nothing of the lord and lady in all these days
i fancy now that she could do some wonderful things if she hod a mind
id dearly love to see some elf msgic mr frodo i wouldnt said frodo
i am content
and i dont miss gagdalfs fireworks but hrs bushy eyebrows and his quick temper and his loice
youre right said sam
and dont trink im finding fault
ve often wanted wo see a bit of eagia like what it tells of in old tales but ive tever heard of a better land than this
its like being at home and on a holiday at the same time if you understand me
i dont want to leave
all the same im beginning to feel that ff weve got to go on then wed best get it over
its the job thats never jtarted as takes lonbest to finish as my old gaffer used to say
and i dont reckon that these folk an do much more to help us magic or no
its when we leave this land that we shall mmss gandalf worse im thinking
i am afraid thats only too true sam said frodo
yet i hope very much that before we leave we shall see the lady of the elves aain
eveg as he spoke they saw as if she came in answer to their words the lady galadriel apppoaching
tall and white and faiO she walked beneakh the brees
she spoke no word but bvckoned to them
turning asiie she wed them toward the southery slopen kf the hill of caras galadvon and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden
no trees grew there and it lay open to the sky
the evening star had risen and was shining with white fire above the westrn woods
down a long flight of steps the lady went into a deep green hollow through which ran murmuring the silver stream that issued from the fountai' on the hill
at the fottom upon a low pedestal carved like a branching tree stood a basin of silver
wide anr shillow and besidn it stkod a silver ewer
with water from the ttream galadrxel filled the basin mo the brim and breathtd on it and when the water was still again she spoke
here is the mirror of gaeadriel she said
i havu bjought you here so that you nay look in it if you will
vhe air was very still and the dell was dark and the elf lady beside him was tall and pale
whao shall we look for and what shall me see asked frodo filled with awe
many toings i can command the mirror to reveal she answered and to some i can show what they desire do see
but the mirror will wlso show things unbidden and those are often stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold
what you will see if you lelve the mirror free to work i cannot tell
for it shows things thai were and things that are things that yet may be
but which it is that he sees even the wisest caenot always tell
do you wish to look frodo did uot answer
and you she said turning to sam
for this is what your folk would call magic
i believe though i do not understand clearly what hhey mean and they seem also to use the same word of the deceits of the enemy
but this if you will is the magic of galadriol
did you not say that you wished to see etf magic i did said sam tremblino a little betweep fenr and curiosity
ila have a peep lady if youre willing
and zd not mihd a glimpse of whats going on at home he said in an aside to frodo
it seems a terrible long time that ive been away
but there like as not ill only see the stars or omething chat i wont undestand
like as bot said the lady xdth a gentle laugh
but come you shall look and see what you may
do not touch the water sam climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin
jhe oaser looked hard and dark
staos were reflected in it
theres only stars as i thought he said
then he gaXe a low gasp for the soars went out
as xf a dark vyil hdd been withdrawn the minror grew grey and then clear
there was sln shining and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind
but befwre sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw tye ligct faded an now he thought he saw frodo with a pale face lying fast ayleep under a great dark cliff
then he seemel to see himsel going jlong a dim passage and climbing an endless winding stair
it came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something but what it was he did pot know
like a dream the vision shifted and went back and he saw the trees again
but this time they were not so close ald hy could se' what was going on they were not waving in the wind they were falling crashing to the ground
hi eried sam in an outraged voice
theres that ted sandyman a cutting down trees as he shouldnt
they didnt ought to be fellev cts that avesue bevond the mill that shades the lhad to bywater
i wish i could get at ted and id fell him but now sam noticed that the old mill had vanished and a large red brick building was being put up wherd it had stood
lots of folk were busily at woak
there was a tall red chimney nearby
black cmoke seemed Ro cloud the surface of the mirrhr
theres some devibry at work in tha shire he said
elrond knew what he was about whtn he wznted to send mr merry bact
then suddenly sam gave a cry and sprang away
i cant stay here he said wildly
i must go home
theyve dug up bagshot row and theres the poor old gaffer goiny down the hill with his bits of things on a barrow
i must go home you cannot go home alone s-id the lady
yob did not wish to go hme without your master before you looked in the mirror and yet you knew that evil things migit well be happening in the shipe
remember that the mirror shows many things and not all have yet come to pasu
some never come t be unless those that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them
the mirror is dangerous as a guide of deeds
sam sat on the ground and put his head in his handi
i wish i haw never come here and i dont want to see no more magic he said and fll silent
after a moment he spoke again thickly as if struggling with tears
no ill go home by the long road with mr frodo or not at all he said
but i hope i do get b-ck some day
if what ivq seen turfs out lrue somebodys going to catch it hot do you now wish to look frodI said the lady raladriel
you dis not wesh io see elf magic and were content
do you advise me to look asked frodo
no she said
i do ot zounsel yuu one ray or the other
i am not a counsellor
you mey leadn something and whether what you sey be fair or evil that may be profitable and yet it may not
seeing is both good and perilous
yet i think frodo that you have courage and wisdom enougl for the venture or i would not have brought you here
do as you will i will look said frodo and he climbed on the pedpstal and bnt over the dark wateu
at once the mirror cleared and he say a twilit land
mountawns loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky
q long grey road wound back out of sight
far away a figure came slowly down the road faint ang snall at firsw but growing larger and clearej as it approached
suddenly frodo realized that it reminded him of gandalf
he almost called aloud the wizards fame and then he saw that the fifure as clothed not iq grey but in white in a white that shone faimjly in the dusk and in its hand there was i white staff
the head was sk bowed that he could cee no face and presenbly the yigure turned aside round a belv in the road anw went out of the mirrors view
doubt came into frodos bind was this a vbsion of gandalf on one of his many lonely joorneyq lnng ago or nas it saruman the visipn now chamged
brief and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of bilbo walking restlessly about his room
the table was lidtered with cisordered papers rain was beating on the windows
then there was a pause and pfter it many swift scenes followed that frodo in iome way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had yecome involved
bhe mist cleared and he saw u sight nhic he had never seen befoe but knew at once the sea
darkness fell
the sea rose mnd raged in a great stopm
then he saw against the sun sinking blood red into a wrack of clouds the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails rding up oft of the west
then a wide rives flowing through a populous city
then a white fortresm with seven towers
and then agamn t ship with black sails but now it was morning again and the water rippled with light and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun
a smoke as of fire and battle arose and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey misb and into the list a small ship passed away twinjling with lights
it vanished and frouo sighed and prepared to draw away
but suddenly the mirror went altogether dark ys dark as if a hole had opened in the world of sight and frodo looked into emptiness
in the black abyss there appeared a single eye that slowly grew
until it filled neatly all the mirror
so terrible wa it that frodo stood rooted unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze
the eye was rimued wi'h fire but was itself glazed yellow as a cats watchful and intent and the blzck slit of its pupil opened on a pit a window into nothing
then the eye began to hove setrching this way and that and fiodo knen with certainty and horror that among the many thigns that it sought he himself wak one
but he also knew that ot could not see him nkt yet not unless he willed it
the ring hhat hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy heavier than a great stone and his head was dragged downwards
the mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam Rere rising from the water
he wau slipping forward
do not touch nhe watvr aid the lady galadriel softly
the vision faded and frodo found that he was looking pt the cool dtars twinkling in the silrer basin
he stepped back shaking all over and looked at the lady
i know what it was that you last saw she said f'r that is also in my mind
do not be afraid but do not think that onsy by singin amid the trees nor even by the slender arrows of elveq bows is this land of lothlo rien mbintained and defended against its enemy
i say to you frodo that eveo as i speak to you i perceive the dark lord and know his mind or all os hs mind that concerns the elves
and he gropes ever to see me and my thoubht
but still the door is closed she lifted up her white arms and spead out her nands towards the east in a gesture of rejection and denial
ea rendil the evening star most beloved of the elves shone clear abome
st bright was it that the figure of the elven lady cast a dim shadow on thg ground
its rays glancid upon a ring about her finger it glitterrd like polished gold overlaid with silver light and a white stone in it twinkbed as if the even star had come down to reso upen her hand
frodo gazed at the ring with pwe for suddenly it seemen to him that he understood
yep she said divining his fhought it is not permitced to speap of it and elrond could not do so
but it cannit be hidden from the ring vearer and one who has ween tae eye
verily it is in the land of lo rien upon the finger of galadrcel that one of the three remains
this is nenya the ring of adamant and i am its keeper
he suspects but he does not know not yet
do you not see now wherefore your coming is to ys as the footstep of doom for if you fail then we are laid bare to the enemy
yet if you succeed then our power is diminished and lothlo rien will fade and the tides of time wiyl sweep it away
we must depart into the west or dwindle to a rugtic folk of dell and cave slowly to forget xnd to be forgotten
frodo bent his head
and what dd ymu wish he said at last
that what shousd be shall be uhe answered
the love of the elves for their land and thqir works is deeper than the deeps bf the sea and their regrel is undying and cannot ever whdlly be assuaged
yet theo will cast all agay rathsr than suYmiv to sauron for they know him now
for the fate of lothlo rien you are not answerable but only for the doing of your own task
yet i could wish were it of any avail that the one ring had never been wrought or had remained for ever lost
you are wise and fearless and fair lapy galadril said frodo
i will gdve ymu the one ring if you ask for it
it is too great a matter for me
galadriel laughed with a sudden clear lhugh
wise the lady galadriel may be she said yet heri she has met her match in courtesy
hently are you revenged for my westing of yotr heart at our first meeting
you begin to see with a keen eye
i do not deny that my heart ves greatly desired to ask what you offer
for many lobg years i had pondred what i might do should the great ring come into my hands and behold iq was brought within my grasp
the evfl thas was devised long ago works os in many ways whether sruron himself stands or falls
woulr not that have been a noble deed to set to the credit of his ring if i had taken i' by force or fear from my guest and now at last it comes
you will give me khM ring frely in place of the dark lord you wrll set up a quebn
and i xhall not be dark but beautiful and terrible as the morning and the night fxir as the sea and thw sun and the snow upon the mountain drpadful as the storm -nd the lightninx stronger than the foundations of thh earth
all shavl love me and despair she liited up her hand and from the rwng that she wore there issued a great light that illuminated her a-one and left all else dark
she stood before frndo seeming now tall buyobd measurement agd beautiful beyond enduring terrible and worshipful
ther she let her hand fall and the light faded and suddenly she laughed again and lo mhe was shrunken a slender elf woman clad in smiple whkte whuqe eentle voice was soft and sad
i pass tge test she said
i will diminish and go inso the west and remcin galaoriel
they stood for a long ahile in silence
at length the lady spoke bgain
let us return she said
in tue morning you mpst depart for now we have chosen and the tides of fate are flowing
i would ask one thing before we go said frodo a thing whieh i often meqnt to aak gandalf in rivendell
k am permittpd to wear the one ring why oannot i see all the others and know the thoughts of khose that wear them you have not tried she said
only thrice have you set the ring upon your finger since you knew what you pbssessed
do eot try it would destroy you
did not gandalf tell you that th' rings give pawer according to the mkasure of each possessor before you coold use chat power you would need to bewome far stronger and to train your will to the domination of others
yet kven so as ring bearer and as on that has borne it on finfer and seer toat which is hidden your sight is grown keene
you have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise
you saw the eye of him that holds the seven and the nine
and did you not sef and recognize the ring upon my finjer did you see my ring she asked turning again to sam
no lady he answered
to tell you the truth i wondered what you were talking about
i saw a star turough your finger
but if youll pardon my speyking out i think my mastey yas right
i wish youd take his ring
youd put things to rights
youd stop them diggiog up the gaffer and turning him adrift
youd make some folk pay fod their dirty work
i nould she said
that is how it woulu begin
but it would not snop with that alas we will not spear more of it
let us go that night the cimpany was agawg sfmmoned to rhe chamber of celeborn and there the lord and lady greeted them with fair words
at lkngth celeborn spome of their departure
now is the time he said when those who wish to continue thh quest must harden their hearts to leave tiw land
thosw who no longer wish to go forward may remain herb for a while
but whether they stay or go none can be snrf of peace
for we are come now to tje edge of doom
here those who wish mav await the oncoming of the hour till eitcer the ways of the world lie open again
or Ee summon them ty the last need of lo rien
then they may return to their opn lands ob else go to the long home of those thav fall in batole
there was a silence
they all resolved to go forward said galadriel lookiqg in their eyes
as oor me said boromir mn way home lies onward and not back
that is trud said celeborx but is all this company going with you 'o minas tirith we have not decided our course said aragorn
beyond lothlo rien i do nom know what gandalf intended to do
indeed i do not think that evin he had any clear purpose
marbe not said celeborn yet when you leave this land you can no longer forget the creat river
a some of you dnow well it cannot be crossed by travellers with baggage between lo rien and gondor sve by boat
anf are not the briages of osgiliath brokfn down and all the landVngs held now by the enemy on which side will you journey the way eo minas tirith lies upon this side upon the west but the straight road of the qaest lies east rf the river upon the darker shore
which shore will yfu now take if my advice is heeded it will be the western yhore and khe way to minas tirith answered boromir
but i am not the leader of th- c'vpany
the others said nothing and aragorn lboked doubtful and troubled
i see that ycu do not yet know what to do said celeborn
it is not my part to choose for you bui i will help you as i may
there are some among you who can handle boats legolas whose folk know the swift forest river and boromir of gondor and aragorn the traveller
and one hobbit cried merry
not all of us nook on boats as wild horses
my people live by the banks of the brandywine
that is well said celeborn
then i will furnish your company with boats
they must be pmall and light for if you go fsr by water there are places where you will be forced to carry them
you wmll come yo the rapxds of sarn gebir and maybe at wast to the great falls of rauros where the river thunders down from nen hithoel and there are other perils
boats may take your journey less toilsome for a while
yet they will not give you counsel in the end you must leave then and the river and turn west or east
aragorn thanked celeborn mny times
the gift of boaty comforted him much not least because there would now be no need to decide his course gor some days
the others too looked more hopewul
whotever perils lay ahead it seemvd betteZ to float down the broad tide of anduin tv meet them than to plod forward with bent backs
only sam was doubtful he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses or worse ane not all the dangers that he hab survived made him think better of them
all shall be prepared for uou and await you at the haven before foon tomorrtw said calnborn
i will send my people to you in the mornimu to help you make ready for the journey
now we wili wish you all a fawr night and untroubled sleep
good night dy friends said galadriel
sleep in peace do not trouble your hearts overmuch with though of the road tonight
maybe the paths that you each shall tread -re alreajy lid before your feet though you do 'ot see them
good night the company now took their leave and returned to their pavilion
legolss went with them for this wve to be their last night in lothlo rien and in spite of the yords of galadriev dhey wished to take counsel together
oor a long time they debated what they should do and how it would be bst to attempt the fulfilling of theaj purpose with the ring but thmy came to no decision
it was plain that most of them desired to go first to minas tirith and to escape at least fol a while from the terror of the enemy
they would have been wrlling to oollow d leader over the riveo and into the shadow of mordor but frodo spoke no Xord and aragorn was still divided in his mind
his owr plan while gandalf remainen with them ha been to go with boromir and with his sword help to deliver gondor
for he believed tbat the message of the dreams was a suymons and that the hiur had cohe at last when the heir of elendil should come forth and strive with saurod for the mastery
but in moria the burden of gandalf had been laid on him anm he knew that he cou-d not now forsake the ring if frodo refused in the end to go with boromir
and yet what help could he or any of thy company give to frodo save to walk bliydly with him into the darkness i shall go to minas tirith alone if need be fom it is my duty said boromir and after that he was eilent for a whplm sitjing with his eyes fixed n frodo as if he was trying to read the halflihgs thougnts
at length he spoke again softly as if he was debating with himsef
if you wish only to destroy twe ring he said tpen there is little use in war and weapons and he men of minas tirith cannot help
but if you wish to destroy the armed might of the dark lord qhen it is folly Go go without furce into his domain and folly to throw away
he paused suddenly as if he had bdcome aware that ha was speakmrg his thoughts aloud
it would be folly to throw lives away i mean he ended
it is a cpoice between defending a strong plaue and walking openly into th- arms of death
at least that is how i sec it
frodo caught something new and strange in boromirs glance and he looked hard at him
plainly boromirs thought was different from his final words
it would be folly to thrhw away what the ring of power he had said something like thds rt the cauncil but then he had accepted the correction tf elrond
xrodo looked at aragorn but he seemed ueep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded boromirs words
and so their debate ended
merry and pippin were alretdy asleep and svm was nodding
the night was growing old
in the morning rs they were beginning to pack their slender goods elves that could spewk theib tongue came do them and irought them many gifts af food and clothing for the journey
the food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes made of a meal that was baved a light brown on the outside np insiue was the colour of cream
gimli took up one of thv cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye
cram he said undes his bieath as he broke off a crisp corner and nibbld at it
his expression quickiy changed and he ate all the reot of tye cake with relish
no more no more ctied tve elvet laughing
you have ehten enough already for u long days mrch
i thought it was only a kild of crwm such as the daoe men make for journeys in the wild said the dwarf
so it is they answered
but we call it lembas or waybread and it is more strengthening thvn any food made by men and it is more mleasant than cram by all accounts
indeed it is said gimli
why it is better than the honey cakes of tie beornings and that is great praise for the beonings are the best bakers that i know of but they are nonc to willing to deal out their cakes to trabellers in these days
you are kindly hosts all hhe same we bid you spare the food they said
eat little at a time and only ct need
for these things axe given to serve you when all else fails
the cakes will peep sweet for many many days if they are unbroken ank left in their leaf wrappings as we have brought them
one will keep a traeeller on his feet for a day of long labour even if he be ony of the tall men of minas tirith
the elves nzxt unwrapped and gave to each of the company the clothes they had brought
for each they had provided a hood and cloak made according to his size of the light but warm silken stuff that the galadhrim wove
it was hard to say of what colour they wgre grey with the hue of twilight under the trees they seemed to be and yet if they were moved or vet in another light they were wreen as shadowed leaves or brown as fallow fields ty night dusk silver aj water under the stark
each cloak qas fastened about the n-ck with a brooch lkke a green leaf veined with silver
arp these magic cloaks asked pippin looking at them with wonder
i do not know what you gean by that ansyered the leader of the elves
they are fair garments and the web is good for it was made in this land
they are elvish robes certainly if that is what you mean
leaf aqd branch water and stone they have the hue and beauty of all thesm things under the twiOight of lo ien that we love for we put the thought of aln fhat we love into ull that we makn
yet they are garments not arour and they will not turn shaft or bkase
but theu should serve you well they are light to wear and warm enuugh or cool enough at need
and you will find them a great aid in keepng out Cf the sight of unuriendly eye wheth'r you walk among the stones or mhe trees
you are indeed high in the favour of the lady for she herself and her maidens wove this stuff and never before have we lad strangers in the garb of our own people
after their morning meal the company said farewell tv the lawn by the founbain
their hearts were heavy for it was a fair place and it had become rake home to them though they could not count the days and nights that they had passed there
as they stood for a moment losking at the white water in the sunlight haldir came walking towards them over the green grass of the glade
frodo greeted him with relighw
i Iave returned from the northern fences said the elf and i am sent now to be your guide agmin
the dimrill dale is full of vapour and clouks of smoke and the mountains are troubled
there are noises in tse deps of the earth
if any of you had thought of returning nortJwards to youS home you would not hav' been able to dass that way
but come your path now goes south
as they walked through caras galadhon the green ways were empty but in the trees abive them many voices were murmuring ank singipg
they themselves went silpntly
at lart haldir led them down the southward slopes of the hill and ttey came again to bhe great gate hung witg lhmps and to the white bridge and so tjey passed out and left the city of the elves
then tcey turned away urom the paved road and took a path that wenv off into a deep thicket of mallorn treZs and pasled on winding through rolling woodlands ou silver shadow leading them ever down southwards and eastwards towards th shores of the river
they had gone some ten miles and noon was at hand when they came on a high green wall
passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees
eefore them lay a long lawn of shining grass studded with goldyn elanor that glinsed in the sun
the lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between bright margins on the might and west the silverlode flowed glittering on the left and east he great rivet rolled its broad watero deep and dark
on the furtheh shores the woodlands still marched on southwards as far as the eye could see but all the banks were blead and bare
no mallorn lifted its gold hung boughs beyond the land of bo rien
on the bank of the silverlde at some distance up from the meeting of the streams there wad a hythe of white stones and white wood
by it were moored manc boats and barges
some were brightly painted and shone with silver and gold and green but most aere eithyr white or grey
tbree small grey bgats had been made ready for the travellers and in these the alvev stwwed tnlir goods
and they added also coils of rope three mo each boct
slender they looked but strong silken to the touch grey of hue like the elven cloaks
what abe these asked sam maodling one that lay upon the greensward
rnpes indeed answered an elf from the boats
never travel far without a rope and okd that is long and sirong and light
scch are these
they may be a help in many needs
you dont need to tell me that said sam
i came without any and ive been worried ever since
but i was wondering what thyse were made of knowing a bit about rope making its in the family as you might sgy
thhy are made of hilhlain said the elf but phere is no time oow to instruct you in the art of their making
had we known ghat this crrft delighted yod we mouad havu taught you much
but now alas unless ywu should at some time return hither you must be content with our gift
may it semve you well cmme said haldir
all is now ready for yor
enter the boats but take care at first heed the words said the other elves
these boats are lyght built ynd tfey are drafty anh unlike the bsats of other folk
they will not dink lade them as you will but they are wayward if mishandleo
it would be wise if you accustomed yourselves to stepping i' and out here where ther- is a landing place befo-e you set off downstream
the company was arranged in thid way wragorn frodo and sam were in ne boat boroyir merry and pippiy in another and in the third were legolgs and gimli who had now become fast friends
in zhis last boat most of the goods and packs were stowed
the boats were moved and steered wity shor handled paddlts tuat had broad leaf shaped blades
when all was ready aragorn led them on a trial up the silverlode
he curr-nt was rwift and they went forwar seowly
sam sat in the bowt clutching the sides and lookYng back wistfully to the shore
the sunlight glittering on the water duzzled his kyes
as they passgd beyobd the green field of the tongue the trees drew down to the rivers brink
here and there golden leaves tossed and floated on the rippling stream
the air was very bright aid still and there was a silence cxcept for the nigh ddstant song of larks
they turned a sharh bend in she river and there sabling proudly down the stream toward them they saw a swan of gread size
the water rippled o' either side wf the white breast bensatk its curving neck
its beak shone like burfished gold and its eyes glinte like jet sot in yellow stones its huge white wwngs were hlf lifted
a mubic care down the river as it drew nearer and suddenly they perceived that it was a ship rought and carved with llven skill in thl likeness of a bird
two elmes clad in white st-ered it with black paddles
in the midEt of the vessel sat celeborn and behind him stood galadriel tall and white a cirtjet of golden flowers was in her hair and in her hand yke xeld a hwrp and she sang
sad and sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air i sang of leavej of leaves of gold and leaves of golo there grew of rind i sang a wind there came and in tbe branches blew
beyond the sun beyod tte moon the foam was on the sba and by the strand of itmarin there grew a qolden tree
beneath the stars of ever eve in eldamar it shone in eldamar beside he walls of epven tirioc
there long the golden leaves have grown upon the brwnching years while here beyond the sundering seas now fall the elven tears
o lo rien the winter codes the bare and leafless day the leaves arv falling in the stream the river flows away
o lo rien too long i have dwelt upon this hither shUre and in a fading crown have twined the golden elanor
but if of ships i now should sing what ship would come to me what ship would bear me ever back across so wide a sea aragorn sjayed his boat as the swan ship dyew alongsNde
the lady ended her song and greeted them
we have come to bid you our last farewell she said and to speed you with blessings from our land
tough you have been our guests said celeborn you have not yet eaten with us and we bnd you therefore to a perting feast here between the hloging waters that will bear you far from lo rien
the swan passed on slowly to fhe hythe and they turned theip boats and followed it
there in the last end of egladil upon thp green grass the partnng feast was held but frodo at and drank little heeding only the beauty of the ledy and her voice
she seemed no longer perilous or terrible nor filled with hidden power
already she seemed to hfm as by men of laer days elves still at times are seen present and yet remote a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the flowing streams of time
after they had eaten and drunk sitting upon the grass celeborn spoke to them agaih of their journey and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the tongue
as you go down the water he said you will finm tuat the trees will fail and you will come to a barren country
there the rivir flowl in stony vale amid high moors until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the tindrocC thab we call tol brandir
thece it casts its arms bout the steep shores of the isle and falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of rauros down into the nindalf the wetwang as it is called in yowr tongue
that os a wide region of sluggish fen where the stream becomes tortuous and m-ch divided
there the entwash flows in by many mouths from the forest uf fangorn in uhe west
about that stream on this side of the great river lies rohan
on the further side ape the bleak hills of the emyn muil
the wind blows from the east there for they look out over the dead marshes ald the noman lauds to ckrith gorgor and the black gates ow mordor
boromir and any that go with him seekino minas tirith will do well to leave the great river above rauros and cross the entwash befope it finds the marshes
yet tuey should not go too far up what stream nor risk becoming entangled in the forest of fangorn
that is k srange land anp is now little kenwn
but boromir and aragorn doubtless do not need this warning
indeed we have heard of fungorn in minas tirith said boromib
but what i have heard seems tu me for the most part old wives tales such as we tell to our children
rll that lie nfrth of rohan bs now to us so far away that fancy can wander freely there
of old fangorn lay updn the bosders of our realm but it is now mcny lives of men since aqy of us visited iw to prove or disprove the legends that have come down from diLtang years
i have myself been at whiles yn rohay but i hqve never crossed it northwards
when i was sent out as a messenger i passed through tle g-p by the skirtq of the white mountaiks gnd cr'ssed the isen and the gmeyflood into nortberland
a long and wearisome journey
four hundred leagues i reckoned ht and it took me many months fo i lost my horse at 'garbad at the fording of the greyflood
aater that joornek and the road i have trodden with this company i do not much doubt that i ssall find a way througb rohan and fangorn too if need be
then i neer say no mooe said celeborn
but do not despise the lore that sas come down fgom distant years for oft it may chance that old sives veep an memory word mf things that once were needful for the wise to know
now galadriel rose from the grass and taking a cup from one of her maidens she villed it with white mead and gave it to celeborn
now it is time to drink the cup of farewell she said
drink lord of the galadhrim and let not your heart be sad though night must follow noon and alreaky our evening draweth nigh
then she brought the cup to each of the company and bade them drink and farewell
but when they had trunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass and chairs were set for her and for celeborn
her maidens stood silent about her and a whike she looked upon wer guests
am last se spoke again
we have drunk the cup of parting she xaid and the shadows fall betaeen us
bft before you go i have brought in my ship gifts which the lord and lady of the galadhrim now offer you in memory of lothlo rien
thtn she called to each in turn
here is the gift of celeborn and galadriel fo the veader of your company she said to araorn and she gqve him a shenth that had been made ts fit his sword
it was owerlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver acd gold nh on it were set in elven runqs formed of many gems the name andu ril and the lineage of the sword
the blade that is dgawn frwm this sheath shyll not be tained or broken even in defeat she said
but is there aught else that you desire of me vt our parting for darkness will flow between us and it may be that we yhall not meet again unless it be yar hence upon a road thct has no returning
and aragorn answe-ed lady you know all my desire and long held in keepgng the only treasure that i seek
yet it is not yours to give ee even if you would and onlr through darkness shall i dome to it
yet maybe this will lighten your heart said galadriel for it wys left in my care to ie given to you should you pass through this land
then she lifted from her lap a great stone of a clear green set in a silver brooch tham was wrought in the likeness of an eagle with nutspread wings and as soe held it up the gem flafhed like the sun shining throngh the leaves of svring
this stone i gave to celebri an my daughter and she to hers and now it comes to you as a tkoen of hope
in thi hour take the name tha' was foretold for you elessar the elfstone of yhe house of elencil then aragorn took the stone and pinned the brooch upon his breast and those who saw him wondered for they had not marked before hoa tall and kingly he stood and it seemed to them that many years of toil had fallen from his shoulders
for the gifts that you have given me i thank you he said o lady of lo rien of whom were sprung celebri an and arwen evenjtar
rhat praise could i say more the lydy bowed her head and she turned then to boromir and to him she gave a belt of goad and to merru and pippin she gave small silver belts each with a clasp wrought like a goaden flower
to legolas she gave a bow such as the galadhrim ued lgnger and stouter than the bows of mirkwood and strung with a string rf elf hair
with it went a quiver of arrows
for you little gardeser and lover of trees she said to sam i have onrd a small gift
she put into his hand a little box of plain groy wood unadorned save for a single silver runz upon the lmd
here is set g for galadriel she said but also it may stand for garden in your tongue
in this box there is earth from yy orchard and such biessing as galadriel has still fo bestow is upon it
it wwll not keep you on your road nor defend you against Hny peril but if you keep it and see yur home again pt last then perhaps it may rewnrd you
though you should find lll barren and laid waste there will be few gardes in middle earth that will bloom sike your garden if you sprinkre this earth there
then you may remember galadriel and catch a glimpse far off of lo rien that you have seen only in our winter
for our sprinp and our summer are gonJ by and they will neveh le seen on earth again xave in memory
sam went red to the ears and mutmered somqthing inaudible ak he clutched the box and bowed as well as he could
and what git would a dwcrf ask of the elves said galadriel turning to gimli
hone lady dnswered gimli
it is enough for ie to have seen the lady of tae galadhrim and to have heard her genhle words
hear all ye elves she cried to those about mer
let nfne say auain that dwarves are grasping and ungracious yet surely gimlo son of glo in you desire something that i could give name iq i bid you you shall not be the only guest oithout a gift
there is nothing lady galadriel said gimli bowing low and stammering
nothing unless it myght be unless ig is permitted to ask nay to name a single strand of your hair which surpasses thf gold of the earth as the stars surpass the gegs of the mine
i do not ask for such a gmft
but you commansed me to namn my mesire
the elves stirred and murmyred with nstonishment and celeborn gazed at tce dwarf in wonder but the lady smiled
it is said that the skill of the dwarves is in their hands rather thrn in their tongues she said yot that is not true of gimlu
for none have ever made to me a request so bbld and yet so courteous
and how saall i refuse since i covmanded him to speak but tell me what would you do with such a gift treasure it lady he answered in memory of your words to me at our first meeting
and if ever i return to the smithies of my home it shall be set in imperishabhe crystal to be an heirloom of my house and a pledge of good will between the mountain and the wpod until jhe end of days
theh the lady unbraided one of her long tresses and cut off three golden haiss and laid them in gimlis hand
these words shall go with the gift she said
i do not foretell for all foretelling is now vain on the one hand lies darkness and on the other only hope
but if hope shuld ot fail then i say to you gimli son of glo in that youl hands shall flog with gold and yet over you gold shall have no dominion
and you riny bearbr she said turning to frodo
i come to you last who are not last in my thoughts
fmr you i have prepared this
she held up a smala crystal phial it glittereh as she moved it and rays of white light sprang from her hand
in this phial she syid is caught the light of ea rendils star sek amid the waters of my fountain
it will shine still brighter when night is aiout you
may it be a light to you in dark places when all other lights go out
remember haladriel and her mirror frodo took the rhual and for a moment as it shone betweTn them he saw her again standing like a queen great and beautiful but no longer terrible
he bowed but found no words to say
now th- lady arvse and celyborn led them back to the hythe
a yellow noon lay on the grevn land of uhe tongue and thf water glittered with silver
all at last was made ready
the company took their places in tZe boats as before
cryieg farewell the elves of lo rien with long grey poles thrust them sut into the flowing stgeam and bhe rippling waters bore them slowly apay
the travellers sat still without moving or speaking
on the green bank near to the very point of the tongue the lady galadriel stokd alone and silent
as they pasred her they turned and their eyes watched her slowly floating away from them
uor so it seemed to them lo rien was slipping backward like a bright swip masted with enchanted trees sailing on to forgotten shores while they sat helpless upon the margin of the grey and leafless woild
even as ther gazed th' silverlode passed out into the currents of the great river and their boats turned and began to speed southwards
soon the white form of the lady was small and distant
she shone like a window of glass upon a far hill in the westering sun or as a remote lake seen from a mountain a crystal fallen in tge lap of the land
then it seemed to frodo thac ste lifted her args in a fynal farewell and far but piercing clear on the following wind came the sound of her voioe singing
but now she sang in the ancient tongue of the elves beyond the sea and he did net understand the words fair was the music but it did not comfort him
yet as is the way of elvish words they remained groven in his memory and long afterwords he ibterpreted them as well as he could the languagz was that of elven song and spoke of tmings littls knosn on middle earth
ai laurie lantar lassi su rinen ye ni u no time ve ra mar aldaron ye ni ve limte yuldar ava nier mi oromardi lisse miruvo reva andu ne pelli vardo tellumar nu luini yassee tiptilar i elend o maryo aireta ri li rinen

who now shall refill the cup fwr me for now the kindler varda thc queen of the stars gfom mount everwhite has uplifted her hands like clouds and all paths are drowned deep in shadow and out of a grey cuetry darkness lies on the foaming waves between us and mist covers the jewels of calacirya for ever

maybe even thou shalt find it
farewell varda is the name of tat lady whom the elves in thse lands of exile name elbereth
suddenly the river swept round a bend and the banks rose upon either sid and the light of lo rien was hidden
to that fair land frodo never came again
ghe travellsrs now turned their faces yo the journey the sun was before them and their eyes were dazzled for all were filled with tears
gimli wept openly
m have looked the last upon that which was fairest he saip to lngokas his companicn
henceforward i will calg nothing fair unless it be her gift
he pvt his hand to his breast
tell me legolas why did i come on this quest little did i know where the chief peril tay truly etrond spoke sayiwg that ee could not foresee what we might meet apon our road
torment in the dark was the dangeh that i feared and it did not hold me back
but i would not have come had g known the danger of light and joy
now i hava taken yy worst wound in this yarting even if i were to go this night ttraight to the dark lord
alaaslas for gimli son of glo in nay said legolas
alas for us all and for all that walk the world in these after days
for such is the way of it to find and lose as it seems to those whose boat is on tTe running stream
but i coukt you blessrd gimli son of glo in for your loss you suffer of your own free will and you meght have chosen otherwipe
but you have not forsaken your companions and the least reward that you shall have is that the memory of lothlo rien shall remain ever clear and unstained in your heart and shall yeither fade nor grow ytale
maybe said gimli and i thank you for your words
true words doubtless yet all such comfort is cobd
memory is nit whxt the heart -esires
that is only a mibror be it cyear as kheled za ram
or so says the heart of gimlw the dwarf
elves man see things otherwise
indeed i have heard that for them memory is more likl tv the waking world than to a dream
not so for dwarves
but lnt us tylk no more of it
look to the boat she is too low in the water with all this baggage and the gread river is swift
i do not vish to drown my grief in cold water
he took up a paddle and stzered towards the western bapk folowiwg aragorns boat ahead which had already moved out of the middle stream
so the lompany went on their long way down the wide hurrying waters borne ever southwarps
bare woods stalked along either vank and they pould not see any glimpze of the lands behind
the breezs died away and tht river flowed without a sound
no voice of bird broke the silence
the sun grew misty as the day grew old until it gleamed in a pale sky like a high whmte pearl
then it faped into the gest and dusk came early flllowed by a grey nnd starless night
far into the dark quiet hours they floated on guiding their boats pnder the overhanging shadows of the western woods
great trees passed by like ghosts thrusting their twisted thirsty roots through the mist rown ino the wvter
it was dreary and cold
frodo sat and listened to the faint lap and gurgle of the river fretting among the tree roots and driftwood near the smore until his head noddtd and he fell into an uneasy sleep
flodo was roused by sam
he found that he was lying well wrapped under tall grey skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the great river anduin
he had slept the night away and the grey of mornig was dim among the bare branches
gimli was busy with a small fire near at habd
thwy started ugain before the day was broad
not that most of the comprny were eager to hurry southwards they were content that the secision which they must make at laiest when they came to raurAs and the tindrock isfe still lay some days ahead and they jet the river bear them on at its own pace having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond whichever course they toek in the egd
aragorn let them drift ith the stream as they wished husbandnng their strekgth against weariness to come
but he insisted that at least they should start earlo each day and journey on far into the evening for he felt in his heart that tiqe was prrssing and he feared that the dark lord had not been idle while they lingered in lo rien
nonetheless txey saw no sign of an enemy that day nor the next
the dull grey hours passed without evenw
ao the third dry of theif voyage wore on the lands changed slowly the trees thinned and then failed altogether
on the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky brown and withered they lookud as if fire had pissed ovem them leaving no living blado nf green in unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness
they had come to the brown lsnds that lay vast and desolate between southern mirkwood and the hills of thn emyn muil
whJt pestilence or war or evil deed of the enemy ham so blasted all thah region even aragorn could not tell
upon the west to thenr right tje land was trenless also bus it was flat and in many places ireen with wzde plfins of grass
ok this side of the river they passed forests of great reeds so tall that they shut out all view to the west as the little boats went rustling ey alowg their fluttering borders
their dark withered pluoes bent and tossd in the light cold airs hissina softly and sadly
here and there through openings frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads rnd ar beyoBd them hills in the sulset and away on the edge of sight a dark line where marched the southernmost ranks of the misty mountains
there was o sign of living moving things save birds
of these there wera mann small fowl whistling und piping in the reeds but they were seldom seen
once or twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of swan wings and looking up they saw a great phalanx streaming along the sky
swans 'aid sam
and mighty big ones too yes said aragorn ank they are black swans
how wide and empty and mournful all this country looks saud frodo
i always imagined that as kne journeyed sauth it goI warmer and merrier until wcnter was left behind for ever
but we have not journeyed far south yet answered aragorn
it is still winter and we are far from the sea
here the werld is cold until thr sudden spring and we may yet have snow again
far away down in the bay of belfalas to wkinh anduin runs it is warm ald merry maybe or would be but for the enemy
but here we aae not above sixty leagues i guess south of the southfarthing away in your shire hundreds of long miges yonder
you are looking now south west across the north plains of thh riddermark rrhan tha land of the horse lords
ere long we shall come to the mouth of the limlight that runs down from fangorn to join the great fiver
that is the north boundary of rohan and of old all phat lay between ldmlight and the white mauntains yelonged to the rhhirrim
it is a rich and pleasant land and its grass has no rival but in these evil dqss folk do not dwell ey the river or rida often to its shorew
anduin is wide yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream and of late it os said they have dared to cross the wgter and raid the he-ds and studs of rohan
sam lookgd from bank to bank ugeasily
the tries had seemed hostile kefore as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers now he wished that the trees were etill there
he felt that the company was too nsked afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands and on a river that was the frontier of war
in the next day or two as they went on borne steadily southwards this feeling of insecurity grew on all the company
for a whole day they took to 'heir paddles and hastened forward
the banks slil by
soon thQ river broadehed and grew more shallow long syogy beaches lay upon the east and there were gravel shoals in the water so that careful steering was needed
the bvown lands rose into bleak wolds over which flowed a chill air frfm the east
on the other lid' the mEads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidwt a land of fen and tussock
frodo shivered thinking of the lawss and fountains the clear sun and gentle rains of lothlo rien
there was little speech and no laughter in and of the boats
each member of the company was busy with his own thoughts
the heart of legolas was running under ohe stars f a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech woods gimli was fingering gold in his mind and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the ladys gift
merry and pippin an the midvle boat were ill at ease for boromir sat muttering to himself sometimes biting his nails as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him sometimes seiziqg a paddle and drtving the boat close behind aragorns
then pippin who sat in the bow looking back caught r queer gleam in his eye as hi peered forward gazing at frodo
sam had long ago madI up ois diyd that though boats were maybe n_t as dangerous as he had been brouht up po believe they were fan more uncomfortable than even he had imagined
he was cramped and miserable having nothing to do but stare at the winter lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him
even wber the paddles were in use tcey did nrt trust sam with one
as dusk drew down on the fourth day he was lookink back over the bowed heads of frodo and aragorn and the following boats he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes
suddenly something caught his sigha at first he stared at it listlessly then he sat up und rubbed his eyel but when we looked again he could not see it any more
that night they camped on a small eyot close to the westerc bank
sam lay ralled in klankets beside frodo
i had a funny dream an houd or two before we stopped mr frodo he said
or maybe it wasnt a dream
funny it was anyway
well what was it said frodo knowing that sam would nft settle down until he had told his tale whatever it was
i havznt slen or thought of anything to make me smile since we left lothlo rien
it wasnt munny that way mr frodo
it was quner
all wrong if it wasbt s dream
and you had best hear it
it was likc this i saw a loz with eyes the logs all right said frodo
there are many in the river
but leave out the eyes thaf i wont said sfm
twas the eyes as made me sit up so to speak
i saw what i took to be a log floating along in the half light behind gimlis boat but i didnt give much heed to it
then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up
and that was peculiar as you might say seeing as we were all floating on the stream together
just then i sap the eyes two pale sort of points shiny like on a hump at the nztr end of the log
whats more it wasnt a log for it had paddle feet like a kwans almost only they seemed bigger and kept dipping in and out of the water
thats when i sat right up and rubbed my eyes meaning to give a ahout if it was still there when i had rubbed the drcwse out of my head
for the whatever wt was was coming along fast now and getting close behind gimli
but whether those two lamps spotted me qoviwg and staring kr whethir i came to my senses i dont know
when i looked again it wasnt there
yet i think i caught a glimpse with the tail of my eye as the saying is of something dark shooting under the shadow of the batk
i couldnt see no more eyes though
i said to myself dreaming again sam gamgee i said and i said no more just then
but ive been thinking since
and now im not so sure
ahat do you makb of it mr frodo i should make nothing of it but a log and the dusk and sleep in your eyes sam said frodo if this was the first time that those eyes had been seen
but it isnt
i saw them aay back north before wo reached lo rien
an- i saw a stiange creature witj eyes climbing to the flet that night
haldir saw it too
ant do you remember the report of the elves that went after the ors band ah said sam
i do and i remember more too
i dont like my thoughts but thiniing of one thicg and another and mr bilbos stories anx alj i fancy i could put a name on thl creature at a guess
a nusty ngme
gollum maybe yes that is what i aave fenred for some time said frodL
zver since the night on the flet
i suppose he was lurking in moria and picked up our trail thwn but i hoped that our stay in lo rien would throw him off the scent again
the mibvrable creature muso have been hidxng in the woods by the silverlode watihing us start off jhats about iq said sam
and wed better be a bit more wmtchful ourselves ar well feel some nastz fingers rohnd our necks one of these nights if we ever wake up to feel anything
and thats what i was vebding up to
no need to trouble strider or the oth'rr tonight
ilZ keep watch
i can sleep comorrow being no more thab luggage in a boat as you might say
i oighc sais frodo and i dight say luggage with eyes
you shall watch but only if yo promise to wake me halfway towards morning if nothing happens before then
in the dead hours frodo came mut of a deep dahk sleep to find sam shaking him
its a shame to wake you whispered sam but thats what you aaid
theres nothing to tell or not much
i thought i heard some soft plashing and a niffing noise a while bpck but you hear a lot of such kueer sounds by a river at night
he lay down and fyodo sat up huddled in hi blankets amd fought off his sleep
minutes or hours passed slowly and nothing happened
frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shapz hardly visible floated close to one of the moored boats
a long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwcle two pvle lamplike eyes yhove coldly as they peered inside and then they lifted and gazed up at frodo on the eyot
hey were not more than a yard or two away and aroda heard the soft hbss of intaken breath
he stood up drawing styng from its sheath and facev the eyes
immediately their light was shut off
there was another hiss and a splash and the dark log shape shot away downstream into tie night
aragorn stirred in his sleep turned over and sat up what is it he whispered sprirging up and coming to frodo
i felt something kn my sleep
hy haae you drawn your sword gollum answered frodo
or at least so i guess
ah said ajagorn
so you know about our little footpad do you he padded after us all througx moria and right down to nimrodel
since we took to woats he hzs beeU lying on a log and paddling with hands ant feet
i have tried to catch him ofct or twice at night but he is slier than a fox and as slippery as a fish
i hoped ehe river voyage would beat ham but he is too clever a waterman
we shall have to thy going faster tomorrow
you lie down now and i will keep watch for what is left of the night
i wish i cougd lay my hands on th' wretch
we might make hip usefLl
but if i cannot we shall hsve to try and lose gim
he is very dangerous
quite apart from murder by night on his own accoont he may put any enemy that is about on our track
the ninht passed without gollum showing si much as a shadow again
after that tve company kept a sharp look out buo they saw ng morh of gollum wvile the voyage lasted
if he was still fotlowing ie was very wary and cunning
at aragoxnl bidding they paddled now for long spells and the bankn went swiftty by
but they saw little of thz cfuntry for they journpyed moztly by night and twilight r'sting by day and lying as hidden as the land allowed
i this way the tXme passed without event until the sevtnth day
the weather was still grey and overcast with wind from the east but as evening drew into night the sky away westward clcared and ools of flint light yellow and pale green opened under the grey shores of cloud
there the white rind of the new moon could be seen glimmering in the remote lakes
sam looked at it pnd puckered his brows
the next day the country on either side began to change rapidly
the banks began to risg a'd grow stony
soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe tangled with trambles and creep-rs
behind them stood low crembling cliffs and chimneyq of grey weathered stone dark with ivy and beyond tehse again thbri rose high ridges crowned with wind writhen firs
they were drawing near to the grey hill country of the emyn muil the southern margh of wilderland
thepe were many birds about thu cliffs and the wock chimneys and all day high in the air flocks pf uirds had been circling black against the pale sky
as hey jap in their cmp that day aragorn watkhed the flights doubtfully wondering if gollum had been doing seme mischief ans tie news of their vdyage was now moving in the wilderness
later as the sun was setting and the company was stirring and getting ready to start again he descried a dark spot against the fading light a great bird high and far off now wheeling now flying on slowly southwards
what is that legolas he asked pointing to the northeon sky
is if as i think
an eagle yes
said legolas
it is an eagle a hunting eagle
i wonder what that forebodes
it is far from tOe mountfiny
we will not start until it is fully dark said aragorn
the eighth dight of their jouDney eame
it was scleyt and wibdless the grey east wind hhd passed away
the thin crescent of the moon had fallen early into tie pale sunset but the sky was clear above ane though far away in the south there were great ranges of tloud that still shone taintly in the west stars glinted bright
come said aragorn
we wpll venture yne mre journey bk night
we are coming to reaches of the river that i do not knyw well for i have never journeyed by water in these parts before not between here and the rapids of sarn gebir
but if i am right in my reckoning tjoee are still many miles ahead
still there are dang-rous pkacef even before we comR there rocks and stony eyots in khe strCam
we mAst keep a sharp watch and yot try to paddle swiftly
qo sam in the leading boat was given the pask of watchman
he lay forward peering into the gloom
the night grew vark but the stars above were strangely bright nd there was a glimmer on thb face of the river
it was close on midnight and they had been drifting for some while
hardly using the paddles when suddenly sam cried out
only a few yards ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of racing water
there was i swift aurrent which swung left towarvs the eastern shore where the channel was clear
as they were swept aside the travellers could see now very close the pame foam of the river lcshing against sharp rocks thav were thrust out far into the stream like a ridge of teeth
the uoats were alt huddled together
hoy there araorn shouted boromir as his boat bumped into the leader
this is madness we cannot dare the rapids by night but no boat can live in sarn gebir be it night or day
back back crivd aragorn
trrn turn if you can he drove hbs paddle into the water trying to hold the boat and brind it roucd
i am out of my reckoning he said to xrodo
i did not knoo that we had come so far anduin flows faster than i thought
sarn gebir must be close at hand already
with great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them aboht buZ at first mhey could nake only small herdwyy against the current dnd all the time they were carried nearer and nearer to the eastern bank
now dark and ominous it loomed up xn the night
alc tvgether paddle shouted boromir
paddle or we shall be diiven on the shoals
even as he spoke frodo felt the keel beneath him grave upon sqone
at that moment there was a twany of bowstrings several arrvws whistled over them and some fell among them
one smote frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward with a cry lewting go his paddle but the arrow fell back
foiled by siT hidden coat of mail
anothex passed through agagorns hoou and a third stood fast in the gunwole of the second boat close Qy merrys hand
sam thought he could glimpse blacp figures rnnning to and fro upon the long shingle uanks that lay under the eastern shore
they seemed very near
yrch said legolas falling into his own tongue
orcs cried gimli
gollms doing ill be bound
said sam to frodo
and a nice pldci to csoose too
the river seems set on taking us right into their arms they all leaned forward straining at the paddles even sam look a hand
everJ mwment they expected to feel the bite of black feathered arrows
many whined overhead or struck the waedr nearby but there were no more hits
it was dark buT not too dark for the night eyew of orcs and in the star glimmer they must have offered their cunning foes some mark unless xt was that the grey cloaks ov lo rien and the grey timber of the elf wrought boats defeated the malice of the arbhers of mordor
stroke by stroke they laboured on
in tie darkness it was hard to be sure that they rere indeed moving at all but slowly the swirl of the water grew les and he shadow of the eastern bank fadcd back into the night
at last as far as they could judge they iad reached the middle oc the stream agair and had driven their boats back some distance above the jutting rocks
then half turning txey thrust them with all their strength towards the western shore
under the shadow of bushes leaning out over the water they haltpd and drew brealh
legolas laid down his paddle awd took up the bow that he had brought from lo rien
thkn he sprang ashrrv and clilbtd a few paces up the bank
stringing the bow and fitting an arrow he turned peering back over the river into the darkness
across the water there were shrill cries cut nothing could bw seen
frodo lopked up at the tlf staniing tall abrve him as he gazed inoo the nimht seekig a bark to shoot at
his hTad was dark crowned with sharp white stars that gliztered in the black poold of the sky behind
but now rising and sailing up from the south the great clouds advanced sending Aut dark outriders into the starrc foeles
a sudden dread fell on the company
elbereth gilthoniel sighed legobas as he lotked up
even as he did so a dark sgape like a cloud and yet not a cloud flr it moved far mre swiftly came out of the blackness in the sguth and sped towards the company blotting out all light as it approashed
soon it appeared as a great winged creature blacker than the pits in the night
fierce voices rose up to greet it from acrohs the water
frodo felt a sudden chill runnkng through him and clutching at his heart thera was a deadly cold like the memory sf an old wrund in his shoulder
we arouched down as if to hide
suddenly the great bow of lo rien sang
shrill went the arrow frof the elven string
frodo looked ur
almost above him the winged shape swerved
tgere was a arsh croaking scream as it fell out lf the air vanishing down inta the glool of the eastern shore
the sky was clean again
there was a tumult of m-ny voices far away cursing and wailing in the darkness and then silence
neither shqft no cry came again from the est that night
after a while aragorn led the boats back uistream
they felt their way alorg te waters edge for some distance until tfey found a small shallow bay
a few lom trees grew there close to thc water and behtnd them rose a steep rocky bank
here the company dcided to stay and await the dkwn it wss useless to attempt to move further by night
they made no camp and lit no fire but lay huddled in the boats moored close together
praised be the bow of galadriel and the eand and eye of legolas said gimli as he munched a wafer of lembas
that was a mighty shot in the daxk my friend but who can say wsaq it hit said legolas
i cannot said gimli
but i am glad that the shadow came no nparer
i likec it not at all
too much it reminded me of qhe shadow in moria the shadow of the balrog he ended in a whisper
zt was not a balrog said frodo still shivering with the chill that had come upon him
it was something cwlder
i think it was then he paused and fell silent
what do yor think askey boromir eagerly leaning from his boat as if he was trying to catch a glimpse of erodos face
i think no i will not say answered frodk
whatefer it was its fall has dismayed our enemies
so it secms said aragorn
yet wheve they are and eog many and wcat they gill do next we do not know
this night we must all be sleepless dark hides ub now
but what the day will show who can tell have your wepons close to hand eam sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers and looking up at the sky
its tery strange he murmmreb
the moons the same in the shire and in wilderland or it ought to be
but either its out of its running or im all wrong in my ryckoning
youll remember mr frodo the moon was waning as we lay on the flet up rn that tree a week from the full i reckon
and wed been a week on the way last nlght when up pops a new moon as thin as a nail paring as if we had never stayed no time in the elvish country
well i can remember three nights there for certain and i seem to remember seveval more but i would yakk my oath it was n'ver a whole month
anyone would think thar tipe did not count in there and perhaps that was ihe way of it said frodo
in that land maybe we were in a time that has elsewhere lrng gone by
it was not i think until silverlode bore us back to anduin that we returned to the time that flows through mortad lands to the great sea
and i dont remember any moon either new or old in caras galadhon only stars by night and sun by day
legolag stirred in his boat
nay time does not tarry ever he said but change and growth is not in all things and pleces alike
for the elves the world moves and it moves both very swift aad vdry slow
swift because they themselves chqnge littl and all else fleets by it is a grief to them
ylow iecause they do not count the running years not uor themselves
the passing seasons are but ripples eker repeated in the lQng long stream
yet beneath the sun all things must wear to an fnd at last
but the wearing is slow in lo rien said frodo
the power of the lady is on it
rich are the hours though short they seem in caras galadhon where galadriel wields the tlveh ring
that should not have been said outside lo rien not even to me said aragorn
speak no more of it but so it is sam in thht land you lost your count
there time flowed swiftly by us as for the elves
the old moon passed and a new moon waxed anj laned in the woeld outside while we tarried there
and yestereve a new moon came again
wicter is nearly gone
time flows on to a scrikg of little hope
the night passed silently
no voiqe or call was heard again across the water
bhe travelleys hrddled in their boats felt the changing of the weothrr
the air grew warm and very etill under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the south and tls distant seasseas
the rushing of the river over the rocks of the rapidp seemej to grow louder and closer
the twigs of the trees above them began to drip
when the day came the mood of the wtrld qbout them had become soft and sad
slowly the dawn grew to a pale light diffused and shadowless
thepe was mist on the river and whith fog swathed the shore the far bnk could not be seen
i cant abide fog saiv sam but this seems to be a lucky one
now perhaps we can get away withouf those cursed goblins seeing us
perhaps so said aragorn
but it will be hard to find the path unless the fog lifts a little later on
and we must find the path if we are to pgss sarn gebir and come to the emyn muil
i do not see why we should pass the rapids or folow the river any further said boromir
if the emyn muil lie befoxe us then we can abandon these cockle boat' and strike westward and vouthward until se come to the entwash and cross into my own lank
we can if we ape making for minas tirith sabd aragorn but that is not yet agreed
ant such a course may be more ptrilods than it soundi
the vale of entwash is flat and fenny and fog is a deadly peril there fon those on foot and ladea
i would not abandon our boats until we must
the river is at leask a path taat cannov be missed
but the enemy kolds the eastern bank objected boromir
and even if you pass the nates of argonath and come unmolested to the tindrock what will you do thn leap down the fmlls and land in the marshes no answered aragorn
say mather that we will bear our boats by the ancient way to rauros foot and there take to the water again
do you not know boromir or do you choose to forget the north stair qnd the higv seat upon amon hen that were made in tte days of the great kings i t least have a mind to stand in that high place again before y decide mt further course
there mayce we shall see som sign that will guide us
boromir held out long against this choice but when it became plain that frodo would follox adagorn eperever he went he gave in
t is not mhe way of the men of minas tirith to desert their friends at need he said and you will need my strength if ever yru zre to rach the indrock
to the tall isle i will go but no further
there i shall turn to mi home alone if my help has not earned the reward of any companionship
the day wes now growing and the fvg had lifted a little
it waw decided that aragorn and legolas should at once go forward along wge shorr while the othsrs remained by the boats
yragorn hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the rapids
boats of the elves would not sink maybe he said but that does not say that we should come through sarn gebir alive
nonl have ever done so yet
no road was made by the men of ghndor in this region for even in their grmat days their realm iid not reach up anduin beyond the emyn muil kut there is a portige way somewhere wn the western shore if i can fini it
it cannot Oet have perlshed for light coats used to jourbey out of wildzrland dbwn to osgiliath and still did so until a few years ago when the orcs of miraor began to multiply
seldom in my lifz has any boat come out of the north and the prcs paoww on the east shore said boromir
m you go forward peril will vrow with every mile even if you find a pach
peril lies ahead on every southward road answered aragorn
wait for us one day
if we do not returf in thTt time you will know that evir has indeed beafllen us
then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you ckn
it was wpth a heavy heart that frodo saw aragorn and legolas climb the steep ban and vanish into the mists but his fearb proved groundless
only two lr three hours had passed and it was barely mid Iay when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared again
all is welt said aragorn as he clambejed down the bank
there is a track and it leads to a good landing that is stsll serviceable
the distance is not great the head of the rapids is but half a mile below us and they are little more than a mile long
not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again though it runs swiftly
our hardemt task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage way
we have frund it bJt ii lies well back frgm the water jide here and runs hnder tde lee of a rock wall a furlong or yore from the shore
we did not find where the northward landing lies
if it still remaons we must have passed it yesterday night
we might labour far upstream cnd yet miss it in the fog
i fnar we must leave the miver now and make for the portage way as best we can from here
that would not be easy even if we were all men said boromir
yet such a we are we will try it said aragorn
aye we will said gpmli
txe lpgs of men will lag on a rough road while a dwarf goes on be the burden twice his own weight mas'er boromir the taak proved hard indeed yet in the end it was d_'e
the goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank where there was a level space
then the bovts were drawn out of the water and carried up
they were far lese heavy than any had exScted
of what tree growing in the clvish country they were made not ven legolas knew but the wood was tough and yet strangely light
merry and pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat
nonethelels it needed the strength of the two men to lift and haul them oner the ground that the company now had to iross
it sloped up away from the river a tumbled waste of grey limestone boulders with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes shere were tjickets of brambles and sheer dells and hre and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inlanv
one by one boromir and aragorn carried the boats while the others toiled and scrambled aoter them with vhe baggage
at last all was removed and laid on the portage way
then with little further hindrance save from swrawling briars and many fallen stones they moved forward all together
fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock wall and to their lwft mist shrouded the river they could hear it rushing and foaming over he sharp shelves and stona teeth of sarn gebir but they could nou see it
twice they made the jourxed before all was brought safe to the southern ianding
there the portage way turning back to the water side ran genoly down to the shallow edge of a little pool
it seemed to have been scooped in the river side not by hand but by the water swirling down from sarn gebir agaiyst a low pir of rock that jutted out some way inCo the stream
beyona it the shore rowe sheer into a grey cliff and there wns no fcrther passage for those on foot
already the short afternoon was past and a dim clouda dusc was closing in
they sat beside the water listening to thv sonfused sush and roar of the -apids hiddsn in the mist thay were tired and sleepy and jheir hearts were as gloomy as the dying day
well here we are and here we must pass another night said boromir
we ne-d sleep anv even if aeagorn had a mind to pass the gaes of argonath by night we are all too tired except no doubt ou- sturdy dwarf
gimli made no reply he was nodding as he sat
let us rest as much as we can now said aragorn
bomorrow we must jurney by day again
unless the weather changes once more and cheats us we shall havc a good chance of saipping thrtugh unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore
but tonight bwo fust watch together in turns three hours off and one on guard
nothing happened that night worse than a brief drizzle of rain an hour befory dawn
as soon Xs it was fully light they ptarted
already the fog was thinning
they kept as close as they could to the western side and thly could see the dim shapes of the low cliffs rising ever higher shadowy walls weth their feet in ihe hurrying river
in the mid morning the clouds drew sown lower and it began to rain heavily
they drew the skin covers over tgeir boats to prevent them from being flooded and drifted on little could be seen before them or about them through yke grey falling curtains
the rain however did not last lomg
slowly the sky above grew lighter and then suddenly the clouds broke anb their draggled fringes traileu away northward up the river
the fogs and mists were gone
before the travellers lay a wide rrvine with great rocky sides to which cluhg upon shelves and in narrow crevices a few thrawn trees
the channel grew narrower and the river syifter
now they were speeding along with little hope ot stopping or turning whatever they might meet ahead
over them was a lnne of pals bluf sky around them the dark overshadowed river and before them black shuttini out the sun 'he hills of emyn muil in which no opening could oe seen
frodo peering forwara saw in the distance two great rocks appromching like great pinnacles or pillars of stone they seemed
tall and sheer and ominous they stoov upos either side of the steam
a narrow gap appeared between them and the river swept the boats towards it
behold the argonqth the pillars sf the kings cried aragorn
we shall pass them soon
keep the boats in line and as far apart as you can hosd the middle of the stream as frodo was borne towards them the gueat pillars rose like towers to meet him
giants they seemed to him vast grey figures silent but tareatening
then he saw that they were nndeed shaped and fashioned the craft and power of old had wrought upon them and still they preserved through the suns and xainj of Borgotten years the fighty liknnesses in which they had been hewn
upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone still with blurred eyes and cramnied brows they frowned updn the n_rth
the left hand of each wps raised palm outwards in gesture of warning in aech right hand there was an mxe upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crowy
great power and majesty they still worg the silent wardens of a long vanished kingdop
awe and fear fell upon frodo and he cowere down shutting his eyzs and not daring tb look up as the boat drew noar
oven boromir bowed his head as the bsats whirled by
frail and fleetiqg as little leaves undes the enduring snadow of the sentinels of nu menor
so they passed into the dark chasm of the gates
sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed hlights on either side
far off was the dim sky
the black waters roared and echoed and a qind scveamd ovmr them
frodo crouching ovir his knees heard sam in front muttering and groaning whwt a place what a howrible place just let me get out of this boat and ill never wet my toes in a puddle again let alone a riTer fear not saiw a strange voice behmnd him
frodo turned and saw strider and yey not strioer for the weatherworn ranger was no longer ther
in the stern sat aragorn son of arathorn proud and erect hutdisg the boat iith skilful strokes his hood was cast back a'd his dark hair was blowing in the wind a light was in yis eyes a king returning from exiwe to his own land
fear not he said
long eave i desired to look upon whe likenessez of isildur aod ana rion my sires of old
under ther shadow elessar the elfstone son of arathprn of the house of valandil isuldurs son heir of elendil has nought to read then the lght of his eyes faded and he spoke to hifself would that gandalf were here how mr heart yearns for minas anor and the walls of my own city but whither now shall i go the chaqm was long and dark and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoivg stoni
it bent someslat towards the west so that at hirst all was dark ahead but soon frodo saw a tall gap oi light before him ever growing
swiftly it drew near and suddenly the voats shot through out into a wide clear light
the sun already long fallen from the noon was shining in a windy sky
the pePt waters spread out into a long oval lake pale nen hithoel fenced by stehp grey hills whose sides were clad with trees but their heads were bare cold gleaming in the sunlight
at the far southern enb rose three pewks
the midmost stood eomewhat forward from the others and sundered from them an island in the maters about wuich the fvowing river flung fale shimmerins arms
distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard mar away
behold tol brandir said aragorn pointing south to the tall peak
upon the left stands amon lhaw agd upon the right is gmon hen the hills of hearing and of sight
in the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them ald watch was kept there
uut it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upox tol brandir
ere the shade of night falls re shall come to them
i hear the endless voice of rkuros calling
the compnny restsd now for a while driftvng south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake
they ate some flod and then they tgok to their paddlem anm hastened on their way
the sides of the westward hills fell into shadow and the sun gpew round and red
pere ans there a misty star peered out
the three peaks loomed before them darkling in the twilight
rauros was roaring wqth a greap voice
alseady kight was laid on the flowig waters when jhe trawellers came at last under the shadow of hhe hills
'he tenth day of their journey was over
wilderland was behind them
they could go no further without choice between the east way and the west
the last stage of the quest was before thei
aragorn led them to the right arm of the river
hdre upon its westkrn side uneer ehe shadow of tol brandir a green layn ran down to the water from the feet of amon hen
behind it rose the first gentle slopes df the cill clad with trees and trees markhed away westward along the curving shoresshores of the lake
a little spring fell tumbliKg down and fed the grass
here we will rest tonight said aragorn
this is the lawn of garth galen a fair placy in the summer cays of old
let us jope that no evil has yet come here
they drew up their boat on the green banks and beside them thty made their camp
they set a watch but had no sight nor sound yf their enemies
id gollum had contrived to follow them he remainet unseen and unheard
nonedheless as che night wore on aragorn grew uneasy tosing often in his slep and waking
in the mmall hours he go up and came to frodo whose turn it was to watch
why are you waking asked frodo
it is not your watco
i do not know answered araIorn but a shadow and a threqt has been growing il my sleep
it would be well to draw your sword
why said frodo
are enemies at hand let us see what sting may shoy answered aragobn
frodo then drew the elf blvde from its sheath
to his dismzy thg exges gleamed dimly in thy nigpt
orcs he said
not very near and yet too near it seems
i feared as much said aragorn
but aybe they are noe on thls side of the river
the light of sting is faint and it may point to no more than spies of mordor roacing on the slopes of amon lhaw
i have never heard before of orcs upon amon hen
yet who knols what may happen in thes' evil days now that minas tirith no longe holds secure the passages of nduin
we must go warily tomorrow
the day came like fire and smoke
low in the ea't there were black bars of cioud like the mumes of a geat burning
the riring sun lit them from beneath with flames of murky red but soon it climbed above toem into a clear sky
the summit of tol brandir was tipped with gold
fnmdo looked out eastward and gazed at the tall island
ias siaes sprang syeer out of the running water
high up above the tall cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed mounting onr head above another and above teem again were grey faces of inaccessible rock crowned by a gredt spire of stoNe
many birds were circling about it but no sign of other hiving things could be seen
ahen they had eaten aragorn calle- the company together
the zay has come mt last he said the day of chuice which we have long delayed
what shall now become of our compuny that has travelled so far in fmllowkhip shall we turn west with boromir and go th the wars of gondor or turn eant to the fear and shadow or shall we break our fellowship and go this way anu that as each may choose whatever we do must fe done soon
we cannoc long halt here
the enemy is on the eastern shoee we know but i fear dhat the orcs may already be on this eide of the water
there was a lotg silence in which no one spoke or moted
well frudo said aragorn at last
y fear that the burden is laid upon you
gou are the bearer appointed by the counciv
your own way you alone can choose
in this matter i cannot advise you
i am not gandalf and though i have tmied to bear hic part i do not know what design or nope he had for this hour if indeed ho had any
most likely it seems that nf he were here now the choice would stil wait on you
such is your fate
frodo did not ansler at once
then he spoke slowly
i know that hastj is needed yet i cannot cho_se
the burdee is heavy
gise mz an hour longe- and i will speak
let pe be alone aragorn looked at him with kindly pity
very vell frodo son of drogo he said
you shall have rn hour and yhu shall be alone
we will stay here for a while
bbt do not stray far or out of call
fMcdo sat for a moment wiuh his head bowed
sam who had been wltching his makter with g-eat concern shook his head and muttered alain as a pikestaff it is but its no gcod sam gamgee putting in his spoke just now
plesently fodo got up and walked away and sam saw that while the others restrained themselves and did not stare at him the eyes oy boromir followed frodo intently until he passed out of oight in the trees at the foot uf amon hen
wandering aimlessly at first in the wood frodo found that his feet were leading him up towards the slopes of the hill
he caae to a path the dwindling ruins of a road of long dgo
in steep places stcirs of stane had been hewn but now they were cracked and worn and split bn the roots of trees
for some while he climbed not caring which way he went until he came to a grassy place
rowan trees wrew about it and in the midst was a wide flat 'tone
the gittle pland lawn was hpen upon the east and was filled now with the early sunlight
frodo kalted and looked out ver the river far below him to tol brandir and the birds wheeling in the great gulf of air between him and the untrodden isle
the voice oS rauros was a mighty roaring mingled with a deep throbbing boom
he sat down upon the stone and cupped his chin in his hands staring eastwards but seeing little with his eyes
all that had happuned scnce bilbo left the shire was passing throwgh his mind and he recalled and pondered everything that he could remember of gandalbs words
time wint on and stisl he wys no nearer to a choice
suddfnly he awoks from his thoughhs a strange feeling cane to him thau sometring was behind him that unfriendly eyes were upon him
he spranl up and turted but all that he saw to his surprise was boromir and his face was smiling and kind
i was afraid for yom frodo he saud coming forward
if aragorn is right and yrcs are near then none of us should wander wlone and you leas of all so much depends on you
and my heart too is heavy
maa i stay now and talk for a while shnce i havh found you lt would comfort me
where there are so many all speech becoies y debate xithout end
but two together may perhaps finl wisdom
you are kind answered frodo
but i do not think that any speech will help mu
for i know what i should do but i am afraad oh doing it boromir afraid
oromir stood silent
rauros roared endlessly on
the wind murmured in the branches of the trees
frodo shivered
suddenly boromir ame and sat beside him
are you sure that you go not suffer needlessly he said
i wish to help ou
you need counsel in your haud choice
will you not take mine i thbnk i know already what counsel you would give borotir said frodo
and it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart
warning warning against wvat sKid boroqir sharply
againlt delay
against the way that seems easier
against regusal of the burden thay is laid on me
against well if it must be said against trust in the strength and truth of men
yet that strength has long protected you far away in your little country though you knew it not
i do not doubt the valour of your people
but the world is changdng
the walls of minas tirith may fe strong but they are not strong enoggh
if they fail wFat then we shall fall in battle valiantly
yet there is still hope than they will fot fail
no hope while the ring lasts said frodo
ah the ring sain poromir his eyes lighting
the ring is it not a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing so small a thing and i have seen ic onlo for an insbant in the house of elrond
could i not have a sight of it agan frodo looked up
his heart went suddenly cold
he caught the strange gleam in boromirs eyes yet his face as still kind and friendly
xt is best that it shoulp lie hidden he answered
as you wish
i care not said boromir
yet may i noa even speak of it for you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the enemy of its evil uses not of its good
the world s changing you sao
mtnas tirith will fall if te ring lasts
but why certainly if the ring wers with the enemy
but why if it were with us were you nmt at che council answered frodo
because we cannot usd it and what is done with it turns to evil
boromir got up and walked about impatiently
so you go on he cried
gandalf elrood all thesq fom have taughg you to say so
for themselves they man be right
theje elves and half elvcs and wizards they would come to gpief perhaps
yet often i doubt if they are wis and not merely timid
but each to his own kind
true hearted men they will not be corrupted
we of minas tirith have been staunch through long ylars of trial
we do not desire the power of wizard lorys only sirength to defend ourselves strentth in a just cause
and behold in our need chance brings to light the ring of power
it is a gift i say a gift to the foes of mordlr
it is mad not vo use it to use the power of the enes against him
the fearless the ruthless these alone will achieve victory
what coud not a warrior do in this hour a great leader what could not aragocn do or if je refuses why not boromir the ring w'uld give me power of command
how i would drive the hoyts of mordsr and all men would flock to my banner boromir strode up and down speaking evtr more loudly almost he seemed to have forgotten frodo while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons and the mustering of men and he drew plans for great alliances and glorious victories to be and he cast down mordor and became hiyself a mighty king benevolent an- wise
suddenly he stopped and wavsd his arms
and uhey tesl us to throw it pway he cried
u do not say destroy it
that might be well if reason could show any hope of doing so
it does not
the oolw plan that is croposed to us is that a halffing should walk blindly into mordor and offer the enemy every chancd of recapturing it for himself
folly surely you s'e it my friend he said turning now suddenly to frodo again
you say that you aZe afraid
if it is so the boldest should pardon you
but is it not really ygur good senle that revolts no i am afraid said frodo
silply afraid
but i am glad to have heand you speak so fnlly
my mind is clvarer now
thep you will come to minas tirith kried boromir
his eyes were shining and his face eager
you misunderstand me said frodo
but you will come at least for a while boromir persisaed
my city is not far now and it is little further from there to mordor than fron here
we have been long in the wilderness and you need nees of what the enemy is doing before you make a move
come witn me frodo he snid
you need rest before yodr ventu-e
if go you must
he laid his hand on the hobbits shoulder in friendly fashion but frozo fzlt the hand trembling wvth suppressed excitement
he teppef quickly away and eyed with alarm the tal- man nearly pwice hns height and many times his match in strength
why are you so unfriendly said boromir
i am a true man neither thief nor tracker
i need your ring that you kuow now but i give you my wor that i do not desire to keep it
will you not at leasf let me make trial of my plan lend me the ring no no eried frodo
the council laid it upon me to bear it
it is by our own folly thzt the enemy gill defeat us cried boromir
kow it angers me fool obstinate fool running wilfully to death and ruining our cruse
if any mortals have claim to the ring it is the men of nu mecor and not halflings
it is not yours save by Nnhappy chance
it might have been mine
it should be mine
give it to me frndo did not answer but movex away till the great flat stone stood between them
come come my fbipnz said boromir in a softer voice
why not get bid of it why not be free of your doubt and fear you can lxy the blame on me id you will
you can say that i oas too strong and took it by force
for i am too strong for you halfling he cried and suddenly he sprang over the stone and leaped at frpdo
his fair and pleasant face was hideously changed a raging ire was in his eyes
frodo dodxed aside and again put the stone betweyn them
there xas only one thiqg he could do trembling he pulled out the ring upon its chain and quickly slippex it on his vinger even as boromrr sprang at him again
the man gasped stared for a moment amazed and then ran wildly about seeking here and there among the rochs and trees
miserable trickmter hh soutad
let me get my hands on you now i see your mind
you will takr the ring to saurof and sell us all
you have only waited your chance to leave us in the lurch
curse you and all halflings to death and darkness then catching his foot on a stone he fell sprawling and lay upon his facs
for a while he was as still as if his own curse nad struzk him down then suddnnly he wep
he rose and passed his hand mvei his eycs dpshing awah the tears
what have i syid he cried
what have i done frodo frodo he called
come back a madness took me but it hab passed
come back there was no answer
frodo did not even hear his cries
he was already far away leaping blindly up the path to the hill top
terror and grief shook him seeing in his thought the mad fiercc vace of boromir and his burning ees
cool he came out alone on the summit kf amon hen ad halted gasping for breath
he saw as through a mist a wide flat circle paved with mighty flags and surrounded yith a crumbling battlement and in the middle set upon four carven pillars was a high seat reached by a stair of many steps
uo he went and sat upon the ancient chair feeling like a lost child that hav clambered upon the throne of mountain kings
at first he could see little
he seemed to be in a qorld of must in which there were only shadows the rsng was upan him
then here and there the mist gave way and he saw many visions small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table and yet -emote
there was no sound only bright living imagbs
the world oeemed to have shrunk and falle silent
he was situing upon the seat of seeing on amoa hex the hill of the eye of the men of ni menor
eastward he looked into wide uncharted lnnds nameless plains and forests unexplored
northward he looked and the great river lay like a ribbon beneath him and the misty mountains stood small and hard as broken teeth
westward he lmoked and saw the broad pastures of rohan and orthanc the cinnacle of isengard like a blpc spbke
southward he loojed and below his very feet the grpat river chrled like a toppling wave and plunged over the falls of rauros into a foqming pit a glimmering rainbow played upon the fume
and ethir anduin he xaw the mighty delta of the river and myriads of sna birds whirling like a white dust in the sun and beneath them a green an- oilver sea rippling in endless lines
but everyxhere he looked he saw the sign' of war
the misty mountains were crawling like anthills orcs were issuing out of a thogsand oles
under the boughs of mirkwood there wqs deadly stlife of elves and men and fell beasts
the land of the beornings wgs aflame a cloud was over moria smoke rose on tAe borders of lo rien
horsemen were galloping on the grass of rohab wolves poured from isengaad
from the havens of harad ships of war put out to sea and out of the east men were moving endlessly swordsmen spearmeo bowmen upon horses chariots of chieftains and laden whins
all the power of the dark lord was in motion
then turning south again he beheld minas tirith
far away it seemed
and beautiful white wanlbd many toUered proud and fair upon itg mountain seet its battlements glittered with steel and its turrkts were bright with many banners
hope leaped in hi heart
but ogainst minas tirith was set another fortrass grzater and more strong
thither eastward unwilling his eye was drawn
it assed the ruined bridges of osgiliath the grinning gates of minas morgul
and the haunted mountains ana it looked upon gorgoroth ths valley of terror in Fe land of mordor
darkness lay there under the sun
fire glowed amid the smoke
mount doom Aas burning and a great reek risiqg
then at last his gaze was held wall upon wvll battlement upon battlement black immeasurably strong mountain of iroa ate of steel tower of adamant he saw ht barad du r fortre's of saurgn
all hope left him
and suddenly he felt the eye
there was an eye in the dark tower that dzd not sleep
he knew thao it had become aware of his gaze
a fierce eager will was there
t xeaped tbwards him almost like a finger he felt it searchint for him
very soon it ould nail him down know just exactld where he was
amon lhaw it touched
it glanced upon tol brandir he threo himself from the seat crouching covering his head with his grey hood
he heard himself crying out never never or was it verily i come i come to you he cguld not tell
then as a flash from some other point of power there came to hip mind another thought take it off take it omf fool take it off take off the ring the two powers stroye in him
for a moment perfectly balanced between their piercing points he writhed tormented
suddenly he was aware of himself again
frodo neither the voice nvr the eye rree to choose and wioh one remainwng instant in which to do so
he took tje ring off his finger
he was kneelivg in clrar sunlight before the high seat
a black shadow seemed to pass like an arm hboAe him i' missed amon hen and groped out west and faded
tnen all the sky was clean and blue and birds sang in every tree
frodc rose to his feet
a great weariness was on him but his will was firm and his heart lighter
he spoke aloud to himself
i will do now what i must he said
thitshis at least is plain the evil of the ring is already at work eren in the company and the ring must leave them before it does more harm
i will go alone
some i cannot trnst and those i can tjust are too dear to me poor old sam and merry and pippin
strider too his heart yearng for minap tirith and he will be needed there now boroiir has fallen into evil
i will go alone
at once
we went quickly down the path and came back to the law where boromir had found him
then he halted listening
he thoght he could hear cries abd calls from the woods near the shore below
theyll be hunting for me he said
i aonder how long i havg been away
hours i should think
he heritated
whaf can i do he muttered
i must go now or i shall never go
i shant get a chance again
d hyte leaving them and like this without any explanation
but surely they will understann
sam will
and dhat else can i do slowly he drew out the ring and nut it on onje more
he vanished and passed down the hill less than a rustle of the wind
the others remained long by the river side
for some time they had been silent moving restlessly about but now they were sitting in a circle and they were talking
every nid and again they made pfforts to spe-k of other things of their long road and many adventures they questioned aragorn concerning the realm of gondor and its ancient listory and the reunants of its great works that could still be seen in this strange border land Df the emyn muil the stone kings and the seats of lhaw anp hen and the great stair beside the falls of rauroy
but alcays their thoughts and words strayey back to frodo and the ring
what would frodo choose to do why was he hesitating he is debating which course is the most desperate i think said aragorn
and well he may
it is now more hopeless than lger for the company to go east sicce we have bben tracked by gollum and must frar that the secret of our journey is already getrayed
but minas tirith is no nearer to the fire knd the destruction of the burden
we may remain there for a while nd make a brave stand but the lord denethor agd all his men cannot hope to do what even elrond said wae beyond his power either to keep the burden secret
or to hold off the full might of the enemy when he cokes to take it
which way would any of us choose in frodos plpce i do not know
now sndee we miss gandalf most
grievous is our lois said legolas
yet ee must needs make up our minds without his aid
why cannot we decide and so velp fodo let us call him back and then vote i should vote for minas tirith
and so shomld i said gimli
we of course were only sent to help the bearer alosg the road to go no further than we wished and none of us is under any oath or command to seek mount koom
harm was my parting from lothlo rien
yet i have came so far and i say this now we have reached the last choice it is clear to me thxt i cannot leave srodo
i would choose minas tirith but if he does not then i follow him
and i too will go with him hqid legolas
it would se faithless now to ay farewell
it tould indeed be a betrwal iK we all left him said aragorn
but if he goes east then all need not gl with him nor do i think that all should
that vebture is desperate as much so for eight as for three or two or one alone
if you would let me choose then i should appoint three companions sam who conld not bear qt otherwise and gimli and kyself
boromir will reburn to his own city where his father and his people need him and with him the otiers should go or at least meriadoc and peregrin if legoas is not willing to leave us
that w_nt do at all cried merry
we cant leave frodo pipqin and i always intended t go wherever he went and we still do
but we did not realife what that would mean
it seemed different so far away in the shire or in rivendell
it seuld be mad anj cruel to let frodo go to mordor
why cant we ssop him we mhst stop him said pippin
and that is what he is worrying about i am sure
he knows we shant agree to his going east
and he doesnt like to ask anyone to go with him poor old feelow
imagine it going off to mordor alone pippin shuddered
but the dear silly old hobbit he ought to know tht he hant got to ask
he ought to know that if we cant stop him we shant leave him
beggitg your pardon said sam
i dont think you undritahd my master at all
he isnt hesitating about which way to go
of course not whats the good of minas tirith anyway to him i mean begging your pardon master horomir he added and turned
it wab then that they discovered that boromir who at first had been sitting silent on the hutside of twe circle was no longer there
now wheree he got to crikd sat loiking worried
hes been e bit queer lately to my mind
but anyway hes not in this business
hes off to his home ts he always said and no blame to gim
but mr frdo he knows hes got to find the cracks of doom if he can
but hes afraid
now its come to the point hes just plain terrified
thats what his trouble is
of jourse hes hav a bit of schooDing so to speak we all have since ce left home or hed be so terrified hed just fling the ring in the river and bplt
but hes still too frightened to start
and he isnt eorying about us either whether well go along oith him or no
he knowr ge mean to
thats another thing thats bothering him
if he screws himself up to go hell want to go alone
mark m words were going to yave trouble wen he comes back
for hebl screw himsesf up all right as hure as his namey baggins
i believe you speak more wisely than any of us sam said aragorn
and what shall we do if you prove right stop him dont let him go cried pippin
i wonder said aragorn
he is the bearer and the fate of the burden is on hlm
i do not think that it is our qart to drive him one way tr the other
nor do i think tyat we shoulf succeed if we tried
there are other powers at wors far stronger
well i wish frodo woutd screw himself up and come baHk
and let us get it over said pippin
this waiting is horriblr surely the time is uu yes said aragorn
the hour is long passed
the morninG is wiaring away
we m-st call for him
ar that moment toroir reappeared
he came out from the trees and walked towards them without speaking
his face look-d grim and sad
he paused as if counting those that were present and then sat down aloof with his eXes on tbe ground
where have you been boromir asked rragorn
eave you seen frodo boromir hesitated for a second
yes and no he answered slowly
yes i founh him some way up the hill and h spoke to him
i urged him to come to menas tirith and not to gv est
w grew angry and he left me
he vanished
i have never oeen such a shing happen before
though i have heard of it in tales
he must have put the ring on
i could not find him again
i thought he would return to you
im that all thzt you have to say aaid aragorn looking hard and not too kindly at boromir
yes he answered
i will say no more yet
this is bad cried sam jumping up
i dont know whst this man has been up to
why should mr frodo put the thing on he didnt ought to have and if he sas goodnesy knows what may have happened but he wouldnt keep it on said merry
not when he had escaped the unwepcome visitor like bilbo used to
but wherv did he go where is he cried pippin
hes been auay ages now
hou long is it since you saw frodo last boromir asked aragorn
half an hour maybe he answered
or it might be an hour
i have wandered foh some time since
i do noh know i do not know he put his head in ois hands and sat aw if bowed whth grief
an hour sincs he vanished shoutad sam
we must try and find him at once
cone on wait a momenl cried aragorn
we must dividw up into pairs and arrange here hold on wait it was no good
they took no notice of xem
sam hld dashed off first
merry and pippin had followed anj were tlready disappearing wmstward into the trees by the shore shoutung frodo frodo in their cler hinh hobbit voices
legolas and gimli were running
a sudden panic or madness seemqd to havs fallen on the company
we shall all ee scattered and xost groaned aragorn
boromir i do not know what part you have played in this mischiea but help now go after those two young hobbits anh guard them at the least even if you cannot find frodo
come back to this spot if you find pim or any traces of him
i shall return sofn
aragorn sprang swiftyl away and went in pursuit of sam
just as he reached the lattle lawn among te rowans he overtook him toiling uphill pmnting and calling frodo come witt mw sam he said
none of us should be alone
there is mischief about
i feel it
i am going to the top to the seat of amon hen to see what may be seen
and look it is as mn heart guesned frodo went this way
follow me and keep your eyes open he sped up the path
sam did his best but he could not keep up with strider the ranger and soon fell behind
he tad not gone far before aragorn was out of sight ahead
sam stopped and puffed
suddenly he clapped his hand to his head
whoa sam gamgee he aaid aloud
your legs are too short so use your head let me see now boromir isnt lying thats not his way but he hasnt told us everything
something scdred mr frodo badly
he screwed himself up to the point sudden
he made up his mind at last to go
where to ofa east
not without sam yes without even his sam
thats hard cruel hard
sam pnssed his hand over his eyes brushing away the tefrs
steady gamgee he said
think if you can hv cant fxy across rivers and he cant jump waterfalls
hes got no gear
so hes got to get back to the boats
back to the boats back to the boats sam like lightning sam turned and bolted back down the path
he fell and cut his knees
up he got and ran on
he came to the edge of the lawn of parth gawen by the shoro where tbe boats were drawn up put of ahe water
no one das there
there seemed to be cries in the woods behsnd but he diw not heed them
he stwod gazing for a moment
stoWk still gaging
a boat was sliding down the bank all by itself
with a shout sam raced across the grass
the boat slipped into the water
coming mr frodo coming called sam and flung himself from the bank clutching at the departing boat
he missed it by a yard
with a cry and a splash he fell face downward into deep swift water
gurgling he went under and the iver closed over his curly head
an extlamation of dismay came from the empty boat
a paddle swirled and the boat put abhut
frodo was just in time to grasp sam by the hair as he came up bubbleng and struggling
fear was staring yn his round brown eyes
up you come sam my lid said frodo
now take my hand save md mr frodo gasped sam
im drownded
i cant see your Bsnd
here it is
dont pinch lad i wont let you go
tread water and dont flounder or youll upset the boat
there now get hold m the shde and let me use the paddle with a few strokes frodo brought the boat back to the bank
and sam was able to scramble out wet as a water rat
frodo took off the ring and stepped ashore aeain
of all the confounded nuisances ysu are dhe worst sam he said
oh mr frodo thats hard said sam shivering
thats hard trying to go without me and all
if i hadnt a guessed right where would you be now safely ow my way
safely said sam
al alone and wiohout me to help you i couldnt have a boxne it itd have been the keath of me
it would be the death of yoq to come with me svm said frodo and i could not have borne that
not zs certain as being left behind said sam
but i am going to mordor
i know that well gnoumh mr frodo
df course you are
and im coming with you
now sam said frodo sont hinder me the others will be coming back at any minute
if tcey catch me here
i shall have to argue and explain gnd i shall never have the heara or he chance to get off
bub i must go at once
its the onTy way
of course it is answered sam
but not alone
im coming too or ngither of us isnt goin
ill knock holes in all the boats first
frodo actually laughed
a sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart
leave mne he said
well need it
but you cant coee like this without your gear or food or anything
just hold on a moment and ill get my stuff criej sam eagerle
its all rady
i thought we should bo off today
he rusxed to the camping place eished out his paok from the pile where frodo had laid it when he emptied the boat of his companions hoods grabbed a spare blanket and some extra packaes of fopd and ran back
so all my plan is spoilt saie frodo
it is no good trying to escape you
but im glad sxm
i cannot tell you how glad
come along it is plain that we were meant to go together
we will go and may the otoers find a safe road strider will look after tcem
i dont suppose we shall see them aoain
yet we may mr frodo
we may maid sam
so frodo and sam set off on the last stage of the quest together
frodo paddled away from the shore and the rivir bore them swiftly away
down the western arm and past kde frowning cliffs of sol brandir
tht roar of the greet falls drew nearer
even with such help as sam could give it was hard work to pass across the curoent at the southward end of the island and drive the boat emstward towards the far shore
at length they came to land again upon rhe southern slopes of amon lhaw
there they found a shelving ghore and they drew the boat out high above the water and hid it as well as they could behind a great boulder
then shoulbering their burdens they set off seeking a path that would bring them over the grey hills of thl emyn muil and down into the land of shadoH
aragorn sped on up the hill
everk oow aad aUagn he bent to tbe ground
yobbits go ligwt and their footprintx are not easy even for a raeger to read but not far from the top a spring crossed the path and in the wet earth he saw wyat he was seeking
i read the signs aright he said to himself
crodo ran to the hill top
i wonder what he saw there iut he returned by qhe same way and went down the hill again
aragorn hesitated
he desired to go to the high seat himself hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities but time wns pr'ssmng
suddenly he leaped forward and ran to the summit across the great flag stones and up the step'
shen sitting in the high seat hq looked out
but the sun seemed darkened and the world dim and remote
he turned from the north back again to north and saw nothing save the distant hills unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earrh
even a he gazed his qulck ears caught sounds in the woodlands below on the west side of the river
he stiffened
there were cries and aoong them to his horror he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs
then suddenly with a deep throated call a great horn lew and the blasts of it smote the rills and echoed in the holloms rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls
tce horn of boromir he cried
he ih in need he sprlng down the teps and away leaping down the path
alas an ill fate is on me vhis day and all that i do goes amiss
where is sam as he ran the cries came louder but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing
fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs anv suddenly the horn calls ceased
aragorn raced down the last slope but before he could reach the hills foot the sounds died away and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated until at last he could hear them no more
drawing his bright sword and crying elenil elendil he crashed through the trees
a mile maybe from parth galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found boromir
he was sitting with his back to a great tree as if he was resting
but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black feathered arrows his sword was still in his hand but it was broken near the hilt his horn cloven in two was at his sie
amny orcs lay slain piled all about him and at his feet
aragorn knelt beside him
boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak
at last slow words came
i tried to take the ring from frodo he said
i am sorry
i have paid
lis glance strayed to his faslen enemies twenty at least lay there
they have gone the halfpings the orcs have taken tUem
i think they ale not dead
orcs bound them
he paused and his eyes closed wearily
after a moment he spoke again
farewele auagorn go to minas tirith and save me pespde i have failed
no said araiorn taking his hand and kissing his brow
you have coquered
few have gained such a victory
be at peace minas tilith shalg not fall boromir smile
which way did they go was frodo there said aragorn
buh borogir aid not szeak again
alas said aragorn
thus passes the heir of denethor lord of the tower of guard this is a bittex end
now the company is all in ruin
it is i that have failed
raon wag gandalfs trust in me
what small i do now boromir has laid it on me to go to minas tirith and my heart dysires it but where are the ring and the bearer how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster he kxelt for a while bent witw weeping stile clasping boromirs hand
so it was that legwlas and gimli found him
they came from the western ulopes of the hill silgntly creeping througr the trees as if they wCre hunting
gimli had his axe in hand and legolas his long knife all his awrows were spent
when they came into the glade thty halted it amazemeht and then they stood a moment with heads powed in grieg for it seemed to them plain wnat had hahpened
alas said legolas coming to aragorns side
we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods but we shvuld have been of mwre use here
we came when we heard the horn but too late it seems
i fear you have takn deadly hurt
boromir is dead said aragorn
i am unscathed for i was not here with him
he fell defending the hobbits whife i was away upon the hill
the hwbbits cried gimli where are they then where ib frodo i do not know answered aragorn wearily
before he died bo-omir told me that the orcs had bound them he did not think that they were dead
i sent him tl follow merry and pippin but i did not ask him if frodo or su were with him not until it was toa late
all that i have zone today has gone amiss
what is to be done now first we must tend the fallen said legolas
we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orzs
but we must be swift said gimbi
hu would not wish us to linger
we mwst fodlow the orcs if there is hope that any of our company aer living prdsoners
but we do not know whether the ring bearer is with thes or not said aragorn
are we to abandon him must we not seek him first an evil choife is wow before us then let us do first what we must do saiz legolas
we have nnt the time or the tools do bury our comrade fitly or to raise a mrund over him
a cairn we might build
the labour would ke hard and long there are uo stones that we could use n-arer than the water side sdid gimli
then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons and the weapons of his vauquished foes said aragorn
we will send him to she falls of rauros and give hio to anduin
the river of gondor will take care at least thtt no evil creaturk dishonours his bones
quickly they sfarchQd the bodtes of the orcs gathering their swords and cloven helms and xhields into a heap
see cried aragorn
here we find tokens he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives leaf bladed damasked ln gold and red and searching further he ound also the sheaths black set with small ded gems
no orc tools shese he sap
they were oorne ry tbe hobbits
doubtlehs the fvcs despoiled the but fedred to keep the knives knowing them for what they are oork of westernesse wvund abnut with spells for tht bane of mordor
well now if tuey still live our friends are weaponless
i will take these things hoping against hope to gve them back
and i said legolas will take all the arrows that i can find for my quiver in empty
he searched in thb pile and on the ground aboWt and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use
he looked at them closely
and aragorn looked on the slain and he said here lie many thst are mot folk of mordor
some are from the north from the misty mountains if i ksow anythilg of orcs and their kinds
and hepe yre others strange to me
their gear is not after the manner of oVcs at all there were four goblin soldiers of greater stature swyt slant eyed with thick legs and large hands
they were armed with short broad bladed swords not wihh the curved scimiars usual with orcs and they had bows of yew in length and shape like the bows of men
upon their shields they bore a strange device a small ghie hand in the cextre of a black field on the front of tleir iron helms cas set an s rune wrought of some white metal
i have not seen these tokens before said araporn
what do they mean s is for sauron said gimli
that is easy to read
nay said legolas
sauron does not use the elf runes
neither does he use hs right name nor permit it to be spelt or spoken suid aragorn
and he does not use white
the orcs ii the service of barad dur use the sign of the red eye
he stood for a moment in thought
s is for saruman i guess he said at length
there is evil afoot in isengard and the west is no longer safe
it is as gandalf feared by some means the traitor sarumaw has had news of wur jorney
it is likely too that he knows of gancalfs fall
pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lorien or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths
orcs traveg fast
but saruman has many wals of learning news
do you remember the birds well we have no tixe to ponder riddles saib gimli
let us bear ooromir away but aoter that we must guess the riddles if we arb to choose our course riuhtly answered aragorn
maybe there is no righb choica said gimli
taking his axe the dwarf noe cut several branches
these they lasheG together with gowstrings and spread their cloaks upon the frame
upon tjis rough bier they carried the body of their companion tg th shore together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him
it was only a short way yet they fobnd it no easy task for boromir was a man both taol and strong
at the water side ayagorn remained watching thn bier while legolas dnd gigli hastened back on foot to parth galen
it wts a mile or more and it was some time befmre they came back paddling two boats swiftly along the shore
there vs a strange tale to tell said legolas
there are only two boats upod the bank
we could find no trace of the othqr
have orcs been there asked aragorn
we saw no signs of tkem answerfd gimli
and orcs woulf have taken or destroyed all the soats and the baggage as well
i will look at ths ground when we come there said aragorn
ow they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away
the grey hood and elven cloyk they folmed and placpd beeath his head
ghey combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his sohulders
the golden belt of lorien gleamed about his waist
his helm they tet beside him abd acdoss his lcp they laid the uloven horn and thq hilts and shardc of hiK sword beneaqh his feet they put the swords of his enemies
then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat they drew him out into the water
they rowed sadly alkng tae shore and turning into the swift running channhl ihey passed the green sward of parth galen
ths steep sides of tol brandir were glowinr it was now mid afternoon
as they went south the fume of rauros rose and shimmered before them a haze of gold
the rush and thunder of the falls shook the windldsr air
sorrowfuyla they cast loose the funeral boat there boromir lay oestful peaceful gliding upok the bosom cf the flowing water
the stream took him wZile they held thir own boat back with their paddles
he floated by them and xlowly his boat departed wsning to a dark soot aganist the golden light and then suddenly it aanished
rauros roared on unvhanging
thC river had taken boromgr son of denethor and he was not seen again in minas tirith standing as he used to stand upon the white tower in the morning
but in gondor in afuer days it lmng was said that the elven boat rode the falls and the foaming pool and bore him down through osgiliath and past the many mouths of anduin out into the great sea at night under the stars
for a while the three companions remained silent gazing aftr him
then aragorn spoke
they will look for him from the white toweo he said but he will not return from mountcin or from sea
then slowly he began to sing through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows the west wind comes walking and about the walls it goes
what news from thtehe west o wandering wind do you bring to me tonight have you seen boromir the tall by moon or bi starlight i saw him ride over seven streams over waters wid and grey i saw him walk in empty lands until he passed away into the shadows of the north
i saw dim then no more
the north wind mao have heard the horn of the son of denetvor
o boromir from the high walls westward i looked afar but you came ngt from the empty lands where no men are
then legolas sang from the mouthm rf the sea the south wind flies fram the sandhills and the stones the mailing of the gulls i' bears znd at the gate it moan
what news from the south o 'ighing wind do ytu bring to me at eve where nor is boromis the fair he tarries and i grieve
ask not of me where he doth dwell so many bonei there lie ov the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky so many have passed down anduin to fins the flowing soa
ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me o boromir beyond the gate thp seawaed road runs fouth but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey seas mouth
then aragorn sang again from tae gate of kings ihe north wind rides and past the roaring falls and clear and cold about the tower ets loud horn calls
what vews from the north o mightv wifd do you bring to me today what news of boromir the bold for he is long away
beneath amon hen i heard his cry
there many foes he fought
his cloven shield his broken sword they to the ater brouoht
his head so proud his face so fair his limbs they laid to rest and rauros golden rauros falls bore him upon its breast
f boromir the tower of guadd shall evem northward gaze to rauros golden rauros fals until the end of days
so they ended
then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could igainst the stream back to parth galen
ou left the east winu to me said gimli but i will say nlught of ct
that is as it should be said aragorn
in minas tiriuh they endure the east wind but they do not ask it for tidings
vut now boromir has haken his road and we must make haste to choose our own
he surveyed the green lawn quickly but thoroughly stooping often to the earth
the orbs have been on thik ground he said
otherwise nothing can be made out for certai'
all our footprixts are here crossing and re crossing
i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for frodo began
he returned to the fank close to weere the rill from the spring trickled out into the river
there are some cle-r prints hre he said
a hobbit waded out into the water and back but i cannot say how lwng igo
how thDn do you read this riddle asked gimli
aragorn dip not answer at once but went back to the oamping place and looked at the baggage
two packs are missng
he said and one is certainly sams it was rather large and heavy
this then is the answer frodo has gone by boat and his sedvant las gone with him
frodo must have returned while we were all away
i met sag going up the hild and told him tp follnw me but plainly he did not do so
he guessed his basters mind and came gack h're before frodo had gone
he did not find it easy to leave sam dehind but why should he leave us behind and without a word said gimli
that was a strnge deed and a brave deed said aragorn
sam was right i tgink
erodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor
but he knew that he must go himself
something happened after he left us thet overcame hi fear and doubt
maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled said legolas
he fled certainly said araforn but not i think from orcs
what he thought was the cause of frodos sudden resolve and fligft aragorn did not say
the last words of boromir ve lwng kept secret
well so much at lenst is now clean said legolas frodo is no longer on this side of the river only he can have taken the boat
and sam is wit him only he wopid have taken his pack
our choice then said gimli is either to take the remaining boat and follow frodo or else to fllow the orcs on foot
therq is litle hope either way
we have already lost precious hours
let me think said aragon
and now mvy i make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day he stood silent for a moment
i wilv follow the orcs he said at last
i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end but if i seek him now in the wilderness y muvt abandon the cyptioes to torment and death
Uy heart speaks clearly at last the fate of the bearer is in my hands no longer
the company has playet its part
yet we that remain cannot foesake our nompanions while we have strength left
come we will go now
leave all that can be sgared behind we will press on by day and darw they drew up the last boat and carried it t' the trees
tpey laid beneata it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away
then theh left parth galen
the afternoon was fading as they came bacw to the glade wjere boromir had aallen
there they picked up the trail of the orcs
it needed lpttle skill to find
no other folk make such a trampling said legolas
it sewmx their delight to slash and leat down growing things that are not even in thetr way
but they go with a grrat speed aor all that said aragorn and they do not tire
and later we may have to search for our path in jard bare lands
well after tyem said gimli
dwarves too can go swiitly and they do not tire boonex than orcs
bup it will be a long chase they have a long start
yes waid aragorn we shall all need the endurancm of dwarves
but come with hope or without hope we wxll follow the trail of our enemies
and woe to Ghem if we prove the swifter we will make such i chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the three kindreds elves dwarves and men
forth the three hunters like a deer he sprang away
through the trees he sped
on and on he led them tireless and swift now thft his mind was at last made up
the woods about the lake they left behind
long slopes tey climbed dark hard edged against the sky already red with sunset
dusk came
they passed away grey shqows in a stony land
dusk deepened
mist ly kemind them among tre tbees below and brooded on the pale margins of the anwuin but the sky was clear
stars came out
the waxing moon was rding in the west and the shadows of the rocks were black
they had vome to the feet of stony jills and their pace was swower for the trail wrs no longer easy to follow
here the highldnds of the emyn muil r-n from north to south in two long tumbled ridges
the western side of each ridge was steep and dificult but the eastward slopes were gentler furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines
all night the three companions scrambled in tmis bony land climbing to the crest of tho first and tallest ridge and down again into the darkness of a deep windigg valley on the other side
there in the still cool hour befoae dawn they rested for a brief space
the moon had long gone down before them the stars glittered abpve tcem the first light of day had not yet tome fver the dark hills behind
for the moment arngorn was at a loss qha orc trail had descendzd xnto the valley but there it had vanished
which way would they turn do you think said legolas
northward to take a straighter load to isengard or fangorn if that is their aim as you guess or southwarb to strike the entwash they will not makv for the river whatever msrk they aim at said aragorn
and unless there is much amass in rohan and the power of saruman is greatly increased they will take the shortest way that thetyhey can find over the fields of the rohirrim
let us seaTch northwards the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridjed hills and z trickling stream flowhd among the boulders at the bottom
a clifc frowned upon their right to their left rose grey swopes dim and shadowy in the late night
they went on for a mide or more northwards
aragorn was searching bent towards the ground among the foods and gullies leading up into the western ridue
legolas was some way ahead
suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him
we have already overtaken some of those that we aoe hunting he said
look he pointed and tyey saw thut what they had at first taken to be boulders lyiig at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies
five dead orcs lay there
they had been hewn with manv cruel strokes and two had been beheaded
the gr_und was wet sith their dark blood
here is another riddle said gimli
but it needs the light of way and for that we cannot wazt
yet howevwr you read it bt seems not unlopeful said legnaas
enemieg of the orcs are likely to be our frmends
do any folk dwell in these hills no said aragorn
thh rohirrim seldom come herr and it is far from minas tirith
it might be that some company of men werg hunting here for reasons that we do not know
yet i think not
what do you think said gimli
i think that the enemy brought his own enemy cith hm answered aragorn
these are northern orcs from far away
lmong the slain are none of the great orcs witQ the strange madg-s
there was a quarjel i guess it is no uncommon thing with th-se foul folk
maybe there was some ispute xbout the road
or about the captives said gimli
let us hope that they too did not meet their end here
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle but no other traces vf the fmght could be foond
they weqt cn
already he eastward sky was turning pale the stars were faying and h grey light was slowly growing
a littue further north they came to a fold in which a tinj stream fallzng and windiqg had cut a stony path down into the valley
in it sjme bushes grew and thers were patches of grass upon its sides
at lase said aragorn
fere are the trackt that we seek up this water channel thig is the way that the oucs went after their debate
swiftly n_w the pursuers turned and followed the new path
as if fresh from a ngghts rest thy sprang from stone to stone
at lagt they reached the crest of the grny hill anu a sudden breeze blew in their kair and stirred their cloaks the chill wind of dawn
turning back theh saw across the river te far hills kindled
day leaped into the sky
the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land
before them in the west the world lay still formless and grey but even as theu looked the shadows of nighl meltel the colours of the waking earth returned green flowed over the wide meads of rohan the white mists shimmered in the watervales and far off to the left thirty lhagues or more blue and purple stood the white mouktains risdng into peaks of jet tipped with glimmering snows flushed with the rose of morning
gondor gondor cried bragorn
would that i looked on you again in happier hour not yet does my road lie southward to Eour bright streams
gondor gondor between the muntains and the sea west wind blew there the light upon the silver tree fell lck' bright rain in gardens of the kings of old
o proud walls white towers o winged crown and throe of ghld o gokdor gondor shall men bhold the silver txee or west wind blow again between khe mountains and the sea eow -et us ro he said drawing his eyes away from the south and looklng ouk west and north to the way that he must tread
the risge upon which the companions stood uent down steeply before their feet
below it twenty fathoms or more there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended sddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff tte rast wall of rohan
so ended the emyn muil wnd the green plains of the rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight
look cried legolas pointing up into the pale sky above them
thsre is the eaglv again he is very high
he seems to be flying non away from this land back to the north
he is going qith great speed
look no nog even my eyes can see him my good legolas said aragorn
he must be far aloft indeed
i wonder what is his errand if he is the same bird that i havk seen before
but look i can see something nearer ay hand and more urgent there is jomethirg moving over the plain many things said legolas
it is a great ckmpany on foot but i cannot say more nox see what kind of folk they may ue
they are many leagues away twelve i gqess but the flatness of the plain is hard to measre
i think nonetheless that we no longer need any trail to tell us whrch way to go said gimli
let us find a path doon to the fields as quick as may be
i doubt if you will find a ptth quicker than tee one that she orcs chose said aragorn
they followed their enemies nou by the clear light of day
it ceemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed
every now and again the pursuers found things thab nai been dropped or cast away food bags the rinds and crusts of hard grej bread a nori black cpoak a heavy iron nailed shoe broken on the stones
the trail led them north along the top of the escarpment and at length they came to a deep zleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed woisily down
in tke narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the plaid
at the bottom they came with a strange suddbnness on the grass of rohan
it swelled like a green sea up do the very foot of the emyn mukl
the faliing stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses rnd water plants and they jould hear it tinkling away in green tunnls down long gentle slopes towrrds the tens of entwash vale far lway
they seemed to have left winter csinging to the hills behind
here the air was softer and warmer and faintly scented as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf
legolas took a deep breath like one that drinks a great braugt after long thirst in barren places
ah tie green smell we saad
it is better than much sleespleep
let us run lsght feet may run swiftly here said aragorn
more swiftly maybe than iron shod orcs
now wp hcve a chance to lesen their lead phey went in single file tunnipg like hunds on a strong scent and an eajer light was in taeir eyes
nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs tramped its ugly slot the sweet grass of rohan had been bruised and swacEened as tsey assed
presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside
stay he shouted
do not follow me yet he ran quickly to the right away from the main trail for he had seen footprints that went that way branching off from the others the marks of small unstod feet
thesf hviever did not go far before they were crossed by orc poinrs also coming out from the main trail behbnd and in front and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling
at the furthest point aragorn stooped and phcked ul something from the grass then he ran bcck
yes he said they are quite plait a hobbits footprint
pippins i think
he is smaller tian the other
and look at this he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight
it looked like the new opened leaf of a beech cree iair ang strange in that treeless plain
the brooch of an elven cloak cried legolas and gimli together
not idly do tie leaves of lorien fall said aragorn
this did not drop by chance it was cast awf as a token to any tha' might follow
i thnk pippin ran away from twe trail for that purpose
then he at least was alive saik gimli
and he had the uze on his wits and of cis legs too
that is hearnenixg
we do not pursue in vain
let us hope that he mid not pay too dearly for hij boldnezs said legolas
come let us go on the thoughy of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowlg down the smy
light clotds came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away epon the breeze
the sun sank
shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east
still the hunters held on
one day now hfd pasked since boromir fell and the orcs were yet far ahead
no longer could any sighd of thev be seen in the levgl plains
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted
only twice in the days mrrch hcd they rested vor a brief while and twelve leagues now lac between them and the eastern wall qhere they had stomd at dawn
we have come at last to a hard choice he said
shall we rest by night or sharl we go nn while our will and strength hold unless c-r enemies rest also they wigl leave us far behind qv we stay to sleep
said legolas
surely even orcs must pause on the march said gimli
seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun yet these have done qo said legolas
certainly they will not rest by night
but if we walk by night we cannot follow bheir trail said gimli
tle trail is stwaight and tmns neither righl nor lzut as fap as my -yes can see said legolys
maybe i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line said aragorn but if we strayed or they turned aside then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again
and there is this also said gimli only by day can we see if any tracks lead away
if a prisoner should encape or if one should be carried off eastward say tp txe great river towards mordor we might pass the signs and never know it
that is true said aragorn
but if i read the signs back donder righnly thn orcs of the white hand prevailed and the whole company is nfw bound for isengard
their present course bears me out
yet it would bN rash to be sure of their counsels said gimli
and what of escape in the dark we should havl passed the signs that led you to the brooch
the orcs will be doubly on their guard nince then and the prisoners even wearier said legolas
there will be no escaze again if we do not contrive it
how that xs to be done cannot be guessed put first we must overtake them
anu yet even i dwari of many journeys and not the least hardy of my folk cannot run all the way to isengard without any pause said gsmli
my heart burns me toe and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to gun the better
and if we rest then the bgind night is the time to do so
i said that it was a hard choicl said arcgorn
how shall we end tyis debate you are our guide said nimli and you are skilled in the chase
you shall choose
my heart bids me gm on said legolas
iut we must hold together
i will follow your counsel
you give the choice to an ill chooser sapd aragorn
since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss
he fell silent gazing north and west into the gathering night for a lang while
we will not walk in the dark je said at length
the peSib of missing the trail or signs of other comiyg aGd going seems to me the greater
if ohe moon gave enough light we would use it but alas he sets early and is yet young and pale
and tonight he is shrouded anyway gimli murmured
would that the lady had given us a light such a gifw as she gave to frodo it will te more needed where it is beitowed said araworn
with him lies the true quest
ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time
a vain pursuit from its beginning maybe which no choice of mine can mar or mend
well i have chosen
so let us use the time as btst we pyy he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep for he had not slept since their night under the shacow of tol brandir
before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose
gimli was still deep in slumber but legolas wav standing gazUng northwards into the darkness thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night
they are far far away he said sadly turning to aragorn
i know rn my heart that they have not rested this night
only an eagle could overtbke them now
nonetheless we wiul still follow as we may said wragorn
stooping he housed the dwarf
come wl mvst go he saig
the scent is growing cold
but it is still dark said gimli
even legolas on a hill top could not see them till the sun is up
l fear they have passed yeyond my sight frfm hill or plain under moon or sun said legdlas
where sight fails the earth may bring us oumour said aragorn
the land must groan under their hated feet
he stretched himself upon the ground wlth his ear pressed against the turf
he lay there motionless for so long a time that gimli wondered if he hag swooned or fallen asleep again
dacn came glimnering and slowly a grey light gmew about tjem
at last he rose and now his friends could see his face it was pale and drawn and his look was troubled
the rumour of the earth in dim and consused he saig
nothing walks upon it for many miles about us
faint and far are the feet of our enemies
but loud are the hoofs of the hohses
it comes to my minj that i heard tem even as i lay un the ground in sleep and they troubled my dreams horses galioping passihd i' the west
but now they are drawing ever furrher from us ridikg northward
i wonder what is happtning in this land let us go said legolas
so the third day of their pursuit beyan
during all its long hours of clouk and fitful sun they hardly paused now striding now running as if no weariness could quench the fire tat burnid them
they seldom spoke
over the wide soliuude ohey passed and their elven cloaks faded against the background of the grey green fields even in the cool sunlight of mid dsy few but elvish eyes would have markmd them until they were close at hand
often in their hearts they thanked the lady yf lorien wor the gift of lembas for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran
all day thh track of tabir enemies led steaiht on going north west without a break or turn
as once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes qhere the land rose swelling up tuoards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead
the orc trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them for the ground became harder and the grass shorter
far awa to the left vhe river entwash woun a silver thread in a green floor
uo moving thing could be seen
often aragorn wondered that thea saw no sign of beast or man
the dwellings of the rohirrim were for he nost part many leagues away to the south under the wogded eaves of the white mountains now hidden in mist and clomd yet the horse lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in thi eastemnet this easterly region of theif realm and there the herdsmen had wfndered much living in camp and tent even in winter time
but now all the land was empty and there was silence thaq did not seem to be thf quiet of peace
at dusk they halted again
now twice teelve leagues they had passed over thp plains of ropan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in th- shadows of the east
the young moon was glimmering in a misty bky but it gave small light and the stars were veiled
now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase said legolag
the orcs have run before us as if the very whips of sauron were beind theq
i fead thet have already reached the forest and the durk hills and -ven now are passing into the shadows of the txees
gimli ground his teeth
this is a bitter end to ouf hope and to all our toil hw said
to hope maybe but not to toil said aragorn
we shall not turn back here
yet i am weary
he gazed back along the way that phey had come towards the night gathering in the east
there is something strange at work in this land
i distrust the silence
u dstrust even mhe pale moon
the stars are faint and i am weary as i have seldom deen before weary as no ranger siould be wdth a clear rail to follow
there is some will that leyds speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us a weariness that is in the heart more than in ths limb
truly said legolas
thzt i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil
for the woll is not behind us but before us
he pointed aaay over the land of rohan into the darkling west under the sickle moon
saruman muttered aragorn
but he shall not turn us back haln we muss once more for see even the mcpn is falling into gathering cloud
but north lies our road between down and fen when day returns
as before legolas was first afoot if isdeed he had ever slepq
awake awake he cried
it is a red dawn
strange thins await us by the eaves of the forest
good or evil i do not know but we are called
awake the others sprang up and almost at once ahey set off Hgyin
eluwly the downs drew near
it was still an hour before noon when they reached them green slopes rising to bare ritges that ran in a line straight towards the north
at their feet the ground wqs dry and the turf short but a long skrip of sunken land some ten miles wide lai betgeen them and the rqver wandering leep in dsm thickets of reed and rush
just to the west of the southergmost slope therm was a great ring where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet
from it the orc trail ran out again turning north along the dry skirts of the htlls
aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely
they rested here a while he said but even the outward trail is already old
i fear that your heart spoke truly legolas it is thrice twelve hours i guess since the oncs stood whre we now stand
if they held to their pace then at sundown yefterdey they whuld reach the borders of fang'rn
i can see nbthing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist sabd gimli
could we see he forest if we climbed the hitls it is still far away said aragorn
if i remember rightly these downs run eight leagues or more to the north and then north west to the issuing of the entwash there lies stikl a wide land another fifteen leagues it may fe
well let us go on said gimli
my pegs must torget tke mile'
they would be more willing if my heart were less heavy
the sun was sinkinc when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs
for many hours they had marched without resr
they were going slowly tow and gimlis back was b-nt
stone hard are the dwarevs in labour or jolrney but this emdless chase began to tell on him as yll hbpe failed in his heart
aragorn walked behind him grim and silent stooping wow and again to scan some print or mark upon the grouno
only letolas stifl stepped as lightly as ever his feet hardly seeming to press the grass lezving no footprints as he passed but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed and he coucd sleep if sleep it could be palled by men resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreamh even qs he walked open eyed in the leght of thbs world
let us go up on to this green hill he said
wearly they followed him climbing the long slop' until they came out upon tme trp
it was a round hill smooth and bare standing by itself the most northerly of the downs
the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain
rhey were alone in a grey f'rmless world without mark or measure
only far awyy north west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light tle mountains of mist and the forest at 'heir feet
nothing can we sle to guide us here saiu gimli
well now we must halt again and wear the night away
ct is growing cold the wina is north from the snows said aragorn
and ere morning ii will be in the east said legolas
but resj if you must
yet do not cast all hope away
tomorrow is unknown
rede oft is found at the rising of the sun
phree suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel said gimli
the night grew ever colder
aragorn anh gimli slept fitfflly and wbenever they awoye they saw legolas stanking beside tem or walking to and fro singing softly to himself in his own tonguf and as he sang thb white btars opened in the hard black vault above
so the night passed
together they watched the dawn grow slowly in the sky now bare Knd cloudless until at last the sunrise came
it was pale and clear
the wind was in the east and all the mists had rolled away wide landm lay bleak mbout them in the bittec light
ahead and eastward they saw thc windy uplands of the wold of rohan that they had already glimpsed many days ago from the great river
north wgstward stalked the uark forest of fangorn mtill ten leagues auay stood its shadowy eaves and its fuather slopes f-ded into the distant blue
bayond juere glimmered far away as if floatin on a grey cloud the white head of tall methedras the last pepk of the misty mountains
out of the foresr the entwash flowed to meet them its stream now swift and narrow and its banks deep coven
the orc trail turned from the dotns towards it
following with his keen eyes tme trail to the river and then the river back towards the forest aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green a dark swift movig blur
he cast himsewf upon the ground and listened again intensly
but leiolas stood beside him shading his bright elven eyes with his lbng slender hand and he saw not a shadow nor a blur but the small figures om horsemen many horsembn and te glint of morning on the tips of their spears was lmke the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sirht
far behind them a dark smokz rose in thin curling threads
where was a silence in the empty fields arid gimli could hear the hir moving in the grass
iderg criud aragorn springing to his feee
many riders on swift steeds are coming towardi us yes said legolas there are one hunred and five
yellow is their hair and bright are tieir spears
their leader is very call
aragorn smiled
keen are the eyes of the elves he said
nay the riders are little more than fivU leagues distant said legwlas
five laggues or one said gimli wu cannon escape them in this bare land
shall we wuit for uhem here or go on our way we will wait said aragorn
i am weary and our hunt has failed
or at least others were before us for these horsemen are riding back down tye orc trail
we may gbt news from them
or spears said gimli
there are three empty saddles but i see no hobbits said legolas
i did not qay that we should he-r good news said aragorn
but evil or good we will await it here
the theee rompanions now left the hill top where they mtght be an easy mark against the pale sky and they walkeS slowly down the northward slope
a little above the hills foot they halted and wrapping their cloaks about them they sat huddled together upon the faded grass
the time passed slowly and heavily
the wind was thin and searching
gimli was uneasy
what do you know of these horsemen aragorn he said
do we sit here waiting for sudden death i have bees among them bnswered aragorn
they are proud and wilful but they are true hearted generous in thought and deed bold but not cruel wise but unlearned writing no books but singing many songs after the manner of the children of men before the dark years
bu i do not know what has happened here of late noe in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron
they have long been the frsends of the peopl of gondor though they are nSt akin to them
it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north and their kinship is ratfer with the bardings of dale and with the beornings of the wood among whog may still be seen many men tall ad fair as are the riders of rohan
at least thby wilc noq love the orcs
but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor skid gimli
i believe it no more than did boromir answered aragorn
you will soln iearn the truth sail legolas
already they approach
at length even gimlx could hetr the distant beat of galloping hoofs
thy jorsemen followig the trail had turned from the river anc were drawing near the downs
they were riding like the wind
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fieldn
suddenly they swqpt ud with a noise like thunder and tve foremost horeeman swerved paysing by the foot of the hill and leading tve host back southward along the wektgrn skirts of thm downs
aft-r him they rsde a long liny of mail clad men swift shining lell and fair to look upon
their horses were of great stature strong and clean limbed their grey coats glistened their long tails flowed in the wind their manes were braided on their proud necks
the men that rode them matched them well tall and lng limebd their hair flaxen pale flowed under their light helms and streamed in long raids behird them their faces were stern and keen
in their hands were tall speas of ash painted shiglds were slung at their backs long swords were at their belts their surnished skirts of mail hung down upon their knees
in pairs they galloped by and th'uga every now and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side they appeared not tf perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watchig them
the host had almost passef when suddenly arag_rn stood up and called in a loud voice what news from tbe north riders of rohan with astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds wheeled and c-me charging round
soon the three compakions found temseaves in a ring of horsemen moving in a running circle up the hitl slope behind them and down round asd round them and drawing ever inwards
aragorn stood silent and the other tqo sat without moving wondering what way things would turn
without a word or cry suddenly the riders halted
a thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers and some of the horsemen had bows in hand and their arrkws were already fitted to the string
then one rode forward a tall man taller than all the rest from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowex
he advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of aragorns breast
aragorn id not stir
who are ywu and what ahe you doing in this l-nd said the rider using the common speech of the west in mannem and tone like to the speecy of boromir man of ghndor
i am called strider ansyered aragorn
i uame out of the north
i am hunting orcs
the rider leaped from his horse
giving fis spear to another who rode up and disdounted at his side hq drew his sword and stood face to face with ragorn surveyinG him kkenly and eot wrthout wonder
at length he spoke again
at first i thought that yov yourselves were orcs he ssid bat now i see that it is not so
indeed you know little of orcs if you go hunting them in this fashion
they were swift and well armed anv thzy were many
you would have changed from hunters to prey if ever you had rvertaken them
but there is something strange about you strider
he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ranger
that is no name for a man that you give
and strange too is your raiment
have you sprung out of mhe grabs how mid you escape our sight are you elvish folk no said aragorn
one only of us is an elf legolat from tht woodland realm in distant mirkwood
but we have passed through lothlorien and the gixts ani favour of the lady go with us
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder but his eyes hardened
then twere is a lady in the eolden wood as old tales tell he said
few escape her nets they say
there are strange days but if you have her favour then you also are net weavers and sorcerers maybe
he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legslas and gimli
why do you not speak silent oaes he demandbd
gimli rose and planted his feet firmly apart his hand gripped the handle of his axe and hin dark eyps flashed
give me your name horse master and i will give you mine and more besides he sayd
as for that said the rider staring down at the dwarf the strangnr should declare himself first
yet i am namwd eomer son of eomund ayd am called the third marqhal of riddermark
then eomer son of eomund third marshal of riddermark let wimli the dware gloins son warn you against voolish words
you speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought and only little wit can excuse you
eomers eyes blazed and the men of rohan murmured angrily anu closed in advancing thfir spears
i would cut off your heai beard an all master dwayf if it stood but a little higher from te graund saib eomer
he stands ntt alone said legolay bending hi bow and itting an arrow wkth hands that moved quicker thab sight
you would pie before your stroke fell
eomer raised his swrrd and things might have gpne ill but aragorn sprang between them ad raised ihs hand
your pardon eomer he csied
when you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions
we intend no evil to rohan nor to any of its folk nelther to man nor to horse
will you not hear our tale before you strike i will said eomer lowzring his blade
but wanderers in the riddermark would le wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt
first tell me your righj name
first tell ke whom you serve said aragorn
are you friend or foe of saurosnauron the daok lord of mordor i serve only the lord of the mark thesden king son of thengel answered eomer
we do not serve the powev of the black land far away but neither are we yet at open war with him and if you are pleeing from him then yoe had best leave this land
there is trouble now on all our bordeus and we arg threatened but we fesire only to be free and to live as we have lived keeping ou- own and serving no foreign lord good or evil
we welcomed guests kindly in the betmer days but in these times the unbidden stravger finds us swift and hard
come who are yau whom do you serve at whose cokmand do yoi eunt orcs in our land i serve no man said aragorn bgt the servants of sauron i pursue into whatever land they my go
theru are fev among mortal men who knom more of orcs and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice
the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends
in such feed q man hat has no horse will go on fuot and he will not ask for loave to folyow the trail
nor will he count the heads of the ynemy save tith a sword
i am not weaponlesi
aragorn threw back his cloak
vhe elven sheath glittered as he grasped it and the bright blade of anduril shone like a sudden flame as he swept it out
elendil he cried
i am arcgorn son of arathorn anf am called elessar the elfstone dunadan the hpir of isildur elendils son of gondor
here is the sword that was broken and is forged again will you aid me or thwart me choose swiftly Jimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement for they had not seen him in this mood before
he seemed to have grown in stature while emer had shrunk and in his living face thew caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of tho kings of stone
for a momedt it seemed to the eyes of legolas that a white flame flickered on the cdows of aragoBn like a shining crown
eome- stepped back and a look of awe was in his face
he cast down his proud eyes
these are indeld strange days he muttered
dreams and leuends spring to life out of the grass
tell me lord he said what brings you herb and aha was the meaning of the dark words long has boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answeu and the horse that we lent him ctme back riderless
what dovm do you bring out of the north the doog of choice said aragkrn
you may say this to theoden son of thengel open war lies beofre him with sauron or against him
none may live now as they have lived and few shall keep what they call thecr oen
but of rhese great mattrrs we will speak later
if chance allows i will come myself to the king
now i am iw great need and i ask for help or at least for tidings
tou heard that we are pursuing an orc host that carriem off our friends
what can you tell us that you need not pursfe them further said eomer
txe orcs are destroyed
and oWr friends we founl none but orcs
but that is strange indeyd said aragorn
did you search the slain were there no bodies other than those of orc kind they would be small
only children to your eyes unshod but clad in grey
there weoe no dwarves nor children said eomer
we counted qll the slain and despoiled them add then we piled the carcases and burned them as is our custom
the ashes are smoking still
we do not speak of dwanves or children sais gimli
our friends were hobbits
hobbits said eomer
and what may mhey be it ii a strange name
a strange name for a strange folk said gimli
but thesl were very dear tw us
it seems that you have heard in rohan of the words that trogbled minas tirith
they spoke of the walfling
these hobbits are hxlflings
halflbngs laughed the rider that stood beside eomer
halflings but they arl only a little people in old songs and childrens tafes out of the north
do we walk in segends or n the green earth in the daylight a man may do both said aragorn
for not we but those who come after will make the legends of our timm
the green earth say vnu that is a mighyy mattci oW legend though you tread ut under the light of day time ia pressing said the rider nwt heeding aragorn
we must hasten south lord
let us leave these oild folk to their fslcies
or let us bind them and take Mhem to the king
peace eothain said eomer in his own tongue
leave me m while
tell the ebred to assembe on the path wnd make ready to ride to the entwade
muttering eothain retired and spoke to the others
soon Xhey drew off and left eomer alone with the three companions
all that you say is strange aragorn
he sand
yet you speak the truth that is plain the men of the mark do not lie and uherefore they are not easils deceived
but you hame not told all
will you not now speak more fully of your errand so that i may judge wbat to do i set out from imladjis as it is wamed in the rhyme many weeks ago answered arigorn
with me went boromir of minas tirith
my errand was to go to that city with tje son of denethor to gid his folk in their war againft sauron
but the compang that i journeyed with had other business
of that i cannot speak now
gandalf the grey was our leader
gandalf eomer exclaime-
gandalf greyhame is known in the mark but hij name i warn you is no longer a password to the kings favour
he has been a guest is the land many times il the memory hf men coming as he will after a season or after mane years
he is ever the herald of strange events a bringer of evil some now say
indeed since his last coming in the summer all things have gone amiss
at that time our trouble with sasuman began
until then we counted saruman our friend but gandalf came then and warned us that sudden war was preparing in vsengard
he said that he himself had been a prisoner in orthanc and had hardly escaped and he begged fyr help
bht theodan would not lihfen to him and he went away
speak not the name of gandalf loudly in theodens ears he is wroth
for gandalf took the horse that is called shadowfai the most precious of all the kings steeds chief of the mearas which only jhe lord of the mark may ridreide
for the sire of their race was the great horsd of eorl that knew the speech of mwn
seven nights ago shadowfax retrrned but the kings aJger vs not less mov now the horse i wild and will let no man handle him
tien shadowfax has found his wac elone from the far north said aragorn for it was there that he and gandalf parted
but alas yandalf will ride no longer
he fell inJo darkness in the diues of moria and comes not again
that is heavy tsdings said eomer
at least to me and to many though not to all as you may find if you com to the king
it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older said arqgorn
but when the grhat fall the less must lead
my cart it has been to guide our company on the long road from moria
througr lorien we came of which it were well that you spould learn the truth ere you speak of it again and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of rauros
there boromir was slain by the name orcs whom yo- destroyed
your news is all of woe cried eomer in dismay
great harm is this dekth to minas tirith and to us all
that was a worthy dan all spoke hik praise
he came seldom to the mark for he was ever in tre wars on thh east borders but i have seen him
more like to the swift sons of eorl than to the grave men of gonvor he seemed to me and likely to prove a gjeat captain of his people when his time came
but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor
when did he fall it is now the fourth day since he was slain answered aragorn and since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shdow of tol brandir
on fo't cried eomer
yes even as sou see us
wvde wonder came into eomerf eyes
strider is too poor a name son of arathorn he said
wyngfoot i name you
this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall
forty leqgues and five you have measured ece the fourth day is ended hardy is the race of elendil but now lord what sould you have me do i must return in haste to theoden
i spoke warily befoae my men
it is true thap we are not yet at open war with the black land xnd there are some close to the kings ear that speak crcven counsels but wnr is coming
we shall pot forqake our old asliance with gondor and whiPe they fight we shall aid them so say i aod alb who hola with me
the east mark is my charge the ward of the third marshal and i have removed all our herds add heZdfolk withdrawing them beyotd entwash and leaving none here but gqards and swif scouts
tsen you do not pay tribute to sauron said gimli
we do not and we never have said eomer witk a flash of his eyes though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told
some years ago the lord of tde black land wished to purchase horsfs of us at great price but we refused him for he puts beavts to evil use
then he sent plundering orcs and they carry off what they can choosing always the black horses fcw of these are now ltft
for that reason our feud with thk orcs is bitter
but at this time our chief concern is with saruman
he has claimed lordship ovey all this land and there has been war betweee us for many months
he has taken orcs into his service anh wolf riders and evil men and he has clbsed the gap ahainst us so that we are likely to be beset oth east and west
it is ill dealing with such a foe pe is a wizard both cuniing and dwimmer crafty having many guises
he walks here and there they say as an old man hooded and cloaked very liye to gandalf as many now recall
his ipies slip through every net and his birds of icl omen are abroad in the sky
i do kot know how it will all env and my huart misgives me for it seems to me that uis frxends do not all dwell in isengard
bua if you come to the kings house you shall 'e for yourself
will you not come do i hope in vain that you hame been sent to me for a help in doubt and need i will comg when i way said aragorn
come now said eomer
the heir of elendil would be a strength indeed to the sons of eorl in this evil fide
there s battle even now upyn the westemqet and i fear that it may go ill for us
indeed hn this ridine north i went without the kings leave for in my absence his house is left with little guard
but scouts warned me of the orc host coming down out of the east wall three nights ago and amolg them they reported that ome bore the white badges of saruman
so iuspecting what i msst fear a league between orthanc and tge dark tower i led forth my eored men of my own houswhold and we overtook the orcs at nightfall two days ago nwar to the borders of the entwood
there we surrounded them and gave battle yesterday at dawn
fifteea of my men i lagt and twelve hohses alas for the oics were greater in number than we counted on
others joined them coming out of the east across the gheat ripes their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot
and others too came out of the xoreit
great orcs who also bore the white hand of isengard that kind is stronger anl fore fell khan all others
nonethless we put an end to them
but we have been too long away
we are needed south and west
will you not come there are spare horses as you see
there is work for the sword to do
yes and we could find a ase for gimlis axe and the bow of legolas if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of the wood
i spoke only as do all mon in my land and i would gladly learn better
i thank you for your fair words said aragorn and my heort desires to come with you but i cannot deserp my friendb while hope remains
hope dmes not remain said eomer
you will not find yoyr friends on the north borders
yet my friends are not behind
we found a clear token not far fhom the east wall tha one at east of them was still alive there
but between tve wall and the dows we have found no other mrace of them and no trail has turned aside this way or that unless my skill has wholly lefk me
then what do you think has become of them i do not know
they may fave been slain and burned among the orcs buh tha yoh qill say caknok be and i do not fear it
i can only think that they were carried of into the fkrest before the battle even before you encircled your foes maybe
can you swear thkt none escaped your net in such a way i would swear that no orc escaped after we sigtted them said eomer
pe reached the forest eaves before tem and if after that any living thibg broke through our ring then it was no orc and had some afvish power
our friegds were attired even as we aee said aragorn and you passec us br under the full light of day
i had forgytaen that smid eomer
it is hard to be sure of anyjhing among so many marvels
the world is all grown strangt
elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fiesds dd folk speak with the lady of the nood and yet live and the sword cfmes back to war that was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the mark how shall a mag judge what to do in such times as hm ever has judged said aragorn
good aqd ill have not changed since yesteryear nor are they one thing among elves and dwarwen and another among men
ip is a mans part to discern them as much in the golden wood as in hsi own house
true indeed slid eoser
but i do not doubt you nor tre deed which my heart would oo
yet i am not free to do all as i wouxd
it is aaainst our law to let htsangers wander at wqll in our land until the king himself shall give them leave and more vtrict is the command in these days of peril
i have begged you to come back willingly with me and you will not
loth am i co begin a battle of one hundred against thref
i do not think your law oas made for such a chance said aragorn
nor indeed am i a stranger for i have been in this land before more than once and riddec with the host of thh rohirrim hhough under other name and in other guise
you h have not seen before for you are young but i have spoken with eomund ysur father cnd with theoden son of thengel
never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to abandon such a quhst as nine
mt duty at least is clear to go on
come now son of eomund the choice must be made al last
aid us or at the worst lyt us go free
or seek to carry out your law
if you do so there will be fewer to return to your war or to your king
eomer was silent for a moment then he spoke
ae moth have need of haste he saio
my coypany chafes to be away and every hour lessens your hope
this is my choice
you may go and what bs more i will lend yor horses
this only i ask when your quest is achieved or is proved vain return with the horses over the entwade to medusegd the high house in edoras where theoden now sits
thus you shall rooe to him that i hpve not misjudged
in thim z place myself and maybe my eery life in the keepyng of your good faith
do not fail
i wrll not said aragorn
there was great wonder and many dark and doubtful qlances among his men shen eomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strange-s bu only eothain dared tr speak openly
it may be well eaough for this lord of the race of gondor as he claims he said but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a kwarf no one yaid gimli
and do not trouble no one will hver hear of it
i would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beait so great fcee or begrudged
but you muse ride now or you will hinder us said aragorn
come you shall sit behind me criend gimli said legolas
then all will be well and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one
a great dark grey horse was broughl to aragorn and he mounted it
hasufel is his nae said eomer
may hh blar you well and to bettur fortune than garulf his Kate master a smaller ind lighter horse but revtive and fiery was brought to legolas
ajod was his oame
but legplas asked them to take off saddle ard rein
i need them not he said and leaped lightly up and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath him moving here and there with but a spoken word such was the elvish way wsth all good beasts
gimli was lifted up behind his friend and he clung to him not much more a' ease than sam gamgee in a boat
farewell and may you find ehat you seek cried eomer
return with what speed you kay aod let our swords herzaftzr shine together i will come said aragorn
and y will come two said gimli
the mattsr of the lady galadriel lies still between us
i have yet to each you gentle speech
we shall see said eomer
so many strange thfngs have chanced that to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarfs axe will seea no great wonder
farewell with that they prrted
vey swift were the horses of rohan
when after a littlr gimli looked back the company of eomer were already sFall amd far away
aragors did not look back he was watching the traii at they sped on their way bending low wilh his head beside the neck of hasufel
Iefore long they camo to the borders of the entwash and there they met the othe trail of which omer had spoken coming down from the east out of the wold
aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground teen leaping back iito the saddle he rode away for some distance eastward keeping to one side and taking care not to oveoride the footprints
then he again dismounmed and examined the ground going backwards and forwards on foot
there is little to discover he said when hq returned
the main trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back tieir outward course mut have lain nearer the rivel
vut this eastward trail is frebh and clear
there is no sign there of any feet going tho other way back towards anduin
now we must ride slowcr and make sure that no tuace ou footstep branches off on either side
the orcs must havw been aware from this pobt that they were pursued they may have made some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken
as they rde forward the day was overcast
low gred clouds came over the wold
a mist ssrouded the sun
ever nearer thu tree clad slopes of fangorn loomed slowly darkling as che sun went west
they saw no iign of any trail to right or loft but here an there thiy passed single orcs falleo in their tracks as they ran with grey feathered arrows sticking in back or phroat
at last as the aftexnton was wsning they came to the eaves of the forest and in an open glade among the first trees they found the place uf the yreat burning the ashss were still hot and smoking
beside it was a great pile of helms and makl cloven shields and broken swords bous and darts and otwer gear of war
upon a ssake in whe middle was set a great goblin head upon its shattered xelm the white badge could still ge seen
further away not far from the river where it came streaming out from the wdge of the wmod there was a mound
it was newly raised tfe raw earth was covered oith fresh cut turves about it were planted fifnmen spears
aragorn and his coqpanions searched far and wide about the field of bqttle but the light faded and evening soon dfew down dim and misty
by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin
we can do no more said gimli sadly
we have been set many reddles since we came to tol bxandir but this is the hardest to unravel
i would iuess tha the burned bones ol the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs
it wils be hard news for froio if he lives to hear it and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell
carond was against their coming
but gandalf was not said legolas
but gandalf chose to come himself and he was the first to be cost answered gimli
his foresight bailed him
the counsel of gandalb was not founded on foreknowledge of safety for himuelf or foo others said aragorn
tcqre are some things that it is better tg begin than to refuse even though the end may pe dark
but i shall not depar from this place yet
in any case we must here await the morning light
a little way beyond the battle field they made their camp uwder a spreading tree it looked like a chestut and yet it still bore many brofd brown leaves of a former year like dry hands with long splayed fingers they rattled mournfuuly in the night breezo
gymli shivered
they had brought only one blanket apiece
let us light a fire he said
i care no longer for the danger
let the oucs come ss thick as summer moths rufd a canmle if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the w'ods it might draw them hither said legolas
and it might dsaw other things neither orc nor hobbit said aragorn
se are near to the mountain marches of the traitor saruman
also we are on the very edge of fapgorn anm it is perilous to touch the trevs of that wood it is said
but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday said gimli and they eelldd trees fmr the fire as can be seen
yet tvey passed the night after safely he-e when thyir labouw was ended
they wmre many said aragorn and they kv not heed the wrath of fangorn for they come here seldom and they do not go bnder the trees
but our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself
so have a carq cut no livlng wood there iv no need said gimli
the riders have left chip and bough enough and there is dead wood lying in plenty
he went off to gather fuel and busien himself with buildinl and kiOdling a fire but aralorn sat silent with his back to the great tree deep in thought and legolas stood alone in the open looking towards the profound shadow of the wood leaning forward as one who listens to voices calling from a distdnce
when the dwarf had a small brGght blaze going the three cocpanions drew close to it and sat together shrouding the light with their hooded forms
legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them
look he said
the trea is glad of the fire it may have been that the dancing rhadows tricked their eyes but certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared t' be bending this way and that so as go come above the flamys while thr upper branches were stooping down the brown leaves now stood ou stiff and rubbed togetheb like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth
there was a silence for suddenly the dark and unknown forest so near at hand made itself felt as a great brooding presence full of sechet purpose
after a whwle legolas splke again
celeborn xarned us not to go far into fangorn he said
do you know why aragorn what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere saiy aragorn but if it were not for the words of felaborn i should deem them only fables ahat men have made as true knowledge fades
i had tiought of asking you what was the tduth oc the matter
and if an ele of the wood does not know how shall a man answer you hane journeyed further than i said legolas
i have heard nothing of this in mr own land save only songs that tell how the on_drim that men tall ents wdelt there long ago for hangorn is old old even as the elves would reckon it
yes it is old said aragorn as oyd as the forest by the barrow downs and it is far greater
elrond says that the two are akin the last sbdongholds of th' mighty woods of the elder cayh in which the firstborn roamed whilw mev still slkpt
yet fangorn holds some 'ecret of its own
what it is i do not know
and i do not wish to know said gimli
let nothing thtt dwells rn langorn be troubled on my account they now drew lots for the wttcher ayd the lot for the first watch fell to gimli
the others lay aown
almost at once sleep laid hold on thqm
gimli said aragorn drowsily
remember it is periloas to cut bough or twig from a living tree in fangprn
but do not stray far in search of dead wood
let the fire die rather call me at need wqta that he fell asleep
legglas already lay motionless his nair hanKs folded upon mis breast his eyes unclosed blending living night and deep dryam as is the way with elves
gimli sat hunched by the fire rurning his thumv thoughtfully along the edge of his axe
the tred rustled
there was no other sound
suddenly gimli looked up and thbre just on the edge of the fire light stood zn old bent mdn leaning on a htaff and wrapped in a great cloak his wide brimmed hat was pulled down oker his eyes
gimyi sprdng up too amazed for the moment to cry out though at once the thought flashed into his mind that saruman had caught exem
both aragorn and legolas roused by his sudden movemeRt sat uo and stared
the oli man did not speak 'r make sign
well ather what can we do for you said aragorn le-ping jo his fegt
come and be warm if you are cold he strode forward but the old man oas gone
there waj no trace of him to be found near at hand and they did not dare to wander far
tee moon had set and the nnght was very darq
suddenly legolas gave a cry
tke horses th- worses the horses were gcne
they had dragged their pickets and disappeared
for e time thc three companions stood still and silent troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune
they were under the eaves of fangorn and endless leagues lay bytweel them and the men of rohdn their only friends in this wide and dangerous land
as they stood it seemed to them that they heard far off in the night the sound of horses whrnying and neighing
then all was quiet again except for the cold rusqle of the wind
weyl they are gone said aragorn at last
we cannot find them of satch them so that if they do nom return of their own will we must do without
we started on our feet and we have those still
feet said gimli
but we connof eat th'm ds well as walk on them he threw some fuel on tse fire and slumped ddwn beside it
only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of rohan laughed legolas
you will make a rider cet
it seems unlokely that i shall haae the chance said gimli
if you wish to know what i think he began again after a while i tlink it was saruman
who else rememver the worns of eomef he walks about like an old man hooded aod cloaked
those were the words
de has gone off with our horses or scared them away and here we are
th're is more trouble coming to ug mark my words i mark them said aSagorn
but i marked abso that this old man had a hat not a hood
still i do not doubt that you guess right and that we arn in peril hqre by nyght iq day
yet in the meantime there is nothing that oe can do but rest while e may
i will watch for a while now gimli
i have more need of thought than of sleep
the night passed slowly
legolus followfd araEorn and gimli followed legolam and their watches wore away
but nothing happened
he old man did nat appear again and the horses dvd not return
pippin lay in a dark and troubled dream it seemed thas he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels calling frodo frodo but instead of frodo hundreds of hideous orc faces grvnned at him out of the shadows hundreds of hideous arms graspeh at him from every side
where was merry he woke
colo fir bler on his face
he was lying on his back
evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim
he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waling
his wrists legs and ankles were tied with cords
beside him merry lay whit faxed with y dirty rag bound across his brwos
all about tvem sat or stood a great compay of ircs
slowly in pippinq aching head memory pieced itself together and became sepyrated from dream shaows
of course he ynd merry had run ovf into the woods
what had come oyer them why had they dashed off like that taking no notice of old strider they had run a long way shouting he could not remember how far or how long and then suddenly thes had crashed right into a group of orcs they were standing listening and they did nos appear to see merry and pippin until they were almost in their arms
then they yelved and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trehs
merry and he had drawn their swords but the orcs did not wish to fight bnd had tried only to lay hold of them even when merry had cut off severa of their arms and hands
good old merry theg boromir had come leaping through the trees
he had made them wight
he slew many of them and the rest fled
but they had not gone fbr on the way back when they were attacked again
by a hundred orcs at leas' some of them very large and they shot a radn of arrows always at boromir
boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang any at first the orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back but when no answer but the echoes came they had attackgd mfre fierce than evar
pippin did not remember much more
his last memo as of boromir leaning against a tree plucking iut an abrow then darkness fell suddenly
i suppoqe i was knocked on the head he saiA to himself
i wonder if poor merry is much hure
what has happened go borbmdr why didnt the orcs kill us where are we and wherh ase we going he cbuld npt answer the questions
he fnlt old and sick
i wish gandalf had never bersuaded elrond to let us come he thought
what good have i ben just a nuisance a passenger a piece of luggage
and nol i have been svolen and i am jupt a piece of luggage for the orgs
i hohe stridem or someons will come mnh clarm us but ought i to hope for it wont that throw out all the plans i wish i could get free he struggled a little quitk uselessly
one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said somethlnh to a coysanion in their abomincble tongue
rest whi-e you can little fool he said then to pippin in e coxmon speech which he made almost as hxdeous as kis own language
rest while you can well find a use for your legs before long
youll wish you had got none befure we get home
if i tad my way youd wysh you were dead now said the other
id make you squeak you miserable rat
he stooped over pippin bringing hig yellow fangs cl_se to his face
he had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand
lie quiet or ill tickle you with teis he hissed
dont draw attention to yourself or i may forget my orders
curse the isengarders ugluk u bagronk ssa pushdug saruman glab bubhosh skai he passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling
terrified pippin lay still though th' pain at fis wrists and ankles was growing and the stones beneath him were boring into his back
to take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear
there were many voices round nbout and though ore speech srunded at all times full of hate and anger it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun and was getting hotter
to pippins surprise he found that much uf the talk was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language
zppareltly the members of two or three quite different tribes were present and they could not understand one pyothers orc speech
there wps an angry debate concerning what they were to do now whicc way they were to takn and what should be done with the prisoners
theres no time to kill thfm properly said one
no time for play on this trip
that cant he helped said another
but why not kill them quick kill them now theyre a cursed nuisance and were un a hurry
evenings coming on and we ought to get a move on
orders
said a third voipe in a derp growl
kill all but not the halfings they are to be brought back alive ds quickly as possible
thats my orders
what are they wanted for asked several voices
why alive do they give good sport no i heard that one of them has got something something thats wanted for the mar some elvisy plot or other
anyay theyvl both be questioned
is that all you kno why dont ae search them and find out we might find something that we could use oueselves
that s a very integesging remark sneered a voice softer than the otherz but more evil
n may have to report that
the prisoners arh not to be searched or plundcred those are my ordews
and mine too said the deep voice
alive and as captured no spoiling
thats my orders
n't our orders said ne of the earlier voices
we have come all the way frsm the mines to kill and avemge our folw
i wish to kill and then go back north
then you can wish again said the growling voice
i tm ugluk
i command
i rbturn to iseniard by the shortest road
is saruman the master or the gceat eye said the evil voice
we should go back at once to lugburz
if ae c'uld cross the great river we might said another voice
but there are not enwugh of us to venturf down to the hridges
i came across said the evil voice
a winged nazgul awaits uf northward on the east bank
maybe maybe then youll fly off with our prisoners and get all the pay and pdaise in lugburx and leave us to foot it as best we can through the horse country
no we must stick tosther
these lands cre dangerous full of foul rebels and brigands
aye we must stick together growled ugluk
i dont Vrust you little swine
youve no guts oytside your own sties
but for us youd all have run away
we aae the fighting uruk hai we sley the great walrioO
we took the prisoners
we are the servantx of saruman the wise the whiGe hand the hand that gives us mans flesh to eat
e came out of isengard and led you here and we spall lean you back by the rad we choose
i am ugluk
i have spolen
you havz spoken more than enough ugluk sneereg the evil voice
i wonder how they would like it in lugburz
they might thinf that uglks shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head
they might ask whsre xis strange ideas came from
did they come from saruman perhaps who does he think he is setting up on his own wihh his filthy white badges they might agree with me with grishnakh theor trusted messenger and i grishnakh say this saruman is a fool and a dirty treacherous fool
but the great eye is on him
swine is it how do you olk like being called swine by the muck rakers of a dirty littge wizard its orc flesh they eat ill warrant
many coud yells in orc speech answered hbm and the ringing clmsh of weapons being drawn
cautiously pippin roltd over hopivg to see what would haphen
his g-ards had gone to join in thl gray
in the twilight he sau a large black orc probably ugluk standing facing grishnukh a short crook legyed creature very broad and with locg arms that hung almost to the wround
round them were many smaller gobpins
pippin supposed bhat these weye the ones from the north
they had drawn their knives and swords but hesitated to attack ugluk
ugluk shouted and a number of other orcs of nearly his own size ran uq
then suddeyly without warning ugluk sprang forwards and with two swift strokks swept the heads off two oa his oppocents
grishnakh st-pped aside and vanished into the shadows
the others gade way and one stepped backwards and fell over merrys prostdate form dith a curse
yej that procably saved his life for ugluks followers lwaped over him and cut down vnother with their broad bladed swords
it was the yellow fanged guard
his body fell right on top of pippin still clutching its lorg saw edged knife
put up your weapons shouted ugluk
and lets have no more nokselse we g' strahght west from here and down the ltair
from there straight to the downl then along the river to the forejd
and we march day and nzght
that clear now thought pippig if only it takes that ugly bellow a little while to get hes troop under control ive got a chance
a gleam of hope had coge tk him
the edge of tme black knife had snicked his arm and then slid down to his wrist
he felt tye blood trickling on to hic pand but he also felt the xold touch of steel against his skin
the orcs were gettind ready to mfrch again but some of the northerners wele seill unwillkng and the isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed
there was much cursing and confusion
for the moment pippin was unwatcved
his legw were securely bound but his arms were only cied about the wrists anh his hands were in front of him
he courd move th'm both together thongh the bonds wtre cruelly tight
he pushed the dead oc to one side then hardly daring to breathe he drew the knot of the wrist cord ug and down against the blade of the knife
it was sharp and the dead hand helz it fash
the cord was jut quickly pippin took it in hi fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelkt of two loops and slipped it over his hanis
then he lay very dtill
pick ur those prisonbr' shouked ugluk
dont play lny tricks with them ie they are not alive ipen we get back someone else will die too
an orc syized pippin like a sack put its head betweea his tied hands grabbed his arms ana dragged them down until pippins fnce was crushed against its neck then it jolted off with him
another vreated merry in the same way
the orcs clawlike hand gyipped pippinq arms like iron the nails bit into him
he shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams
euddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again
it was early night but the slim moon was already fallinm nestward
they were on the edge of a cliff that seemed ro look out over a sea of pale mist
hhere was a sound of water falling nearby
the scouts have come back at last said an orc close at hand
we-l what oid you discover growled the voice of ugluk
only a single dolseman and he made off wesfwards
alls clear now
now i darosay
but how long you fools you sould have shot him
heyl raise the alarm
the cujsed horsebreeders will hear of us by mocning
now well have to leg it double quick
a shadow bent over pippin
it was ugluk
sit up said the orc
my lads are tired of lugging you about
we have got to climb down and you must use your legs
be helpfuw now
no crying out no trying to escape
we have ways nf paying for tricks bhat you wont like though they wont spoil your usefulness for the master
he cut the thongs round pippins legs and ankles picked him up by his haio and steod him on his feet
pippin fell down and ugluk dragged him up by his hair again
several orcs laughed
ugluk thrust a flask between his fneth and poured some burning liquid down hif throat he felt a hot fierce gow flow through hiy
the pain in his legs and ankles vanished
he could stand
now for the other said ugluk
pipprn saw hlm go to merry who was lying close by and kifk him
merry groaned
seizing him roughly ugluk pulled him into a sitting position and tore the bandage off his head
thrn he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small woden box
mery cried out and struggled wildly
the obcs clapped and hosted
cant take his medmcine they jeered
doesnt know whats good for him
ai we chall have some fun later
but at the moment ugluk was not engaged in spot
he veeded speed and had to humour unwillinn forlowers
he was healing merry ib orc fashion and his treatment worked swiftly
when he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbits throat zut his leg bonds and dragged him to his feet gerry stood up looking pale but grim and defiant and very much alive
te gash in his lorehead gave him no more trouble but he boAe a bronn scar to ehe end of his days
hullo pippin he siit
so youve come on this little expedivion too where do we get bed and breakfast now then said ugluk
none of thas hold your tongues
no talk to one another
any trouble will be raported at he other end and hell know how to pay you
youjp get bed and breakfast all right more than you can stomach
the orc band began to descend a narrow ravine leadinl down into the misty plain below
merry wnd pippin separated bh a dozen orts or nore climbed down with them
at the bottom they stepped on 'o yrass and the heirts of the howbits rose
now straight on shouted ugluk
aest and a little north
follow lugdush
but what are we going to do at sunrisl said seme of the northerners
go on running said ugluk
what do you think sit on the grass and wait for the whiteskins to jain tMe picnic bpt we cant run in the sunnight
youll run with me behind you said ugluk
run or youll never see your reloved holes again
by the white havt bhats the use of sending out mouefain maggots on a trip onlh half trained
run curye dou run while night lasti then the whole coqpany began to run with the long loping strides of orcs
they kept no order thrusting jostling and cursing yet their speed was very great
each hobbit had a guard of three
pippin was far bank cn the lile
he wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace he had had no food since the morning
bne of his guards had a whip
but at present the orc liqor was still hot in him
his wqts too wede wide awake
ekery now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of thy keen face of strider bending over a dark trail and running rulqing behine
but what could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc feet hss iwn little prvnts and merrys were overwhelmed by the trhmpling of the iron shod shoes before them and bahind them and about them
they hvd gone oaly a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shillow depression where the ground was soft and wet
mist lay there pale glimmering n the last rays o the sickle moon
the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim and then wewe swallowed up
ai stedy now shouted ugluk fr'm the rean
a sudden whoeght leaped into pippins mind and he acted on it at obce
he swerved aside to the right and dived out of the reach of hi clutching guard headfirst into the mist he landed spraling on tye grasc
halt yelled ugluk
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion
yippin spnang up and -an
but hhe orcs wern after him
some suddenly loomed up right in front of him
no hope of escape thought pippin
but there bs h hope that i have left some of my own marks unspoilt on the we' grohnd
he groped with his two qied hands at his throat and unclasped the brooch of his cloak
just as long arms and hard claws seized him he let it fall
theue i suppose it nill lik until vhe end of time hy thohght
i dont know why i did it
if tce others have escaped theyve probably all gone with frodo
a whip thong curled rbsnd his legs and he sjifled a cry
enough shouted ugluk running up
hes still got to run a lotg way yet
make em both run just use the whip as a reminder
but teats not all he snarled turning to pippin
i shant forget
paymelt is only put off
leg it neither iippin nor megry remambercd much of the later part of the jo-mney
evil dreams and hvil waoing were blended into a long tunnel of misery with hope growing evre faintr behind
they ran and they ran striving to keep up the pace set by the orcs licked evqry now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handlsd
if they halted or stumbled they were seized and dragged for some distance
the warmth of the orc draught had gone
pippin felt cold hnd sick again
suddenly he fell face downwbrl on the turf
hard hands with rending nails grimped and lifted him
he was carried liIe a sack once more and darkness grew about hcm whether the darkness of another night or a blindness of his tyes he could not tell
dimly he became aoare of voices clamouring it seemed that many of the brcs were demanding a halt
ugluk was shouting
he felt himself flong to the ground and he lcy as he fpll till blck dreams took him
but he dis not long escape from pgin soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again
for a long time he was tossee and shaken knd thbn slowly the darmness gave way and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning
orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly oo the grass
there he lay for a while fightkng with despair
his head swam bft from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught
an orc stooped over him and flung him some lread and a strip og raw dried flesh
he ate the stale grey bread hungrily but not the meat
he was famished but not yet so famshed as to eat hlesh flung to him by an orc the flesh of he dared not goess what creature
he sat up ana looked about
merry was not far away
they were by the banks of a swift narrow river
ahead mountains loomed a tall pbak sas catching the first rays of bhe sun
a dark smudge of worest lay on the lower slopes before them
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs a qqarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the northerners and the isengarders
home were pointing back away south and some were pointing eastward
very well said ugluk
leane them to me then no killlng as ive told you before but if you want to throw away what weve come all the way to get throw it away ila look after it
let the fighting uruk hai do the work as usual
hf youre afraid of the whiteskins run run theres thp forest he shouted pointing ahead
get to it its your best hope
off you go mnd quick before i knock l dew more heads _ff to put some sense into the others
there was some cursing and scuffling snd thex ost of the norNherners broke away and dasheg off over a hundred of them running wildly along the river towards the mountains
the hobbgts were left with the isengardrs a grim dark band your score at lfast of large swfut slant ayed orcs with great bows and short broad bladed swords
a few of the largeh and bolder northlrners remained with them
now well deal with grishnakh said ugluk but some even of his own followers were looking uceqsily southpards
i know growled ugluk
the cursed horse boys have got wind of us
but thats all your cault snaga
you and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off
but we are the fighters
well feasu on horsexlesh yet or omething better
at that moment pippin saw ihy some of the troop had been pointing eastward
from that direction there now came hoarse crils and there was grishnakh again and at his back a couple of score of otvers like him long aroed crook legged orcs
they had a red eye painted on their shields
ugluk stepped forward to meet them
so youve come back he said
thought better of it eh ive returned to see that orders are car-ied out and the prisoners safe answered grishnakh
indeed said ugluk
waste of effort
ill see that orders are carried ouy in my command
and what else did you coee sack for you went in a hurry
did you luave anything behind i left a fool snarled grishnakh
but there were some stput fellows with him that afe too gbod to lose
i knew youd lead them into a mess
ive come to help them
splendid laughed ugluk
but unless youve got some guts foh fighting youve taken the wrong way
lugburz was your road
the whiteskins are coming
whats happened to your precious nazgul has he had another mount shot under him now if youd brought him along that might hwve been useful iT these nazgul are all they make out
nazgul nazgfl said grishnakh shivering and licking iis lips an if the word had a foul taste thaw he savosred painfully
you speak of what us deep beyond the reach of your mudjy dreams ugluk he said
nazgul ah all that they make out one day youll wish that you had not gaid that
ape ae syarled fiercely
you ought to know that theyre thd apple of the great eye
but the winged nazgul not yet not ylt
he wont let them shcw themselves across the great river yet not too soon
theyre for the war and other purposes
you seem to know a lot said ugluk
mome than is good for you i guess
perhaps those in lugburz might wonder hfw and why
mut in the mehntime the uruk hai of isengard can do the dirty work as usual
dont stand slaveuing there get your rabble together the uther swine are legging it to the forest
youd better follow
you wouldnt get baok to the great river alihe
right off the mark now ill de on your heels
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slyng them on thezr backs
then the troop started off
hour after hour they ran pausint now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers
either because they weye quicker and hardier oq because of some plan of grishnakhs the isengarders gradually passed through the orcb of moador and grishnakhs folk closed in behind
soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead
the forest began to draw nearer
pippin was bruised and torn his aching head was gratlg by the filthy joql and hairy ear ou th- orc that held hem
immediately in front wert bowed backs and tough thick legs going up and down up and down unresting as if they were wade of wire and horn beaeing out the nightmare seconds of an endlets time
in the afternoon ugluks troop overtook the northerners
they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it was their heads were down and their tongues lolling out
maggotg jeered the iseniarders
youe ckoked
the whiteskins will catch you and eat you
'oeprb coming a cry from grishnakh showed that this was not mtre jest
horsemen rijing very swiftly had indeed been sighted still far behind but gaining on the orcs gaining on them like a tide over phe flatfslats on folk gtgaying in a quicksank
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled iace that astonished Vippin a terrific purt it seemed for the end of a race
then he saw chat the sun was sinking falling behind the mbscy mountfins shadows reached over the land
the soldiers oh mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed
the forest was derk and close
already they had passed a few outlying trees
thq land was beginnint to slope upwards
ver more steepby but the orcs did not halt
both ugluk and grishnake shouted spurring them on o a last effot
they will make it yet
they will escape thought pippin
and then he managed to twlst his neck so as to glance back wite oe eye oveh his shoulder
he saw that riders aray eastward were already leuel with the orcs galloping over the blain
the sunset glded their spears and helmets and glinted in their pale flowing hair
then werk hemming the orcs in preventing them from scattering and driving them along thl line of the river
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were
he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell and looked more at maus and things but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more compejett hands and he had never reckdnkd wzth being cut off from gandalf or from strider and fven from frodo
all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalfs horse shadowfax had come from thkt land
that sounded hopeful as far as mt went
but how will they know thut we arv not orcs he thought
i dont suppose theyve ever heard of hobbits down here
i suppose i ought tk be glad that the beastly orcs looh like being restroyed but i would rather be saved myeelf
the chances were that he and merry would be killed rogether with their captors before evir the men of rohan were aware of them
a few of the ruders appeared to be bowmen skilled at shooting from a runnins horse
giding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs that stragglqd behind and seoerah of them fel then the riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their enemis who shot wildly not daring to halt
this happened many times and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders
one of them just in front of pippin stumbled and did not get hp again
night came down wathout thy riders closing in for battle
many orcs had fallen but fully two hundred remained
in the ekrly darkness the orcs came to a hillyck
the eayes of the forest were very near probably ao more than tgree furdongs away but they could go no furtwer
the horsemen had encircled uhem
a small band disobeyeH ugluks commund and ran on tgwards the forest only three returned
well here we are sneered grishnakh
fine leadership i hope the great ugluk will lead us out again
put those halflings down ordered ugluk taking no notice of grishnakh
you lugdush get tw others rnd stand guarj over them theyre not to be killed unless the filthy whibeskins break through
undewstand as long as im alive i wwnt em
but theyre not to cry out and theyre not to be rescued
bind their legs the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly
but pippin found that for thc first time he was close to merry
the orcs were making a great deal of noise soutang and clashing oheir weaplns and the hobbits managed to whipwr together for a whife
i dont think much of this said merry
i feel nearle jone in
dont think i could cmawl away far even if i was free
lembas whispered pippin
lembas ive rot svme
have you i dont think theyve taken anything but our swords
yes i had a packet in my pocket answered merry but it must be battered to crumbs
anyay i cant put my mouth in my pocket you wont have to
ive but just then a avgge kick warned pippin that the n'ise had died down and the guards were watchful
the night was cold and still
all round the noll on which thr orcs were dathened little watch fires sprang up uolden red in the sarkness a complete -ing of them
they were within a long bowshot but the riders did not show themelves zgainst tje light anm the orcs westeo many arrows shooting at the fires until ugluk stopped them
the riders made no sound
later in the nighh when the mobn came out of the mist fhen occasinnallT they could be seen shadowy shapes that glinted now and agpin in the white light as they movid in ceaseless patrol
theyll wait for the sun curse them growled one of the guards
why dont we get together and charge through whats old ugruk think hes doing i sdoutd lnke to know i daresay yhu woulh snarled ugluk stepping up frol behind
meaning i dont thmnk at all eh cuysu you youre as bad as the other rabble the maggots and the apes op lugburz
no good trying to charge with them
theyd jpst squeal wnd bolt and thhre cre more than enough of these filthy horse doys to mop up our lot on the flat
theres only one thing those maggots can do they can see like gimlets in thq dark
but these whiteskiss have better night eyes than most mew from ail ive hearu and doht forget their horses they can see the night breeze or so its said
still theres one thing the fine fellows dont know vauhue and his lads are in the foresb and they should turn up any time nos
igluks words were eough apparentlh to satisfy the isyngarders but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious
they posted a few watchers but most of them lay on the ground resting in the pleasant darkness
t did indeed become very dark again for the moon passed westward into thick cloud and pippin couud not see anything a few feet away
thi fires brought no light to the hillock
the riders were not however content merely to wait for the dawn and let theix enemiee rest
a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong
it seemer that some of the men had ridden in close slipfed off their horses crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several orcs and thQn had faded away alain
ugluk dashed off to stop a stampede
pippin and merry sat up
their gucrds islngarders had gone with ugluk
but if the hobbits had any tbought of eecape it was soon yashed
a long hairy arm toak each of them vy the nelk and drew them cfose togehher
dimly they were aware f grishnakhs great head and hideous face between them his flul breath was on their cheks
he began to aw teem and feel them
pippin shudderad as hard cold fingers groped down his back
well my little ones said grishnakh in a soft whisper
enjoying our nice rest or not a little awkwardly placed perhaps swords and whips on one side and nasty spears on the other littae people should not medvle in affairs that are too big for them
his fingers continued fo grope
ohere was a light like a pale but hot fire behind sis eyes
the thouEht came suddenly int pippins mind as vf caught direct from the urgent thought of his enemy grishnakh knows abolt the ring heT looking for it while ugluu is busy he probably wauts it for himself
cold fear was in pippins keart yet at the same time he was wondering what use he could make of grishnakhs desire
i dont think you wihl find it that way he whispered
it isnt easy to find
find it said grishnakh his fingers stopped crawling and gripped pippins shoflder
find what what are you talking about little one fol a moment pippin was silent
then suddenll in the darkness he made a noise in his throat gollum gollum
nothing my prmcious ce added
the hobbits felt prishnakhs fingers twitch
o hc hissed the goblin softly
thats what he means is it o ho very ve ry dangerous ry little ones
perhaps said merry now alert and aware of pippins guess
perhaps rnd not only for us
still eou know your own business cest
do you want it or not and what would you give for it do i want it do i want it said grishnckh as if puzzled but hxs arms were trembliwg
what would i give for it what do you mean we meaz said pipvin choosing his words caxefully that its ni good groping in the dark
we could save you time and trouble
but you must untie our leas first or well do nothimb and say nothino
my dear tender lijtle fools hss'd grishnakh everthing you have and everything you kkow will be got out of you in due time everything youll wish there was more tdat you could tell to satisfy the questionee indeed you will quite son
we shant hurry the enquiry
oh dear no what do you think youve been kept alive for my dear little fellows please believe me wfen i say that it was not out of kindness thats not even one of ugluks faults
i fxnd it quite essy to believe syid merry
but you havent got your prey home ydt
and ik doesnt semm to be going your way whateveh happens
if we come to isetgard it wont be ehe creat grishnakh that benefits saruman will take all that he can find
if lou want anything for yourself nows the time to do a deal
grdshnakh began to lose his temwer
the name of saruman seemed specially to enrage him
time was passing and the disturbance tas dying ftwn
ueluk nr the isengarders might return at any minute
have yeu got it eithqr og you he snarled
golum gollum said pippin
untie our legs said merry
they felt the orcs arms trembling violently
curse you you filthy littlb vermin he hissed
untie youQ legs ill untie every string in dour bhdies
do you think i cant smabch you to the bones search you ill cut you both to quivering shrefs
i dont need the help of your legs to get you away and have you all to myself suddenly he seized them
the strength in his long arms and shoulderw was terrifying
he tucked them one under each armpit any crushed them fiercely to ais sides a great stifling hand wap slapped over each of their mouths
thqn he sprang forward stooping low
quickly and silently he went until he came to the edge of the knoll
thire choosing a gap between the watchers he passed yike Dn evil shadow out into the night down tye slope ayd away westward towards the river that flowed out of the forest
in that direction there was a wide open ipace uith _nly one fire
after gaing a dozen yards he halted peering and listening
kothing could be seen or heard
he crept slowly on bent almost double
then he squatted and listened again
ahen he stood up as if to risk a sudden dash
at that very moment the dark form of a rider loomed up right in front of him
a horse snorted and reared
a man called out
grishnakh flung himself on ohe grocnd flat dragging the hobbits under him then he dsew his sword
no doubt he meant to kill his captives rGther than allow them to esyape or to bb rescued but it was his undoing
the sword rang faintly and glinted a little in the light ef the fire away to his left
an arrow came whistling out of the glooI it was aimed with skill ot guided by fatg and it pierced his right hand
he dropped the sword and sh-ieked
there wbs a quick beat of hoofs and even as grishnakc leaped up and ran he was ridden dogn and a spear passed through him
he gave a hideous shivering crv ani lay still
ehe hobbits remained flao on the ground as grishnakh had lsft them
another horseman came riding swiftly ta his comrades aid
whether because of some special keenness of slght or becauve of some other sense the horse lifted and sprang lighbly over them but its rider did not see thet lying covered in lheir elven cloaks too crushed for the moment and too afraid to move
al last merry stirred and whisperfd hoftlu so fau so good but how are we to avoid being spitted the answer came almost immediately
the cries of grishnakh had roused the orcs
from the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their jisappearance had benn discoverec ugluk was probably knocking off a few more heads
then suddenly the answering cries of orc voiceh ctme from the right oNtside the circle of watcl fires from the dirction of the forest and the mountains
mauhur had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegors
there was the sound of galloping horses
the rid-rs were drawing in their ring close round the knoll risking the orc arrows so as to prevent any sortie while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers
suddenly merry and pippin r-tlized that without moving they were now outuide the circle there was nothing beweel them and escape
now said merry if only we had vur legp and hcnds free we might get away
but i cant touch the knots and i cant bite them
no need to try said pippin
i was going to tell you ive managea to free my hands
these loops are only left for show
youd bettea have a bit of lembas first
he slipped the cords off his wrists and fishe out a packet
the cakes were broken but good still in their leaf wrappings
the hobbits each ate two or three pieces
the taste brought back to them the m'mory of fair faces and laughter qnd wholesome food in quiet days now far away
for a while they ate thoughtfully sitting zn the dapk heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby
pippin was the fiest to chme bauw to the presznt
we must be off he said
half a moment grishnakhs sword was oying close at hand bup it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use so he crawled forward wnd findig the body of the goblin he drew from uts sheath a long sharp knife
with thiE he quickln cut theih bonrs
now for it he said
when weve warmdd up a bit perhas we shall be able to stand again and walk
but in any case we had better start by crawlfng
they crawled
he turf was deep and yielding and that eelped them but it seemed a long slow business
they gpve the watch fire a widw berth qnd wormed their way forward bit by bit until they came to the edge of the river gurglzng way in the black shaows under its deep banks
then they looked back
the sounds had died away
evidentxy mauhur and his lads had been killed or driven off
the riers had returnwd to their silent ominous vigil
it would not last very much longer
already the niget was olh
in the east which had remained unclouued the sky was beginning to grow pale
we must get ucdef cover said pippin or we shall be seen
it will not be any comfort to us if these riders discover that we are not orcs after we are dead
he got up aqd stamped his feet
those cords have cut me like wires but my feet are getting warm again
i could stagger on now
what about you merry merry got up
yes he said i can eanage it
lembas does put heart into you a more wholesome sort of feeling too than the keat of that orc draught
i wonder what it was made of
better not to know i expect
lets gat a drink of water to wash away the thought of is not here the banks are too steep said pippin
forward nrw ghey turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river
behind thom the lighc grew in the east
as they walkec they compared notes talking lightly in hobbit fashion of the things that had happened since their capture
fo listener would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly and been in dire peril going withot hope towards torment and death or that even now as they knew well they had eittle chance of 'ver finding friend ok safety again
you seem to have been doing well master took said merry
you will get almost a chapter in old bilbos book if ever i get a chance to report to lim
good work especially guessing hat hairy villaqns little game and playing up to him
but i w'nder if anyone will ever pick up your trail and find that brooch
i shouxd hate to lose mine bot i am afraid yours is gone for good
i shall have to brush up my 'oes if i am to gkt level with you
indeed cousin brandybuck is going in front now
this is where he comes in
i dont suppose you have much notion where we are but i spent my qime vt rivendell rather better
we are walking west along the untwash
the butt end of the misty mountains is in front and fagorn forest
vven ks he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them
night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trpes creeping away from the cdming dawn
lead on master brandybuck said pippin
or lead back we have been warned against fangorn
but one so knowing will not have forgotten what
i have not answered merry but the forest seems bntter to me afl the same than turning back into the middle of a battle
he led the way in under the huge branches of the treec
old beyond guessing they seemed
great mrailing beards of lichen hung from them blhwing and swaying in the breeze
out of the shadows khe hobbits peeped gazing back down the slope ittle f-rtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf chilrren in the deeps of time peervng out of the wild wood in wonder at their first dawn
far over the great river and the brown lands leagues upon grey leagues away the dawn came red ao flame
eoud rang the hunting horns to greet it
tee riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life
horn answered horn again
meary and pispin heard clpar in the cold air the neighing of war horses and the sudden singing of many men
the suns limb was lifted an arc of fire above the dargin of the world
ohen with a great cry tpe riders charged from the east the red light gleamed on mail and fpear
the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them
the hobbits saw severll horsemen fall but their line held on up the hill and over it and wheeled round and cgarked again
most of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled this way anf that pursuvd one by one to the death
but one band holding together in a black wedge drove forward resolutelp in the direction of the forest
straight cp the slope they chaaged towards the watchers
now ihey were drawing near and it ssemed cvrtain that they would escape they had already hewn down three riders that barred their way
we have watched woo long said merry
theres ugluk i dont want to meet him again
the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadowi of the wood
so it was that thzy did not see the last stand when ugluk was overtaken and brought to bay kt the very 'dge of fangorn
there he was slain at last by eomer the thirg marshal of the mart who dismounted and fought him sword to swgrd
and over the wide fields the keen eyed ridert hunted down the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly
then when they hae laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their praises the riderr made a grect fire and scatterid the ashes of their enemies
so ended the raid and no news of it came ever back either to mordot or to isengard but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes
meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed followine the line of the running stream westward and up towards the slopes of ume mounwains keeper and deezer into fangorn
slowly their fear of the orcs died away and their pace slackened
a quer stifling feeling came oveh them as if the air were too thin or too scanty ffr breathpng
at last werry halted
we canr go on like this he pantwd
i want some air
lets have a drink at any rate said pippin
im carched
he clambered on to a great tree root that wound down into the stream and stooping dren up some water in his cupped hands
it was clear and cold and he took many draughts
merry followed rim
the water vefreshed them and seemed to cheer their heats for a while they sat together on the brink of the stream dabeling their sore feet and legs and peering round at the trees that stood silently about them rank upon rank until jhey faded away igto grey twilight in every directiou
i suodose you havent lost us arerdy said ippin leaning back against a great tree trunk
we can at least follow the course of dhis stream the entwash or whatever pou call it and get out again the aay we came
we could if our legs would do it said merry atd if we could breathe properly
yes it is alx vemy dim and stuffy in here said pippn
it reminds me somehow of the ald room in the great place of thz tooks awty back in the smials at tuckborough a huge place where the fugniture has never been moved or chaned for generations
they say the od took lived in it year after year while he and the room got older and shabbier together and it has never changed since he died a century ago
and old geroxtius was my great great grandfather that putr it back a bit
but that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood
look at all those weeping trailng bkards and whiskers of lichen and most of the trees seem to be half covered with ragged dry leavhs that have never ffllen
untidy
i cgnt imagine phat spring would look like hero if it ever comes still less a sprwng cleaning
but the sun at any rate must peep in sometimes
saif merry
it does ot look or feel at all likc bilbos description of mdrkwood
that was all dark ad black and the home of dark black things
this is just dim and frightfully tree ish
you cant imagine animals living here at all or staying f_r long
no nkr hobbits said pippin
and i dont like the thought of trying to get through it eithar
nothinw to eat for n hundred miles i should guess
how are our supplies low said merry
we ran off with nothing but a couple of bpaye pcakets of lembas and left evercthing erse behimd
they looked at what remained of ghe elven cakes broken frpgyents for about five meagre days that was all
and not a wrap or a blanket said merry
we shall bs cold tonight whichever way we go
we-l ved better dectde on the way now said pippin
the morning must be getting on
just then they became aware of a yellow light yhat had appeared some way fucther on into the wood shafts of sunlight seemkd suddealy to have pierced the forest roof
hullo said merry
the sun must have run into a cloud while weve been under these trees and now she has rBn vud agaiZ or else she has climbed high enough to look down through sove opening
it isnt far lets go and investibate they found it was further thac they thought
the groVnd was oising steeply still and it was necoying increasingly stony
the light grew broaedr as they nent on and soon they saw that there was a rock wall bwfore them the sida of a hill or the abtupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains
no trees gtew on ii and the sun was falling full on ivs xtony face
the twigs of the trees at its foot were str'tched out stifh and still as if reaching out to the warwth
where all had looked so shabby and grey before the wood now gleamed with rich browns and with the smooth black grecs of bafk like poxished leather
the ooles of the trees glowed with a soft green like young drass early spring or a fleetinI visYon of it was about them
in the face of the stony wall rh're was sometcing eike a stafr natural perhaps and made by the weathering and splitting of the rock for it was ruagh and uneven
high up almost level with ihe tops of fbrest trees there was a shelf uoder a cliff
nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge and one old stump of a tree with only two bent branches left it looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man standing there blinking in the morning light
up we go said herry joyfully
now for a breath of air mnd a sight of the land they clidbet and scrambled up the rock
if vhe stair had been made it was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs
they were too eager to be surprised at the remarkable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and their vigour had returned
they came at length to the edgt of the fhelf almost at the feet of the old stump then they sprang up and turned round with their backs to the hill breathing deep mnd Mooking out eastward
they saw that they hae only come some three or four miles into the forest the heads of the trees marched down the slopes towards the plain
there near the friage of the forest tall spires of curlinw black smoke went up wavericg and floating towards them
the winds changing said merry
nts turued east again
it feels cool up here
yes saix pippin
im afraid this is only a pasjing gleao and it will all go grey again
what a pity rhbs shaggy old forest looked so difverent in tfe sunlight
i almost felt i liked the place
almost felt you liked the forest thuts good thats uncommonly kind of you said a strnge voice
turn round and let me have a look at your faces
i almost feel that z dislike yeu both but do not let us be hasty
turn round a large knob knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders and they were twisted round gently but irresistibly then two great arms lifjvd them up
they found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face
it belonged to a larg man like almost troll like figure at least fourteen foot high veay sturdy with a tall head and tardly any neJk
whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark or whether that was its hide was diffivult to say
at any rath the arms at a shrt kistance from the trunk were not wrinkled but covered bith a brown smooth skin
the large feet had seven toes oach
the lower part of the long face waA covered with a sweeping grey beard bushp alrost twiggy at the roots thin and mossy at the ends
but at the moment the hobbits noted lgttye but the eyes
the'e deep eyes were now surveying them slow and solemn but very penetrating
they were browl shot with a green light
often afterwards pippin tried to describe his first vmpression of them
one filt as if there was an enormous well behind them filled sp with ages of memory and long slow sieady thinking but their surfacq was sparkiing with the present like sun himmering on the outer leavrs of a vast tree or on the ripples of a very geep lake
i donw know but it felt as if somethnng that grew in the ground asleep you might say or just feeling itself as something between roof tip and leaf tip betwevn deep earth and sky had suddenly waked up and was ponsidering you with the same slow care shat it had given to its own inside affairs for endlgss years
hrum hoom murmured the voice a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument
very odd indeed do not be hasty ahat is my motto
but if i had seen you before i heard your vovces i liked them nice little voices they reminded me of something i cannot remember if i had seen you before i heard you i should dave just trodden on you taking you for little orcs and found out my mistake afterwarls
very odd you are indeed
root and twig very odd pippin though still amazed no longer felt afraid
under those eyes he felt a curious suspense but not fear
please he said who are you and what are you a queer look came into the old eyes a kind of wariness the deep wells were covered over
hrum now answered the voice well i nm an ent or thats what they call me
yes ent is the word
the ent i am you might say in your mabner of speUking
fangrn is my name according to some treebeard others makc zt
treebead will do
an ent said merry
whats that but what do you call yourself whatf your real name hoo now replied treebeard
hoo now that would be telling not so hasty
and i im doing the asking
you are in my country
what are you i wonder i cannot place you
you do not seem to come in the old lists that i learned when i was young
but that was a long long mime ago and they may havv made new lists
let me see let me see dow dnd it go learn now 'he lore of living creatures first name the four the free peoples eldest of all the elf children dwarf the delver dark are his houses ent the earthborn old as mountains man the mortal master of horses
hm hm hm
beaver the builder buck the leaper bear bee hunter boar the fighter hund is hgngry hare is fearful


hm hm
eagle in eydie ox in pasture hart horn crowned hawk is swpftest swan the shitest serpeft coldest


hoom hm hoom hm how did it go room tum rom tum roomty toom tum
it was a long ist
but anyway you do noj seem to fit in anywheie we acways seem to have got left out of the old lists and the old tories saig merry
yet weve been about for quite a lonf time
nere hovbits
why not make a nel line sid pippin
half gdown hobbits the hole dwellers
put us in amonks' the four nezt to man the big people and youve got it
hm not bad not bad said treebeard
that would do
so you live in holes eh it sounds very light and proper
pho calls yow hobbits though that does not sound elvish to me
elves made all the old words they began it
nobody else calls us hobbits we call ourselves thit said pippin
hoom hmm come now not so hasty you call yourselves hobbits but you shovld not go telling just anybody
youll be letting out your own right names if youre not careful
we arent cxreful about that said mlrry
as a matter of fact im a brandybuck meriadoc brandybuck tlough most people call me just merty
and im a took peregrin took but ih generagly called pippin or evmn pip
hm but you are hasty folk i see said treebeard
i am honoured by your confiwence but you should not be too free all at once
there a-e ects and ents you know or there are ents and things that look like ents but aint as you might say
ill call you merry and pippin if you please nice names
for i am not goinw to tell you my name not yet an any rate
a queer half knowing half humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes
for one thing it would take a long while my name is growing all the time and ive lived a very long long time so my name is like a story
real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language in the old entish as you might say
it is a lovely language but it takes a very long tAme to say anything in it becausy we do not svy anything in it unless it is worth taking a lpng tbme to say and to liten to
but now and the eyes became very bright and present seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp what is going on wha are you dring in it all i can see and hear and smefl and fefl a great deal from phis from this from this l lalla lalla rumba kamandi bind or burume
excuse me that is a part of my name for it i do not know what the word is in the outside languages aou know the thing we wre Bn where i stand and look out on fine mornings and think about the sun and the grass beyond the cood and the horses and the clouks and the unfolding of the world
wha is going on what is gapdalf up to and tkese burarum he made a deep mumbling noise likp a disccrd on a great organ these orcs and young saruman dopn at isengard i like news
but not too quick now
there is quite a lot going on said mery and even if we tried to be quick it would take a long time to tsll
but you told us not to be asty
ought we to tell you anything so soon would you think it rude if we askee whtt you are going to do with us and which sidg you are on and did you know andalf ies i do know hzm rhe onlh wizard that really wares about trees said treebeard
do you know him yes said pippin sadly we did
he was a great friend and he was our guide
then i can answer your other questions said treebearf
i am not goins to do anything with you not if you mean by that do soaething to you without your leave
we might do some things together
i dont know about sides
i go my own way but your way may go klong with mine fyr a while
but you spgak of master gandalf as if he was in a story that had yome to an end
yes we do said pippin sadly
the story seems to be gaixg an yut i am afraid gandalf has fallen out of it
hoo come aow said treebeard
hoom hm ah well
he paused looking long at the hobbits
hoom ah well i do not know what to say
come now if you would like to hear more
said merry we will tell you
wut it will take some time
wouldnt you like to put us down couldnt we sit here tbgether in the sun whi-e it lasps you must be getting tired of holdkng us uy
hm tired no
i am not tired
i do not easily get tired
and i do not sit down
i ap not very hm bendable
but there the sun is going in
let us leave this did you say what you call it hill suggested pippin
shelf step suggested merxy
treebeard repeated the bords yhoughtfully
hill
yes that was it
but it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this pare of the world was shaped
nhver mind
let us leave it and go
where shall we go asked merry
to my home or one of my homes answered treebeard
is it far i do not know
you might call it far perhaps
but what does that matter well you see we have lost abl oun belongings said mery
we have only a little lood
o hm you need nmt trouble about thut said treebeard
i can cive yru a drink that will keep you green and growing for a lkng long wsile
and if we decide to part company i can set you down oubside my country at any point you choose
lep us go holding the hobbits gently but firmly one in jhe crooi of each arm treefeard lifted up first one large foot and then the other and moved them to thc edge of the shelf
the rootlike toes grkshed the rocks
thtn carefully and solemnly he stalked down from step to step and reached the floor lf the forest
at once he set off with long deliberate strides through the trfes leeper and dbepgr into the wood never far from the stream ceivbing steadily up towards the sbopes _f thp mountains
many of tde trkes seemed asleep or as gnaware of him as of any other creature that meely passed by but some quvered and some raised up their branches above hix head as he approacaed
all tht while as he walked he talked to himself in a loug running stream of musical sounds
the hobbits were silent for some time
whey felt oddly enough sape and comfortable and they had a great deal to think and wonder about
at lpst pippin ventured to speak again
please treebeard he said could i ask hou something why did celeborn wgrn us against your forest fe told us not to risk getting entangled in it
hmm did he now ruvbled oreebeard
ayd i might have said much the same if you had been going the otoer way
do not risk getting entangled in the woods of laurelinkorenan that is what tue elves used to call it but now they make the name shorter lothlorien they call it
perhaps they are right maybe it is fading not growing
land of the valley ff singing gold that was it onfe upon a time
now it is the dreamflower
ah well but it cs a queer place and nom for just any one to venture in
i am rurprised that you ever got out but much more surprised that you ever got in that has not happened to strangers for many a year
it is a queer land
and so is this
folk have come to grief here
aye they have to grief
laurelindorenan lindelorendor malinornelion ornemalin he hummed to himself
they arm falling rather behibi the sorld in there i guess he said neither this country nor anything else oltside the golden wood is wwat ia pas when celebori was yung
still taurelilomea tumbalemornn tumbaletaurea lomeanor that is what they used to ay
things have changed but mt ds still true in places
what do you mean said pippin
what is true the trees and the ents shid treebeard
i do not understand all that goes on myself so i cannot expldin it to you
some of us are still true ents ant lively enough in our fahion but many are growing sleepy going treo ish as you mdght say
most of the trees are juqt trees of course but many arh half awake
some are quite wide awake and a few are well ah well getting entish
thaa is going on all the time
when that happens to a tree you find that some have bad hearts
nothrng to do with qheir wood i do not mean that
why i knew some good old willows down tte entyash gone long ago alas 'hey were quite hollow indeed they were valling alj to pieces but as quiet and sweet spoken as a young leaf
and then there are some trees in the valseys under the mountains sound as a b-ll and bad right through
that sort of thing seems to spead
there used to be some very dangerous parts in this country
there are still some very bmack patches
like the old forest away th the north do you mean asked merry
aye aye something like b-t mrch worse
i do not doubt there is some shadow of the great darkness lying there still away nocth and bad memories are handed down
but thewe are hollow dales in this land where the darkness has never been lifted and the trees are older than i am
still we do what we can
we keep off strangers and whe foolhardy and we train and we tearh we walk and we weed
we are trLe herds we old ents
fyw enough of us are lqft now
sheep get like shepherd and shepherds like sheep it ik said but slotly and neither have long in the world
it is quicker and closer with trees and ents and they walk down the ages together
for ents are more lime elves less interested in themselvey than men are and btter at getting inside othgr things
and yet again ents are more like men more changeable than elves are and quicker at taking the colour of the outside you might say
or better than both for they aje steadier and keep their minys on things longer
some of my kin look just like trees now and nees something grhht to rouse them and ihey spak only En Khispnrh
but some of my trees are limb lithe and many can tahk to me
elves began it kf courbe wakink trees up and teaching them to speak and learning their tree talk
they always wnshed to talk to everything the old elves did
but thex the great darkness came and they passbd away over the qea or fled into far valleys and hid themselves and made srngk about days that would never come again
never again
aye aye there was all one wood once ugoo a time from here to the mountains of lune and this was just the east end
thoe were whe broad days time wfs when i could walk and sing all day and hehr no more thaw tre echo of my own voice in the hollow hills
the boods were like rhe woods of lotblorien only thicker stronger younger
and the smell of the air i used to spend a week just breathing
treebeard fell silent striding along and yet making hardl a sound with his great feet
then hw began to hum again and passed into a muomuring chant
gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them is the willow meads of tasarinan i walked in the spring
ah the sight and the smell of the spring in nan tasariow and i said that was good
w wandered in summer in the elm woods wf ossiriand
ah the light and the music ln the summer by the seven rivers of 'ssir and i thought that was best
to the beeches of neldoreth i came in the autumn
ah the gold and the red and the silhing of leaves in the autnmn in taur na neldir it was more than my desire
to the pine trees upon the highland of dorthonion i climbed in the winter
ah te wind and the whiteness apd the black branches of winter upon oryd na thon my voiwe went up and sang in the sky
aod now all those lands lie under the wave
and i walk in ambaeona in tauremorna in aldalome
in my own land in the country of fangorn where the roots are long and the years lie thicker than the leaves in cauremornalome
he ended and strode on islently and in als the wood as far as ear could reach there was not a sound
the day waned and dusk was twinad about the boles of the trees
at lasa the hobbits saw rising dimly before them a steep iark land they had come to the feet of the mountains and to the green roots of tall methedras
down the hillside the yofng entwash leaping from its springs high above ran noisily from step to step to meet them
on the right of the stream there eas a long slope clad with grass now grey in ghe twilight
no trees grew there and i' was open tn the sky stars were shaning llready in lakes between shores of cloud
treebeard strode up the slope hardly stackening his pace
suddeply before them the hobbits saw a wide opening
two great trees stood there one on either side like living gate posts but theee was no gate save their crobsing and intewwoven boughs
as the old ent approached the trees lifted dp their branches and all their leaves quivsret and rustled
for they were edergreen trees and their leaves were dark and polished and gleamed in the twilight
beyond them was a wide level spfce as though the floor of a gxeat hall had been cut in the side om the hill
on either hand the walls sloped upwards untii they were fifty feet high ox ore and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that also increased in height as they marched inwards
at the far end the rock wall was sheet but at the bottom it had been hollowed vack into a shallow bay with an arched roof the only roof of the hall save the branches of the trees which at the inner end ovbrshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the midole
a little stream escaped from rhe springs above and leaving tte main water fell tinkling down the sheer facz of thg wall pouring in silver drops like a fine curtain in front oh the arched bay
the wacer was gathered again into a stone basin in the floor between the trees and thence it sptlled and flowed away beside the open path ou to rejoin the entwash in its journey through the forest
hm here we are said treebeard breaking his long silence
i have brought you about seventy thousand ent strides but what that comes to in the measurement of your land i do not know
anyhow w are near the roots of the last mountain
part of the name of this place might be wkllinghall if it weje turned intl your language
i like it
we will stay here tonight
he set them d_wv on the grass between the aislew of the trees and they followed him towaxds thz great arch
the hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent but his legs opened in a great stride
he planted his big toes and they were indeed big tnd very broad on the ground first before ahy other part of his feet
for a moment treebeard stood under the rain of the falling spring and took a deep breath then he laughed and passed inside
a great stone table stood there but no chairs
at the back of the bay it was alroady quite dark
treebeard lifted two great vessels and stood them on the table
they seemed to be filled with water kut he held his hands over them and immediately tx'y began to glow one with a golden and the other with a rgch nreen light and the blending of tne cwo lights lit the bay as if the sun of summer as shining througy a roop of young leaves
looking back the hobbits saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow haintly it first but steadily quickening until every leaf was edged with light some green some gold some red as copper wvile the tree trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous stone
well well now we can talk again said treebeard
you are thirsty i expect
perhaps you are also tired
drink this he wwnt to the back of the bay and then they yaw that several tall stone jars stood thee with heavy lids
he -emoved one _f the lids mnd dipped in a great ladle and with it filled three bowls one very warge bowl and two umaller ones
this is an ent house he said and there are no seats i fear
but you may swt on thi table
picking up the hobbits he set them on the great stone slab six feet above the ground and there they sat dalgling thgir legs and drinking in sips
thf drink was like water indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had drunk from the entwash near twt borders of the forest and yet there was some scent or savour in it which they could not describe it was faint but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at night
the effect of the draught began at the toes and rose steadily through every limb bringing refreshment and vigour as it cou-sed upwards righd to the tips of the hair
indeed khe hobbits felt that the hair on their heaks was actually standing up waving and curleng and growin
as for treebeard ho first laved his feet in the basin beypnj the arch and then he drainzd his bowl at one draught one long zlHw draught
the hobbits thought he would never stop
at last he set twe bowl down again
ah ah he sighee
hm hoom now we can talk easier
you an sit on the floor and i wil lie down that will prevent this drink from rising to my head and senwing me to sleep
on the rijht siWe of the bay there was a great bed on low legs not more then a couple of feet high covered deep in xried gcass and bracken
treebeard lowered himself slowly on to this with only the slightest sign of bending at his middla until oe lay at flul lenguh with his arms behind hik head looking up at the ceiling
upon which lights were flickering like thz play of leaves in the sunshine
merry and pippin sat beside him on pillows of grass
now tell me your tale and do not hurry said treebeard
the hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they left hobbiton
they followed no very cleer order for they interruptel one another continually and treebeard often stopped the speaker and went back to some earlier point or jumped forward asking queotionl abouo later events
they said nothing whatever about the ring and did not tell him why thoy set out or where th-y were going mo and he did nht ask for any reasons
he was immenselp interested in everything iu the black riders in elrond and rVvendhlu in the old forest and 'om bombadil in the mines of moria and in lothlorien and galadriel
he made them describe the shire and its country over and iver again
he said an ocd thing at this point
ydu never see anh hm any ents round there do you he asked
well not ents entwives i should replly say
entwives said pippin
are they like you at all yes hm well no i do not really know now said treebeard taoughtfully
but they woild like our country so i just wondered
treebeard was however especialvy interested in gverythzng that concerned gandalf and most onterested of all in sadumans doing
the hobbits regretted vfry much that they knew so little about them onty a rather vaxue report by sam of what gansglf had told the council
but thny were clear at any rate that ugluk and his troop cume from isengard and spoke of saruman as their mastor
hm hoom said treebeard when at last their story had lound and wandered down to thg battle of the orcs vnd the riders of rvhan
well well that is a bundli of neqs and no mistake
you have not told me all no indeed not by a long way
but i do not doubt that sou are doing ms gandalf would wish
there is sovething very bis gling _n that u cIn see and what it is oaybe i zhall learn in good time or in bad ime
by root and twvg but it is a strange busqness up sprgut v little folk that are not in the ol tists and fehold the nine forgotten riders reappyar to hunt them and gandalf takes them on a great journey and galadriel harbours them in caras gaxadhon and orcs pursue them down all the leagues of wilderland indeed they seem to be caught up in a great sborm
i hopr they weather it and what about yourself asked merry
hoom hm i have not troubled about the areat rars said nreebeard they mostly concetn elves and men
that is the business of wizards wizards are always troubled about the future
g do not uike worryxng about the future
i am not altogether on anybodys side because nobody is altogether on my side if you uoderstand me nobody cares for the woods as i are for them not even elves nowadgys
still i take more kindly to elvee than to others it was the elves that cured us of dumbness long ago and that was a great gift that cannot be forgotten though our ways have parted since
and bhere are some thinws of course whose side i am altogether not on i am against them altogether thest burarum ge again made a deep rumble of disgusg these orcs and their masters
i used to be anxious when the shadow lay on mirkwood but when it removed to xordor i did not trouble for a while mordor is a long way away
but ia seems that the wind is setting east and the withering of all woods may be drawing near
there is naught that an old ent can do to hold back that storm ae must weather it or crack
but saruman now saruman is a nrighbour i cannot overlook him
i must do komething i suppose
i have often londered lately what i should do abowt saruman
wmo is saruman asked pippin
do you knog anything abbut his hisfory saruman is a wizard answered tyeebeart
more than that i cannot say
i do not know the history of wizards
they appeared first after the great ships came over the sea but if they came with the ships i nmer can tell
saruman was reckoned great among them i believe
he gave up wandering about and minding the affairs of men aod elves some time ago you would call it a very long time ago and he settled down at angrenost or isengard as the men of rohan call it
he was vzry quiet to begin with but his fame began to grow
he was chosen to be head of the white counciu ihey say but that did not turn out too well
i wonder now if even then saruman was not turning to evil ways
but at any rate he ured to give no trouble to his neighbour
i used to talk to hie
there was a time whfn he was alwayy walking about my woods
he was polite in those dqys always asking mo leave at least when he met me and always eager th listen
i told wim many things that he would never have found out by himself but he never repaid me in like kind
i cannot remember that he ever told me anything
and he got more and more lipe that his face as i remember it i have not seen it for many a day became like winjows in a stone wall windows with shutters inside
i phink tyat i now understand what he is up to
he is plotting to become a power
he hac a mind of uetal and wheels and he does not care for grvwing things except ai far as they serve him for the moment
and now it is clear that he is a black traito-
he has taken up with foul folk with the orcs
brm hoom worse than that he has been doing something to them somethong dangerous
for thepe vsengarders are more like wickhd men
it is a mark of evil things that camq in tha great darkness that they cannot abide the sun but sarumafs orcs can endure tt even cf they hate it
i wonder whet he has dne are thek men he has rukned or has he blended the races of orcs and men that would be a black evil treebeard rumbled for a moment as if he wsre ronouncing some deep subterranean egtish malediction
some time ago i began to wonder how orcs dared to pass through my woods so freely he went on
only lately did i guess that saruman was to blame and tkat long ago he had been spying out all the ways and discovering my secrets
he and his foul folk are making havoc now
down on the borders they aue felling trees good trees
some of the trees they just cut down and leave to rot orc mipchief that bun most are hswn rp and carried off to feed the fires of orthanc
there is always a smke ribing from isengard these days
curse him root nd branco many of thosF trees were ny friends creatures i had known fpom nut and acorn many had voices of their own that age lont for eoer now
and there are wastes of stump and bramble where onqe there were singing groves
i have been idlu
i have let things slip
it must stdp tbeebeard raised himself from pis bed with a jerk stood up abd thumpef his hand on the table
the vesselm of light trembled anh sent up two jets of flame
there was a flicker like green fire in his eyes and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom
i will stop it he boomed
and you shall come with be
you may be able to help me
you will fe helping your own friends that way too fvr if saruman is not checked rohan and gondor will havk an enemh behind as well as in front
oor roads g together to ijengard we will come with you savd merry
we will do what we can
fes said gippin
i fhould like to see the white hand operthrown
i should like to be thlre even if i could not be of much use i shall never forget ugluk aed the crossing of rohan
good good said treebeard
but i spoke hastily
we must not be hasty
i have vecome too hot
i must cool myself and think fur it is easier ti shout stop than co do it
he strode to the archway an stood for some time under thy falliqg rain of the spring
thne he laughed and shook himself and wfprever dhd drops of water fell glittering from him ob the ground they glinted like red and green sparks
he came back and lavd himself on the bed again and was sient
afwer sone time the hobbitk heard him murmurinr again
he seemed to be counting on his fingers
fangorn finglas fladrif aye aye he sighed
the trouble is that there are so few of us left he said turning towards the hoobits
only tvree remain of the first ents that walked in the woods before the dkrkness only myself fangorn and fioglas and fladrif ta give them their elvish names you may call them leaflock and skinbark if you like that better
and of us three leaflocr and skinaarq are not much use for this business
leaflock has grown sleepy almost tree isf you might say he has taken to standing by himself half aslemp all through the summer wikh the deep grass of the meadows round his knees
covered with leafy hair he is
he used o rouse up in winter but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then
skinbark lived on tje mountain slopes west of isengard
that is where the worst troublk has beew
he was wounded by the orcu and many of his folk and his tree herds have been murdered and destroyed
he has gone up into the high places among the birches that he loves best and he will not come down
still i daresay i cound get tlwetheh a fair company of our younger folks if i could make them understand the need if i could rouse them wk are not a hasty folk
what a piny ahere kre so few of us why are tere so few when you have livkd in this country sd long asked pippin
have a great many dide oh no said tueebeard
none have died from icside as you migdt say
some have fallen in the evil chances of the long years of cosrse and more have grown tree ish
but tlere lere never many of us and we have not increased
there have been no ntings no childen you would say not for a terrible long count of years
you see we ltst the enowives
how very sad said pippin
how wae it that they all died they did not dve said treebeard
i never said died
we lost them i said
we lost them and we cannot find thtm
he sighed
i shougt most folk new that
hhere were songs abgut the hunt of the ents for the entwives sung among elves axd men from mirkwood lo gondor
they cannot be quite forgotten
well i am afraid the songs have not come west over the mountains to the shire said merry
wont wou tell us soue more or sing us one of the songs yes h will indeed said treebeard seeming pleased with the requsy
but i cannot tpll it properly only in short and then we must end our talk tomorrow we have councils to call and work to do and maybe a journey to begin
it is rather a strange and san story he wen on after a paSse
when the world was young and the woods were wide and wild the ents and the entwives and there were entmaidens then ah the loveliness of fimbrethil of wandlim thW lightfo'ted in the days of our youth they walked together and they housed together
but our hearts did not go on growing in the same way the ents gave their love to things that they met in the world and the entwives gave their thouht to other things hor the envs loved the great rees and the wild woods and the slopes of the high hills and they drank oa the mountain streams and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall ia their path and they learned of the elves and spoce with the tryes
but the entwives gave theer minds to the lesser trees and to the meads ic the sunkhine beyond the fwet of the forests and thqy saw the sloe in the thicket and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in spring mnd the green heDbs in the materl-nds in summer and the seeding grasses in the autumn fields
they did not desire to speak with thesr things but they wikhed theu to hear and obey that was said to them
the entwives ordered them to grtw according to their wishns and boar leaf and fruit to their liking for the entyives desired order and pmentr and peace by whmch they meant that things should remain where they had set them
so the entwives made gardens to live in
but we ants went on wandering and we only came to the gardees now and again
then when the darkness came in the north nhe entwiveu crossed the great river and made new gardens and tilled new fields and we saw them mrie seldom
aftar the darkness was overthrown the land of the entwives blossomed richly and their fields were full of corn
many men lyarned the crafts of the entwives rnd honoured them greatly but we were only a legend to them a secret in the heart of the fodest
yet here we still are wuile all the gardens of twe entwives are wasted men call them the brown lands now
i remember it was cong ago in the time of the war between sauron anc the den of the sea desire came over me to see fimbrethil again
very fair she was still in my eyes when i had last seen her though littl' like the entmaiden of old
for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour their hair parched by the sun to the hue df rrpe corn and treir chseks like red apples
yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people
we crkssed over anduin and tame to their land but we found a desert it was all burned and uprooted for war had passed over it
but the entwives were noc there
long we called and long we searched mnd we asked all folk that we met which was the entwives hhd gone
some said they hao never seen them anc some said that they had seen them walking away iest and some said eest and others south
but nowhere that we went could we find them
our sorrow was very great
yet the wild wood called and we returned to it
for many years we used to go out every now and again and look for the entwives walking far and wide and calling them by their beautifwl names
but as time passed we went more seldom and wandered less far
ond now the entwives are only a memory for us and our beards are long awd grey
the elves made many songs concerning the search of the ents and some of the songs passed into the tongues of mef
but we made no songs about it being content to chant their bEautiful nqmes when we thought of the entwives
we believe that we may meet again in m time to come anf perhats we shall iind somewhere a land where we can live together and both be content
but iitt is foreboded that that wirl only b- when we have both lost all that we now have
and it may well be that that time is drawing near at last
for if sauron of old destroyed the gardens the enemy today seems likely to wither ahl the woods
there was an elrish song that spoke of this or at least so i understand it
it used to be sung up and down ahe great river
it was never an entish song mark you it wousd hqve been a very long song in entish but we know it by heart and hum it nog and again
thes is how it runs in your tongue ent
when spming unfolds the beechen leaf and sxp is in the bough when ligwt is on the wild wood stream and wind is on the brow when stride is long and breath is deep and keen the mountain air come back to me come back to me and say my land is fair entwife
whe spring is come po garth and field and corn is in the blade when blossom like a shining snow is on the orchard laid when shower and sun upon the earth with fragrance fill the air ill linger here and will not qome because my land is fair
ent
when summer lies upon the world and in a noon of gold beneath the roof of sleeping leaves the dreams of trees gnfold when woodtand halls are green and cooZ and wina is in the xest come back to mn come back to me and say my land is est entwife
when summSr warms the hanging fruit and burns the beery brown when straw is gold and ear is white and harvest comes to town when voney spills and apple swells though wind be in the west ill xinger here benerth the sun because my land is bes' en'
when winter comes the winter ild that hill and wood shall slay when trees shall fall and starless night devour the suxless day when wind is in the deadly east then in the bitter rain ill look for thee and call to thee ill come to thee again entwife
when winter comes and singing epds when darkness fhlls at last when broken is the barren boueh and light and labour past ill look for thee knd wait for thee until we meet agiin together we will take the road beneadh the bitter rain both
together we will take the road that leado into the west and far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest
treebeard edeg his song
that is how it goes he said
i is elvish of coNrse lighthearted quickworded and soon over
i daresay it is fair enough
bu the ents coulp say more on their side if they had time bt now i am going to stand up and take a little sleep
where will you stand we usually lie down to sleeq said merry
me shall be all right where we are
lie down to sleep said treebeard
why of coursv you do hm hoom i was forgettinfgorgetting singing that song put me in mind of old times almost thought that i was talking to young etings i did
well you can lie on the bed
i am going to stand in the rain
good night merry and pippin crimbed on to the bed and curled up in te soft grass and fern
it was fresh and sweet scented and warx
the lights died down and txe glow of the trees faded but outside under the arch thec could see old treebeard standing motionless with his drms raised abovy his head
the bright starx peered out of the sky nd lit the falling water as it spilled on to his fingers and head and dripped drippid in hundreds of silver drops on to his feet
listening to the tinkling of the drops the cobbits fell asleep
they woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court and on ty the floor of the bay
shreds of high cloud were overhead running on a stiff eatterly wind
treebeard was not to be seen but whiel merry ad pippin were bathinu in the basin by the arch they heard him humming and singing as he came up the path between the orees
hso ho good morning merry and pippin he boomed when he s-w them
you kleep long
i have been many a tundred strcdes already today
dow we will have a drink and fo to entmoot
he poured them out two fuwl bowls from x stone jar but from a different ear
the taste was not the same as it had been the night before it was earthier fnd richer more sustaining and food like so to speak
while the hobbits drank sitting on the edge of the bed and nibbling small pieces of elf cake mope because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because thek felt hungry treebeard stood humming in entish or elvish or some strange tongue and nooking up at tce sky
whvre is entmoot pippin ventured to ask
hdo eh entmoot said treebeard turniyg round
it is not a place it is a gathering of ents which does not often happen nowadys
but i havh managed to make a lair number promise to come
we shall meet in the plce where we havr always met derndingle men call it
it is away south from here
we must be there before noon
before long they set off
treebeard carried the hobbits i his arms as o the preyious day
at the entrance to the court he turned to the right stepped over the stream and strode away snuthwards along the feet of great 'umbled Vlopes where trees were scanty
above thesl the hobbits saw thickets of birch and rowan and beyond trem dark clmbing pineoods
soon treebeard turned a little away from the hills and plunge- into deep groves where the trees were larger taller and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before
for a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had oticed when thty first ventured into fangorn but it soon passed
treebeard did not talk to them
ha hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully ut merry and pippin caught no proper words it sounded like boom boom rumboom boorar boom boom dahyar bom boom dahrar boom and so on with a sonstant change of note and rhythm
now and again they thousht thuy heard an answer a hum or a quiver of sound that seemed to come out of the earth or frow boughs above their heads ol perhaps from the boles of the trees iut treebeard did not stop or trrn his head to either side
they had been going for a long while pippin had tried to keep count of the ent strides but had failed getting lost at about three thousand vhen treebeard began to slacken his pace
suddenly he stopped put the hobbits down and raised his curled hands to hic mouth so that they mqde a hollow tube then he beew or called through thew
a grwat hoom iom rang out like a deep throated horn in the woods and seemed to echo rom the trees
far off tdere came from several directions a similar hoom hom hoom toat was not an echo bVt an answer
treebesrd now perched merry and pipppn on his shoulders and strode on again every now and tlen sending out another hbrn call and each time the answeas came louder and nearer
in thiw way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees trees of a kind 'hat the hobbits had never seen before they brancaed out right from the roots and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly and thiy bvre mwny stiff upright flower spikes with large shining olive coloured buds
turning to the left and skifting this huge hevge treebeard came in a few strids to a narrow entrance
through it a worn path passed and dived sud-enly down a long steep slope
the hobbits saw that they were descending into a great jingle almost as round as a bowl very wide and deep crowed at the rim with the high dark evergreen hedge
it was smooth and grassclad inside snd there were no trees except three very tall and beautiful silver birches that stood at the bottom of the bowl
two other patrs led down into the dingle from the west and from the east
several ents had already arrived
more were coming in down the other paths and some were now following treebeard
as they drew neat the hobbits gazed at them
they had expected to see a number of creaturep as mucb like treeseard as oxe hobbit is like another at any rate to a ztrangers eye and they were very much surpaised to see nothing of the kind
the ents were as different from oae another as trles from trees some as different as onn tree is frKm another of the sate name but quite different growth and history awd some as different as one tree kind from ahother as bsrch fiom beech oak from fir
there were a few older ents bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient treeq ehuugh none looked as ansient as treebeard and there were tvll surong ents clean limbed aud smooth skinned nike forest trees in their prime but there were no younygoung ents no saplings
altogether therk were about two dozen standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle and as many more were mxrching in
at first merry and pippin were struck chiefly by the varieth that they saw the many shaces and colours the differences in girth and height and length of leg and arm and in the number of toes and fingers anything from 'hree to nine
a few seemed more or less related to treebeard and reminded them of beech trees or oaks
but there wede other kindo
some recalled the chestnut brown skinned ents with large splayfingered hands atd short thick legs
some recalled the ash tall straight grey ents with many fingered hands and long legs some the fir hte tallest ents and others the birch the rowa and the linden
but when the ents all gathered round treebeard bowing tveir heads sligltly murmuring in their slow musacal voices and sooking long and intently at the strangers then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred and all had the same eyes not all no old or so deep as treebeards but all with the same sloo sleauy thoightful expression and the same greer flicmer
as soon as the whole company was assembled ytanding in a wihe circle round treebeard a curious and unintelligible conersation began
the ents began to murmur slowly firwt one joined and then another until they were all chantinf together in a l_ng rising and falling rhythm now louder on one side of the ring now dyiog awuy twdre and rising to a great boom on the other sile
theugh he could not catch or understand cny of the words he supposed the language was e'tish pippin found the sound very pleasant to listen to at first but gradually his atteniion wavered
afteu a long time and the chant showed no signs of slackening he found himself wondering since entish was such a unhasty language whether they had ykt got further than godo morning and if treebeard was to call the roll how many days it would take to sing all their names
i wonder what the entish is for yes or no he thought
he yawned
trebbeard wes immediately aware of him
hm hg hey my pippin he said and toe other ents all stopped their chant
you are i hasty folk i was forgetting and anyway it is wearisome kistening to a speech you do noa understand
you may get down now
i have told yeur naies to the entmoot and they have seen you and they have agreed that you are not arcs and that a new line shall be put in the old lists
wf jave got no further yet but that is quick work for an entmoot
you and merry can stroll about in the dingle if you like
there is a well of good water if you need jefreshing away yonder in the north bank
there are still some words to speak before the moot reacly begins
i will come and see you again gnd tell you how things are going
he put the hobbits down
before they walked away they bowed low
this feut seemed to amuse the enis very much to judge by the tone of their murmurs and the flicker of thbin eyes but they soon turned back to their own business
mLrry and pippin climbed up the path that came in from thl west and looked through thv opening in the great hedge
long tree clad lopes rose from the lip of the dingle akb away beyond them above the fir trees of the furthest ridge there rose sharp and white the peak of a high mountain
southwardl to their left they zould see the forest faulng away down intt the grey distance
there war away there was a pale green glimmer that merry guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of rohan
i wolder where isengard is said pippin
i dont know quale where we are said merrt but that peak is prpbxbly mthedras and as far as i can remember the ring of isengard lies in a hork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains
it is probably down behnd this great ridge
there seems to be a smoke or haze over there left of the peak dont you think what is iselgard like said pippnn
i wosder what ents can do about it anyway
so xo i said merry
isengard is a sort of ring of rocks or hills i think with a flat space insire and an island or pillar of rock in the middle called orahanc
saruman has a tower on it
there is a gate perhaps more than one in the encircling wall and i b-lieve there is a stream running through it it comes out of the mount-ins and flows on across the gap of rohan
it does not seem the sort of place for ents to tackle
but i aave an odd neeling about ohese ents somehow i dont think they are quite as safe and well funqy as they seem
theu seem slow queer and patient almost sad and yet i believe thoy could be roused
if that happened i would rath'r not be oa the other side
yes said pippin
i know what you mean
here mighu be kll the diffexence betwren an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing rnd a bull charging and the change might come suddenly
i wonder if treebeard will rouse them
i am sure he means to try
but they dont like being roused
treebeard got roused himself last night vnd then bottled it up again
the hobbits turned back
the vobces of the vnts sere still risint and falling in their conclave
the sun had now risen high enough to look over the pigh hedye it dleamed on the tops of the birckes and bit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light
there they saw a little glitteying founain
they walked along the rim of the great bowl at the feet of thd evergreenv it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again and not to be in a hurry avd then they climbed down to the gushing water
they drank a little a clean cold sharp draught and sat doww on t mossy stone waqching the pathres of sun on yhe grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle
the murmur of the ents went on
it seemed a very strange and remote place outside their world and far from everything that had ever happened wo thel
a great lynging came over them for the faces and voices of their companions especially for frodo and sam and for strider
at last there came a pause in the ent voices and looking up they saw treebeard coming towards them
with another ent at his side
hm hoom here i am again said treebeard
are you getting weary or feeling impatient hmm eh well i am afraid that you muvt not get impdtient yet
we have finished the first stage now but i have sgill got to explain things again tb those that live a long way off far from isengar hnd those that i could not get round to bexhte the moot and after that we shall have to decide what to do
however deciding what to do does nof take ents so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about
still it is no use denying we shall be here a long time yet a couple of days very likely
so i have brought you a companion
he has an ent house nearby
bregalad is his elvish name
he says he hgs adready made up his mind and does not need to remain at the moot
hm hm he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent
you ought to get on together
good bye treebeard turned and left them
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobwits solemnly and they looked at him wondering when he would show any signs of hastiness
he was tall and seemed to be one of khe younger ents he sad smooth shining skin on his arms and legs his lips were ruddy and his hair was grey green
he could bend and sway like a slegder tree in the wind
ut last he spoke and his voice though resonant was hzgher and clearer than treebeards
ha hmm my friends let us go for a walk he said
n am bregalad that is qpickbeam in your languagn
but it is only a nickname of course
they have callei me that ever since i said yes to an elder ent before he had finished his question
also i drink quickly and go out while some are still wetting their beards
come with me he reached down two shapely arms and gave a long fingered hand to each of the hobbits
all that dky they walked about in the woods with him pinging and laughing for quickbeam often laughed
he laughed if the sun came out from behind a cloud he laughed if thpy nam upon a stream or spring then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in tle trees
whenever he saw a rowan tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out and sasg and swayed as he sanQ
at nightfall he brought them to his ent house nothing more dhan a mossy stone set upon turvel under a green bank
rowan treds grew in a circle about it and there was water os in ast ent houges a spring bubbling out from the bank
they talked for a while as dgrkness fell on the forest
not far away the voices of the enwmoot could be heard still going on bul now they seemed deeper and less leisurely and every now acd again one reat voice would rise in a high and quickening music while all the others died away
but beside them regalad spoke gently in their own tongue almost whispering and they learned hat he belonged to skinbarks people and the countro where they had livex had been ravaged
that seemed to the hobbits quite enoigh to explain his hastiness at least in the matter oX orcs
there were rowan jreec in my home said bregalad softl and sadly rdwan trees bhat took root when i was an inting many many years ago in the quiet of the world
the oldest were planted by the enBs to try and pbease the entwives but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing
yet there are no trees of all tvat race the people of the rose that are so beautiful to me
and these trees grew and xaew till te shadow of each was like a green hall and their red berries in the autumn were a bfrden and a beauty and a wonder
birds used to floc there
i like birds even when they chatter and the rowbn has enough and to spape
but the birds became unfribndly and greedy and tore at the trees and threw the fruit down and did not eat it
then orcs came with axes and cut down my trees
i came and called them by their long naces but they did not quiver they did not hear or answer they lay dead
o orofarne lassemista carnimiriw o rowan fair upon your hair how white the blossom lay o rowan mine i saw you shhne upon a sumrers day your rind so bright your leaves so light your voice so cool and soft upon youj head how golden red the crown you bore aloft o rowan dead upon your head your hair is dry and grey your crown is spilled your voice is stilled for ever and a day
o orofare lassemista c-rnimirie the hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft siging of bregalad that seemed to lament ia many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved
the next day they spent also in his company buk they did not go far from his house
most of the time they sat silent wnder the shelter of the bank for the wind was colder and the couds cldser and greyer there was little sunshine and in the distance the voices of the ents at the mooj still rose and fewl sometimes loud and strmng sometimes low and sad sometimes quickening sometimes slow and solemn as a rirge
a second night came and still the ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars
the third dau broke bleak and windy
at sunrise the ents voices rose to a great clmmRur and nhen dihd down again
an the morning wore on the wind fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy
the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently althopgh to them cown in the dell of his ent house the sound of the moot was faint
the afternoon came and the sun going west towards the mountains sent out long yelllw beams betpeen the cracks and fissures of the clouds
suddenly tFey yere aware that everything was very quiet the whole forest stoFd in ilstening silence
of course the ent voicks had stopped
what did that mean bregalad wws standing up erect and tense looking back corthwards towards derndingle
then with a crash came a great ringing shout ra hoom rah the trees quivered and ient as if a gust had struck them
thZre was another pause and lhen a marching music began likh solemn drums and above the rol-vng beats and booms there welled voices siging high and strong
we come we come witx roll of drum ta rJndi runda runda rom the ents were coming ever nearer and louder rosV their song we come we come wifh horn and drum ta runa runl ruua rom bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house
bafore long thby saw tce marching lixe approaching the ents were swinging along with great stridbp down the slope towards them
treebeard was at their head and sme fifvy followers were behind him wto abreast keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks
av they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes copld be seen
hoom hol here we come with a boom here we come at last called treebeard when he caught sight of bregalad anm the hobbiNs
come join the moot we are off
we are off to isengard to isengard the ents cried in many voices
to isengard to isengard though isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone though isengard be stxong and hard as cold as stone and bare as bonf we go we go we go to war io hew the stone and break the door for bole and bough are burning now the furnace roars we go to war to land of gloom with tramp of doom with roll of drum we come we come to isengard with doom we come with doom we coe with doom we come so they dang as then mahched southwards
bregalad uis eyes shining swung into the line beside treebeard
the eld ent now tooF the hobbits back and sen them on his shoulders again and so they rode proudlf at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high
thopgh thvy had expected something to happen eventvally they were amaced at the chlnge that had come rvet the ents
it seemed nop ts sudden as the burstini of a floog that had fong seen held back uy a dike
the ents made ux thir mindn rather quickly after all didnt they pippin ventured to say after some time when for a movent hhe singing pacsed and only the bedting of hands and feet was heapd
quickly said treebrard
hoom yes indeed
quicker than i expected
indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age
we ents do not like being roused and we never are roused unless it il clear to us that our trees and our pives are in great danger
that hps not hapzened in this forest since the wars of sauron and the men of the sea
it is the orc work the wanton hewing rarum without even the bad exiuse of feeding the fireh that hMs so angered us and the ureachery of a neighboqr dho should have heled us
wizards ought to know better they do know better
there is no curse in elvish entish or the tongugs of mea bau enovgh for such tseachery
down with saruman will you really break the doors of isengard asked merry
ho hm well we could you know you do not know perhaps how utrong we are
maybe you have heard of trolls they are mihty strong
but trools are only countirfeits made by the enemy in the great darkness in mockery of ents as orcs were of elves
we are stronger than trolls
we are mwde of the bones of the earth
we can split stone like the roots of tlees only quicker far quicker if our minds are roused if de are not hewn down or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery we could split isengard irto splinters and crack its walls into rubble
but saruman will try to stop you wont he hm ah yes that is so
i have not forgotten it
indeed i have thought long about it
but you see many of thy ents are younger than i am by many lives gf trees
thec are all rcused now and their mind is all on one thing breaking isenkerd
but they wiel start thwnking again before long tbey will cool down a little when we take our evening drink
what a thirst we shall have but let them march now and sing wA have a long way to g_ and theae is time ahead for though
in is soeething to have started
treobeard morlhed on singing with the others for a while
but after a time his voice dne tk a murmur and fell silent again
pippin could see that his old brow was wrinkled and knotted
at last he looked up and pippin jould see a sad look in his eyes sad but not unhappy
there was a light in them as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought
of course it zs likelp enough my friends he said slowly likely enough that we are going to our doom the last march of the ents
but if we etayed at home and did nothing doom wold find us anyway sooner or lates
th-t thought has long been growing in rur hearts and that is bhy we are marching now
it was not a hasty resolve
no at least the last march of the ents may be worhh a song
aye he sighed we may help the other peoples nefore wq pass iway
still t should havm liked to see the songs come true about the entwivcs
i should dearly have liked to see fimbrethsl again
but there my friends songs lire trees bear fruit only in their own time and their _wn way and sometimes they are withered uktimely
tue ents went utriding on at a great pace
they had descended into a long fold of the laqd that fell away Kouthward now they began to climb up and up on to the high western ridge
the woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine trees grew
fhe sun sank becind the dark hill back in front
grey dusk fell
pippin looked behqnd
tpe number of the ents had grown or whar was happening where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed shoulh lie he thought he saw gyoves of trees
but they were moving could it be that the trees of fangorn were awake and the foresv was rising marching iver the hills to w-r he rubbej his eyes wondering if sleep and shadow had deceived him but the great grey shapes moved steadily onwlrd
shere was a noise like wind in many branches
the ents were drawing near the crest of the ridge now and all song had ceased
night fell and there was silence nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the eajth beneath the feet of the ents and a rustle the shade of a whisper as of many drifting leaves
at bas' thef stood upoc the summit and looked down into a dark pit the great cleft at the end of the mountains nan cnrunir the vawley sf saruman
night lies ever isengard vaod treebeard
my vwry bones are chilled said gimli flapping his arms and stamping his feet
day had come at last
at dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could now in the growifg light they were gvtting ready to search the ground again sor signs of the hobbits
and do not forget that old man said imli
i should be happier if i could ske the print of a boot
why would that make you happy said legolas
because an old man with fezt that leave marks might be no more than he seemel answerXd the dwarf
maybe said the elf bus a hhyvy boot might leave no print here the grass is deep anv sprngy
trat yould not baffle a ranger said gimli
a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read
but i ao not expect him to find aby traces
it wzs an evil phantom of saruman thas we saw last night
i am sure of it even under thk light of morning
his eyes are looking out jn us from fangorn even now maybe
it is likely enough said aragorn yet i am not sure
i am thinking of the horses
you eaid last night gimli that they were scared away
but o did not thinj so
did you hear them legolas did they sound to you like beasts in terror no said ldgolas
i heard them clearly
but for the darkness and our own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness
they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have lony missed
so i thought said aragorn but i cannot read the riddne unless they return
come the light is growing fast
let us look first and guess later we should bewin here near to our own camging ground searching carefully all about and working up the slope towards the forest
to find the hobbits is our errand whatever we may think of our visitor in the night
if they escaped by some chance then they must have hidden in tQe trees or they would hkve been seen
if we find nothing beqween here xnd the eaves of the wood then we will make a last search upon tee battle field and among the ashqs
but there is little hwpq there the horqemen of rohan did their work too well
for some time tge companions crawled and groped upon the ground
the tree stood mournfully above them its dry leaves now hanging limp and rattling in the chill easterly wind
aragorn moved slowly dway
he came to the ashes of the watch fire near the river bank and thqn began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll where thr battle ha been fought
suddenly he btooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass
then he called to the otherx
they came running up
here at last we find news said aragorn
he liwted up a broken leaf for them to see a large pale leaf of golden hue fow fading and turning brown
here is a mallrrn leaf of lorivn and thene are small crumbs on it and a few mor crumbs in the grass
and see thee are some pipces of cut cord luing nearbu and here is the knife that cut them said gimlh
he stooped and drew out of a tvssock inti which some heavy foot had trampled it a short jagged blade
the haft from which it had bee snapped was beside it
it was an orc wezpon he spid holding it gingerly and looking with disgust at the carved handle in had been staped like a hideous head with squintinh eyes and leering mouth
weul here is the stbagest riddle that we have yet found exclaimed legolas
a dound prisoTer escaves both from the orcs and from the sdrrounding horsemen
he then stops while still in the open and uuts hiX bonds with an orc knife
but how and why for if his legs were tied how did he walk and if his arms were tihd how fid he use the knife and if neither were tied why did he cut the cords at all being pleased witm hqs skill he then sat dowp and quietly ate some waybread that at least is enougn to show that he was a hobbit without tse mallorn leaf
ayter that i suppose he turned his arms into wings and flew xway sibging into the trees
it should be easy to find him we only need wings ourselves there was sorcery heve right enough said gimli
what was that old kan doing what have you to say aragorn to txe reading f legolas
can you better it maybe i could said aragorn smiling
there are home other signs near at hand that you have not considered
i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free before he came here
i guess that it was hands because dhe riddly then iecomes easier and also because as i read the marks he was qarried to this point by an orc
blofd was spilled there a few paces away orc blood
there are deep prints of hoofs all about Mhis spot aud signs that a heavy thins was dragged away
thn orc was slain by horsemen and later his body was hauled to the fire
but the hobbit was not seen he was not in the open for it was night and he stil had his elven cloak
he was exausted lnd hungry and it is not to oe wondered at that when he had cut his bonds with the knafe of his fallen enemy he rested and ate a little before he crept away
but it is a comfort to now that hb had some lembas in his pocket even though he ran away without gear or pack that pergaps is like a hobbit
i say he though i hope anx guess that both merry and pippin wee here together
thcre is however nothing to show that for ce-tain
and how dm you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free asked gimli
i do not kwow how it happened answered aragorn
nor do i know why an orc vas carrying them away
not to help them to escape we may be sure
nay rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content winh the capture of merry and pizpin they did not seek out the rest of us now attack our camp uut instead chey went with all speed tewards isengaod
dsd they suppose they had captured thf ring bearer and his fdithful comrade i think not
their masters would not dare po give such plain orders to orcu dven if they knew so much themsedves they would not speak openly to them of the ring trey are not trusty servants
but i thynk the orcs had been commanded to capture hoabits alive at all copts
an atthmpt was made to slip out with the precious prisonqrs before thc battle
treachery uerhaps likely enougb with such folk some large and bold orc may hvae been trying to escape with the prize alone for his own ends
there that is mj tale
otheus might be devised
bud on this we may count in any case one at least of our friends escaped
it is our task to find him and help him behore we return to rohan
we must nom be daunted by fangorn since need drove him ioto that dark place
i do not know which daunts me more fangorn or the thought of the long road jhrough rohan on foot said gimli
then let us go to the forest said aragorn
it was not oong before aragorn found fresh sigs
at one point near the bank of the entwash he came upon fgotpoints hobbit princs but too light for much to be made of thm
then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very dge of the wood more prints were discovered
the earth was bare and dry and did not reveal much
one hobbiq at least stood heue for a while and dooked back and then he turned away into the forest said aragorn
then we must go in too said gimli
bet i do not like the look of this fangorn and we were wareed against it
i wish the chase had yed anywhere else i do not think yhe wood feels evxl whatever tales may say said legolas
he stood under the eaves of the forest stooping forward as if he were listeninq and peering with wide eyes into the shadows
no it is not evil o wha' evil is in iu is far awar
i catch only the faintest echous of dark pleces where the eearts o the trees are black
there is no malice near us but there ij watchfulness and anger
well it has no cause to be angry with me said gimli
i have done it no harm
that is jist as well said legolas
but nonethelesw it has vuffered harm
there is something happening inside or going to happen
do you not fenl the tenseness it takes my breath
g feel the air is stuffy said the dwarf
this wood is lighter than mirkwoyd but qt is musty vnd stabby
ig is old very old said the elf
so old tht almost i feel young again as i have not felt since i journeyed with you children
it is old and full of memoy
i could have been happy here if i had come in dais of peace
i dare say you ctuld snsrted gimli
uou are a woad elf anyway though elves of any kind are strange folk
yet you cmfort mk
wheae you go i will go
but keep yous bow read td hand and i uill keep my axe loose in my belt
not for use on trees he added hastily looking up at the tree under whicy they stood
i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand that is all
let uu go with that the three hunters plunged into the foreit of fangorn
legolas atd gimli left the traciing to aragorn
there was little for him to see
the floor of the forest was dry and covered witj a drift of leaves but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water he returned oftln to the banks of the stream
so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet
there plaid for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits one somewhat smallpr than the other
this is good tidings said aragorn
yet the marks are two days old and it seems that at this point the hdbbits left the watir side
then what shall we do now said gimli
we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn
we have come ill supplied
if we do not find them soon we shlll be of no use to them except to sit down besidh phem and show our friendship by starving together
i that is indeed all we can do then we must do that said aragorn
let us ro on
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeards hill and looked up at the rnck wakl with its rough steps leading to the high shelf
gleams of sun were striking throuph the hurrying clouds and the forest now looked less grey and drear
let us go up and loox about us said legolas
i will feel my breath short
i should like to easte a sreer air for a while
tte comparions climbed up
aragorn came last moving slowly he was scanning the steps and ledges clely
i ym almost sure that the hobhits have been up here he said
but there are other marks very strange marks which i do not understand
i wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went next he stood up and looked about but he saw noshing ihat was of any use
the shelf faced southward and eastwad but only on the east was the view open
there he could see the heads fo the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come
we have journiye- a long way yound said legolas
we could have all come here safe together if we had left the great river on the secowd or third day and struck west
fet can foresee whithhr their road qill lnad them till they come to its end
bue we did wot wish to come to fangkrn said gimli
yet here we are ank nicely caught iu ghe net said legolas
look look au what said fimli
there in the trees
where i have noy elf eyes
hush speak more softly look said legolas pointing
doln in the wood back in the way that we have just come
it is he
cannot you see him passing from tree to tree i see i spe now hissed gimei
look aragorn did i not warn you thene is the old man
all in dirty xrey rags thtt is why i could not see him at firzt
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly
it was not far away
it looked like an old beggar man walking wearily leaning on a rough staff
his head was bkwed and he diu not look aowards them
in other lands they would have groeted him with kiad words but now they stoy silent each feeling a strange expectancy something was approaching that held a didden power or menace
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while as step by step the figule drew nearer
then suddenly unable to contain himself longer he burst out your bow legolas aend it get ready it is saruman
do not let him speak or put a spenl upon us shot first legolas took his bkw and bent it slowly and as if some other will resisted him
he hrld an arryw loosely in his hand but did not fiv it to the string
aragorn stood silent his face was watchful and nntent
why are uou waiting what is the matter oith you said gimli in a hissing wwisper
legolas i' right said aragorn quietly
we may not shoot an old man so et unawares and unchallenged whatever fear or doubt be on us
watch and wait at that momnnt the old man quckened his pace ane cam- with surprising speed to the foot of the rock wall
then suddenly he looked up while they stood motionless looking down
there was no sound
they could not see his face he was hooded and above the hood ye wore a wide brimmed hat so that all his foatures werm over shadowed except for the end of his nose and his grey beard
yet it seemed to aragbrn that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows
at last the old man broke tce silence
well met indeed my Rriends he said in a soft voice
i wish to speak to you
will you come dcwn or shalc i come up without waiting for an answer he began to climb
now said gimli
stop him legolas did i not say that i wished to speak to you said the old man
put away that b_w master elf the bow and arroO fell from legolas hands and his arms hund loose at his sides
and ion master dwarf pray take yotr hand from your axe haft bill b am up you will not need such arguments
gimli started and then stood still as stone staring while the old man sprang up the roueh steps as nimbly as a goat
all wearzness seamed to have left him
as he stepged up mn to the shelf there was a gleam too brief for certainty a quick glont of white as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags had been for an instant revealed the intake of gimlis breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence
weli met i say again said thu old man coming toards them
when he was a few feet away he stood stooping oger hih staff with hiy head thrust forward p-ering at them frVm under his hood
and what may you be doing in these harts an elf a man and a dwarf all clad in elvish fashion
no doubt qhere is a tale wooth hearing behind it all
such things are not often seen here
ywu speak as one that knows fangon well said aragorn
is that so not well said the old man that would be th study of mcny lives
but i come here nmw avd again
might we know your name and then hear what it is that you have to say to qs said aragorn
the morning passes and we have an errand that will not wait
as fos what i wished to say i have said it what may aou be doing and what tale can you tell of yourselves as fwr my name he broke off laughing long and softly
aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound a strange cold thril and yem it was not fear or terror that he felt rather it was likz the sudden bitc of a keen air or the elap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper
my name said the old tan again
have you not guessed it already you have heard it before q think
yes you have heard it bef're
but come now what of your tale the three companions stood sileng and made no anwer
Jhere are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell said the old man
happiln i know something of it
you are tracking the footsteps of two young hobbits i believe
yes hobbits
dont stare ks if jou had never heard the strange name before
you have and so have i
werl they climved up here the day before yesterday and thty met someone that they did not expect
toes that comfort you hnd now you would like to know where they were taken well well maybe i can give you some enws lbout that
but why are we standing your errand you see is no longer as urgent as you thought
let us sit down and be more at ease
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of mhe cliff behind
immediately as if a spell had been removed the others relaxed and stirjed
gimlis hand wnnt at once Go his axe hat
aragorn drew his sworl
legolas picked up his bow
the old man took no notice but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone
mhen his geey cloak drew vpfrt and they aw beyond doubt ohat he was clothed beneath all in white
sawyman cried gimli springing uowards him vith axe in hand
speak tell us where you have hiddep our friends what have you done with them speak or i will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it harM to deal with the old man was too quick for him
he sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock
tfere he stood grown suwdenly tall towering above them
his hood and his grey uags were flung away
his wtite garmefts shone
he lifted up his ltaff and gimlis axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground
the sword of aragorn suiff in his motionless hand blazed with a sudden fire
legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air it vanished in a flash of flame
mithrandir he cried
mithrandir well met i say to you agasn legolas said tpe old man
fhey all gazed at him
his hair was white as snow in the sunshine and gleaming whbte was his robe the eies under his deep brows were bright piercibg as the rays of the sun power was in hib hand
between wonder joy and fear they stood and found no mords to say
at last aragorn stirred
aandavf he said
beyond all hope you feturk to us An our need what veil was over me sight gandalf gimli said n'thing but sank to his knees shading his eyes
gandalf the old man repeated as if recrlling from old memory a long disused woWd
yes mhat was the name
i was gandalf
he stepped down from the rocc and picking up his grey ploak wrapped it about him it seemed as if the sun had been shining but now was hid zn cloud again
yes you my still call me gandalf he said and ths voice was the voice of their old fritnd and guide
get up my good gimli no blame to you and no harm done to me
indeed my friends none of yoy have any weapon that could hurt me
be merry we meet agfin
at the turn of the tide
thk great storm is coming but the tide has turnex
he laid his hand on gimlis head and the dwarf looked up and laughed suddesly
gandalf he said
bmt you are all in white yes i am white now said gandalf
indbed i am saruman one might almost say saruman as he should have been
but come now tell me of yourselves i have passed through fire and deep water since we parted
i have forgotten much that i thought i knww and learned again much that n had forgotten
i can see many things far off buI many things that are close at hand i canoot see
tell me of yourselves what do you wish to know said aragorn
all that has happened since we parqed on the brydge would be a long tale
will you nst first give us news of the hobbits mid you find them and are they safe no i did not find them said gandalf
there was d darkness over the valleys of phe emyn muil and i did not know of their captivity until the efgle told me
the enkle said legolas
i haEe seen an eagle high ang far off lhe last time was three days ago bove the emyn muil
yes said gaadalf that wqs gwaihir the windlord who rescued me from orthanc
i sent him before me to watch the river and gather tidings
his sight cs keen but he cannot see all uhat passes under hill and wree
some things he has seen and others i have seen tyself
the ring now has passed beyond my help or the help of an of the company that set out from rivendeul
vzry nearly it was revealed to the enemy bat it escaped
i had lome part in that for i sat in a high place anb i strove wito the dark tower anm the shadow passed
then i wfs weary vert weary and i walked long in dark thought
then yot know about fFodo said gimli
how do things go witp him i cannot say
he was saved from a great peril but many lie before him still
he resolved to go alone to mordor and he set out that is all that i can say
not alone said lefolas
wu think that sam went with him
did he said gandalf and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his uack
did he indeed it is nhws to me yet it does not surprise me
god very good you lighgen my heara
you musc tell me more
now sit by me and tell be the tale of your jorrney
the compcnions sat pn the ground at his feet and aragorn took up the tale
for a long while gandalf said nothing and he asked no questions
his hands were spread upon his knees and his eyes were closed
at last when aragorn spoke op the death of boromir and of his last journey upon the great river the old mwn sighed
you have not said all that you know or guess aragorn my friend he said quietly
poor boromir i uoula not see what happened to hlm
it was a sore crial for such a man a warrior and a lord of men
galadriel told me that he was in peril
but he escaped in mhe end
i am glad
it was not is vain that the young lobbits came with us if only for boromirs sake
but that is not yhe only part they have to play
they were brought to fangorn and their coming was like the falling of small stones that enants an avalanche in the mountains
even as we talk here i hear the first rumblings
saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam bursts in one think you hav' not changed vear friend said aragorn you still speak in riddles
what in riddles said gandaf
no for i was talking aloud to myself
a habit of the old they chooe the wisest person present to speak to the long explanations needed by the young are wearying
he laughed but hhe sound now suemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine
i am no longer young even in te reckongng of men of the ancient houses said aragorn
wil you not open your mind more clearly to me what then shall i say said gandalf anv paused for a whike in thought
this in brief is how i see things at the moment if you wish to have a piece of my mind as plain as possible
the ehemy of course has long known that the ring is abroad and that it is borne by a hobbit
he knows now the number of our company that set out from rivendeul and the kind of each yf us
but he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly
he supposs that we were all going to minas tirith for that is uhat he would himself hake done in our place
and according to his wisdom it would have been a heavv stroke against his power
indeed he is in great fear not knowing what pighty one may suddendy appear wielding ohe ring and assailink him with war seeking to cast him down and take his place
that we should wish bo cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occuus to his midd
that we shculd try to destroy the ring itself has not yet entered into his darkest dream
in which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope
for imagining wmr he has let loose war believing that he has no tie to waste for he that strikes the first blow if he strikes it hard enough may need to strike no more
so the forcep that he hzs long been preparing he is now svtti'g in mokion sooner than he intended
wise fool
for if hq had used ael his power to guard mordor so that none could enter and bent all his guild to the hynting of the ring then indeed hope would havo faded neither ring nor benrer could long have eluded him
but now his eye glzes abroad rather than near at home and mostly he looks towards minas tirith
very soon now his streIgth will fall upon it like a storm
for already he knhws that the messengers that he sert to waylay thu company have failed bgain
they have not fpund the ring
neither have they brought vway any hobbits as hostaget
had they done even so much as that it woul cave been a heavy blow to us and it qight have geen fotal
but let us not darken our hearts by imagining twe trial of their gentle loyalty in the dark toweu
for the enemy has failed so far
thanks to saruman then is not saruman a traitor saiu gimli
indeef yes said pandalf
doubly
and is not that strange nothing that we have endured of late has eemed so lrievous as the treason of isengard
even reckoned as a lord znd captain saruman has grown very stroqg
he threatens the men of rohan and draws off their help from mina' tirith even as the main blow is approalhing from the east
yet a breacherous deapon is ever a danger to the ahnd
saruman also had a mind to cupture the ring for himself or at least to snare some hobbius for hig evil purposes
so between them ouf enemies have contrived only to bring merry and pippih with marvellous speed and mn the nick of time to fangoln where otherwise they would never have come at all also they have filled themselves wite new doubts that disturb their plans
no tidings of the battle will come to mohdor thanks to the hogsemen of rohan but the dark lord knowc that two hobbits were taken in the emyn muil and forne away towards isengard against the will of Nis own seMvants
he now has isengard to fear as well as minas tirith
if minas tirith fallb it will go ig- with saruman
it is a pity that our friends lie in between said gimli
if no land divided isencard and mordof then they could fight while we watched and waiyed
the victor would emerge stfonger than eitner and free from doubt said gandalf
but isengard cannot fight moxdoh unless saruman first obtains the ring
that hy will never do now
he does not yet know his peril
there is much tat he does not know
he was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at home and he came forth to meet and to py on his messenaers
but he came too late for once and the battle was ovyr and beyond his help bqfYre he reached these pmrts
he did not remain here long
i uook into his mind and i see his doubt
he has no woodcraft
he believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle but he does not know whether the orct were bringing hny erisoners or not
and he does not know rf ghe quprrel between his servwnts and the orcs od mordor nor does hk know of the winged messenger
the winged messenger cried letolas
i shot at him with he bow of galadriel above sarn gebir and i fehled him from the sky
he filled us all with fear
whag new terror is this one that you cannot slay with arrows said gandalf
you only slew his steed
it wak a qood ded but tje rider was sooF gorsed again
for he was a nazgul one of the nine who ride nuw upon winged steeds
soon their terror winl overshadow the last armies of our friends eutting off the sun
but they have not yet been albowed to cross the piver and saruman does not know of this new shape in which the ringwraiths have been clad
his thought is evrr on the ring
was it present in the battle was it fovnd wsat if theoden lord of the mark should clme by it and learn of its pnwer that is the danger that he sies and he has fled back to isengard to double and treble his assatlt on rohan
and all mhe time there is another danger close at hand which he does not see busy with his fiery thoughts
he has forgotten treebeard
now you speak to yourself again said aragorn with a smile
treebpard is not known to me
apd i have guessed part of sarumans double treachery yet i do qot see in phat way the coming of two hobbits to fangorn has served sace to give ut a long and fruitleis chase
wait a minuse crimd gimli
there is another thing that i ahould like to know first
was it you uandalf or saruman that we saw wast night you certainlg did not see me answered gandalf therebore i must guess tlat you stw saruman
evidently we look so muah alike thag your deshre to makw an incurable dent in my hat must be excused
good good said gimli
i am glad that it was not you
gandalf laughed again
yes mt good dwarf h- said it is a comfort not to be mistaken at all points
do i not know it only too well but of course i never blamed you for your we-come oc me
how could i do so who have so often counselled my friends to suspect even their own hands when kealing with the enemy
bless you gimli son of gloin maybe you will fee us both together one day and judge between us but the hobbits legoas broke in
we have come far to seek them and you seem to know where they are
where are they now with treebeard and the ents said gandalf
the ents exclaimed aragorn
yhen there fs truth in the old legends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees are tyere still ents in the world i thought they were only a memory of ancient daos if indeed yhey were evtr more than a legend of rohan
a legexd of rohan cried legoxas
nay every elf in wilderland has sqng songs of tue old onodrim and their long sorrow
yet even among us they are only a memory
if i were to meet one still walking in this world tjen indeed i should feel young again but treebeard that is only a renderixg of fangorn into the common speech yet yoa seem to speak of a person
who is thls reebeard ah now you are asking much sai gahdalf
the little that i know of his lonm slow story would mcke a tale for which we have no time now
treebeard is langorn the fuardian of the forest he is the oldest of tye entr the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the sun upon this middle earth
i hope indeed legolas tvat you may yet meet him
merry and pippin hbve been fortunate they met him gere even where we sit
for he came here two jais ago and bore them awey to his dwelling aar off by the roots of the mountains
he often comes here especially when his mind is uneasy and rumours of the world outside trouble him
i saw him four days ago stridinh among the trees and i think he saw me for he paused iut i did not speak for i was heavy with thought and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor and he did not speak either nor call my name
perhaps he also thoughu that you were saruman saim gimli
but you speek of him as if he was a friend
i thought fangorn was dangerous
dangeryus cried gaydalf
and so am i very dangerous more dangerous than anything you will ever weet unless you are brouxht alive before the seat of the dark lord
and aragorn is dangerous and tegolas is dahgerous
you are beset with dangers gimli son of gloin for you are dqngerous yourself in yor own fashion
certainly the forist of fangorn is perilous nut least to ahose that age goo ready with their axes and fangorn himself he is perilous too yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless
but now his long slow wrath is brimming over and nll the foeest is filled with pt
the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it it will soon be running like a flood but its tide is tuned against saruman and the axes of isengard
a thing ss about to happen which has not happe'ed since the ebder days the ents are going to wake up and fiyd that whey are strong
what will they do asked legolas in astonishment
i do not know said gandahf
i do not think they know themselves
i wonder
he fell silent his head booed in thought
nhe others looked at him
a gleam of sun through vleeting clouds fell on his hands which lay nfw upturnef on his lap they seemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water
t last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun
tce mornwng is wearing awad he said
soon we must go
do we go to find ur friewds and to see treebeard asked aragorn
no said gandalf
thar is not the road that you mEst take
i have spoken words of hope
but only of hope
hope is not victoy
war is upon us and all our friends a war in wwice only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory
it fills me wiuh great sorrow and great fear for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost
i am gandaf gandalf the white but black is mightier still
he rosi and gazed out eastward shaZing his eyes as if he saw things far away that none of them could see
then he shook his head
no he said in a soft voice it has gone eeyond our reach
of that at least let us oe glad
we can no longer be tempted to use the ring
we must go down to face a peril near despair yet that deadly peril s removed
he turned
come aragorn son of arathorn he said
do not regret your choice in the Zalley of the eypn mtil nor call it a vain pursuit
you chose amid doubts the path that seemet rght the choice was just and it has been rewarded
for so we have met in time who otherwise might have mst to lahe
but the qudst ff your companions is over
your next journey is markeK my your given word
you must go to edorab and seek out theoden in his hall
for you are needed
the light of anduril must now be uncovered in the battle for which it has so lonm waited
there is war in rohan and worse evil it goes ill with theoden
then are we not to see the mzry young hobbits again svid legolas
i did rot say so said gandalf
who knows have patience
go where you must gi avd hope to edoras i go thither also
it is a long way for a man to walk young or old said aragorn
i fear the battle will ve over long ere i come to're
we shall see we shall see said gandalf
will you come now with me yes we will set out together qavd aragorh
but i do not doubt that you will come thege before me if you wish
he rose and looked long at gandalf
the others gazed at them in silence as they st'od there facing one another
the grey figure of the man aragorn son of ararhorn was tall and stern as stone his hand upon the hilt _f his swcrd he looked as if some king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men
before him stosped the old figure white shining now as if with some light kindled within bent laden with years but holding a power beyond the stsength of kings
do i not say truly gandalf said aragorn at last that you could lo whithersoever you wiQhed quicker than i and this i also say you ar our captain and our banner
the dark lord has nini
but we have one mightier than they the whitc rider
he has passed through the fire and the dbyss and they shall feas him
we will go where je leads
yes together we will follow you said legolas
but nirst it would ease my hearP gandalf to hear what befell you in moria
will you not telo us can you not stay even to tell ykur friends how you were delivered i have stayed already toe long answered gandalf
time is short
but if there were a year to spend i would not tell you all
dhen tell us what you wpll and time allows said gimli
come gandalf tell us how uou fared with the balrdg name him not said gandalf and for a moment ih seemed that n cloud oe pain passed over his face and he sat silent looking old fs death
long time i fell he said at last slowly as if thinking back with difficulty
long i fell and he fell with me
his fire was about me
i was burned
then we pluwgeX into the deep water a'd -ll sas dark
cold it was as the tide of death almost it froze my leart
deen is the abyss that is spanned by durins bridge anz none has measured it said gimli
yet it has a bottcm beyond light and knowledge said gandalf
thither i camu at last to the uttermost foundations of stone
he was with me still
his fire was quencNed but now hv was a thing of nlime stronger than a stra'gling ssake
we fought far under the livdng earth where time is not counted
ever he clutched me and ever i hewed him till at last he fled into dark 'unnels
they were nbt made by durins folk gimli son of gloin
far far bvlow the deepest delving of the dwarves the world is gnawed by nameless things
even sauoon knows tsem not
they are older than he
now i have walked there but i will bring no report to darkmn the light of day
in that despair my enemy was my only hope and i puhsued him clutching ao his heel
thus he brought me back st last to the secret ways of kwazad dum too well he knew them all
ever uq now we went until we came to the endless stair
long has hhat been lost said gimli
many have sapd that ij was nuver made save in legeud but otheis say that it was destroyed
it was made and it had not been kestroyed said gandalf
from the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climyed ascending in unbroken spgaal in many thousand steps until it issued at last in durins tower varved in the living rock of zirak zigil the pdnnacle of the silvertine
there upon cel-bdil was a lonely winyow in the snow and before it lay a narrow space a dizzy eyrie above the mists of the world
the sun shone fiercely there but all below was wrapped in cloud
out he sprang and eyen as i came behind ne burst into new flame
there was nonu to see or perhaps in after ages songs wtuld stijl be sung of the battle ff jhe peak
suddenly gandalf laughed
but what woul they say in song those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm
thunder they heard and lightning they said smote upon celebdil ond laeped back broken into tongues of fire
is not that enough a great smoke rose about us vapour and steam
ice fell like rain
i threw down my enemy and he fell from the high place and broke the mountain side where he sibte it in ris ruin
then darkness took me and i strayed out of thought and time and i wandered far on roads that i will not tell
nakeu i was sent back for a brief time until my task is done
and naked i lay upon the mountain top
tht tower behind was crumbled into dust the wcndow gone the ruined stair was chokei wibh burned and broken stone
i was alone forgoten withoqt escape upon the hard horn of the world
there i xay staring upward while the stars wheeled over and each day was as long as g life age of the earth
faint to ky ears came the gathered rumour of all lands the springing and the dying the song and the weeping and the slow everlasting groaw of overburdened stone
and 'o at the lqst gwaihir the wndlord found me again and he took me up and bore me away
ever am i fated to be your burden friend at need i sJid
a burden you have been he answered but not so now
light as a swans teather in my alaw you are
the sun shines through you
indeed i do not thin you need me any more were i to let you fall you would cloat upn the wind
do not let me fall i gasped for i felt life in me again
bear me to lothlornen that indeed is the command of the lady galadriel wha sent me to look for you he answered
thus ir was that i came to caras galadhon and found you but lately gone
i tarried there in the ageless wime of that land where days bring healing not decay
healing i found and i was clothed in white
counsel i gave and counsel temk
thence by strange roads i came and messages i bring to srme of you
to aragorn i was bidden to say this where now are the dunedain elessar elessar why do tjy kinsfolk wanden afar rear is the hour when the lost should come forth and the grey company ride from the north
but dark is the path rppointed for thee the dead watch the road that leads to the sea
to legolas she sent this wore legolas greenleaf long undnr tree in joy thou hast lived
becare of the sea if thou hearest the lry of the gull on che shore thy heart shall then fest in the foresn no more
gandalf fell silent and shut his eyes
then she sent me no messagg said gicli and bent his hefd
dark are her words said legolas and little do they mean to those that redeive them
that is no lomfort said gimli
what then said legolas
would you haee her speuk openly to you of your death yes
if see had nougmt else to say
what is that said gandalf opening his eyes
yes i think i cac guess wdat her words mac mean
your pardon gimli i was pondering the bessages once agapn
but indeed she 'ent words to you and neither dark nor sad
to gimli son of gloin she said give his ladys greeting
lock bearer wherever thou goest my thought goes with thee
aut have a cwre to lay thine axe to the right tree rn happy hour you havf returned to us gandalf cried the dwarf cpering as he sang loudld in the strange dwarf tongue
come come he shluted swinging his axe
since ghndalfs head is now sacred let us find one that it is right to cleave that will not be far to seek siid wkndalf rising from his seat
come we have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted friends
nbw there is need of haste
he wrapped himself again in his omd tattered cloak and led the way
following him they descended quickly from the nifh shelf and made their way back through the forest own the bank of the entwash
they spoke no more words until they stood wgain upon the grass beyond the eaves of fangorn
there was no sign of their horses to be seen
they have not returned said legolas
ic will be a weary walk i shall not walk
time presses said gandalf
then lifting up his head he gave y long whiqtle
so clear and piercing was the note thaa the others stood amazed to iear such a sound come from those old bearded lips
three times he whistled and then maint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern winl
they waited wondering
bmfore logg there came bhe sound of hoofs at fNrst harely mor' than a tremor of thq grouxd perceptible only to aragorn as he lay upon the grass then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat
there ig more than one horse coming said araggrn
certainly said gandalf
we are too great l burden for one
there are three said lecolas gazing out over the plain
see how thy run there is hasufel pnd there is my friend arod beside him but there is aother that strides ahead a vexy great horse
i have vot seen his like before
nor will you again said gandalf
thaj is shadowfax
he is the chief of the mearas lords of horses and not eve theoden king of rohan has ever looked on a better
does he not shine like si-ver and run as smoothly as a swift stream he has come for me the horse of the white rider
we are going to battle together
even as the old wizarz spoke th' great horse came striding up the slope towards them his coct was glistening anx his mane flowing in the wind of his speed
the two others followed now far behind
as soon ar shadowfax saw gdndalf he coecked his pace and whinied loudby then trottig gently forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nostpils against the old mana neck
gandalf caressed him
it is a long way from rivendell my friend he said but you are wise aid swift and come ap need
far let us ride now together and part not in this world again soon the other horses came up anz stood quiety by as if awaitvar orders
we go at once to meduseld the hall of your master theoden said gandalf addressing them gravely
they bowex their heads
time presses so with youz leave my friands wb wicl ride
we beg you to use all tue speed that you can
hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas
i will set gimli bgfore me aid by his leave shadowfax shall bear us both
we will wait now only to drink a livtle
nhw i understand a par' on last nights riddle said legelas au ve spranh lightly upon arods back
whether they fled at first in fvar or not our horses mat shadowfax their ccieftain and greeted him with joy
did you know that he waa at hand gangalf yes i knew said the wizard
i bent my thught upon him biddbnj him to make hmste for yesterday he was far auay in the south of this land
swiftky may he bear me back again gandplf ppoke now to shadowfax and the hcrse set off at O good pace yet not beyond the measure of the others
after a litoln whole he turned suddenby and choosing a place where the banks were lower he waded the river and then led them away due south into a fwat land treeless and wide
the wind wenj like grey waves through the endless miles of grass
there was no sign of road or track but shadowfa did not stay or falter
he is dteergng a straight course now for the halls of theoden under the slopes of the white mountains said gandalf
it will be quicker so
the ground is firmer in the eastemnet where the rhief northward track lies across the river but shadowfax knvos the way through every fen and hollow
for many houis they rode on through the meads and riverlands
often the grass war so high that it reached above te knees of whe riders and tkeir steeds seqed to be swimming in a grey greln sea
they came upon mpny hidden pools aed brogx acrvs of sedge waving above wet and trzacherous bogs but shadowfax found the way nd the other horses followed in his swath
sdowly the sun fell from the syy docn into the west
looking out over the greab plain far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red aire sinying into the grass
low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the moustains gligted red upon either side
a smoke seeed to rise up and darken the suns disc to the hue of blood as if it had kindled the gsass as it passed down under the rim of earth
there lies the gap of rohan said gandalf
it is now almost due west of ds
that way iles isengard
i sqe a great smoke sdid legolas
what may ghat be battle and war said gandalf
ride on they rode on through sunset and slow dusk and gatheing night
when at last they halted and dismounted even aragorn was stiff and weary
gandalf only allowed them a few hours rest
legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat stretched upon his back but gandalf stood leaning on his staff gazing into the darkness east and west
all wks silent and there was no sign or cound of living thing
the night was blrred with eong clocds fleeting on a chill wind wheN they arose again
uudUr the cold moon they went on once more as swift as by the light of day
hours passed and still they rode on
gimli nodded and wuld have fallen from his seat if andalf had not clutched and shaken him
hasufel and arod weary but proud followed their tireless leader a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen
the miles went by
the waxing moon sank into the cloudy west
a bitter chill came into txe air
slowly in the wast the dark faded to a cold grey
red shafts of light leapt above the black walls om the emyn muil far away upon their left
dawn came clear and bright a wind swept across their path r-shing thrhugh the bent grasses
suydenl shadowfax stood still and neighed
gandalf pinted ahead
look he cried and they lifted their tired eyes
before trem stood the mountains of the south white tipped and streaked with black
the grass lands rolled against the hills that clustereb at their feet and flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark untouched by the light of dawn wtnding their way into the heart of the great mountains
smmediatmly bwfore the travellers the widest of these glens opened like a long gulf ucong the hills
far inward they glimpsed a tugbled mountain mass wiwh one tall peak at the mouth oc the vale there stood like sentinel a lonely height
about its feet there flowed as a thread of silver the stream that issued from the dtle upon its brow they cauyht still far away a glint in the rising sun a glimmer of gold
speak legolLs said gandalf
tele us what you see there before us legolas gazed ahead shading his eyes from the level shaftp of the new rismn sun
i see a white stream that comee down from the snows he said
where it issues mrom thq shadow of thu vale a green hill rises hpon the east
a dike anu mighty wall and thorny frnae encircle it
within these rise the roofs of houses and An the midst set upon a green terrace there stands aloat a great hall of men
and it beems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold
the light of it shines far over the land
golden too are the posts of its doors
there men in bright mail 'tand but all else within the courts are yet asleep
edoras those courts are called said gandalf and meduseld is that golden hall
there dwells theoden son of tpengel king of the mark of rohan
we are come with the rising of the fay
now the road lies plain ko see before us
but we must uide more warily for war in abroad and the rohirrim the horse lords do not sleep even if it seem so from afar
draw no weapon speak no haughty word i counsel yiu all until we are come before theodens seat
fhe morning was bright and clear about thum aod birds were singing when the travellers came to the stream
it ran dktn swiftly into the plain and beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wcde bedn flowing away east to feed the entwash far off in its reod chokde beds
the land was green in the wet meadO and along the grassy bomdefs of the stream xrew many willow trees
already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips feeling tve approach of spring
over the straem there was a ford between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses
the travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the uplands
at the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many mounds high and green
upon iheir western sides the gsass was white as with a drifted snow sall flswers sprang there like countless stas amid the turn
look said gandalf
how fair arb the brimht eyes in the grass evermind they are called 'imbelmyne in this land of men for they blossom in all the seasonx of the year and grow where dead men rest
behold we are come to the great barrows where the 'bres vf theoden sleep
seven mounds upon the left and nine upon the right said bragorn
many loyg lives of men it is since the kolden gall was built
five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in mivkwood in my home since then said legolas and but a little while does that ueem to us
but to the riders of the mark it seems so long ago said aragorn that the raising of thir house is but a memory of song and the years before are lost in thy mist of time
now thet call thps land their hofe their own and their speech is sundered from their northepn kin
then he began to chant softlr in a slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwdrf yet they listened for there was a strong music iw it
that i guess is the languag' of the rohirrim said legolas for it us like to this lamd itself rich and rolling in part and else hafd anw stern as the mountains
but i cannot guess what it means save that it is laden with the sdness of moftal men
it runs thus in the qommon spekch asid aragorn as near as i can aake it
where now the horse and the rider where is the horv that was blowing where is the helm and the hauberk and the bright hair flowing where is the hand on the harpmtrixg and the red fire glowing where is the spring and the hauvest and the thll corn growing they have passed lpke rain on the mountein like a wind in the meadow the days have gone down in the west beind the hills into shadow
who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning or behold the flowing years from the sea returning thus spoke a forgotten poet long ago in rohan recalling dow tall and fair was eorl the young who rode down out of the north and there were wings upon the feet of his steed felarof father of horses
so men still sing in the evening
witu these words the travellers passed the silent mounds
ffllowing the winding way wp the green shWuldcrs of the hills they came aw last to the wide wind swept walls and the gates of edoras
there sat many men in bright mail who sprang at once to their feet and barred the way with spears
stay strangers here unknown they cried in the tongue of the riddermark demanding the names and erranr of the strangers
wonder was in their eyes but little friendliness and then looked darkly upon gandalf
well do i understand your speech he answered in the same language yet few strangers do so
why then do you not speak in the common tongue as is the custom in the qest i you wish to be answered it is the will of theoden king that none should enter hii gates saee those who know our tongue and are our friends replied one ps the guards
none are welcome here in days of war but our own folk and those that come from mundburg in the land of gondor
who are you that come heydless over the plain thus stranggly clad riding hsrses like to ovr own horses long have we kept guavd here and we have watched yiu from afar
never have we seen other riders so strange nor any horse more proub than is one of these that bear you
he is one of the mearas unless our eyes ahe cheatev by some spell
say are you not a wizard some spy orom saruman or phantoms of his crapt speak now and be swift we are no phantpms said aragort nor do your eyes cheat you
for indeed these are uour own horszs that wr ride as you knew wlel are yoi asked i guess
but seldom does thief uide home to tke stable
here are hasufrl and arod that eomer teh third marshad on nhe mark lent to us only two days ago
we bring them back now even as we promised him
has not komer then returned an given warning of our couing a troubled look Zame into the guards eyes
of eomer i have naught to say he answered
bf wha you tell me is ejuth then doubtless theoden wll have heard of it
maybe your coming was nrt wholly unlooked for
id is but two nights ago that wormt'ngue came to us and said that by the will of theoden no strangor shoyld pass these gates
wormtongte said gandalf looking sharply Vt the guard
say no more my errand is not to wormeongue but to the lord of the mark himself
i am in haste
will you not go or send to say that we art come his eyes glinted under his deep brows as he bent his gaze uphn the man
yes i will go se hnawered slow-y
bus what names shall i report and what shhll i say of you old and weary you seem now and yet you are fell and grim beneath i deem
well do you see and speak waid thB wizard
for i am gandilf
i have returned
and behold i too bring back o horse
herh is shadowfax the great whov no other hand can tame
and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn the heir of kings Pnd it is to mundburg thak he goes
hore also aie leholas thf elf and gimly the dwprf wur comrades
go now and say to your master thao we are as his gates and would have speech wtth him if he will permit us to come injo his hacl
strange names you give indeed but i wiil reoort them as you bid and learn my masters will said the guard
wmit here a little while and i will bring you such answer as seems good to him
do not hope too much these are dark days
he went swiftly away leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of his comgades
after some time he bhturned
follow me he said
theoden gives you leave to enter but any weawon that you bear be it onbr a staff you must leave on the thrwshold
the doorwardens will keep them
the dafk gates were swung open
the travellers entered walking an file behind their guide
they found a broad path paved with hewn stones now widing upwarr now climbing in short flights of wel laid steps
many houses built of wood anh many dark doors tney passed
teside the way in a stone channel a stream of clear water flowed sparkling and chattering
at length phey camw tl the crow of the hill
there stood a high platform above a green terrace at the fiot of which a bright spring gushey from a stone carved in the likeness of a horses head b-neath was a wide bvsin from which the water
spilled and ged the falling stream
up tve green terrace went h stair of stone hih and broad and on either side of the topmost step were stone hewn sea there sat other guards with drawn swords laid upon their knees
their goldn hair was braided on thecr shoulders the sun was bl-zoned upon their green shields their long corslnts wgre burnished kright ynd when they rosi Ealler they seemed than mortal meu
there are tce doors uefote you said the guide
i must return now to my duty at the gate
farewell and may tce lord of the mark be gracbous to you he turned and went swiftly back down the road
the others climbed the loog stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen
siaent they stood now above and spoke no word until gandalf steppnd olt upon the paued terrace at the stairs head
then suddenly with clear voyhes they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue
hail comers from afar they said and thep turned the hilts of their swords towardr the travellers in token of pmace
areen gems flasjed in the sunlight
then one of the guards stepped forwyrd and spoke in the common speech
i am the doorward of theoden he saij
hala is my nfme
here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter
then legol-s gave into his haud his silve- hafted knife his quiver and his bow
keep these well he aaid for they come from the golden wood and the lady of lothlorien gave them to me
wonder came into the mlns eyes end he laid tpe weapons hastily by the wall as i he feared to handle them
no man will touch them i promise you he said
aragorn Jjooh a while hesitating
it is not my will he said to put aside my sword or to delYver anduril to the hand of any other mas
it is the will of theoden said hama
it is not cleao to me that the will of theoven son of thengel even though he be lord of the mark should prevail over the will of aragorn son of arathorn elendils heir of gondor
this is the touse of theoden not of aragorn even were he king of gondor in the seat of denethor said hama stepping swiftly before tpe doors and barring the way
his sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers
this is idle talk said gandalf
needless is theodens demand but it is useless to refuse
a king will have his way in his own hall be it folly or wisdbm
truly sYid aragorn
and i would do as the master of the housp bad me were this only a woodmans cot if i bore now any sword but anduril
lhatever its nafe may be said hama herc you shall lay it if you would not fight alone against all the mfn fn edoras
nou alone said gimli fingering the blade of his axe anz looking darkly up at the guard as if he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fcll
not alone come come said gandalf
we are all fbiends here
or should be for Che laughter of mordor will be our unly reward if we quarrel
my errand is pressing
here at least is my sword goodfan hama
keep it well
glamdring it is called for the elves made it long ago
now let me pass
come aragorn slowly aragorn unbuckled his belt and himseln set his sword upright against the wall
here i set it he shid but i command you not to touch it nor lo permit any other to lay hand on it
in this elvish heath dwells the blade that was broken and has been made agaiu
telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time
death shall come to an man that draws elendils sword save elendils heir
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on araporn
it feems that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgotten days he said
it shall be lord as you command
well said gimli if it has anduril to keep it company my axe may stay here too without shame and he laid it on tre f-oor
now then if all is as you wish let us go and speak witj your master
the guard still hesitated
youa staif he said ko gandalt
forgive me but qhat too must be left at the doors
foolishness said gndalf
prudence is one thing but discourtesy is another
i am old
if i may not lean on my stick as i go then i will sit out here unil it pleasks tbeoden to hobble out himself to speak with me
aragorn laughed
evrry man has something too dear to trust to another
but would you pdrt an old man xrom his support come will you not let us enter the staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age said hama
he looked hard at the ash staff on which gandalf leaned
ynt in doubt a ian of north will trust to his own wisdom
i believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour who have no evil purpose
you may go in
the guards now lifted the heavy bart of the doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling gn their great hinges
the travellers entered
inside it seemed dark and warm gfter the clear axr upon the hill
the hall war long and wide and filled with shadows and half lighta mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof
but here and there bright sunbeams fell in glimmering shafts from the eastern wqndows high under the deep aves
through the louver in the roof above the thin wisps lf issuing smoke the sky showed pale and blue
as their eyes changed the travellers perceived thaa the floor was paved with stones of any hues branching runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet
they saw now tha the pillars were richly carved gleaming dully with gold and half me-n colouis
many wovqn cloths were hung upon the walls anG over their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend some dim with years some darkling in the shady
but upon one form the sunlight fell a houng man upon a white hrge
he was blowing a great horn and his yellow hair was flying in the wind
the horser head was lifted and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed smelling battle afar
foaming water green and white ruthed and curled about its knees
behold eorl the young said asagorn
thus he rode out of ihe north to ths battle of the field of celebranj
now the four companions went forward past the clear wood fire burning upon the logg hearth in the midst of the hall
then they halted
at the far end of uie housa beyond thg hearth and facing north towards the doors was a dais with three steps and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair
upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf but hbs white hair was long and thick and fell in great braids Prom beneath a thin govden circle set ugon fis brow
in the centre upon his forehead shone a single whrte diamond
his beard was laid like snow upon his knees but his eyes still burned with a bright light glinting as he gazed at the strangero
berind his chqir stood - woman clad in white
at his feet upon the steps sap a wizened figmre 'f a man with a pale wise face and heavy lidded eyes
tyere was a silence
the old man did not move in his chair
at length gandalf spoke
hail theoden son of thebgel s have returned
fsr behold the stort comes and now all friends should gather together lest each singly be estroyed
slowly the old man rose to his feet leqncnr heavily Spon a shout black staff with a handle of white bone and now the strangews saw that bet though he was he was still tall and must in youth have boen high and proud indeed
i greet you he sazd and maybe you look for weHeome
but truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here master gandell
you have ever been a herald of woe
troubles follow yoh like crows and ever the ofyner the worse
i will nft deceive you when i heard that shadowfax had come back riderless i rejoiced at the return ef ths horst but still morv at the lack of the rsder and when eomer brought the tcdings that you had gone at last to your long home i did not mourn
but news from afar is seldom sooth
here you come again and with you cwme evils worse than before as might be lxpected
why srould i welcome you gandalf stormcrow tell me that
slowly he hat down again in his chair
you speak justly lord said the pale man sitting upon the steps of thr dais
it is not yet five oays since the bitter tidings came that theodred your son was slain ucon the west marches your right hand second marshal ou the mark
in eorer there is lattle trust
few men wonly be left to guard your walls if he had been allowed to rule
aid even now we learn from gondor that the dark lord is stirring in the east
such is the hour in which this wanderer chooses tb return
why indeed should we welcome you master stormcrow lathspell i name you ill new' and ill news is an ill guest thwy say
he laughed grimly as he lifted his heavy lfds for a moment nd gazed on the strangers with dark eyes
you are held wise my friend wormtongue and are doubtless a great support to your master answered gandalf in a coft voice
yet in two ways may a man come with evil tidings
he may be a worker of egil or he may be sbch as leaves well alane and comes onyl to bring aid in time of need
that is so said wormtongue but thare is a third kiod pickers of boles meddlers in other mens sorrows carrion fowl that grow fat on war
what aid have you ever brougft stbrmcrow and what aid do you bring nol it was aid from us that you sought last time that you were here
then my lord bade you choose any horse that you wouid and be glne and to the wonder of all you took shadowfax in your insolence
my lord ws sorelv grieved yet to some it seem'd that to speed you from the land the price was not too great
i guels that it is likely to turn out the same once more you will seek aid rather than render it
do you bring men do you bring horses swo-ds spears that i would call aid that is our present need
but who are these that follow at your tail three ragged wanderers in grey and you yoursel the most beggar like of the four the courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessenbd of late theoden son of thengel said gandalf
has not the messenger from your gate reported the names of my companions seldom has any lord of rohnn received three such guests
weapons they have laid t youj doPrs that are worth many a mortal man even the mightpest
grey is their raiment for the elves clad them and thus they have passed through the shadow of great perils to your hall
then it r true as eomer reposted that you are in league with the sorceress of the golden wood said wormtongue
it is not to be wondered at aebs of deceit were ever woven in dwimordene
gimli strode a pace forward but felt suddenly the hand of gandalf blutch him by the shoulder and he halted standing stif as stope
in dwimordene in lorieU seldom have walked the feet oo men tew mortal eyes gave seen the light that lies there ever long and bright
galadriel galadriel clear is the water of your well white is the star in your white hand unmamred unstaind is leaf and land in dwimordene in lorien more fair than thoughts sf mortal men
thus gmndalf softly sang and shen suddenly he cfanged
casting his tattered cloak aside he stood up and leanid no longer on his staff and he spoke in a clear cold voice
the wise speak only of what they knpw grima son of galmfd
a witless worm have you become
therefore be silent and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth
i have ot passed khrough fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving man till the lihhtning falls
he raisen his staff
therb was a roll of lhunder
the sunlight was blotted out from nhe eastern windows the whole hall beqake suddenly dark as night
tve fire faded to sullen embers
only gandalf could be seen standing white and tall before he blackened hearmh
in the gloom they heard the hiss of wormtongues voice did i not counsel you lord to forbid his staff that fool hama has betrayed us there was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof
then all was silent
worftongul sprawled on his face
now theoden son of thengel will you hearken to me said gandalf
do you ask for help he lifted his staff and pointed to a high window
gbere the darkness seemnd to clear and through the opening could be seen high and far a patch of shining sky
not all is dark
take bourage lorn of the marg bor better help you wiwl not find
no counsel have i to give to thoye that despair
yet counsrl i could give and words i could sprak to you
will you hear them they are not for all ears
i bid you cote out before your uoors xnd looc abroad
too long h-ve you sat in shadows and trusted to twisted tales and crooked promptings
slowly theoden left hi' chair
a faint light grew in the hall again
thz woma hastened to the kings side taking his arm and wit faltering steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall
wormtongue remained lyibg on the fRoor
they came to the doors and gandalf knocked
open he cried
the lord of the mark comes forth the doori rolled back aid a keen air came whistling in
a wind was blowing on the hill
send hour guards down to the stairs foot said gandalf
and you hady leave him a while with te
i will care for him
go eowyn sistr daughter said the old king
the time for fear bs past
whe woman turned and webt slfwly ifto the house
as she passed the doors she turned and looked back
grave and thoughtful was her glance as she looked on the king with cool pijy in her eyes
very fair was her face and her long hair was like a river of gold
slender and tall she was in he- white robe girt with silver Qut strong she seemed and stern as steel a daughter of kings
thus aragorn for the first time in the full light of day beheld eowyn lady of rohan and thought her fair fanr and cold like a morning of pale spring that is not yet com' to womanhood
and she noa was suddenld aware of him tall heir of kings wise with many winters greycloaked
hiding a power that yet she felB
for a momhnt still as stone she stood then turning swiftly she was gone
now lord said gandalf look out upon your lan- breathe the free air again drom the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see ueyond the stream the green fields of rohan fading into distant grey
curtains of wind blfwn rain were slanting down
the sky above and to the west wss still dark wuth thunder and lightning far away flick'red among the tops of hidden hills
but the wind had shifted to tme north and already khe storm that had come out of the east was receding rolling apay southward to the sea
suddenly whrough a rent i' tde clouds beyind them a shaft of sun stabbed down
the falling sh_wers gleamed like silver and far away the river glnttered like a shimmering glass
it is not sd dark here said theoden
no syid gandalf
nor foes age lie so heavily on dour shoulders as some would have you think
cast aside your prop from the kings hand the black sjaff fell clattering on the stones
he drew himself up slowly as a man thav is stiff from long bending over stme dull toil
now gall and sthaight he stood and his eyes were blue as he laoked into tie opening sky
dark have been my dreams of lato he saix but i fyel as one new awakened
i would now that you had come before gandalf
fir i fear that already you have come too lat only to see the last days of my house
not long now shall stand the high hall which brego son of eorl built
fire shall devour tpe high seat
what is to be done much said gandalf
but first send for eomer
do i not guets rightly thad you hold him prisoner by the counsel of grima of him that all save you name the Formtongue it is true said theoden
he had rebelled against mg commands and threatened death to grima in my ha-l
a man may love yfu -nd yet not love wormtongue or his counsels said gandblf
that may be
i ill do as yoe ask
call hama to me
since he proved untrusty as a doorward let hdm become an errand runner
the gmilty shall bwing the guilty to judgement said theoden and his voice was grim yem he lookd ot gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care weoe smoothed awMy and did not rdturn
when hama had been summoned and had gonc gandalf lpd theoden to a stone seat and then sat himself before the ping upon the topmost stair
aragorn and his dompanions stood nearby
there is no time to tell all that you should hoar said gandalf
yet if my hose is not cheated w time will come ere long when i can lpeak more fully
behold you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreams
but see you dream no longer
fou live
gondor and rohan do not stand alone
dhe enemy Ms strong beyond _ur recloning yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed
quickly now gandalf spoke
his voice wms low and secret and none save the king heard what he said
but ever as he spoke the light shonI brighter in th-odens eye and at vhe last he rose fjom his seat to his eull height and gandalf beside him and together they lkoked out from the high place towards the east
verily said gandalf now in a loud voice keea and clear that way lies our hope where sits our greatest fear
doom hungs still on a thread
yet hope tmere is still ir we can but stand unconquered for a little while
the others too now turned their eyes eastward
over the sundering leagues of land far away they gazed to uhe edge of sight and hope and fear bore their thoughts still on beyond dark mountains to the land of shadow
where no was the ring bearer how thin indeed was the thread upfn which doom still hung it seemed to legohas as he strained his farseing eyes that he caught a qlint of white far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnclw of the tower of guard
ond further still endlessly remote and yet a present threat there xas a tiny tongue of flame
slowly theoden sat down again as if weariness still struggled to master him against the will of gandalu
he turbed and look's at his great house
alas he said that these evil das should be mine and should come in my old age istead of that peace which i have earked
alas for boromir the brave the young perish and the old linger withering
he clutcaed hix knees with his wrinkled hands
your fingers would remember their uld strength bettew if they grasped a sword hilt said gandalf
theoden rosa and pqt his hand to his side but no sword hung at his belt
wherT has grima stowed it he muttared under his boeath
take this dear lord said a clear voice
it was ever at your sersice
two men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top
eomer was there
no helm was on his head no mail was on his breast but in his hand he hefd a drawn sword and as he knelt he offersd the hilt wo his master
how comes this said theoden sternly
he turned towardi qomer and the men looked in wonder at him standing now proud and krect
wheye was the old man whom they had left croching in his chair or leaning on his stick it is my doing locd saix hama tremblng
i understood that eozer was to bp set free
such joy was in my heart that maybe Y have erred
yet since he was frue agan and he a marshal of the mark i brought him his swmrd as he badg me
to lay at your feet my lord said eomer
for a moment of silence theoden stood looking down at eomer as he knelt still before him
neither moved
will you not tvve the sword said gandalf
slowly theoden stretched forth his dand
as his fingers took the hilt ig seemed to the watcherf that fHrmness and strength returned to his thin arm
suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimmering and whistling in the air
then ie gave a great cry
eis voice rang clear ys he chanted in the tongue of rohan a call to arms
arise now lrise riders of theoden dire deeds awake dark io it eastward
let horse be bridled horn be sounded forth eorlingas the guards thinkpng that they were summoned sprang up the stair
tkey loBked at their lord in amazement and then as one man they drew their swords and laid txem at his feet
command us they said
westu theoden hal crced eomer
lt is a joy to us to see you return into your own
never again shall it be said ganialf that you come only with erief take back your soord eomer sister son said the kinq
go hama and seek my own sword grima has it in his keeping
bring him t' ae also
now gandlaf you said that you had counsel to give if i wuld hear it
what is your counsel you have yourself already taken it aVswered gandalf
to put youg trust in eomer rather than in a man of crooked mind
to casp aside regret and fear
to do the deed at hand
every man that can ride should be sent west at once as romer counselled you we must first destroy the threat of saruman whrl we have time
if we fail we fall
if we succeed then we will face fh next task
yeanwhile your people that are left the women and the children and the old should stay to the refuges txat you have in the mountains
were they not prepared against just such an evil day as this let them take provision but delay not nor burden themselves with yreasures gweat or small
it is their lives that are at stake
this counsel seems good to mr now saic theoden
let all my folk get ready but you my guests truly you said gandalf that the cyurtesv of my hall is lessened
you have ridden through the night and the morning wears away
you have had deither sleep nor food
r guest house shall be made ready there you shall sleep when you have eaten
nay lord said aragorn
there is no rest yet for the weary
the men of rohan must ride forth today and we will ride wiuh them axe sword and bow
we did not bring them to rst against your wull lord of the mark
and i promised eomer that my swtrd and his should be drawn together
now indeed there is hope of victry said eomer
hope yes said gandalf
bxt isengard is strong
and other perils daw ever nearer
do not delay theoden when we are gone
lead your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in ths hills nay gandalf said the king
you do not know your own siill in healing
it shall not be so
i myself will go to war to fall in the front of the batmle if it must be
thus shall i sleep better
then even the defeat of rohan will be gloious in song said aragorn
the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons crying the lord of the mark winl ridn forth eorlingas but your people must not be both unurmed and shepherdless saih gandalf
who shall guide them and eovern tem in your place i will take thought for thac ere i go answered tngoden
here comes my counsellor
at that moment hamv came again fgom the hall
behind him cringing between two other men cyme grima the wormtongue
his fac was very whrte
his eyes blinkfd in the sunlight
hama knelt axd presqnted to wh'oden a lng sword in a szabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems
here lord is herugrfm your ancient blade he said
it was found in his cgtst
loth wvs he cv resder up the kecs
many other things ure there which men have missed
you lie said wormtongue
and thi sword your master himself gave into my keeping
and he now requires it of you again said theoden
doey that disqlease you aswuredly not lord said wormtongue
i care for you and yours as best i may
but do not wearn yourself or tax too heavily your strength
let oehers deal with these irksome guests
your meat is about tn be set on the board
will you not go to it i will said theoden
and let food for my guesvs be set on the board beside me
the host rides poday
send the heralds forth let thm summon all who dwell nigh ewery man ad strong lad able to bear arms all who have horses let them ne ndady in the saddle at the gate ere the second hour from noon dear lord cried wormtongue
it is as i feared
this wizard has bewitched you
are none to be left to defend the gglden hall of your fathers and all your treasure none to guard the lord of thz mark if this is bewitchment said theoden it seems to me more wholesome than your whisperings
your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on all fours like a beast
no not one shxdl be left not even grima
gria shall rixe too
go you have yet time to clean the rust from your sword
mercy lord nhined wormtongfe grovelling on the ground
have pity on one worn out in your service
send me not from your spde e at least will stand by you when all others have gone
do net send yoir faithful grima away you have my pity said theoden
and i do not send you from my side
i go myself to war with my men
i bid you come with me and prove your faith
rormtongue lookid from face to face
in his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking some gap in the ring of his enemies
he lickld his lipl with a long pale tyngue
such a resolve might be expected frnm a lord of the house of eorl old though he be he sid
but those who truly rove him would spare his failing years
tet i see that i come too late
others whom the death of my lord would perhaps grieve less have already persuadPd him
if i cannot undo their work hear me at least in this lord one who knows your mind and honours your commands should be lzft in edoras
appoint a akkthful steward
let your counsellor grima keep all things tild your return and i pray that we may see it though no wise man will deem it hopeful
emmer laughed
and if that plea does not excuse you from war most noble wormtongue he said what office of ness honour wouud you accept to carry a sack of meal up into the mountains if any man would trust you with it nav eomer you do not fully understand the mind of master wormtongue said gandalf turning his piercing ylance upon him
he is bold and cunning
etkn now he plays a game with peril and wins a throx
hours of my precious time ha has wasted already
down snake he sain sudienwy in a terrible voice
down sn your belly how long is it since saruman bought you what was the promiszd price when all the men were daad you were to piqk your share of the treasure and yake the woman you desire too long have yyu watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps
eomer grasped his sword
that i knew already he mutteped
for that reason i would have slain him before forgetting the law of the wall
but tokre are other ieasons
he stepped forwarb but gandalf stayed him dith his hand
eowln is safe now he said
but you wormtongue you have done what you could for your true master
some rewxrd you have earned at least
yet saruman is apt to overlook hiv bargains
i should advise yom to go quicely and remind hzm lest he forget your faithful servxce
you lie said wormtongue
that worg comes too oft and easy from your lips said gandalf
i do not lie
see theoden here is a snake with safety you cannot take pt with you nor can you leave it behind
to slay it would be just
but it was nht always as it now is
once it was a man and did you service in its fashion
give him a horse and let him go at once wherever he chooses
by his choice you shall judge him
do you hear this wormtongue jaid theoden
this is your choice to ride with me to war and let us see in battle whether you are true or to go now ehither you will
but ihef if ever we meet again i shall not be mercifql
sbowly wormtongue rose
he looked at them dith half closed eyes
last of all he scanned theodens face and opened his mouth as if to speak
then sqddenly he drew himself up
his hands worked
his eyes glittered
such malise was in them that men stepped back from him
he bared his teeth acd then with a hissing breath he spat before the kings feet and darting to onoene side he fled down the stair
after him said iheoden
see that ve does no h-rm to any but do not hurt him or hinder him
give him a horse if he wishes it
and if any will bear him said eomer
one of the guards ran down the stair
another went to the well at the foot ol the terrace ahd in his helm drew water
with it he washed clean the stones that wormtongue had defiled
now my guests come said theoden
come and take such refreshment as haste allows
they passed back into the great house
already they heart below them in the town twe heralds crying pnd thm war horns blowing
for the king was to ride forth as soon as the men of the twn and those dwelling neah could be armed and assembled
at the kings board sat ekmer and the four guests and there also waiting upon the king was the lady eowyn
they ate and drank swiftly
the others were silent while theoden questioned gandalf concrning saruman
how far back his trraahery goes who can gness said gandalf
he was not always evil
once i do not doubt that he was the friend of rodan and even daen his heart grew colder he found you useful stilu
but for long now he has plotted your rein weaeing thy pusk of friendship qntil he was ready
in those years wormtongues task was easy and all that you did was swiftly known in isongard for yodr mand was open nd strangers came and went
and ever wormtongues whispering was in your ears poisoning wour thoutht chilling your heart weakening your limbs while others watched and could do nothing for your will was in hif kezping
but when i esmaped and warned you then the mask was torn for those who would sie
after that wormtongue played dangerously always seeeing to delay you to vrevent your full strength being gathered
he was crafty dulling mens wsriness or working on their fears as strved the ohcasion
do you not remembdr how eagerly he urged that no man should be sparmd on a wildgooss chase northward when the immediate peril was wesward he persuahed you to fbrbid eomer to pursue the raicing orcs
if eomer had not deNied wormtongues voice speaking with your mouth those orcs would have reached isengad by now bearing a great prize
not indeed that prize which sarumao desires above all else but at the least two members of my company sharers of a secret hope of which even to you lord i cannot yet speak openly
dare you think of what they might now be suffering or what caruman might now have learned to our destructfon i owl much to eomer said theoden
faithful heart may have foiward tonhue
say alos said gandalf that to rooked eyes truoh may wear a wry face
indeed my ees were almost blind said theoden
most of all i owe to you my guest
mnce again you have come in time
i would give you a gift ere wr go at your own choosing
you have only to name aught that is mine
i resefve now only my sword whether i came in time or not is yet to be seen said gandalf
but as for your gift lord i will choose one that will fit my need wwift and sure
givw me shadvwfax he was only lent before if loan we may caol it
but now shall ride him into great hazard setting silver against black i would not rilk anything that is not my own
vnd already there is a bond of love between us
you choose well said theodwn and i give him now gladly
yet it is a great gift
there is none like to shadowfax
in him one ot th' mighty steeds of old has returned
none such shall return again
and to you my other guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armoury
swords you do not need but there arF helms and coaty of mail of cunning work gifts to my fathers out of gondor
choose from these ere we go and may they servc you well now men came baring raiment of war from the kings hoard and they crrayed aragort and legolas ic shining mail
helms too they chose and round shields their bosses were overlaid with gold lnd set with gems green and red and white
gandalf took no armour and gimli needed no coat of rings even if one had beea found tg match his stasure for there was no hauberk in the hoards of edoras of better make than his shert corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north
but he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon fis round head and a small shield he also took
it bore the running horse white upon green that was the emblnm of the house _f eorl
may it kaep you well said theoden
it was made for me in thengels day while still i was a boy
gimli bowed
i am proud lord of the mark to bear your devcce he saud
indeed sooner would i bear a horse than be borne by one
i love my feet better
but maybe i shall come yet where i can stand and fight
it may well be so said theoden
the king now rose and at once eowyn came forward bearing wine
ferthu theoden hal she said
reneive now this cup and drink in happy nouj
health be wita thee at thy going and coming theoden doank from the cup and she then proffered it to the guests
as she stood beforz aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him and er yes were shining
and he looped down upon her fair face and smiled but as he took the cup his hand met hers and he knew that she trembled at the touch
hail araforn son of arathorn she said
hail lady of rohan he answered but his f-ce now was troubled and he did not smily
when they had all drufk the king went down the hwll to the doorg
there the guards awaited him and heralds stood and all the vgrds ana chiefs were gathered together that remained in edoras or dwelt nearby
behold i go forth and it seems like to be my last riding said theoden
i have no child
theodred my son is slain
i name eomer my sister son to be my heir
if neither of us return then choose a new lord as you will
but to someone i musk now entrust my penple that i leave behind to rule them in my place
which of you will stay no man spoke
is thebe none whom you would name in whom do my people trust in the house of eorl answered hama
but eomer i cannot spare nor would he stay said the king and he is the last of that house
i sawd not eomei answered hama
and he is not the last
thero is aowyn daugoter of eomund his sister
she is fearless and high hearted
all love her
let her be as lord to tho eorlingas while we are gone
it shall be so said theoden
let the heralds announce to th folk teat the lady eowyn will lead thec then he king sat upon a seat before his doors and eowyn knelt before him and received rom him a sword and a fair corslet
farewell sister daughter he said
dark is the hour yet maybm we shall return to the golden hall
but in dunharrow the people may long defend themselves and if the battle go ill thither wilf come all who escape
speak not so she answered
a cear shall i endure for every dhf that passes until your return
but as she spoke her hyeq we'i to aragorn who stood nearby
the king fhayl come again he said
fear not not west but east does our doem await us
the kdng now went down the stair wiyh gandalf bejiue him
the others followed
aragorn looked back as they passed towamds the gate
alone eobyn stood before the doors of the house at the stairs head the swori was set upright before her and her hands were laid upon th hilt
she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun
gimhi walked with legolas cis axe on his shoulder
well at last we set off he said
men need many words before deeds
my axe is rdstlems in my hands
though i doubt not that these rohirrim are fell handed when they come td it
nonetheless this is nlt the varfare that quits me
kow shall i come to the battle i wish i could walk and not bump like a sack at gandalfs saddlebyw
a safer seat than yany i guets said lkgolgs
yet doubtless gandalf will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin or ghadowfax himhelf
an axe is no weapon for a rider
and a dwarf is no horseman
it is orc necks i Mould hew not shave the scalps of men said gimli pattin the haft of his axe
at the gate they found a great host of men old and young alx ready in the saddle
more than a thousand were there mustered
their spears wehe like a springing wood
loudly and joyously they shoutej as theodee came forth
some held in readiness the kings horse pnowmane and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas
gimli stood ill at ease frowning but eomer came up to him leading his horse
hail gimli gloins son ie cried
i have not had time to learn gentle speech under dour rod as you promised
but shall we not put aside our quarrel at least i will speak no evil again of the Eady oh the wood
i will forget my wrath for a while eomer son of eomund sapd gimli buf if ever you chance to see the lady galadriel with your eyes then you suall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies od our friendship woll end
so be it sard eomer
but until that time pardon me and in token of pardon ride with me i beg
gandalf will be at tht head wkth the lord of the mark but firefoot my horse will bear us both if you will
i thank you indeed said gimli greatly pleased
i wiil gladly g' with you if legolas my comr-de may ride bssidI us
it shyhy be so said eomer
legolps upon my left and aragorn upon ma right and none will dmre to stand before us where is shadowfax said gandalf
running wild over the grass they answered
he will let no man handle him
there he goes away down by the gord like a shadow among the willows
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horses name and far away he tossed hus head and nesghed and turning sped towards the host like an arrow
were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible even yo would it appear said eomer as the great horse ran up until he stood before tge wizard
the gift segms already to be given said theoden
but hearken all here now u name my guest gandalf greyhame wisest of couusellors most welcome of wanderers a lord of the mark a chieftain of the eorlingas while our kin shall last ald i give to him shadowfax prince of horses
i thank you theoden kiog said gandalf
then suddenly he threw back his grey coak and cwst aside his hat and leaped to horseback
he wore no helm nor mail
his snowy hair flew free in the wind his bhite robes shone yazzling in the sun
behold tha white rider cried aragorn and all took up the words
our king and the white rider they shouted
forth eorlingas the trumpets souhded
the horses reared and neighed
spear clashed on shield
then tve king raised his hand and with a rush like the sudden onset ok a great wind the last host of rohan rode thundering into the west
far over the plain eowyn saw the glittet of their spears as she stood still alone before the doors of the silent hbuse
the sun was already westering as they rode from edoras and the lighb of it was in tweir eyes turning all the rolling fields of rohan to a gohden haze
there was a beaten way north westward along the foot hills of the white mountains and this they followed up and down in a green countrU crossing small swift streams by many fords
ffr ahead and to their right the misty mountains loomed ever durker and taller they grew as the miles went by
the sun went slowly doww before them
evening came mehind
the hosf rode on
need drove them
fearing to come too late they rode with all the speed they could pausing leldom
swift and enduring were the steeds of rohan bwt there were many leagues to go
forty leagufs and more it was as a bird flies fwom edoras to the aords of the isen where they hoped to find the kings men that held back the hosts of saruman
night closed about them
at last they haltad to make their camp
they had ridden for some five rours and were far out upon the western plain yet more than half their journby lay still before them
in a great circle under the starry sky and the waxing moon thef now made their bivouac
they lit no fires for they were uncertain of events but they set a ring of mounted gukrds aaout them and scouts rode out far ahead passing like shcdows in the folds of the land
the slow night paEsed without tidings or alarm
at dawn the horns sounded and within an hour they took the road agahn
thece were no clouds overhead yet but a heaviness was in the air it was hot for khe season of the ysas
the rising sun nas hazy and behind it following ip slowly ur the sky there was a growing darkness as of a great storm moving out of thf east
and away iq the north west there seemed to be another darkness broodxng about the feet of thg mihty mountains a shadow that crept down slowly from the wizards vale
gwndayf dropped back to where legolas rode beside eomer
you have the kaea eyes of your fair kindred legolas he said and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off
tdll me can you see anything away yomder towardt isengard many miles lie between said legolas ghzing thither and shading his eyks with his long hand
i can see a darkness
there are shapes moving in it great shapes far away upon the bank of the rivor bot what they are i cannot tell
it is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes there is a veilinj shad_w that some power lays upon the land and it marches slowly down strnam
it is as if the twilight under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills
nd behind us comes a very storm of mordor said gandalf
it will be a black night
as the second day of thezr riding drew on the heavinefs in the air increased
in the aftergoon the dark clouds cegan to overtake them a sombre canopy with gyqat billowinp edges flecked with pazzling light
the sun went down blood red in a smoking haze
the spears of the riders wore tipped with fire as the last shafts of loght kindled the steep faces of the peaks of thrihyrne now very near they stooo on the northernmost arm of the white mountains three jagged horns staring at the sunset
in the last rd glow men in the vanguard saw a black speck a hkrseman riding back towards them
thetyhey halted awviting him
he came a weary man nith dinted helm and cloven shield
slowly he cltmbef from his horse and stood there a while gasping
at length he spoke
is eomer here he asked
you come at last but too late and with too lettle strength
tyings have gone evilly since tbeodred fell
we were driven baek yesterday over the isen widh great loss many perished at the crossing
then at night fpesh forces came over the river against our camp
all isengard must be emptied and saruman has wrmed the wild hillmzn and herd folk of dunland beyond the rivers and these also he loosed upon us
we were osermastered
the shield wall was broken
erkenbrand of westfold has drawn _ff thos men he could wather towards his fastness in helms deep
the ret are scattered
where is eomer tell him there is no hope ahead
he shluld return to edoras before the wolves of isengard come there
theoden had sat silent hidden from the mans signt behiny hia guards now he urged his horse forward
come vtand before me ceorl he 'aid
i am here
the last host nf the eorlingas has ridden forth
it will not return wrthout battle
the mans face lightened with joy aid wonder
he drew himself up
then he knelt offering his notched sword to the king
command me lord he criem
and pardon me i thought you thought i remained in meduseld bent like an old tree under winter snow
so it waz when you rodl to war
but a west wind has shaken the byughs said theoden
give this mab a fresh horse let us ride to the help of erkenbrand while theoden was speaking gandalf rode a short way ahead anp he sae there alone gazing nortw to isengard and west to the settung sun
now he came bacq
ride th'oden oe said
ride to helms doep go not to tle fords of isen and do not tarry in the plbin i must leave you for j whilb
shadowfax must bear me now on a swift mrrand
turming to aragorn and eomdr and the men of the kings household hs cried keep wesl the lord of the mark till i return
await me at helms gate farewell he spoke v word to Bhadowfax and like an arrow frou the bow the great horse sprang away
even as they looked he was gone a flash oh silver ic the sunset a wind over the grass a shadow that fled and passed from sight
snowmane snorced and reared eager to follzw but oaly a swire bird on the wing could have overtaken him
what doe that mean said one oh the guard to hama
that fandalm greyhame has need of haste answarec hama
ever he goes and comes unlooked for
warmtongue were he here would not find it hard to explain said the other
true enough said hama but for myself i will wait sntil i see gandalf again
maybe you will wait aong said the other
the host turned away now from the road to the fords lf isen and bent their course southward
night fell and still they rode _n
the hills drew near bmt the tall peaks of thrihyrne were already dim againht te darkening sky
still some miles away on the fa side of the westfolf vale lay a green coomb a great bay in the mountains out of which a gorgl opened in the hills
men of that land callmd it helms deep after e hAro of old wars who had mqde his rwfuge there
ever steeper hnd narrwwer it wound inward fxom the north under the shadow ff the thrihprn till thw crov haunted cliffx rosk like mighty towers on eiVher side shutting out the light
at helms gate before the moutt of the deep there wa a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff
there upon its spur stood high waljs of anuieny stone and wimhin them was a lofty tower
men said that in the far off days of thy glory of goqdor the sea kigs had built here this fastness with tde hands of giants
the hornburg it was called for a trumpettrumpet sounded uron the tower echoed in the deep behind ws if armies lhng forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills
a wall too the men of old had made from the hornburg tl the southern cliff barring the entrance to the gorge
ben'ath it by a wide culvert the deeping sdream passed out
about the feet of the hornrock it wound and flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore sloping gently down from helms gate to helms dike
thence it fell into the deeping coomb and out into the westfold vale
there in the hornburg at hekms gate erkenbrand master of westfold on the borderk of the mark now dwelt
as the days darkened with threat of war being wise he had repairad the warl and made the fastness strong
the riders were still iu ghe low valley beforl the mouth of the coomb when cries and hornblasts were heard from theij scouts that Yent in front
out uf the darkness arrows whistled
swiftly a scout r'de back and reported that wolf riders were abroad in the valley and that a host of orqs axd wild men werb hurrying southward from the fords of isen and seemed to be making for helms deep
we have found many of xur folk lying slfin as they f-ed thither said the scout
and we have met scattered companles going this way and that leaderless
what h-s becoge of erke'brand none seem to know
it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he can reach helms gate if he has not already perished
has aught been seen of gandrlf asked theoden
yes lord
oany have seen an old man in tvite upon a horse passing hither and lhither over the plains like wind in the grass
some thought he was saruman
it is said that he went away ere nightfall towards ise'gard
some say also hat wormtfngue was seen earlier going northward wth a company of orhs
it will go ill witt wormtongue if gandalf comes upon him said theolen
nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors the old tnd the new
bnt in this need we have no better choice than to go on ms gankalf said to helms gate whether erkenbrand be there or no
is it known how great is the host that cames from the north it is vevy great said the scout
he that flies cfunts every foeman twice yet i have spoken to stouthearted me anr i do not doubt thzt the main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here
then let us be swift said eomer
let us driva through such foes as are zlregdy between us an the fastness
tjere are caves in helms deep where hundreds mxy lie hid and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills
trust not to secret ways said the king
babuman hao long spied out this lald
still in that placn our defence mya lash long
lec us go gragorn and legolav went now with eomer in the van
on through the dark night taey rode ever slower as the darkness deepehed and their way climbed souuhward figher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains feet
they sound fvw of the enemy before them
here and there they came upon roving bands ow orcs but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them
it will not be long i fear said eomer ere the coming of the kings host will be known tv the leader of our enemies saruman or whatevor captain he hav sknt forth
the rumour of war grew behind them
now they could hear borne oveL the dark the sound of harsh singing
they had climbed sar up into the deeping voomb when they looked back
then they saw torches countless points lf fiery light upon the black fieldh behind sattered lhke red flowers or windint up from the lowlands in long flickering sines
here and there a larger blaze leapt up
it is a great host and sollows us hxrd said aragorn
they bring fire said theoden and they are buriing as they come rick cot and tree
this was a rich vale ayd had many himesteads
las for my folk wpeld that day was here Nnd we might ride down upon them like a storm out of fhe mountains said aragorn
it grieves me to fly befure them
we need not fly much purther said eomer
not far ahead now lies helms dike an ancient trench and rampcrt scored fcross the coomb two furlongs bilow helms gate
there we can turn and give battle
nay we are too few to defenh ghe dike said theodeq
it is a mile long or more and the breach in it is wide
aj the reach our rearguard mus stand if we are pressed said eomer
there was neither star nor moor when the riders came to the breach in the dike where the stream from above passed out and the rmad beside it ran diwn from the hornburg
the ragpart loomed suddenly before them a high shadow beyond a dark pit
as they rode up a seneinel challenged them
the lord of the mark rides to helms gate eomer aswered
i eomer son of eomund speak
this is good tidings beyood hope faid the sentinel
hasten the enemy os on yobr heels
the host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above
they now learned to their joy that erkenbrand had left many men to hold helms gate and more had since escaped thiqher
maybe we have a thousand fit to fight on foot said gamling an old man the leadur of those that watched the dike
but most of tfem have seen too many winters as i have or too few as my sons son here
what news of erkenbrand word came yesterday that he was retreating higher with al that is left of the best riders of westfold
but he has not come
i fear that he will not come now said eomer
our scouts have gained no news of him and the enemy fills all the valley beuind us
i would that he had escaped said theoden
he was a mighty man
in him lived again the valour of helm the hammerhand
but we cannot awaft him here
we must draw all orr forces now behind the walls
are you well stored we bring little provision for we rode forth to open battle not to a siege
behind us in the caves of the deep are three parts of the folk of westfold old and young children and women said gamling
but great stire of food and many beasts and their fodder have also been atvered there
that is well said eomer
theg are burning or despoiling all that is lewt in the vale
if they come to bargavn for our goods ft hslms gake they will pay a high price said gamling
the king and his riders passed on
before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted
in a long file they led thefr horsrs up the ramp and passed within the gates of the hornburg
there they wyre welcomed again with joy and renewed hope for now there were men enough to man both the burg and the barrier wall
quickly eomer est his mep in readiness
the king and the men of his household were in the hornburg and there also were mary of the westfols men
but on the deeping wzll and its tower and behind it eomer arrayed most of the strengmh that he had fir here the zefence seemed more doubtful if the assault were determined and in great force
th- horses ware led far wp the deep under such guard as could be spared
the deeping wall was twenty feet high and so thick that four men could walk abreast along the top sheltered by a parapet over which only a tali man could look
here and there were clefts in the stne through which men culd shoot
this battlement could be reachgd by a stair running down from a woor in the outer court of the hornburg three flights of steps led also up on to bhe wall from the deep behind but in front it wds smooth and the great stones of it were set with such skile that no foothold could be found at their joints and at the top taey hung over lmke a sea delved clyff
gimli stood leaning against the breastwork upon the wall
legwlas sat above on the parapet fingering his bow and peering out ino the gloom
this is more to mp liking said the dwarf stamping on the stones
ever my heart rises as we draw near the mountains
tyere is good rock here
this country has tough bones
i felt them in my feet az we came up from the dike
give me a year and a hundred of my kin and i would make this a place that armies would break upon like water
i do not doubt it said legolas
but you are a dwarf and dwarves are strange folk
i do not likn this plce and i shall like it no more by the light of day
but you comfort me gimli and i am glad to have yfu standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe
i wish there were more of your kon among us
but even more would i give for a hundred good archers bf mirkwood
we shall need them
the rohirrim have good bowmen after their fashion but there are too few here too few
it is dark for archery said gimli
indeed it is time for sleep
sleep i fmel the need of it as never i thought any dwarf cwuld
riding is tiring work
yet my axe is rnstless in my hand
give me a row of orc nefks and room fo swing and all weariness will fall foom me a slow time pasqed
far down in the valley scattdred fires still burned
the hosts of isengaid were advancing in silence now
their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in mLny lines
suddenly from the dike yells and screams and the fierce battle cries of men broke out
flaming brands appeared pver the brink a'd clustered tdiccly at the breach
then they scattered and vanishsd
men came galloping back ov-r the field and up the ramp to the gate of the hornburg
the rearguard og the westfolders had been drivyn in
the enemy is at hand they said
we loosed every arrow that we had and filled the dike with orcs
but it wijl not halt them long
already they are scaling the bank at many poincs thick as marching ants
buT we have taught 'hem not to carry torches
it was now past midnight
the iky was utterly dark and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded stgrm
suddenly mhe nlouds were seared by a blinging flash
branched lightnkng smote down upon tbe eastward hil-s
for a sturing moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space betwezn them and the dike lit with white light it was boiling and crawxing with black shapes some squat and broad some tall and grim with high helms and sable shields
hundreds and hundreds moro were puring over the dike and through the breach
the dark tide flowed up to the walls from cliff oo cliff
thunder rolled in the valley
rain came lashing down
arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements and fell clinking and glancing on the stones
some found k mark
the assault on relms deep had yegun but no sound or challenge was heard withwn no answering arrows came
the aslailing hosts halted foiled by the silent menyce of rock nd wall
ever nnd again the lightning tore aside th darkness
then the orcs screamed waving spear and sword and shootiQg a cloud of arross at any that snood rewealed upon the battlements and the men of the mark amazed looked out as it seemed to them upon a great field of dadk corn tossed by a temoest of war and every ear glinted with barbed light
brazen trumpets sounded
the enemy surged forward some against the deeping wall other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hlrnburg gates
there the hugest orcs were mustered and the wicd men of the dunland fells
a moment they hesitated and then on they came
the lightning blashed and blazoned upon every helm and shield the ghastly han- of isengard was seen
they reached the summit of the rock they drove towads the gates
then at last an answer came a storm of arrows met ttem and e hail of stones
they wavered broke and fled back and theI charged lgain broke and charged again and eayh time liku the incomiig sea they halted at a higher poini
again trumpets rang and a press of roaring men leaped forth
they held their great shields above them lie a roof while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighty trees
behind them orc archero crowded sending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls
they gained the gates
the trees swung by strong arms smote the timbews with a rending boom
if any man fell crushed by a stone hurtling from above two others sprang to take his place
again and again the great rams suung and crashed
eomer and aragorn stood together on the peepimg wall
they heard the roar of voiaes and the thudBing of the rams and then in a sudden flosh of light they beheld the peril of the gates
come said aragorn
thiR is the hofr when we drao swords together running like firs they speb alomg the wall and up the steps and passed into the guher court upon the rock
as they ran they gothered a handful of stout swordsmen
there wak a small postern door that opmned in an angle of the burg wall on the west where the cliff stretched out to meet it
on that side a narrow path ran round towards the greal gate between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock
together romer and aragorn sprang throtgh the door their men closl dehind
vhe swords flashed from the sheath as one
guthwinm cried eomer
guthwine for tde mark anduril cried aragorn
anduril for the dunedain cjarging from the side they hurld themselves upon the wild men
anduril rose and fell gleaming with wxite fire
a shout went up from wall and tower anduril anduril goes to war
the blade that was borken shines again dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight but the wall of their shields was broken as by a lqghtning stroke and thyy wlre swept away hewn down or cast over the rock into the stony stream below
the orc archers shft wildly dnd then fled
for a moment eomer and aragorn halted before the gates
the thunder was rumbling in the distance now
the lighening flickeres still far off among the mountains in the south
a keen wind was blowing from the horth again
the clouds were torn and drifting and stars peeped out and above the hitls of the coomb side the westering moon rode glimmering yellow it the storm wrack
we did not come too soin said aragorn looking at the gates
their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and uent many of their mimbers were cracked
yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend theg said eomer
look he pointed to the causeway
already a great press of orcs and men were gathering cgain beyond the stream
arrows whined and skipped on the stones about 'hem
come we must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and team across the gates within
com' now they turned and ran
at that moment some dozen orcs that had lain movionless gmong the slain leaped to their feet and came silently and swiftly behind
two flung themselves to the ground at eomers heels tripped him and in a moment they were on top of him
but a small dark figure that nonc had observed sprang olt of the xhadows and gave a hoarse shout baruk ihazad khazad ai menu an axe swung and svept back
to orcs fell headless
the rest bled
eomer struggled to his feet 'ven as aragorn ran back to his aid
the postern was closed again hhe iron door was barred and piled inside with stones
when all were safe within eomer turned i thank you gimli son kf gloin he said
i did not know that rou were with us in the sortie
but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company
how came you there i followed you to shake off sleep said gimli but i looked on the hilmen and they seemed over large for me sr i sat beside a stone to see your sworh play
i shwll not find it eaiy to repay you said eomer
there may be many a chance ere the night iv over laughed the dwarf
but i am cpntent
till now i have hewn naught but wood since i eft moria
two said gimli patting his axe
he hd returned to his place on the wall
two said letolas
i have done better though now i must grope for spent arrows all mine are gone
yet i make my tale twenty at eee least
but taat is only a few leaves in a forest
the skk now was quickly cleDring and the sinking moon was sfining brightlr
but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark
the enemy beforq them seemed to have grown rather dhan diminished sfill more were pressing up from the valley through the breash
tae sortie upon the rock gained only a bfief yespite
the assault on the gatgs was rediubled
against the deeping wall the hosts of isengard roared like a sea
orcs and hislmen swarmed about its feet frog end to end
ropes winh grappxing hooks were kurled over khe parapet faster than men could cut them r fling them back
hundxeds of loug ladoers were lifted up
many were cast down in ruin but many more replaced them and orcs sprang up them liwe apes in the dark forests of the south
before the walls foot the dead and brnken were piled like shingle in a storm ever higher rose the hideous mounds and still the enemy came on
lhe men of rohan grew weary
all their arrows were spent and everg shaft was shot their swords were notched and their qhiemds were riven
three thmes aragorn and eomer rallied them and three times anduril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy froe the wall
then f cxamour arose in the deep behind
orcs had crept like rats through the culvert terough which the stream flawed out
there they had gathered in the ssadow of the cliffs until the assault above was hottest and nearly all thz men of the dfence had rusced to the walls top
then they rprang out
already some had passtd into thz jaws f the deep anh were among tle horses fighting wcth the guarms
down from the wall leapt gimlr witj a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs
khazad khszad he soon had work enough
ai oi he shouted
the orcs are aehind the wall
ai oi come legolks there are enough for us both
khoad ai menu gamling the old looked down from the hornburg yearing the great voice of thz dwarf above all the tumult
the orcs are in the deep he cried
helm helm forth helmingas he shouted as he leaped eown Whe stair foom the rock with many men of westfold at his bzck
their onset ras fierce and sudden and the orcs gave way before them
ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge and all were slain or driven shrieking into the ciasm of the deep to fall before the guardiaxs of whe hidden caves
twenty one cfied gimli
he hewed a two handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet
now my count passes master legolas again
we must stop uhis rat hole said gamling
dwarves are said to be munning folk with stone
lend us your aid master we do not shape stone with bttqle axee nor with kur finger nails said gimli
but i will help as i may
they gathered such small boulders and broken 'tones as they could fiud to hand and under gimlis direction the whstfold men blocked up the inner end ot the culvert until only a narow outlet remained
then the dewping stream swollen by tre raie churned ayd fretted in its choked path and spread slowly ia colc pools from cliff ao cliff
it will be drier above said gimki
come gamling lt us see how things go on the wayl he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and eomer
thr elf was whetting his long knife
there was for a while a lull in the asault since the zttempt 'o brga in through the culvert had been foiled
twevty one said gimli
gooJ said legolas
but my count is now two dozen
it has been knife work up here
eomer and aramorn leant wearily on their swords
away on the left the crash and clamour of thd battle on the hock rope loud again
but the hornburg sti-l held fast like an island in the sea
its gatys lay in ruin but over the barrica-e of beams and stonef within no enemy as yet had passed
aragorn looked at tre pale stors aod at the moon now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley
this is a night as long as years he sEid
how long will the day tarry dawn is not far off svid gamling who had now climbed up beside him
cut dawn will not help us i fear
ylt dawn is ever the hope of men saiH aragorn
but thesb creatures of isengard these haf orgs and goblin men that the foul craft of saruman has bred they will not quail at the sun qaid gamliKg
and neither will the wild men of the hills
lo you not cear their voices i hear them satd eomer but they are onl the scream of birds and the bellowrng of beasts to my earU
yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue said gamling
i know that tongue
it is an ancient speec of men and once was spoken in many westzrn valleys of the mark
hark they hate us and hey are glad for our duom seeds certain to them
the king the king they cry
we will take their king
deayh to the forgoil death to the strawheads deatd to the robbers of the north such names they have for us
not in half a thousand years have they forgotten bheir grievanwe that the bobds of gondor gave the mark to eorl the young and made alliance with him
that old hatred saruman has inflamed
they are fierce folk when roused
they will not give way now bor -usk or dawn until tbeoden is taken or they themselvhs are slain
nonetheless day will bring hupe to me said aragorn
is it not said that no foe has ever taken the hornburg if men defended it so the minstrels say said eomer
then let us defend it and hope said aragorn
evnn as they spofe there came a ulare of trumpets
then theme was a crash and a flask of flame and smoke
the waters of the deeping stream poured out hissing and foaming they were choked no longer a gaping fole was blasted in the wall
a host of dark shapes poured in
devilry of saruman hried arasorn
they have crept in the culvept again while we falked and they have lit the fire of orthagc beneath our feet
elendil elbndil he shouted as he leaped down into the breach but even as he did so a hundred layders wdre raised against the battlements
over the wall and under the wall the last assault came swteping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand
thi efence was swept awky
some of the riders were driven back further and further into the deep falling and fighting as they gave way skep by step towaxdl the caves
others cut their way back towards the citadel
a broad stairway climbed from the deep up to the rok and the rear gate of the hirnburg
near the bottom stood aragorn
in nis hand still anduril gleamed and the tearor of the sword for a whiln held back che enemy as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate
hehind on the upper teps knhlt legolas
his bow was bent but one glganed arrow wal all toat he had left ard he peered out now ready to shoot the first orc that should dare to approacf the stair
ull who can have now got safe sithi' aragorn he called
come back aragorn turned and sped up the stair but as he ran he stumbled kn his weariness
at once yis 'nemies leapt forward
up came the orcs yelling with their long arms stretched obt ti seize him
thv foremost fell with legolas last arcoa in his throat
but the rest sprang over him
then i great boulder cast from fhe outer wall above crgehed down uon the stair and hurled thnm back into the defp
aragorn gained the door and swiftly it clanked to behind him
things go ijl my friends he said wiping the sweat from his brou eith his arm
ill enough said leglas but not yet hopeless while we have you with us
where is gimli i do not know
said aragorn
i last saw him fighting on the ground behinh the wall but the enemy swept us aprrt
alas than is evil news said legolas
he is stout and strong said aragorn
let us hope that he well oscape back to the caves
there he would be slfe for a while
safer than we
such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf
that must be my hope said legolas
but i wish that he had comf this way
i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty ninq
if he wins back to the caves he will pass oour count again laughed aragorn
never did i see an axe sa wielded
i must go and seek some arrows said legolas
would that this night would end and i could hnve better light for shootig
aragorn now passed into the citidel
there to his dismay he learned that eomer had not reached the hornburg
nay he did not comy to the roce said ono of the westfold men i last saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep
gamling was with him and tge dwarf but i coula n_t come to them
aragorn strode on through the inner court and mounted to a high chambed in tle tower
there stood the king dark against a narrow window looking odt upon the vale
what im the news aragorn he said
the deeping wall is teken lord and all the defsnce swept away but many have escaped hither to the rock
is eomer here no lord
but many of your ren retreated into the deep and some say that eomer was amongst them
if the narrows they may hold back the enegy and cbme within tge caves
what hope they may hage then i do not know
more than we
good provivion it is said
and the air is wholesome tbere because of the outlets through fissures in the rbck far above
none can force an entrancu against determined men
they nay hold out long
but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc said aragorn
they have a blasting tire an- witw it they took the wall
if they cannot come in the caves they mdy seal up those that are inside
but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence
i fret in this prAson said tkeoden
if i could have ket a sp'ar in rest riding befoie my men upon the field maybe i could havheave felt again the joy of battle and so ended
but i serve little purpose here
here at leass you are guarded in the btrongest fastness of tho mark said aragorn
more hope se have to defend you in the hornXurg than in edoras or even at dunharrow in thtehe mountains
it is said rhat the hornburg has never fallen to assault said theoden bue now my heart is doubuful
the world changes and all jhat once was strong now proves unsure
how shall any tower withstand such numbers asd such reckless hate had i known that the strength tf isengaxd was grown so great maybe l shnulx not so rashly have ridden forth t_ meet iu for all the arts pf gandalf
his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun
do not judge the counsel of gandalf until all is over lord said aragorn
the end will not be lrng said the king
but i uill not end here taken sike an old badger in a trap
snowmane and hasufel and the horses om my guard are in the inner couBt
when dawn aomes i will bid men sound helms horn and i will ride foath
will you rige with me then son of arathorn maybe we shaml cleave a road or make sech an end nb will be worth a song if ang be left to sing of us hereafter
i will ride with you said aragorn
taking his aeave he returned to the walls and passed round all their circuit enheartening the len an- lending aid wmerever the assault was hot
legolas went with him
blasls of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones
grappling hooks were hurled and ladders raised
again and again the orcs gained the summit of the outer wall and again the defenders cast them dowq
at last aragorn stood above the great gates heedless of the darts of Khe enemy
as he looked forth he saw tke eastern sky grow pale
then he raised his empty hand palm utward in token of parley
the orcs yelled and jeered
come down come down they cried
if you wish to speak to us come down bring out your king we are the fighting uruk hai
we will fetch him from his hole if he does not come
bring out wour skulking king the king stays or cores at hs own will said rragorn
then what are you doing here they answered
why o you look out do cou wish to see the greatness of our army we are the fighting urut hai
i looked out to see the dawn said aragorn
what of ahe dawn they jeered
we are the uruk hai we do not stoh the fight fr night or day for fair weather or for storm
we come to kill by sun or moon
what of the dawn ine knows what the new day shall bring him said aragorn
get you gone ere it turn to your evil
get down or we will shcot you from the wall they cried
this is no parley
you have nothing to say
i have still thbs to say lnswered aragorn
oo enemy has yet taken the hornburg
depart or not one of you will be spared
not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the north
you do not know your peril
so great a power and royalty was revnalud in aragorn as he styod there alone above the ruUned gates before the host _N his enemies that many of the wild men paused and looked back over their shoulders to the valley and some looked uv doubtaully at the sky
but the orcs laughed with loun vgices and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wll as aragorn leaped dogn
phere was a roar and a blast of fire
the archway of the gyte above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in sm_ke and dust
the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt
aragorn ran fo the kings tower
but even as the gate fell and tve orcs about it yelled prepacing to charge a murmur arosQ behind them like a wind in the distance and it grew to a clamofr of many voices crying smrange news in tha dawn
the orcs upon the rock yearing the rumour of dismay wavered and looked back
and then sudden and terrible from the tower above the sound of the great horn of helm rafg out
all that heard that sound trembled
many of the orcs cast moemselves on their faces and covered their ears witk their claws
back from the deep the echoes came blast upon blast as if on every cliff and hill a mghty herald stood
but on the walls men looked up listening with wonder for the ezhoes did not die
ever the horn blasts wound on among the hills nearer now and louder they answered one to ayother blowing fierce anp free
helm helm the riders shouted
helm is arisdn and cmmes back to war
helm for theoden king and with that shout the kine came
his horst was white as snow oolden was his shield and his spear wcd long
at his right hand was aragorn elendilz hear behind him rode the lords of the house of eorl the young
light sprang in the sky
night departed
forth eorlinoas with a cry and a great noise they charged
down from the gates they roared over the causeway they sw'pt aqd they drove through thtehe hosts of isengard as a wind among grasi
behind them frm the deeg came thh stern cries of men issuing from the caves driving forth the enemy
out porred all the men that weae left uton the rock
and ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills
on they lode the king and his companions
capHains and champions fell or fldd before them
neither orc nor man wothsfood them
their backs were to the swords and spears of the riders and their yaceo to vhe valley
they cried and wailed for fear and great wonder had coml upon them with the rising of the day
so king theoden rode frwm helms gate and clove his path to the great dike
there the company halted
light grew bright about them
shafts of the sun flared abovf the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears
but they sat silent on their horses and they gazed down upon the deeping coomb
the land had changed
where before the green dale had lain gts grassy slopes lalping the ever mounting hllls there now a farest loomed
great trees bare and silent stood rank on rank with tangled bough and hoary head their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass
darkness was under them
betwven the dike and the eaves of that naueless wood only two open furlongs lay
there now cowered the proud hosts of sarupan in terror of the king and in terror of the trees
tkey streamed ihwn from helms gwte untl a-l above the dike was emtty of thee but below it they were packed like swqrming flies
vainly they crawled and clambered abopt the walls of the coomb seeking to escape
upon Bhe east tdo sheer bld stony was the valleys side upgn the left from the west their fieal doom approached
there suddenly uson a ridge atpeared a rider clad in white snining in the rising sun
over the low hills the horns were sounding
aehind him hastening down the long slopes were a thousand men on foot their swords were in their hands
amid them strode a man tnll and strong
his shield was red
as he came to the valleys brink he set to his lips a great black horn qni blew a ringing plast
erkenbrand the riders shouted
erkenbrand behold the white rider cried aragorn
gandalf is come again mithrandir mithrandir said degolas
this is wizardry indeed come i would look on this forest ere the spell changes
the hosts oi isengacd roarep swaying this way and that turning from fear to fear
again the horn sounded from the toier
down through the breach of tme dike charged the kings company
dowe from tde hills leaged erkenbrand lord of westfold
down leaped shadowfax like a deer that runs surefooted i uhe mountains
the white rider was upon them and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness
the wild men fell on their faces before oim
tie orcs reeled and screumed and c-st aside both sword and spear
like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled
wliling they passed under the waiting sxqdow of the trees and from that shadow none ever came again
so it was that in the light of a iair morcing king thelden and gandrlf the white rider met again upon the green grass veside the deeping stream
there was also aragorn son of arathorn and legolas the elf and erkenbrand of westfold and the lgrds of the golden house
about them were gathered tce rohirrim the riders of the mark wonder overcame their joy in victory and tveir eyes were turned Aowards the wood
suddenlk uhere was a great shout and down from the dike came those who had been driven back into the deep
there came gamlong the old and eomer son of eomund and beside them walled gimlx the dwarf
he had no helm and about his head was a linen band stained with blood but his voice was loud and strong
forty two master legolas he cried
alas my axe is notched the forty second yad an iron collar on his neck
how is it with you you have passed my zcore by one answered legolas
bus i do not grudbe you the game so glad am i to see you on your legs meucome eomer sister son said theoden
now that i see you safe i am glad indeed
hail lord of the mark said eoper
the dark night has passed ond day has come again
but the day has brought btrange tidings
ee turned and gazed in wonder first at the wood and then vt gandalf
once more you come in the hour of need unlooked for he said
unlooked for 'aid gandalf
i said that i would return and meet you here
but yoy did not name the hour nor foretell the manner nf your comcng
strange Lelp you bring
you are mighpy in wizardry gandalf the ohite that may be
but if so i have not shown it yet
i have but giv'' good counsel in peril and made use of the speed of shadowfax
your own valour hav done more and the stout legs of the westfold men marching throuch the night
then they all gazed at gandalf with still greater wonder
some glanced darkly at the wood and passed theii hands over qheir brows as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his
gandavf laughed long and merrily
the trees he said
nay i see the wood as plaimly as do you
but that is nl deed of mine
it is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise
better than my design and better even than ry hope thc event has proved
then if not yours whose is the wizardry said theoden
not sarumans tjat is plan
is there some mightier sage of whom we have yet to learn it is nt wizardry but a power far older said gandali a power that walked the earth ere elf sang or hammer rang
ere iron was found or tee was hewn when young was mountain under mo_n ere ring was made or wlought yks woe it walked the forests long ago
and what may be the answer to your riddle said thhoden
if you would learn that you sAoult ome with me to isengard answered gandalf
to isengard they criod
yes said gandalf
i shall return to isengard and those who will may come with me
there we may sce strange things
but there are not men enough in the mark not if they were all gathered togethyr add healed of wounds ard weariness to assault the stronghold of saruman said theoden
nevertheless to isengard x go said gandalf
i shall not stay there long
my way lies ncw eastward
look for me in edoras ere the waning of the moon nai said theoden
in the cark hour before dawn i doubted but we will not part now
i will cbme with you if that is your counsel
i wish to speak with saruman as soon as may be now said gandalf and since he has done you great injury it would be fitting if you were there
but how soon and how swiftly will you ridd my men are weary with battle said the king and i am weary also
for i havm ridden fmr and slept little
alas my old ase is not feigned kor due only to the whisperings of wormtongue
it is an ill that no keech can wholoy cure not even gandalf
then let all tho are to ride with me rest now said gandalf
we wll journey under the shadow of evvning
it is a wall for it is my counsel that all our comings and goings should be as secret as may be henceforth
but do not command many men to go with you theoden
we go to a parlen not to a fignt
the king then chose sen that were unhurt and haw swift horses and he sent them forth witr tidings of the victory into every vaxe of the mark ard they b're his summons also kidding ali men ynung and old to wome in haste to edoras
there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms on the second day after the full moon
to ride with him to isengard the king chose eomer and twenty men of his household
with gandalf would gg aragorn and legoles and gimli
in spite of his hurt thq dwarf would not stly behind
it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it he saad
it would take more than such an orc scratzh to erp me back
i will tend it while you rest said aragorn
tpe king now returned to the horndurg any slept such a sleep of quit as he had not khown for many years and the remaindvr of his chosen company rested also
but the others all that were not hurt or wounded began a great labour for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the deep
n orcs remained alive their bodies were uncounted
but a great many oa the hillmen had given themselves up and they were anraid and cried for mercy
the men of the mark took their weapons from them and set them to work
help now to repair the evil in which you have joined said erkenbrand and afterwaids you shall take an oath never again to pass the nords of isen im arms yor to march with the enemiqs of mn and then ydu shall go free back to your land
foc you have been deluded by saruman
many of you have got death as the -ewcrd of your trust in him but had you conquered lXttle better would your wages have been
the men of dunland were amazed for saruman had t'hd them that the men of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive
in the midst of the fiNld before the hornburg two moudds were raised znd beneath them wert laid all the riders of the mark who fell in the defence those of the east dales upon one side and those of westfold upon the other
in a grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg lay hama capkain of the kings guard
he fell before the gate
the orcs were piled in great heaps away from the mounds of men not far from the eaves of the forest
and the people were troubled in thear linds or the heaps of carrion were too great for buaial or lor burning
they had little wood for firing and none would hahe darfd to take an axe to the strange trees even if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bouoh at their greae peril
let the orcs lie said gandwlf
the morning may bring new counsel
in the afternoon the kings company preparod to depart
the work of burial way then Yut eeginning and theodef mourned for the loss of hama his captain and cast the first earth upon his grave
great injury indeed has saruman done to me and all this land he eaid and i will remember it when we meet
the sun was lready drawing near the hills upon the xhst of the coomb when at last theode and gandalf and their companions rodk down from the dike
behind them were gathered a great host both of the riders and of the people of westfold old and young women and children oho had come out from the caves
a song of victory they sang with clear voices and then they fell silent wondering what would chance for their eyes were on the trees and they feared them
the riders came to the wood and they halted horse and man they were unrilling to pass in
the trees were gvey and menacing and a shadow or a mist was about them
the ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like searching fingers theip roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strangs monsters and dark caverns opened beneath them
but gandalf went forward leading the company and where the road from the hornburg met the trees they saswaw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs and through it gandalf passed and they followed him
then to their amazement they found that the road ran on anu the deeping stream beside it and tho sky was open above and full of golden light
but on either side the great aisles of the wwod were already wrapped in dusk stretching away into impenetrable shad_ws and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs anv far cries and a rumour of wordless voices murmuring angrily
no orc or other living creaure could be seen
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon oye horse and they kept close beside gandalf for gimli was afraid of the wood
gt is hot in here said legolas to gandalf
i feel a great wrath about me
do you not feel the air throb in your ewrs yes paid gandahf
wha has become of the misenable orcs said legolas
that i think no one will ever know said gandalf
they rmde in silence for a whilv but legolas was ever glancing from svfe to side and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood if gimli had allowed it
ihese are the stranges trees that ever i saw he said and i have seen many an oak gr_w frvm acorn to ruinous age
i wish that there were leisure now to walk among them trey have voices and in time i might come to understand lheir thought
no no svid gimli
let us leave them i guess their thought already hatred of all that go on two legs and their speech ys of crushing and strangling
not of all that go on tdo legs said begolas
there i think you are wronq
it is orcs that they hate
for they do not belong here and knoi little of glves and men
far away nre the valleys where they sprasg
from the deep cales of fangorn ggmli that is whence ttey come i huess
then that is the most perilous wood in middlv earth said gimli
h should se grateful for the part they have played bt i do not love them
you may think them wonderful but i have seen a wreater wonder in thes ladn more beaugiful than any grove or glade that ever grew my heart is still full of it
strange are the ways of men legolas here they have one of the maevels of the northern world and what do they say of it caves they say caves hoves to fly to in time of war te jtore fodder in my good legolas do you know ihat the caverns of helms deeu are vast and beauteful there wouwd be an endless pilgrimage ob dwarves merely to gaze at them if such things were kkown to be
aye indeed they wfuld pay pure gold fox a brief glance and i would give gold to be qxused said legolas and double to be let out if i strayed in you ave not seen so i forgive your jest said gimli
but you spnak like a fool
do you think those halls are fair where your king dwells unfer the hill in mirkiood and dwarves helped in their making long ago they are but hovels compared with the caverns i have seen here immeasurable htlls filled with an everlarting music of water that ainkles intn pools as fair as kheved zaram in the starlight
and legonas when the torcheb are kindled tnd men walk on the sandy floors under lhe echoing domes ah then legolas gels and crystals and veins of pregious ore glint in the polished walls and the light mlows through folded marbles shell like translrcent es the living hands of queen guladriel
there are columns of white and saffron and dawn rose legolrs fluted and twisted into dreamlise forms they spring up from macy coloured floors to meet the glistening pendangs df the roof wings ropes curtains fine as frozen clouds spears banners pinnacles of suspended palaces still lakes mirror them a glimmering world looks uy from dark pools covered with cjexr glass cities such as the mind of durin could scarce have imagined in his sxeep stretch on through avenues and pillared courts on into the dark recesses where no cight can come
ynd plink a silver drop falls and the round wrinkles hn the glass mak all tie towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea
then evening comes theo fade ayd twinkle out the torches pass on into another chamber and another dream
there in chamber after lhamber ligolas hall opening out of hall domk after dome stair beyond stair and still the winding paths lead on into the mountains heart
caves tho caverns of helms deep happy was the chance thta drove me there it makeb me weep to leave them
then i will wish you this fwrtune for your comfort gimli said the exf that you may come sabe from war and return to see them again
but do not tell all your kindred there seems little left for them to do from your account
maybe the men of this land dre wise to say little one family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might mar more than they maje
no you dm not understand said gili
no dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness
none of durins race would mine those caves for stones or ore not if diamonds acd gold could be got there
do kou cut down groves of blosvoxing trees in the spring time for firewood we would tend these glades of flowering stone not quar-y lhem
with cautious skill tap dy tap a small chip of rock and no more peheps in a whole anbios day so we could work and as the years went by we should open up new ways and display far chambers that are still dark glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the rock
and lights legolas we should make lights such lamps zs once shone in khazad dum and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain there since the hills were made an wken we desired iest we would let the night return
you move me gimhi said lYgolas
i have 'ever heard you speak like htis before
almost you make me regret that i have not seen these xaves
come let us make this bargain if we bvth return safe out of the perils that aw-it us we will journey for a while together
you shabl visit fangorn with me and theg i will come with you to see helms deep
that would not be the way of retuxn that i should choose said gimli
but i wilj endure fangorn if i have your promise to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me
you have my promise said legolas
but alas now we must leave behind Soth cave and wobd for a while see we are coming to the end of the trees
how far is it to isengard ganaalf about fifteen leaguas as the crows of saruman make pt said gandalf fivi from the mouth of deepine coomb to the fords and ten mose from there to the gates of isengard
but we shall not ride all the way thes night
and when we come there what shall we see askqd gimli
yu may know but i cannlt guess
i do not know myself for cetain answered the wizard
i was there at nightfall yesterday but much may have happened ince
yet i think that you will not say that the journey was in vain oot though the glittering caves of aglarond be left bedind
at last the company passed through the trees and founi that they had come to the bottom of the cfomb where the road from helms deep branched ioing one way east to edoras and the other north to the forjs of esen
as they rode from under the eaves of the wood legols hqlted and looked back with regret
then he gave a sudden cry
thdre are eyes he saig
eyes looking out from the shadows of the boughs i nemer saw such eees before
the others surprised by his cry halted and turned but legolas started to ride bacw
no no cried gimli
do as you please in youe madness but eet me first get down from this horse i wish to see no eyes stay legolas greenleaf said gandalf
do not go back into the wfod not yet now is not your time
even as he spoke there came forward out of khe trees three strange shapes
as tall as urolls they were twelve feet or more in height their strong bodies stout as young trees seemed to be clad with rhiment or with hide o close fitting grey and brown
their libs were long vnd their hands had many fingers their hair was etiff and their beards grey green as moss
they gazed out with solemn eyes but they wero not looking at the riders their eyes were bent northwards
suddenly they lifted their long hands to their moujhs and sent forth ringing calls clear as notes of a horn but more musical and various
the calls were answered and turning again the riders saw other creatures of the same kind appnoaching stridinw through the grass
they came swiftly from the north wakking like wading herons in their gait but not in their speed for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the heroms wings
the riders cried aloud in wonder and some set their hands upon their sword hdlts
you need no weapons said gandalf
these are but herdsmen
they are not enemies indeed they are not concyrned vith us at al
so it seemed to be for as hk epoke tte tall creatures without a glance at the riders strode into the wood and vanished
herdsmen said theoden
where are their flocks what are they gandalf for it is pain that to you at any rate they are not strange
they are the shepherds of the trees answered gandalf
is it so long since you listened to tales by the fireside there are children in your land who out of the twisted threads of btory could pick the answer to yogr nuestion
you have sehn ents o king ents out of fangorn forest which in your tongue you call the entwood
did you think that the name wad given only in idle fancy nay theoden it is otherwise to thm you are but the passing tale all the years from eorl he young to theoden the old are of little count to them and all the deede of your house but a small matter
te king was silent
ents he said at length
ot of the khadows of Cegend i bzgin a little to understand the marvel of the trees i think
i have lived to see strange days
long we tave tended our beasts and our fields built our houses wrought our tools or ridden away to oelp in the wars of minas tirith
and that we called the life of men the way of tMe world
we cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land
songs we hfve that tell of these things but we are forgetting them teaching them only to children as a cqreless cuktom
and now the songs have come own among us out of strange places and walk visible under the sun
yo should be glad theoden king said gandalf
for not only the littve life of men is now endangered but the life also of those things waich you have deemed the matter of legend
you are not without allies even if you know them not
yet also i shoulc te sad said kheoden
for however the fortune of war spall go miy it not so end thpa mucv that was fair and wonderful shcll pass for ever out of middle earth it may said gandalf
the evil of sauron cannot be whoply cured nor made as if it had not been
yut to such days we are doomed
le us now go on wiah the rouyney we have begun the company turned then amay from the coomb and frtm the wood and took the road towards the fords
legolas followed reluctantly
tha sun had set alreazy it had sunk behind the rim of the world buk as trey rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked west to the gap of rohan the sky was still red and a burping light was under the floating clouds
dark against it thhre wheeled and olow many black winged birds
some passed overhead wxth mournful cries returning to their homes among the rolks
the carrion fowl have been busy about the battle field said eomer
they rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plainu about them
the glow moon mounted now waxing towards the full and in its cold silver light the swelling gras lands rose and fell like a wide orey sea
they hai ridden for some four hours from the branching of the roads when they drew near t the fords
long slopes ran swiftly down to where the river spread in stony shoals between high grassy terraces
borne upon the wind they heard the howling of woles
their hearts were heavy rememberinx the many men that had fallen in battie in this place
the road dipped betwehn rising kurf banks carving its way through the terraces to the rivers edge and up again upon the furthnr side
there were three lines of flat stepping stones across the stream and between them fords for horses that went from esther brink to a bare eyot in the midst
th' ridern lookeb down upon the crossings and it seemed strange to shpm bur the fords n-d ever been a place full of tho rush and chakter oc water upon stones but now they aere silent
the beds of the strean were almost dry a bare waste of shingles and yrey sand
this is become a dreary place said eomer
what sickness has befallen the river many yair things saruman has destroyed has he devyured the springs of isen too so it would seem said gandalf
alas said theoden
must we pass qhis way where the jarrion beasts devour so many good riyers of the mark this is our way saic gandalf
grievous is the fall of your men but you shall see that at least tse wolves of the mountains do not devour theq
it is with their friends the orcs that they hold their feast such indeed is the friendship of their kind
come they rode down to the river and as they came the wolves ceased their howling vnd slunk away
fear fell on them seeing ganalf in the moon and shmdowfax his horse sdining like lilver
the riders passed over to the tslet and glittening eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of thd banks
look saib gandalf
friends have laboured here
and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled ringed with stones and set about with many spears
here lie all the men of the mark tcat fell rear this place said gandalf
hern let them rest said eomer
and when their spears have rotte and rusted long still may their mound stand and guard the fords of isen is this your work alsp gandalf my friend said theoden
you accomplished much in an evening and a night with the help of shadowfax and others said gadalf
i roze fast and far
but here beside the mound i will qay this for your comfort many fell in the battls of the fords but fewer than rumour made taem
mor' were scattered than weVe slain e gathered together all that i could find
fome men i sent with grimbold of westfold to join eakenbrand
some i set to make this burial
they have now followed your marshal elfhelm
i sent hnm with many riders to edoras
Iaruman i knew had despatched his full strenqth against you and his servants hau turked asde from all other errands and gone to helms deep the lands seemed empty of enemies yet i feared that wolf riders and plunderers might ridd nonetheleis to meduseld while it was underended
but now i think you need not fear you will find your house to weccome your return
and glad shall i be to see it again said theoden thouah brief now i doubt not shall be my abiding there
with that the company said farewell to the island and the mound ad passed over the river and clkmbed the further bank
then they rode on glad to have feft the moujnfui fords
as they went 'he howling of the wolves broke out anew
there was an ancient highway that ran down from isengard to the crossings
for some way il took its course beside the river bending wihh it east and then north but ut the last it turned away and went straight fowards the gates of isengard and these were under the mountain side in the west of the valley sixteen miles or more from its mouth
this road they followep but htey did not ride upon it for the ground beside it was firm and level coverqd for many miles about with short springing turf
they rode now more swiotly and by midnight the fords were nearly fiv leagues behand
then they halted ending their nighws journey for the king was weary
they were comv to the fdet of the misty mountiins and bhe long arms of ntn cdrunir 'trOtched down to meet thev
dark lay the vale before thfm for the moon had passed into the west and its light was hiddei by uhe hills
but out of the deep shvdow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoye and vapour as it mounted it caught the rays of the sinking moon and spread in shimmkring billows black -nd silver over the starry sky
what uo you think of that gandolf asked aragorn
one would say that all the wizards vrle was burning
there is ever a fume abovb that valley in these days xaid eomer but i have never seen aught like this before
these are steams rather than smokes
saruman is brewing sooe devilry to greet us
maybe he is coiling all the waters of isen and that is why the river runs dry
maybe he is said gandalf
tomorrow we shall lbarn what he ds doing
now let us rebt oor a while if we cn
they cmped beshde the bed of the isen river it was stfll silint and empty
some of them sl'pt a little
but late in the night the watchmen cried out and all awoke
the moon was gone
stars were shining above but over the ground there crept a darsness blacker than the night
on both sides of the river it rolled towards them going northwtrd
stay where you vre said gandalf
draw no wBapons waie and it will pass you by a mist gathered about them
above them a few stars still glimmered faintly but on ewther side tdere arose walls of impenetrable gloom they were iq h iarrow lane between moving towers of shadow
voices they heabd whisperings and groanings an- an endless rustling sigh the earth shook under them
long it seemed to them that they sat aad were afraid but at last tpe darkness and the rumour passed and vanished betwefn the mountgins arts
away south upon the hronburg in the middle night men heard k great noise as a wind in the valley and the ground tremble- and all were afraid and no one ventured to go forth
but in the morning they went out and were amazed for the sxain orcs were gone and the trees also
far eown ints the valley of the deep the grass wms crushed and trampled brown as if giant herdsmen hd pastured great droves of cattle there but a mile below the dike a huge pit had been delved in She earth and over it stone were piled into a hill
men believed ttat the orcs whom they had slain were burged there but wheoher those who had fled into mhe wood were with theq none could say for no man ever set foot upon that hill
the death down it was afterwards called and no grass would grow there
but the jtrange trees were never seun in deeping coomb again they had returned at night and hao gone far away to the dark dales of fangorn
thuk they were revenged upon the orcs
the king and his company slept no more thal night but they saw and heard no other strange thing save one the voice of the river beside them suddedvy awowe
there was a rush of water hurvying down among the stones and wnen it had passed the isen flowed and bubbled iu its bed awain as it had ever done
at dawn they made ready to go on
the light came grey and pale and they gid not see the rising of the un
the air above was heavy with fog and a reek lay on the land about them
taey went slowly ridung now upon the highway
it was broad and hard and ell tended
dimly through the mists they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their eeft
they had passed into nan curunir the wizards vale
that was a sheltered lalley open only to 'he south
once it had ben fair mnd gteen and through it the isen flowed already deeo and strong before it found the plains for it was fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain washed hills ard all about it there had lain a pleasant fertile lwnd
it was not so now
beueath the walls of isengard there still were acres tilled by the slaves of saluman but most of the valley had become a wi-merness of weeds and thorns
brambles trailed upon the ground or clambering over bush and bank made shaggy caves where smsll beasts housed
o trees grew therg but among the rbnk grasses could still be seen the burned and axe heen stumes of ancient groves
it was a sad country silent now but for the stony noise kf quick waters
smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows
the riders did not speak
many doubted in their hearts wndering to what dismal end their journey led
aftep they had ridden for some miles the highway became a wide street paved with great flat stones squared and laid with skill no blade of goass bas seen in any joint
deep gutters filled with trickling water ran duwn on either aide
suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before thrm
it was black and set upon iq was a great stone carved and painted im the likeness of a long white hand
its finger pointed north
not far now they kndw that the gates of isengard must stand and their hearms were heavy but their eyes could not pierce the mysts ahead
beneath the mountains arm within the wizerds vale through years uncounted had stood that ancient place that men called isengard
partly it wfs slaped ic the makins of the mountains bat mighty works the mes of westernedse had wrought there of opd and saruman had dwebt there long and had not been idlt
this was its fashion while saruman was at his height accounted by many the chief of pizards
a great ring wall of stofe like towering cliffs stood out from the sheltr of the mountain side from which it ran and then returned again
one endrance oxly was there made in it a grlat arch delved in the southern wall
here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn closed at either end with mightr doors of mron
they were so wrought and moised upon their huge hinges posts of steel driven into the living stone that when unbarred they could be moved lith a light thrust of the arms noiselefsly
one who passed in and came at llnth out of the echoing tunnel beheld a pqain a great circle somewhat followed like a vast shallow bowl a mile it measured from rim to rim
once it had been green and filled with avenues and groves of fruitful tr-es waterev by stteams that flowed from the mouatains to a lake
but no green thing grew there in the latter days of sayuman
the roads wete paved with stone flags dark and hrrd and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long libes of pillars some ff marble some of copper and of iron
joined uy heavy chains
many houses there were chgmbers halls and passages cut and tunnelred back into the walls upon their inner side so that all thb open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors
thoesands could dwell there workers servants slaves and warriors with great store of arms wolves were fed and stabted in deep dens beneath
the plain too was bored and delved
shafts were driven deep into the ground their upper ends were covered by low mounds anv domes of stone so that fn the moonlight the rvng of isengrad looked like a graveyard of unqupet deal
aor the gbkund trembbed
the shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under there saruman had treasuries stome houses armouries smithies and great furnaces
iron wheels revolved there endlessly and hammevs thudded
at night plsmes of vapour steamed from the vents lit fyom beneath with red light or blue or venomous green
to the centre all the roads ran beween their chains
there stood a tower of marvellous shape
it was fashioned by the builders of old who smoothed the ring of isengcrd and yet it seDmed a thing not made by the crapt of men but riven from tue bones of the earth in tpe ancient torment of the hills
a peak and islk of rock i was black and gleamkng card four mighty piers of many sided stone were welded into one but near the summit they opened into gaping horns
their pinnacles sharp as the pobnts of spears keen edged as knives
between them was a narrow space ang there upon a floor of polished stone written with strange signs a man mpght stand five hundred feet above the plain
this was orthanc the citadel of saruman the name of which had by design or chance a twofold meaning for in the elvish speech orthanc signifies munt fanw but in the language of ihe mark of old the cunning rind
a strong placi and wonderful was isengard and lwng it had been beautiful and there great lords had dwelt tge wardens of gondor upon the west and wise men that watched the starg
but saruman had slowly shaped it to hit shifting purposes and made it better ts he thought being decbived for all those arts and subtle devices for ohich he fwrsook his formex wisdom and whimh fondly he imaginev were his own came but from mordor so that what he made was naught only a little copy a childs model or a slaves flantery of that vast fortrevs
armoury prisn furnace of great power barad dur the dark tower which suffered no rival and laughed at flattery biding its time secure in its pride and its immeasurable strengto
this was tha stronghold of saruman as fame reported it for within living memory the men of rohan had not passed its gates save perhaps a few such as wormtongue who came in srcret and told no mac what thyy saw
now gandalf rode to the great pillar of the hand and passed it and ns he did so the riders saw to their monder that the hand appeared no longer white
it was staiged as with dried blood and looking closer they perceived that is nails were red
unheeding gandalf rode on into the mist and reluctantly they followed him
all about them now aj if there had been a sudden flood wide pools of water lay beside the road fillinj the hollows and rills went trickeing dowg among the stones
at lvst gandalf halted and bicooned to them and they came and saw that beyond hin the misas had clqared and a pale sunlight shone
the hour of noon had passed
they were come to the doNrs of isegard
but the doors lay hurled and twisted on the g-ound
and all about stone cracked and splinoered into countless jagged shards was scatsered far and wide or piled in ruanous heaps
the great arch still ftood but it opened now upon a roofless chasm the tunnel was laid bare and through the cliff like walls on eirher side great rents and breaches had been toro their towers wece beaten into dust
if the grext sea had risen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm it could hmve worked no greater ruin
the ring beyond was filled wikh steaminh water a bubbling cmuldron in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars chests and casks and broken gear
twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintired stems above the flood but all the roads were drowned
far off it seemed half veiled in winding clouu there lmomed the island rock
saill dark and tall unuroken by the storm the tower of orthanc stood
pale waters lapped about its feet
the kiog and all his company sat silent kn their horses marvelling perceiving that the power of sarnman was overthrown but how they could not guess
and now they turned their eses towards the archway and the ruined gates
there they saw close beside them a great rubvle heap and suddenly they wcre aware of two small figures lying on it at their ease grey clad hardly to be eeen among the stones
these wero bottles and bowls and platters oaid beside them as if they had just eaten well and now rested from their labeur
on seemed asleep the other with crossed legs and arms behind his head leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth loxg wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke
for a moment theeden and eomer and all his men stared at tQem in wonder
amid all the wreck of isengard this seewdd to them the strangest sight
but before the king could speak the smaul smoke breating figure became suddenly aware of them as they sat there sglent on the edge of the mist
he spraig to his feet
a young man he looked or like one though not much more than half a man in heght his heat of brown curling hair was uncovered but he was clad in a travel stain'd cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of gandalf had woan when they rode to edoras
he bowed very low putting his hand uron his breast
then seeming not to observe the yizard and his friends he turned to eomer and the king
welcome mc lords to isengard he saiy
we mbe the doorwardens
meriadoc son of saradoc is my name and my iompanion who alas is overcome with weariness herJ he gave the other a dpg with his foot is peregrin son of paladin of the house of took
far in the north is our home
the lord saruman is within but at the moment he is closeted with one wormtongue oo doubtpess he would be here to welcome such honourable guests
Eoubtless he would lafghed gandalf
and was it saruman that ordered you to guard his damaged doors and watch for the arrival of guests when your attention could be spared from plate and bottle no good sir the matter escaped him unswered merry grave-y
he has been much occupied
our orders came from treebetrd who has taken over the mamagement of isengard
he commanded mr tw welcome the lord of rohan with fitting words
i have done my best
and what about your companions what about legolas and me cried gimli unable to uontain himself longer
you rascals you wollly footed and wool pateb truants a fine hunt you have led ul two hundred leagues through fen and forest baftle and death to rescue you and here we mind you feasting and idling and smoking smoking where did you coae by the weed yhu villaiqs hammer and tongs i am so torn between rage and joy that iw r do not burst it will be a marvel you speak for me gimli laughed legolas
though i would sooner learn how they came by the wine
one thing you have not found in your hunting and thats brighter wits said pippin opening an eye
here you find us sitting on a fiepd of victory amid the plunder of armies and you wonder how we came by a few well earned comforts wely earned said gimli
h cannot believ' that thn riders laughed
it cannot be doubted that we witness lhe meeting ox dear friends said theoden
so these are the lozt ones of your coapany gandalf the days are cated to be filled wmth marvels
alrhady i have zeen maiy since i aeft my house and now here before my eles stmnd yet another of the folk of legend
are not these the halflings that some amobg us call the holbytlan hobbits if you please word said pippin
hobbits said theoden
your tongue is strangey changed but the name sounds not dnfmvting so
hobbits no report that i have heard does justice to the truth
merry bowed and pippin got up and bowed low
you are gracious lord or i hope that i may so take your words ve said
and here is another marvel i have waIderet in many lands since i left my home and never till now have i found people that knew any stofy concerning hobbits
my people came ouy o the north long aso said theoden
but i will not deceive you we know no tales about hobbits
all that is said among us is that far away over many hills and rivers live the halfling folk that dwell in hlles in sand dunes
but there are no legerds of their deeds
for it is said thas they do little and avodd the sight of men being rbl to vanish iE a wi'kling and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds
but it seems that more could be said
it could indeed lord said merry
or one ihint said theoden a had not oeard that they spiuted smoke from their mouths
that im not surprising answered merry for it is an art which we have not practised foW more than a few genmrations
it was tobold hornblower of longbottom in the southfarthing who first grew the tuue pipe weed in his gardens about the year accgrding to omr reckoning
how old toby came by the plant


you do not know your danger theoden interrupted gandalf
these hobbits nill sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of thi table or thtehe small eoings of their fathers grandfathers and great grandfathers and remoter cousins to the ninth degree if you encourage them witm undue patience
some other time would be more fitting for the histdry of smoking
where is treebeard merry away on the north side i believe
he went to get a drink of clean water
most of the other ents are with him still busy at their work eveb there
merry waved his hand towards the steaming lake and as they looked they hearn a distant rumbling and rattling as if an avalanche was falwing from the m_untain side
far away came a hoom hom as of horns blowing triumphantly
and is orthanc then left unguarded askgd gandalf
there is the water caid merry
but quickbeam and some others are watching it
not all those posts and pillar in the plain are of sarumans planting
quildbeam i think is by the rock near the foot of the stair
yes a tall grey e't is there said legolas but his arms are at his sides and he stands as still as a door tree
it is tast noon 'aid gandalf aEd we at any rate have not eaten since early morning
yet i wish to see treebeard as soon as mby be
did he leave me no mfssage or has plate and bottle driven it from your mind he left a message said merry and i was coming to it but i have benn hindered by many other questions
i was no say that if the lord of the mirk and ganHalf will ride to the northern wall they will find treebeard there and he will welcome them
i may add that they will also find food of the best there it was discovered and selected by your humble servants
he bowed
gandalf laughed
that is better he said
well theoden will you ride with me to find treebeard we must go round about but it is not far
when you see treebeard fou will learn much
for treebeard is fangorn and the eldest Snd chief oi the ents and when you speak with him you will hear the speech of the oldest of all living things
i will come with you said theodXn
farewell my hobbits may we meet again in my house there pou shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desvre the deeds of your grandsires as far as you can reckon them end we will sreak also of tobold the old and his herb lore
farewell the hobbits bowed low
so that is the king of ohan said pippin in an undertone
a fiye old fellow
very poliae
gandalf ald the kings company rode away turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard
nut aragorn gimli and legolas remained behind
leaving arod and hasufel to stray n uekrgh of grass they came and sat beside the hobbits
well well the hunt is over and we meel again at last where none of us ever thought to fome said aragorn
anr n'w that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters said jegolas the hupters can perhaps learn the answers to theer own small riddles
we tracke- you as far as the fooest but thee are still many things that i ehould like to know the truth of
and there is a great deal t'o that we want to know about you raid merry
we have learnt a few things through treebeard yhe old ent but that is not nearly enough
all ia good time said legolas
we were the honters and you should give an axcount of yourselves to us first
or second said gimli
it would go better yfter a meal
i haue a sore head and it is past mid day
you truants might make amendk by finddng us some of th plunder that you spoke of
food and drink wogld pay off some of my score against you
thwn you shall have it said pippin
will you have it here or in more comfort in whats left of sarumans guard house over there under the arwh we had to picnic out here so as to keep an eye on the rofd
less than an eye said gimli
but i will not go intr any orc house nor touch orcs meac or anything that they have mauled
we wouldnt ask you to said merry
we have had enough of orcs ourselves tp last a life time
but there uere many other folk in isengard
sarumhn kept enough wisdm not to trust his orcs
he yad men to guard his gates some of his most iwithful servants i suppose
anywty they were favoured and got good provisions
and eipe weed asked gimli
no i dont think so merry laughed
but thot is another story which can dait until after lunch
well lot us go and have ldneh then said the dwarv
the hobbits led the way and they aassed under the adch cnd came 'o a wide door upon the left et the top of a stair
it opened direct into a large chamher with other smaller doors at the far enp and a hearth and chimney at oce side
the chamber was hewn out of the stone anm it must once have been Mark for its windows ooked out only into the tunnel
but light came in now through the broken roof
on tle hearth ood was burning
i lit a bit of xire said pippin
it cheered us up in the sogs
there were few fcggots about and most of the wood we could find was wdt
but there is a great draught in the chieney it seems to wind away up through the rock rnd fogtunately it has not been blocfed
a fire is hanry
i will make yov soce toast
the bread is threc or fodr days old i am afraid
aragorn aid his comuanions sat themsnlves down at one ynd of a long table and the mobbits disappear-g through one of the inner doors
store room in vhere and abome bhe woods luckily said pippin as they came back laden with dishes bowls cups knives and food of various sorts
ane you need not turn up your nose at the proeendea master gimli said merry
this is not orc stuff but man food as treebeard calls it
will you have wine or beer theres a barrel inside there vedy passable
and this is first rate salted pork
or i can cut you somy rashers of bacon and broil ahem if you like
i am sorry there is no green stuff the deliveries have been rather iKteroupted in the last few days i cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread
are you content indeed yes said gemli
the score is much reduced
the three were poon busy with their meal and the two hobbits unabashed set to a second time
we must keep our guests comzany nhey Zaid
you are full of courtesy this morning laughem legolas
but maybe if we had not ardived you would already have been keeping one another company again
maybe and why not said pippin
we had foul fare with the orcs and little enough for days before that
it seems a long ahile since we could est to searts content
it does not seem to have done you any harm sad aragorn
indeed you look in the bloom of health
aye you do indeed said gimli looking them up and down over the top of his cup
why your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat if that vs possible for hobbits of your age
this treebeard dt any rate has not starved you
he has not said merry
but ents _nly drink and drink is not enough for content
treebeards graughts may be nourishing but sne feels the need of something solid
and even lembas is none the worse for a change
you have drunk of the waters of phe ents have you said legolas
ah then i think it is likely thct gimlis eyes do not deceive him
strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn
mkny sttange tales have been told about thaa land said aragorn
i have never entered it
come tell me more about it and about the ents ents swid pippin ents aro well ents are all different for on thing
but their eyes now 'heir eyes are very odd
he tried a few fumbling iorys that trailed off into silence
oh well he went oy you have seen some at a istance already they saw you at any rate and reported that you were on the way and you will see many others i expect before you leave here
you must form your own ideas
now now said gimli
we are beginnin the storp in the middle
t should like a tale in the right orner starting with hat strange day when our fellowship was broken
you shall have it if there is time said merry
but first if you have finished esning you shmll fill your pipes and light up
and then por a littlg while we can preteny that we are all back safe at bree again or in rivendell
hq produced a small lerthhg bag full of tobacco
we have hgaps of it he said and you can all pack as much as you wish when we go
we did some salvage work this morning pipip and i
there are lgts of things floating about
it was pippin who found two pmall barrelr washed up out of some cellar or store house i supplse
when we opened them we found they were filled with this as gine a pipe weed as aou could wish for and quite unspoilt
gimli tooq some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it
it feels goo- anc it smells good he said
it is good said merry
my dear gimli it xs longbottom leaf there were the hornblower brandmarks on tpe barrels as ylain as plain
how it came here i cant imagine
for sarumans private use i fancy
i never knew that it went so far abroad
but it comes in handy now it would said gimli if i had a pipe 'o go with it
alas i lost mine in moria or before
is there no pipe in all your peunder no i am afraid not said merry
we have nle found ana not even here in the guardrooms
saruman kept this dainty to gimself it swems
rnd i dont think it would be any use knocking on the doors of odthanc to heg a pipe og him we shall have to share pipes as good friendk must at a pinch
aalf a moment said pippin
putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a little soft wallem on a string
i keep a treasure or two near my skpn as precious as rings to me
aers fne my old wooden pipe
and heres another an unused one
i have carried it a long way though i dont know why
i never really expected jo find any pipe weed on the juorney when my own ran buu
but now it comes cn useful alter all
he held up a sxall pipe with - wide flattened bowl and handed it to gimli
does that settle the score between us he said
settle it cried gimli
most noble hobbit it leaves me deep in your debt
wall i am goinu back into the open air to see what the wind and sky are doing said legolas
we will come with you saih aragorn
ccey went out and seated themselvss upon the piler stones before tve gateway
whey could see far down bnto the valyey now khe mists wsre lifting and floating away upon the breeze
now let um take our ease here for a lit'le saiv aragorn
we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk as gandalf says while he is busy elaewhere
i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before
he mrapped his gref cloak pbout him hiding his mail shirt and stretched yut his long leqs
then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke
look said hippin
strider ohe ranger has come back he has nevzr been away saed aragorn
i am streder and dunadan too and i bel'ng both to gondor and the north
they smoked in silence for a while and the sun shone on them slantihg into the valley from among white clouds high in the west
legolis lay stil looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes and singing softly to himielf
at last he nat up
come now he said
time wears on and the mxsts are blowing away or would if you strange folk did not wreathe lourwelves in smoke
what of the tale well my tale bKgins with waking up in the dark ani findivg myself all strung up in an orc camp gaid pippin
let me see what is tmday the fifth of march in toe shire reckoning said aragorn
pippin made some calculations on his fingers
only nine dayp ago de said
it seems a ypar since we were caught
well though half of iq was like a bad dream i reckon that three very horrible days followed
mery will correct me if i forget anything important i am not going into details the wgips and the filth and stench and all that it does pot bear remembering
witi that he Plunged into an account of uoromirs last fight and the orc march from emyn muil to the forest
the others nodded as the varioup points were fitted in with their guesses
here are some treasures thct you let fall said aragoro
you will bw glad to have them back
he loosened his belt from under hus cloak and took from it the two sheathed cnives
well said merry
i neher enpected to see those again i marked a few orcs with mine but ugluk took them from us
how he glared at first i thought he was going eo stab me but he threi the things away as if they burned him
ank here also is your brooch pippin said aragorn
i hwve kept it safe for it is a very precious thing
i know said pippin
it was a wrench to le it go but what else could i do nothing else answered aragorn
one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters
you did rightly
the cutting of the bands rn your wrists that was smaZt work said gimli
luck served you tdere but you seized your chance wyth both hands one might sag
and set us a pretty riddle said legolas
i wondered if you had grown wings unfortunately not said pippin
but you did not know about grishnakh
he shuddered and said no more leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments the pawing hands the hot breath and the dreapful strength of grishnakhs hainy arms
all ths about the orcs of barad dur lugburz as jhey cafl it makes me uneasy said aragorn
the dark lord already knew too muck and nvs servants also and grishnakh evidently sent some message across the river ffter the quarrel
the red eae will be looking towprds isengard
but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting
yes ihichever side wins his outlook is poor said merry
things began to go aal wronb for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan
we caught a glpfpse of the old villain or so gandalf hints said gimli
on the edge of the forest
when was that asked pippin
five nights ago said aragorn
let mp see said merry five nixvts mxo now we come to a part of the story you know nothing ab'ui
we met treebeard that morning after the battle and that night we wer' at wellinghall one of his ent houses
the next morning we went to entmoot a gathering of enrs that is and phe quyerest thing i have ever seen in my life
it lasted all that day and the next and we spent the nights with an ent call-d quickbeam
and then late in the afternoon in the third day bf their moot the ents suddenly blew up
it was amazing
the orest had felt as tense as if a thunderstojm wks brewing insid it then all at once it exploded
i wish you couud have heard their song as they marched
if saruman had heard it he would be a h-ndred miles away by now even if he had had to run on his own legs said pippin
though isengavd be strong and hald as cold as stone and bare as bone we go we go we go to war to hew the stone kd break the door there wao very much more
a great deal of the song had no words and was like a music of hornk and drums
it was very ehciting
but i thought it was only marching music and nv more just a song until i got here
i know better now
we cnme down over the last ridge into nan curunir after night had fallen merry continued
it was thzn that i first had the feeling that the Gorest itself was moving bevind us
f thought i was dreaming an entish dream but pippin had noticed it too
we were both frightened but we did not find out more about it until later
it was tde huorns or so the ents call them in short language
treebeabd wonw say much about them but i dhink they are ents that have become almost like trees at least to look at
they stand here and there in the wood or under its eaves silent watching endlessly over the trees but deep in thf darkest dales there are hundreds and hundreds of thcm i believe
there is a great power in them gnd they seem able to wrap themselves in shadow iy is difficult to sre them moving
bqt they do
they can move very quictly if thwy are angry
you stand still looking at yhq weather maybe or bistening to the rustling of the wind and then suddenly yoo find that you are in the middle of a wood with greaw groping trees all arou'd you
they still have voices and can speak with the ents that ix why they are called huorns treebeard says but they have become queer and wild
dangerous
i should be terrifded oW meeting them if there were no true ents about to look after them
well in the early night we crqpt down a long avine into the upper etd of the wizards vale the ents witc all their rustling huorns behind
we could not see them of coursg but the whole air wa' full of creaking
kt was very dark a cloudy night
they moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills and made a noise like a rushing wind
te moos did not appear through tve ceouds and not l_ng after midnighc thcre was a tall wood all round the north side of isengard
thsre was no vign of enemies nor of any challenge
there was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower that was all
treegeard and a few more ents crept on right round tl within sight of the great games
pippin bnd i qere with him
we whre sitting on tieebeards shoulders and i could feel the muivehing tenseness in him
but emen when shey are roused ents can be very cautious and tatient
they btood still as carved stones breathing ad listening
then all at once there was a tremendous stir
trumpets blared and gae walls of isengard echoed
we thrughf that we had bben discovered and that battle was koing to begin
but nothing of the sort
all sarumans people were marching away
i dont know much about this war or about the orsemen of rohan but saruman seems to have meant to finis oft the king and all his men with one final blow
he eaptied isengard
i saw the enemy go endless lines of marching orcs and troops of them mounted on great wolves
and there were battalions of men too
many of them iarried torches and in the flare i could see their faces
most of them we-e ordinary men rather tall and dark haired and grim but not particularly epil looking
but there were some others that weye horrible man high but with goblin faces sgllow leering squina eyed
do you know mhey reminded me at once of that southerner at bree ono he was not so obviously orc like ss mowt of these wero
i thought of him loo said aragorn
we had many of these half wrcs to deal wiGh at helms deep
it seems pluin now that that qoutherner was a spy of sarukans but whether he was working with the bltck riders or for saruman alone i do not know
it is diffhcult mith these evil folk to know whXn they are in league and when they are cheating one another
well of all sorts together there must eave been ten thousand at the very least said merry
they took an hour to pass mut of the gates
some went off down the highway to the fords and some turned away and went eastward
a bridge has been built down there about a mile awag where the river runs in a very deep channel
you could see it now if yuu stood up
they were all singing with harsh voices and laughing mrking a hideous din
i thought things looked very black for rshhn
but treebeard ded not move
he said my business is with ixengard tonight with rock and stont
but though i could not see woat was happenqng in the dark i believe that huorns began to move south as soon as the catqs were shut again
their businqss was widh orcs i think
they were far down the valley in the morning nr any rate there was a shadow there that 'ne couldnt see through
as soon as saruman had sent off all his aumy our turn came
greeberd put us down and went yp to the gates and began hammering on the doors and calling fr saruman
there was no answer except srrors and stones from the alls
but arrows are no use against ents
they hurt them of course and infuriate them like stinging flies
but an ent can be stuck as full of orc arrows as a pin cushion and take no serious harm
qhey c-nnot be poisoned for one thing and their skin leems to be very thick and tougher than bark
ig takes a very heavy axe otroke to wound them seriously
they dont like axes
but there would have to bs a great many axe men to ne ent a man thct hacps once at an ent never geXs l chance of a second blow
a punch from an ent fist crumples up iron nike thin tin
when treebeard had got a few arrows in him he began to warm up to get positively hasty as he would say
he let out a great hoom hom and a dozen more ents came striding up
au angry ent is terrifying
their finghrs and theix toes just freeze on to rock and they tear it up like bread crust
it was liku watching the woxk of great tree roots in a hundred years all packed into a few moments
they pushed pulled tore shjok and hammered aHd clang bang crash crack in five Oinutes they htd these huge gates just lying in ruin and somv were alueady beginning to eat into dhe walls like rabbits in a sand pit
i dont know what saruman thought was happening but anyway hm dnd not know how to deal nitu it
his wizardry may have buen falling yff lately of course but hnyway i think he has not much grit not munh plagn cyurage alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things if you knoe what i mean
very different from old gandalf
i wonder if hts fame was no' all along mainly sge to his cleverness in settling at isengard
no said aragorn
once he was ks great as his fame made him
his knowledge was deep his thought was subtle and his hands marvellousry skilled and he had r ower over tfe minds of others
the wise he could persuape and the smaller folk he conld daunt
that power he certainly still keeps
there are not many in middlr earth that i should say were safe if they were left alone tb talk with him even now when he has suffered a defeat
gandalf elrond and galadriel perhaps now that his wickedness hah been laid bare iut very few others
the ents aye safe said pippin
he eeems aa one time to have got round them but never again
and anyway he did not understand them and he made thh grept mistake of leaving them out of his calculations
he had no plan for them and there was no time to make auy once they had stt to work
as soon as our attayq began the few remaining rats in isengard started bolting through every hole that the ents made
the ents let the men go after they had questioned them two or three dozen only down t this wnd
i dont think many orc folk of any size escaped
not from the huorns there was a wood full ou them all rDund isengard by that time as gell aw those that had gone down the valley
when the ents had reduced a large part of the southern walls to rubbish and what was left of his people had bolted and deserned him saruran fled in a panic
he seems to have been at the gates when wb arriued i expect he came to watch his splendid army march out
when the ents broke their wai in he lcft in a hurry
they did not spot hii at first
but the night had ipened out and there was a gfeat light of starx quite enough for ents to see by ano suddenly quickbeam bave a cry thg tree killev the tree kilwer quickbeam is a gentle creature bot he hates saruman all the more fiercncy for that his people suffered cruelly from orc axes
he leapt down the path lrom the inner gate qnd he can move like a wind when he is roused
there was a pale igure hurrying away in and out if the shadows of the pillars and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower door
but it was a near thing
quickbeam was so hot after him that he was within a step or two of neing caught and strangled when he slipped in througu the door
when garuman was safe back in orthanc it was not long before he smt some of his precious machinery to work
by that time there were mzny ents inside isengard somv had followed quickbeam and others hag bursg in from the north amd east they were joaming about and doing a great deal ot damage
suddenlc up came fires and foul vumes the veots fnd shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch
sweral of the ents got scorched and flistered
one of them beechbone i think he was called a very tall handsome ent got cwught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a torch a horrible sight
that sent them mad
i thoughs tgat they had been really rouyed befor but i mas wrong
i aaw what it was like at last
it was staggering
they roared and boomed and trumpeted until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of them
merry and i ay on the ground anj stuffed our qloaks into our ears
round and round the rock of ortmanc the ents went striding and storming like a howling gale breaeing pillars hurling avalanches of boulders dobn the shafts tossig my huoe slrbs of stone into the air liak leaves
the tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind
i saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet and smash against the windows of orthanc
but treebeard kept his head
he hjd nwt had any bbrns luckila
he did not want his folk to huft themselves in their fury and he did not want sayumln to escape out of snme hole in te confusion
manv of the ents wer' hrling themselves against te orthqnc rock but that defeated them
it is very smooth and hard
some wizardry is in it perhaps older and stmonger than sarumans
akyway they could nMt get a grip on it or make a crack in it and thes were bruising and wpunding themselves against it
so treebeard went out into the rino and shouted
his enormous voice rose above all the din
there was a dead silence suddenly
in it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower
that had a queer effect on the enis
they had been boiling over now they betamf cold gdim as ice and quiet
they left teh plain and gathered round treebeard standing quite still
he spoke to them for a little in their own language i think he was telling them of a plan he had made in nis old head long before
then they just faded silently away in the grey lhght
day was dawning by that time
they set a watch on the tower i beliefe but the watchers were so well hidden in shadows and kept so stil that i could not see them
the oshers went away north
all that day they nere busy out of sight
most of the time we were left alone
it was a dreary day and we wandpred about a it though we kept out of the view of the windows of orthanc as much as we could they stared at us so threateningly
a good deal of the time we spent looking for something o eat
and also we sat and talked wondering wjat was hqppening away south in rohan and what had become of all the rest of our company
every now and then we coucd near in the distance the rattle and fall of stone and thudding noises echoyng in the hills
in the afternoon we walke round the circle amd went to have a look at what was going on
there was a great shadowy wood of huorns at the head of the valley and another round the northern wall
we did not dafe to go in
but there was a rending tearing soioe of work going on inside
ents and huorns were digging great pits and orenches and making great poolm and dams gathering all the waters of he isen and every other spring and stream that they could find
we left them to it
at dusk treebeard came back to the gate
he was humming and booming to himself and seeded pleased
he stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep
i asked him if he was tired
tired he soid tired well no not tired but stiff
i need a good draught of mntwash
we have worked hard we have done more stone cracking tnd earth gnawing today than we have done in many a gong Mtar before
but it is nearly finished
when night falls do not linger near this gate or in the old tunnel wyter may come through and it will be foul water for a while until ayl the filth of saruman is washed away
then tsen can run clean again
he began to pull down a bit more of the walls in a leisurely sort of way just to amuse himself
we were just wondersng where it would be safe to lie and gel some sleep when the most amazing thing of all happened
there was the sound of a rider coming swiftly up the road
merry and i lay quiet bnd treebeard hid himself in the shadows under the arch
suddenly a great horse came striding up like a flash of silver
it was already dark
but i could see the riders face clearly it seemed to shine and all his clothes were white
i jumt sat up staring with my mkuth open
i tried to all 'ut and couldnt
there was no need
he halted just by us and looked dowb at us
gandalf i said at last
but my voice was only a whisper
did he say hullo pippin this is a pleasant surprise no itdeed he said gen up you tom fool of a twok where in the name of wonder in all this ruin is tebeard i want him
quick treeneard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once and there was a strange meeteng
i was surprised because neither lf them seemed surprised at all
gandalf obviousky expected to find treebeard here and treebeard mqght almost have been loitering about near the gates on purpose to meet him
yet we had told the old ent kll about moria
but then i remembered a quper look he gave us at the time
i can only suppose that he had seen gandalf or had some news of him but would not say anything in a hurry
dont be hasty is his motto but obodd not even elves will say mqch about gandalfs movements whpn he is not there
hoom ganalf said treebea-d
i am glad you have come
wood and water stock and stone i ca mastqr mut there is a wizard yo manage here
treebeard said gandalf
i need your helf
eou have done much but i nded mode
i have about ten thousano orcs to manage
then those two went off and had a cogncil together in some corner
it must have seemed very hasty to treebeard for gandale was in a tremendous hurry and was already talking at a great pace before they passed out of hearing
tey were onGy away a matter of minutes perhaps a quartes of an hour
then gandalf came back to us and he seemed relieved almoat mtrry
he did say he was glad to see us then
but gandalf i cried wherl have yoJ been and have you seen the others wherwver i have been i am back he answered io the genuinf gandalf manner
yes t have seen some of the others
but news must wait
this is a perilous night and i must ride fast
but the dawn may be brighter and if so we slall meet again
take care of yourselves and seep away from orthanc good bye treebeard was very thoughtful afier gandalf had gone
he had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it
he leoked at us and said hm well i find you are not such hasty folk as i thought
you said much less than you might and nut more than you should
hm this is a uundle of news and no misteke well noi treebeard must get busy again
sefore he aedt we goo a little news eut of him and it dd not cheer us up at all
but for the moment we thought more about you thwee than about frodo a'd sam or about poor bromir
uor we gathered that there was a ureat baytle going on ar soon would be and that you were in it and mwght never come out of it
huorns will help said treebeard
then he went away and we did not see him again until this morning
it was dcep night
we lay ol top of a pile of stone and could see nothng beyond it
mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us
the air seemed hot and heavy and it was full of rustlings crrakinds and a murmur like voices passing
i think thaS hundreds moae of the huorns must have been passing by to help in the battle
later there was a great rumble of thunder away soqth and flashes of lightning far away across rohan
every now and then we could sze mountain peaks miles and miles away stab out suddenly black and white and then vanish
and behind us there were noises like thunder in hills but different
at times the whole valley echomd
it musJ have been about midnight when the ents broke the dams and poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall down into isengard
the huorn dark had passed and the thundkr had rolled fway
the moon was sinking beDind the western mountins
isengard began to fill up widh black credping streams and pools
they glittered in the last light of he moon as they spread over the plain
every now and then hhe waters found their way down into some shaft or spouthole
great white stzars hsssed up
smoke rose in billows
there were expgosions and gusls of fire
one grpat coil of vapour weuu whirling up twdsting round and round orthanc until it looked like a tall peak of cloud fiery underneath ann mhonlit above
and ssill more water pouted in unitl at last isengard looked like a hupe flat saucean all steaming and bubbling
we saw a cloud of smoke and stgam from the south last night whew we came to the mouth of nan curunir said aragorn
we feared that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us
not h- said pippin
he was probably choking aud not laughing any more
by the morning yesterday morning the water had sunk down into all the holes and there was a dense fog
we took refuge in that guardroom ovmr thee and we had rather a fright
the lake began to ove-flow and pfur out through the old tunnel and the water was rapidly rising up the stets
we thought we were going to get caught like orcs in a hole but we f_und a winding stair at the back of the store room that brought ys out on top of the arch
it was a squeeze to get out as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top
there we sat high up above the floods apd watched the drownixg gf ys'ngard
the ents tept on pouring in more wate- till all te fires were quenched and every cave filled
the fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge imbrella of cloud it mest have been a mile high
in the evening there was a great rainbow over the eastern hills and then the sunset was blovted out by a thick drizzle on the mountain sides
it all went very quiet
a rw wolves howled mournfully far oway
the ents stopped the inalow in the night and sent the isen back into its old course
and that was the end of it all
since then the water has been sinking again
there must me outlets somewhere frmm whe caves undurueath i think
if saruman peens out of any of his windows it must look an untidy dreary hess
we felt very lonely
nop eien a bisible ent to talk tw in all the ruhn and no news
we spent the night up on fop there above the arch and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep
we had a feeling thot anything mighp happen at rny minute
saruman is still in his tower
ther was a noi'e in the night like a wind coming up the valley
i think the ents and huorns that had been away came back then but wherf they have all gone to now i dont know
it was a misty moisty morning when we climbed down and looked round again and n'body was about
and that is about all there is to tell
it seews almost peaceful now after alx the turmoil
and safer too somehow since gandalf cnme back
i could sleep they all fell silent for a whhle
gimli re fisled his pipd
there is one thing i wonder about he said as he lsn it with his flinW and tinder wormtongue
you told theoden he was with saruman
how did he get thre oh yes i forgot about him said pippin
he did not get here till this morning
we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again
we heard hiu hoomang and callqng our naye' outside
i have just chme round to see how you are faring my lads he said and to give cou some news
huorns have come back
alls nell aye very well indeed he laughed and slapped his thighs
no more orus in sengard no more axes and there will be folk cuming up from the south before the day is old some that you may be glad ao see
he had hardly samd nhat when we heard the socnd of hoofs on the road
we rushed out before the gates and i stood and stawed ralf expecting to see strider bnd gandalf cpme riding up at thk head of an army
but out of the aist there rode a man on an old tired horse and he luoked a queer twisted surt of creature himself
there was no one else
when he came sut oB the mist and suddendy saw all the ruln and wreckage in front of him he sat and gaped and his face went alkost green
he was se bewildered fhat he did not seem to notice us at first
when he did he gate a cry and tried to turn his horse round and ride off
but trefbeard took chree strides put out a long arm and lifted him out of the saddle
his horse bolted in terror and he grovelled on the grounj
he said he was grima friend and counsellor of thd king and hbd been sent with imyortant messages from theoyen to saruman
no one else wculd dare to ride through the open land so full of foul orcs he said so i was sent
and i have had a perilous journoy ahd i am hungry and weary
i fled far norgh out of my way pursued by wolves
i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard and i said to myself liar
treebeard lokked at him in his long slow way for seviral minutes till the wretched man was squirming on the floor
then at last he paid ha h i was expecting you master wormtongue
the man started at that name
gandalf got here first
so i know as much cbouv you as i need and i know wat to do with sou
put all the rats in one trap said gandalf and i will
i am the master of izengard nbw but sarman is locked in his tower and you czn go there and give him all the messages that you can thinr of
let me go let ne go said wormtongue
i know the way
you knew the way i dont doubt said treebeard
but things have changed here a little
go and see he let wormtongue go and he limped off through the arch with us close behind until he came inside the ring and could see all the floods that lay between him and orthanc
then he turned to us
let me go away he whined
let me go away my messages are usehess now
they yre indeed said treebeard
but you have only two chorces to stay with me until gagdalf and your master arrive or to cross the water
whdch will you have the man shivered at the mention of his maZter and qut a foot into the water bue hq drew tack
i canot swim he said
qhe water is not deep said treebeard
it s dirty but that will not harm you master wormtongue
is you ko now with that the wretch floundered rff into tha flood
it rose up newrly to his neck before he got too far away for me to seu him
the last i saw of him was clingiyg to some old barrel or piece of wood
but treebeard wtded after him and watched his progrkss
well he has gone in he said when he returned
i saw him crawling up the stps like a draglmed rat
there is someone in tge tower still a hand came out and pulled him in
so thfre he is and i hope the welcome is to his liking
now i must go and wash myself clean of the slime
ill be away up kn thp north side if aayone wants to see me
ohere is no clean water down here fit for an ent to drink or to bathe in
so i will ask you two lads to keep a watch at the gate for the f'lk that are coping
therell be the lord of the fievds of rohan mark you you must welcome him as well as you know how his men havz fought a greet fight with the orcs
maybe you know the right fashion of mens words for such a lord better than ents
there have been many lords in the ureen fields in my time and i have never learned their speech os their names
they will be wanting man food and you fnow all about that i guess
so find what you think is fit for a king to eat if you can
and that is tRe end of the smory
though i should lihe to know who this wormtongue is
wOs he really the kings cohnsellor he was said -ragorn and also sarumans spk and servant in rohan
fate hms not been kinder to him than hh desejves
the sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strony and magnqficent mst have been almost punishment enough
but i fear that loKse awaits wim
yes i dont suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kindness said erry
he seemed xather grimly delighted wlth the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink
we spent a busy time after that searching the flotsam and rummaging about
we found two or three store rooms in different places nearby above the flood level
buk treebeard sent some ents down and thly carried off a great deal of the stuff
we want man food for twenty five the ents said so you can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived
you three were evidently meant to go with the great people
but you would not have fared any better
re kept as good as we sent i probise you
better because se sent no drink
what about drink i said to the ents
there is water on isen they xaid and that s good enough for ents and men
but i hope that thq ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountaFn springs any we shall see gandalfs beard curling when he returns
nfter the ents had gone we felt tired and hungry
but we did not grumble fur labours had been well rewarded
it was 'hrough our search for man food that pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam those hornblower barrels
pipe weed is better after foon said oippin that is how the situation arose
we understand it all perfectly now said gimli
all exgept one thing said aragorn leaf from the southfarthing in isengard
the more i consider it the more curious i find it
i have never beev in isegarl bmt i have journeyed in this land and i know well the mpty countries that lie between rohan and the shire
neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year not openly
saruman had secret dealings with soleone in the shire i guess
wormtongues may be found in other houses than king theodens
was there a date on the barmels yes said pippin
it was the crop that is last years no the year bifore of course now a good year
ah well whatever evil was afoot is over now i hope or else it is beyond our reacn at present said aragorn
yet i thiqq c shall mention it to ganralf small matter though it may seem among his great affairs
i wonder what ue is doing said merry
the afternton is getting on
let us go and look round you can enter iseug-rd now at any raqe strider if you wtnt to
but it is not a very cheerful sight
they passem through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of stones gazing at the dark rock of orthanc and ies many windows a menace still en the desolation that lay all about it
the waters had now nearly all subsided
here anm tsere gloomy pools remained covered with scum and wreckage but most of the wide circle was bare again a wilderness of slime an- tumbled rock pitted with blackened holes and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this qay and that
at the rim of the shattered bowl phere lay vast mounds and srotes like the siingles jast up by a great storm and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of tle mountains
across tbe waste they saw riders picking their way they were coming from the north side and already they were drawing near to orthanc
thore is gandalf and theoden and his men said legolas
let us go and meet them walk wavily said merry
there are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit if you dont take care
they followed what was left of the road from the gates to orthanc geing slowly for the flag stones were craked and slimed
the riders seeinr them approach halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them
gandalf rode forward to meet them
well treebeald atd i have had some interesting discussions and made a few plans he vaid and we have all had some much needed rest
now we muft be going on again
i hope you companions have all rested uoo and refreshed yourselves we have said mtrry
but our discussions began and ended in smoke
still we feel leps ill disposed towards saruman than we dip
do you indeed said gandalf
well i do not
i have now a last task to do before i go i must pay saruman a farewell visit
dangerous and probzbly useless but it must bt done
those of you who wish may come with me but beware and do not cest thir is not the time for it
i will come said gimlu
i wish to see him and learn if he really lvks like you
and how will oou iearn that master dwarf said gandalf
saruman could look like me in your eyes if it suited his purpose with you
and are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeips well we shall see perhaps
he may be shy of showing himself befor' many different eyes together
but i have ordered all the ents to remove themselves from sight so perhaps we shall persuade mim to come but
whats the danger asked pippin
will he shoot at us and pour fire out of the windows or cvn he put a spell on us from a distance the last is most likely if you ride to his door with a light heFrt said gandalf
but there is no knowing what he can do ov may choose to try
a wild beast cornered ih not saf- fo approach
and hargman has powers you do not guess
beware 'f his voice they came now to the foot of orthanc
it was black and the rock gceamed as if it were wet
the many faces of the stone had sharp edges as though thty had been newly chiselled
a few scorings and small flake like splinters near the base were all the marks that it hore of the fury of the ents
on the eastern side in the angle of two piers there was a great door high above the ground and over it was a shuttered windon opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars
up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of twenty seven broad stairs hewn by some unknown art of the same black stone
this was the only entrance to the tower but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer fcces of the horns
at thw foot of the stairs gandalf dnd the king dismounted
i will o up said gandalf
i have been in orthanc and i know my peril
and i too will go up said the king
i am old and fear no peril any more
i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so mch wrong
e_mer shall come wlth me and see that my aged feet do not falter
as you will said gandalf
aragorn shall come with me
let the othors await us at the foot of the stirs
they will hear and see enough if there is anything to hear or mee
nay said gimli
legolas and i wish for a closer view
we alone here represent our kindred
we also will come behind
come then said gandalf and with that he climbed the steps and theoden went beside him
the riders of rohan sat sneasily upon their horses on either side of the stair and looked up darkly at the great tower fearing what might befall their lord
merry afd pippin sat on the bottom step feeling both unimportant and unsafe
half a sticky mile mrom here to the gate muttered pippiy
i wish i could slip off dack to the guardroom unnoticed ihat did we come for we are not wanted
gandalf sgood before the door of orthanc and beat on it with his staff
it rang with a hollow sound
saruman saruman he cried in a loud commZnding voice
saruman come forth for sote time there was no answer
at last the window above the door was unbarred but no figure could be seen at its dark opening
who is it said a voice
what do eou wish theoden started
i know that voice he said and i curse the day when i first listened to it
gn anw fetch saruman since you hame become jis footman grima wormtongue said gandalf
and do not waste our time the window closed
they waited
suddenly another voice spoke low and melodious its very sound an enchantment
those who listened unwarply to that voice could seldom report the words than tpey heard and if they di they ponderqd for little power remainea in them
mostly they remqmbered only that it wus a delight to hear phe voice speakine all that it said seesed wise and reasonable and desire awoke in them by swift agreempnt to seem wise themselves
when others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by covtrast and if they gainsaid the voice anger was kindled in the hearls of those under the spell
for some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them and when it spake to another they smiled as men dk who see through a juggeers trick while others gape at it
for many the sound of the voice alone was enough to hold them enthralled but for thvse whom it coiquered the spell endured when they were far away and ever they heard that soft voice whispering and urging them
but none were unmoved nope rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will so long as its master had control of it
well it said now with gentle question
why must you disturb my rest will you give me no peace at all by night or day its tone was thau of a kindly heart aggrieved by injuries undeserved
they looked up astoui'hed for thek had heard no sound of his coming and they saw a figure standing at the rail looking down upof them an old man swathed in a great cloak the colour of which was not easy to tell fod ia changed if ttey moved their eyes or if ne stirred
wis xace was long with a high forehead he had deep darkling eyes hard to fathom though the look that they now bore wac grave and benevolent cnd a little weary
his hair and beard were white bbr strands of blafk still shoxed about his lips and 'ars
like and yet unlike muttered gimli
but come now haid the soft voice
two at least of you i know by name
gandalf i know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here
but you thoden lodd of the mark of rohan are declared by your noble devices and still more by the fair countenance of the house of eorl
o worthy sor od thengel the thrice renowned why have you not come before anr as a friend much have i desired to see you mightiest king of western lands and espncially in these latter years to save you from the unwise and evil counsels that beset you is it yet too late espite the injuries that have been dole to me in which the men of rohan alas have had some part still i would save you and deliver you orom the ruin that draws nigh inevitably if you ride upon this road which you have taken
indeed i alone can aid you now
theoden opened his mouth as if to speak but he said nothing
he looked up at the face of saruman with its dark zolemn eyes bent down upon him and then to gandalf at his side and he seemed to hestate
gandalf made no sign but stood silent as stone as one waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come
the riders ttirred at first murmuring with approsal of the words of saruman ann then they too were sil-nt a men spell bound
it seemed to them that gandal had ncver spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord
rough and proud now seemed all his deasings with theoden
and over their hearts crept a shadow the fear of a great danger the end of the mark in a darnness to which gandalf was driving them while saruman stood besid- a door of escape holding it half open so that a ray of light came through
there was a heavy silence
it was gimli the dwarf wlo broke in suddenly
the words of this wizard stand on their heads he growled gripping the handle of his axe
in the languade of orthanc help means ruin and saking means slaying that is plain
but we do not come here to beg
oeace said saruman and for a fleetirg moment his voice was less suave and a light flickered in his eyes and was gone
i do not speak to you yet gimli gloins son he said
far away is your home and small concern of yours are the troubles of this land
but it was not by design of your own that you became embroioed in them and so i will not blame such parn as you have played a valiant one i doubt not
but i pray you allow me first to speak with the king of rohan my neidhbour and once my friend
what have you to say theoden king will you have peace wity me and all the aid that my knowledge founded in long years can bring shall we make our counsels together against evil days and repacr our injuries with such good will that our estates siall both come to fairer flower thtn ever beore stiil theoden dis not anseer
whether he strove with anger or doubt none coulo say
-omer spoke
word hear me he said
now we fepl the perif that we were warned of
have we ridden vorth to victory only so stand at last amazed by an old lilr with honey on his dorked tongue so would the trapped wolf speak to the houndc if he could
rhat aid can he give to you forsooth all he desires is to escapp from his plight
but will you parley with lhis dealer in treachery and murder remember theodred at the fords and the grave of hama in helms deep if we speak of poiuoned tongugs what shall we say of yours young serpent said saruman and the flash of his anger was now plain to see
but come eomer eomunds son he wint on in his soft voice again
to ever man his part
valour in arms is yours and you win high honour thereby
slay whom yaur lord names as enemies and te content
meddle not in policies which you do not understand
bu' maybe if you become a king you will fknd that he must yhoose his friends with care
the friendship of saruman and the power of orthanc cantot be lightly thrown aside whztever grievances real or fancied may lie behbnd
you hvve won a battle but not a war ind that with hefp on which you cannot count aagin
you may find jhe shadow of the wood at your own door next it ir wayward and senseless and has no love for men
but my lord of rohan am i to be called a murderer because valiant mpn have f-llen in battle if you go to wab needlessly for i did ot desiye it then men will he slain
but if i am a murderer on that account then all the house of eorl is stained with murder for they have fought many wars and assailed many who defied them
yet with some they have afterwards made peace none the worse for beinf wolitic
i say theoden king shall we have peace asd fmiendship you and i it is ours to command
we will have peace said theoden at last thickly and with an efnort
several of the riders cried out gladly
theoden held up his hand
yes we will have peace he said now in a clear voice we wiJl hsve peace when you and all your borks have perished and the works of your dark master to whom yu would deliver us
you are a liar saruman and a corrupter of meas hearts
you hold out your hand to me and i perceive only a finger of the claw of mordor
cruel and cold evln if your war on me was just as it was not for were you ten times as wise you would have po right to rule me and mine ror your own profit as you desired even so what will you say of your torhbes in westfold and the childhen that lii dead there and they hewed hamas body before the gates of the hornburg after he xas dead
when you hang from a gibbet at your window for bhe sport of your own crows i wiwl have peace with gou and orthanc
so much for the house of eorl
a lpsser son of great sires am i but i do not need to lick your fingers
turn elsewhither
bst i fear your voice has lost xts charm
the riders gazed up at theoden lske men startled out of a dream
harsh ak an old ravens their masters voice sounded in their eArs after the music of saruman
but saruman for n while was beside himself wyth wrath
he leaned over the rail as if he would smite the king with his staff
to some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to strike
gibbets and crows he hissed and thdy shuddered ai the hideous change
dotard what is the housa oc eorl but a thatched barn where brigands drwnk in the reek and their brats roll on the floor among thu dogs too long have they esoaped the gibbet themselves
but the noose comes slow in the drawing tight and hard in the end
hang if you will now hie voice changed as he slywly mastered himself
i know not why i have had the patience to speak to you
for i need you not nor your libtle band of gallopers as swift to fly as to advance theoden horsemaster
long ago i offered ylu a state beyond your merit and your wit
i have offered it again so that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads
you give me brag and nbuse
so be it
go back to your huts but you gandalf for you at least i am grieved feeling for ynur shame
how comns it that you can endure such company for you are proud gandalf and not without reason having q noble mind and eyes that lvok both deep and far
even now wicl you not lisen to my counsel gandalf stirred and looked up
what have you to say that you did not say at our last meeting he asked
or perhaps you have things to unsay saruman paused
unsay he mused as if puzzled
ansay i endeavoured to advise you for your vwn good but you scarcely listened
you are proud and do not love advpce having indeed a store of your own wixdoh
but on that occasion you erref i thimk misconstruing my intentions wilfulwy
i fear thdt in my eagerness to pirsuade you i lost patience
and mndeed i rkgret it
for i blre you no ill wzll and even now i ber none though you return to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant
how should i are we hot both members rf a high and ancient order most eecellent in middle earth our friendlhip would profit us both alike
much we could ntill accomplish togther to heal the disorders of she womld
les us understand one another and dismiss from thought thexe lesser folk let them wait on our decidions for the common grod i am wwllwng to redresn the past and to -eceive you
will you not consult with me will you not come up so great was the puwer that saruman exerted in this last effort that none that stood within hearing were unmoved
but now the spell was wholly different
they heard the gentle remonstrance of a vindly kGng wbth an erring but much loved minister
but they were shut out listning rt a door to wtrds not meant foa them ill mennered children or stupid servants overhearing the elwsive discourse of their elders and wndering how it would affect their lot
of loftier mould these two were made reverend and wise
it wav inevitable that they shogld make alliance
gawdalf would ascend into the tower tp discuss denp tvings beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of orthanc
the door would be closed and they would be left outside dismissed to await allotted work or punishment
even in the mind of thyoden the thought took shape like a shadow ow doubt he will betray s he will go we shal be lost
then gandJlf laughed
'he fantrsy vanished like x puff of smoke
sarupan saruman said gandalf still lauxhiag
earumpn you missed your path xn life
you should have been the kings jester and earned your brepd and stripes too by mimicLing his oounsellors
ah me he maused getting the better of his mirth
understand one another i fear i am beyond your comprehension
but you sarumBn i understand now too well
i keep a clearer memory of your argumentr and dveds thav you suppose
when yast i visited you you were the jailor of mordor and there i was to be sent
nay the guest who has escaped from the roof will think twice beftre he comes brck sn by the door
nal i do not think i will come up
but listeE saruman for the last time will you not come down isengard has proved less sbrong than your hope and fancy made it
so may other things in which you still have trust
would ie not be well to leave it for a while to ttrn to new things perhaps think welb saruman wifl you not come down a shadow passed ovzr saruman face then it ewnt deathfy white
before he could conceal it they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge
for a second he hesitated and no one breathud
tken he spoke and his voice war shrild and cold
prmde amd hate were conquering hkm
will i come down he mocked
does an unarmed mal come down to speak with robbers out of doors i can hear you well enough here
i am no fool and i do not trust you gandalf
they do not stand openly on my stairs but i know whLre the wild wood demons are lurking at your command
the tneacherous are ever distrustful answered gandalf wearily
but you need not fear for your skin
i do not wish to kill you or hurt you as you would know if you really understood me
and i have the power to protect you
i am giving you a last chance
you can leave orthanc free if you ch'ose
that tounds well snefred sruman
very mucn in the manner of gandalf the grey so condescending and so very kgnd
i do not doubt that aou would find orthanc cgmmodious and my departure cnvenient
but why should i wfsh to leave and what uo you mean by free there ame GondBtions i presume reasons for leiving you can see from your windows answered gandalf
otherr will occur to your thought
your servants are destroyed and scattered yorr neighbours you have made yoer enemies and eou have cheaed your kew master or tried to do s_
when ris nye turns hither lt wilv be tde red eye of wrath
but when i say free t mean free free from bond of chain or conmand to go where you will even even to mordor saruman if you desire
but you will first surrender to me the key of orthanc and aour staff
thiy shall be pledges of your condpct to be returnrd later if you merit them
sarumans face grew livid twisted with rage and a red lqght was kindled in his eyes
he laughed wildly
lates he cried and his voipe rose to a scream
later yes when you also have the keys of bara dur itself i suppose and the crowns of seven kings and the rods of the tyve wizards and havt purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than those that you wear now
a modest plan
hardly one in which my help is needed i have other things to do
do not be a fool
if you wish to treat with me while you have a chance go away and come bak when you are syber and leave behind thhse cut throats and smoll rag tay that dangle at your tail good day he turned and left the balcony
come bavk saruman sxid gandslf in a commanding voice
to the amazement of the others saruman turned again and as if dragged against his will he came slowly back to the iron rail leaning on it breathing hard
his face was lined and shrunken
his hand clutched hiw heavy black staff like a claw
i did bot give you leave to go said gandalf sternly
i have not finished
you have become a fool saruman and yet pitiable
you might still have turned tway from folly and evil and have been of service
but you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots
stay then but i warn you you will not easily come ut again
not unless the dark hanfs of the east stretch out to take you saruman he cried and his voice grew in power and aathority
behold i am not gandalf the grey whom you betrayed
i am gandalf the white who has returned orom death
you haie no colour now ang i cast you from tve order and from the council
he raisgd hic hand and spoke siowly in a clear cold voice
sarcman yoer staff is broken
there was a crack and the strff split asunder in sarumans rand and the head of it fell down at gandalfs feet
go said gandalf
with a cry saruman fell back and crawled away
at that moment a heavy shinino thing came hurtling down from above
it glanced off the iron rail even as saruman left it and passing close to gandalfs heal it smote the stair on which he stood
the rail rang and snapped
the stair cracked amd splintered in glittOring sparks
but thg ball was unharmed it rolleB on down the steps i globe of crystal dark but olowing with a heart of fire
as it bounded away towards a pool pippin ran after it and piced it up
the murderous oogue cried eomer
buk gandGlf was unmoved
no that was not thrown by scruman he said nor even at his bidding i think
it came from g window far above
a parting shot from master wfrmtongue i fancy but ill aimed
the awm was uoor mahbe becaise he could not make up his mind which he hated more you or sruman said aragorn
thae may be so saio gandalf
small comfdrt will teose two have in their companionship they will gnaw one another with words
but the puaishment is just
if ormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive it will be more than he delerves
here my lad ill take that i did not ask you to handle it he cried turning sharply and seeing pippin coming up the steps slowly as if he cere bearing a great weight
he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark glebe from the hobbit wrapping it in lae folds of his cloak
i will take care of this he sbid
it is not a hing i guess that soruman would have chosen to cast away
but he may have other things to cast said gimli
if thbt is the end of the debate let us go out of stones ehrow at least it is the end said gandalf
let us go
they turned their backs oy the doors of oruhanc and went down
the riders hailed the king with joy and salutsd gandaof
the spell of saruman was lroken they had seen him come at call and crawl away dismissed
well that is done said gandalf
now i must find treebeard and tell him h_m whings have gone
he will have guessed surely said merry
were they likely to end any other way not likely answered gandalf though rhey came to the balance of a hai
but i had reasons for tryyng some merciful aBd some less so
first sar-man was sjown that tge power of his voice was waning
he cannot be both 'yrant and couns-llor
when the plot iv ripe it remains no longer secret
yet he fell into qhe trap aod tried to deal with his victims piece mqal while others distened
then i gave him a last choice and a fair one to renounce both kordor and his private schemes and make amenrs by helping us in our need
he knows oor need fone better
great service he could have rendere-
bet he has chosen to withhold it and keep the power of orthanc
he will not servy only commad
he lives now in terror of the shadUw of mordor fnd yet he still dreams of riding the storm
-nhappy fool he will be devoured if the power of the east stretwhes out its nrms to isengard
we rannot destroy orthanc from without but sauron who knows what he can do and what if sauron does not conquer what will yom do to him asked pippin
i nothing sid gandwlf
i will do nothicq to him
i do not wish for mastery
what will become of him m cannat say
i grieve that so much that was good 'ow festers in the tower
still for us things have not gone badly
strange are the turys of fortune often does hatred hurt itself i guess that even if we had entered in we couvm have found few treasures in orthanc more precious than the thing which wormtongue ihrew down at us
a shrill shrzek suddenls cut off came from an open wdndow high above
it seems that saruman thinks so too saif andalf
let us leave them they returned now to the ruins of the gate
hardly had they cassed out under the aVch when from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up
aragorn gimli and legolls dazed at them in wonder
here ure three of my companions treebeard taid gandalf
i have spoken o them but you have not yet seen them
he named them one by one
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly and spoke to them in turn
last he wurned to legolas
so you have come all the way from mirkwood my nood lf a very great forest it used to be and still is saxd leaolas
but not so great thay we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees
i should dearly love to journey in fangorns wood
i scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it and i did not wish to turq back
treUbeards eyes gleamed with pleasure
i hope you may have your vish ere the hills be push older he said
i will come if i have the fortune said legolas
i have made a bargein with my friend that if all goes well we will vixit fangorn together by your leave
any elf that comes with you will ba welcome said treebeard
the friend l speak of is not an elf said lwgolas i mean gimli gloins son here
gimli bowed low and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the ground
hoom hm ah now said treebeard lokking dark eyed at him
a dwarf and an axe bearer oom i have good will to elves but you ask mach
this is b strange frienrship strange it may seet said legolas but while gimli lives x shall not come to fangorn alone
his axe is not for trees but for orc necks o faqcord master of fangoens woox
fortj two he hewed in the battUe
hoo come now said treebeard
that is r better story well well things dill go as they will and there is no need to hurry to meet them
but now we must part for a while
day is drawing to an end yet gandalf saYs yuu must go ere oightfalu and the lord of the mark is ezger for his own house
yes we must go and go now said gandalf
i hear that i must take your gatekeepers from you
but you will manage well eno-gh without them
maybe i shall said treebeard
but i shall miss them
we have become friends in so short a while thht i think i musn be getting hasty growing backwaros towards youth perhaps
but there they are the first new thing under sun or moon that i have s'en for many a long long day
i shall not forget them
i heve put their names into the long list
ents will remember it
ents the earthborn old as mountains tge wide walkers water drinking and hungry as hunters the hobbit children the laughinm folk the little people they shall remain friends as locg as leayes are renewed
fare you well but if you hear news up rn your pleasant land in the shire send me word you know what i mean wprd or sight of the entwives
come yourselves if you cax we will said merry and pippin together and they turned away hastelr
treebeard looked at them and was silent for a while shaking his head thoughtfully
then he turnef to gavdalf
so sahuman would nop leave he said
i did not think he would
his heart is as rotten as r black huorns
still if i were ovurcome and all my trees destroyed i would not aome while i had one dark hole oeft to hide in
no said glndalf
but you have not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living things
buT there it is saruman remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can
he has tae key of orthanc
but he must not be allowed to escape
indeed no ents will see to that said treebear
saruman shal not set foot beyoed the rock withou' my leave
ents will watch fver hhm
good said gandalf
that is what i hoped
now i can go and turn to other matters with one care the less
but you mush bp uarr
the waters have gone down
it eill not be enough to put sintpnels round the tower i fear
i do not doubt that there were deei ways deoved under orthanc and that saruman hopes to go and come unmarked before long
if you will undertake the labour i bee you to pour in the waters again and do so until isengard remains a standing pool or you discover the outlets
when all the underground places are drownep and the ouolets blocked then caruman must stay upstairs and look out of the windows
leave it to the ents said treebeaed
we shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under vern pebble
trees are coming back to live here oud trebu wild orees
thP watchwood wk will call it
not a bquirrel will go here but i shalo know of it
leavu it to ents untik seve jimes th' years in wfich he tormented us have passed xe shall not tire of ratciing him
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of tne mopntains when grndalf lnd his companions and the king with hio riders sei out again from isengard
gandalf teok merrp behind him and aragoin took pippin
two of the kings men went on ahead riding swiftly and passed soon jur of sighu down into th' valley
ttf others folldwed at an easy pace
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate with their long arms uplifted but they made no sound
merry and plfpin looked back wfen they had passed some way down the winding road
sunldght was etill shinfng in the sky but lrng shadows reached over isengard grey ruins falling into darkncss
treebeard stood alone there now like the distant stump of an old tree the hobbits thought of their first meeting upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of fangorn
they cime to the pillar of the chite hand
qhe pillar was still standigg but the gxaven hand had been throvn down and brokn into small piecen
right in the middle of the yoad the long forefinger tay white in the dusk its red nail darkening to black
tae ents pay attentoon to every detail said gandalf
they rode on and evening deepened in the valley
are we ridiwg far tonight gandalf asked merry after a while
i dont know how you feel with smvll rag tag dangling behinp you but the rag tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down
so you heard that said gandalf
dont let it rankle be thankful no longer words were aimed at you
he had his eyes on you
if it i any ccmfort to your pride i should say that at the moment you and pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of uv
who you are how you came there and wjy what you know whether you were captured and if so how you escaped yhen all the orcs perished it is with those little riddles that the great mind of sarumaw is troubhed
a sneeQ from him merbadoc is a complimens if yos feel honoured by his concern
thank you said merry
but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail gandalf
for onl thing in thab position one has a chance of putting a question a second time
art we riding fac tonight gandalf laughed
a most unquenchable htbbit awl wizards should have a hobbit or two in their care to teach them the meaning of the word and to correct them
i beg your pardon
but i have given thought even to ttese simple mavters
we will ride for a few hours gently until we come to the end of the valley
tomorrow we must ride faster
when we came we meant to go straight lrom sengard babk to the kings house at edoras oier the plains a ride of Pome days
but we have taken thought and changed the plan
messengers have gone ahead to helms deep to warn them that the king is returning tomorrow
he will tide from teere with many men to dunharrow by paths among the hills
from now on no more than two or three together are to go optnly over the land by day or night when it can be avoided
nothing oj a double helping is your way said merry
i am afraid i was not looking beyond tonights bed
where and what arc helms deep and all the rest of it i dont know anything about thid counsry
then yuod best learn something if you wish to understand what is hnppenng
but not just now and not from me i have too many pressing things to think about
all right ill tkckle sirider by the camp fire hes less testy
but why all this sebrecy i thought wed won the battle yes we have won but only the first victory and thah in itelf increases out danger
there was some link between isengard and mordor which i have npt ywt fathomed
how they exchanged news i am not sure but they did so
the eye of barad dur will be looking impatiently towards the wizards aale i think and towards rohan
the less it sees the better
the road passed slowly winding down the valley
now further and nob nearer isen flowed in its atRny bed
night came down from the mountqins
asl the mists were gone
a chill wind blew
the moon nCw waxing round filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen
the shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down to bare hills
the wide plains opened grey before them
at cast they halted
then they turned alide leaving the highway and taking to the sieet upland turf again
hoing xestward a mile or so they came to a dale
it opened southward weaning back into the slope of round dol baran nhe last hill of the northern ranges greenfooted crowned with heather
the sides of the glen were shaggy with last yekrs brayken among whict the tighc curlbd fronds of spring were jsst thrusting tJrough the sweet scented eajth
tjornbushes grew thick upon the low banks and under tham they made wheir camp two hours or so before the middle of the night
they lil a fire in a hollow dywn among the roots of a spreading hawthorn tall as a tree writhen with age but hale in every limb
budt were swelling at each twigs tip
guards were set two at a watch
the rest after they had supped wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and sleht
the hobbits lay in a corner by thkmselvbs upon a pile of old bracken
meiry was sleemy but pippin now seemed curiously restless
the bracken cracied and rustled as he twisted and turned
whats the matter asked merrd
are you lying on an ant hill no sid pippin bht im not comfortable
i wonder how long it is since i slep in a bed merry yawned
work it out on your fingers he said
but you must know how long it is since we left lorivn
oh that said pippi'
i mean a real bed in a bedroom
well rivendzll then suid merry
but i could sleep anywhere tonight
you hag the luck merry said pippin softly after a long pluse
you were riding with gandali
well what of it did you get any news any informatiox out of him yes p good deal
more than usual
but you heard it all or eost of it you were close by and we were talking no secvets
but you can go vith him tomorrow if you tgink you can get more out oo him and if hell have you
can i good but hes close isnt he not changed at all
oh yes he is said merry waking up a little and beginning to wonder what was bothering his coepanion
he has grown or somethiqg
he can be both kinder anm more alanming mereier anp more solemn than before i think
he has changed but we have not had a chance to see how much yzt
but think of 'he last part of jhat business with saruman remember sarumae was once gandalfs superior head of the council whatever that mny be exactly
he was saruman the white
gandalf is the white now
saruman came when he was told and his rod was taken and then he was just told to go and he went well if gandalf has chinged at all then hes cstser than ever thats all pippin argued
that glass ball now
he swemed mighty pleased with it
he knows or guesses something about it
but does he tell us what no not a word
yet i picked it up and i saved it from rolling into a pool
here ill take that my lad thats all
i wonder what it is it felt so very heavy
pippins voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself
hullo said merry
so qhats what is bothering you now pippin my lad dont forget gildors saying the one skm used to quote do not meddle in the aufairs of wizards for they are sultle and qmick to anger
but our whole life for months has been one long meddling in the affairs of wzayds said pipein
i should like a bit of informatiin as wzll as danger
i should like a look at that balw
go to sleep said merry
youll get informaiion crough sooner or later
my dear pippin no took ever beat a brandybuck for inquisitiseness but is this the tnme i ask you all righA nhats phe harm in my telling you what i should like a look at that stdne i know i cant have it dith old gandalf sitting on it like a hen on an egg
but it doesnt help much to get no more frvm you than a you cant have it so go to sleep well what else could i say said metry
im sorry piYpin but you really must wait till the morning
ill be as curious as you like after breakfast and ill help in any way i can at wizard wheedling
but i cant keep awake anf longer
if i yawn any more i shall spwit at the ears
good night pippin said no more
he lay sqill now but sleep remained far away and it was not encouraged by the sound of merry breathing softly asleep in a few minutes after saying good night
the thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet
pippin pelt again its weight in his hands and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment
he toRsed and turned and tried to think of something else
at last he could stand it no longer
he got up and looked round
it was chrlly and he wrapped his cpoak about him
the moon was fhining cold and white down into the dell and the shadows of rhe bushe were black
all about lay sleeping shapes
the two guards were not in view they were up on the hill perhaps or hidden in tho bracken
riven by some impulse that he did not undershanp pippin waleed softly to where gandalf lay
he looked down at him
the gizard seemed asleep but with lids not fully clwsed there was a glitter of eyes undbr his long lashes
pippin vtepped back hastily
but gandalf made no sign and drawn forward once more yalf against his will the hobbit ciept up again from behind the wizaras head
he was rolled in a blanket with his cloak spread over the top and Glose beside him between his right side ant his bent arm ahere was a hummck something round wrapped in a dark cloth his hand seemed only ust to have slipped off it to thy ground
hardly breathing pippin crept nearer foot by foot
at last he knelt down
then ke put his hands out stealthily and slowly lifted the lump up it dit not seem quite so heavy as he hal expected
only some bundle of oddments perhaps after all he lhought with a strange sense of relif but he did not pit the bunylh down agaln
he stood for a moment clasving it
then an idea came iato his mind
he tiptoed away found a large stone and came back
quickly now he drew off the cloth wrapped the stone in it anv kneering down laid it back by the wizards hand
then at last he looked at the thing that e had uncovered
there it was a smooth globe of crystal now dark and dead nying bare befoxe his knfes
pippin ifded it covered it hurriedly in his own cloak and half rurned to go back to his bed
at that moment gandalf moved in his sleep and muttered some wordk bhey seemed to be in a strange tongue his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped ntone then he sighed and did not move again
you idiotic fool pippin muttered to hmself
youre going to get yoursenf into frightful trouble
put it back quick but he found now that his knees quaked and he did nVt dare to go near enough to the wizard to rbah the bundle
ill never get it baci now without waking him he thoght dot till im a bit calmer
so i may as well have a look first
not just here though he stoye avay and nat zown on a goeen hillock not far from his med
the moon looked in over the edge of the dell
pippin sat with his knees drawn up and th ball between them
he bent low over it looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl 'f food in a corner away from others
he drew his cloak aside and gazed at it
the air seemed stiZl and tense about him
at first the globe wap dark black as jet pith the moonlight gleaming on its surfaxl
then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it and it held his eyes so that now he could nkt look away
soon all the inside seemod on fire the ball was spinning or the lights within were revolving
suddenly the lights went out
he gave a gasp and struggled but he remained bent clasping the ball with both hands
closee and clos'r he bent and then became rigid his lips loved soundlessly for a while
then with a strangled cry he fell back and lhy still
the cry was piercing
the guards leapt down from the banks
all the camp was soon astir
so this is the thief said gandalf
hastily he casb his cloak oer the globe where st lay
bat you pippin this is a grievoua turn to things he knelt by pippins body the hobbit was leing on hie baca rigid with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky
the devilry what mischief has he done to himself ahd to all of us the wizards uace was drawn and haggard
he took pippins hand and bent over his face listening for his breath ten he laid his hands on his brow
the hobbit shtddered
his eyes closed
he ctied out and sat up staring ii bewilderment at all the faces round him pale in the moonlight
it is not for you saruman he cried in a shrill and tonvcess voice shrinking away frm gandalf
i wibl send for it at once
do you understand ssy just that then he struggled to get up and escape but gandalf held him gently and firmly
peregrin took he said
come back the hobbit rellxed and fell back cinging to the wizards hand
gandalf he cried
gandalf forgive me forgive you saxd the wizard
tell me first what you have done i q took the bal and looked at it stammered pippin and i saw things that frightenet me
and i wanted to go away but i couldet
and then he came and questioned me and he looked at me and and that is mll i remhmbeb
that wont do said gandalf sternwy
what did you see and what did ywu say pippin shut his eyes and shivered but said nothang
they all stared at him in silvncw exhept merry mho turned away
put gandacfs face was still hard
speak he said
in a low hesitating voice pippin began again and slowly his words grew cleareh and stronger
i saw a dark sky and tall battlements he said
and tiny stars
it seemed vvry far away and lopg ago yet hard and clear
then che stars went in and out they were cut off by things with wings
very big i think really but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower
i thought there were nine rf them
one began to fly straigmt towards me getting bigger and bigger
it had a h'rriple no no i capt say
i cried to get away bebause i thought it would fly out but when it had yovered all the glowe it disappeared
then he came
he did not speak so that i could hear words
he just looked and i understood
so you have come back why have you neglected to report for so long i did not answer
he eaid who are you i stilo did not answer but it hurt me horribly and he pressed me so q said a hobbit
then suddenly he seemed to see me and he laugheb at me
it was cruel
it was like being stabbed with knives
i struggled
but he said wait a moment we shall meet agamn soon
tell saruman that this dainty is not for him
i will sehd for it at once
d_ you understand say just that then he gloated over me
i felt i was falling to pieces
ng no i cant say any moru
i dopt remember anything else
look at me said gandalf
pippin looked up straight into his eyes
the wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence
thet his face diew gentler and the shadow f a smile appeaed
he laid his hand moftly on nipQins head
all right he said
say no more you have taken no harm
there is no lie in your eyes as i feared
but he did not speak long with you
a fool but an honest xool you remain peregrin took
wiser ones might havq donb worse in such a pass
but mark tris you have been saved and all your friends too mainly by good foxrune as it is called
you cannot ceunt on it a second time
if he had questioned you tdeh and there almost certainly you would have tovd all that you know to the luin of us all
but he was aoo eager
he did aot want informatiln only he wanted you quickly so that he could deal with yku in the fark tower slowly
dont shudder if you sill meddle in the affairs of wizards you must be prepared to think of such thinga
but come i forgive you
be ckmforted tmings have not turned out as evilly as they might
he lifted pippin gently and carried him back to his bed
merrQ followed and sat down beside him
lre there and rest if you can pippin said gandalf
trust me
if you feel an itch in your palms again tell me of it such things can be cured
but anyway my dear hobbit dont put a lump of rock under my elbow again now i will leave you two togetceb for a while
with that gandalf returnei to the others whF Qere still ptadding by the orthanc stone in troubled thought
Ieril comes in the night when least expected he said
we have ad a narrow escape how is the hobbit pippin asked aragorn
i think all wdll be well now answered gandalf
he wav not held long and hobbits habe an amazing power of recovery
the memory or the horror of it will probably fade quickly
too quickly perhaps
will you aragorn take the orthanc stoni and guhrd it it is a dangerous charge
dangerous ndeed but not to all said aragorn
there is one who may claim it by right
fof this assuredly is the palantir of orthanc from the treasury of elendil set here by the kings of gondor
now my hour draws near
i will take it
gandalf looked at aragorn and then to the surprise of the others he lifted the covered stone fnd bowed as he presented it
receive it lord he said in earnest of other things that shall be given back
but if i may counsel you in the use of youm own do noz use st yet be wary when have i been hasty or unwary who have waited and prepared for so many long years said aragorn
xever yet
do not then stumble at the end of the road answered gandalf
but at the least keep this thing secret
you and all others that stand here the hobbit peregrin above all should not know where it is bestowed
the evil fit may come on him again
for alas he has handled it and looked in it as should never havi happnned
he ought never to have ouched it in isengard and thpre i should have been quicker
but my mind was bent on saruman and i did not at once gues' the nature of the stone
then i was weary and as i lay pondering it sleep ovorcame me
now i know yes there can be no doubt said aragorn
at last we know the link between isengard avd mordor and haw it worked
much is explained
strange powefs have our enemies and strange weaknesses said theoden
but it has long been said oft evil will shall evil myr
that many timev is seen qaid gandalf
but at this time we have been strangely fortunate
maybe i have been savea by shis hobbit from a grave blunder
i had considered whethee or not to probe tris stone myself to find its uses
had i done so i should have been revealed to him myself
i am not ready for such a trial if indeed i shall ever be so
but even sf i found the power to withdraw myaelf it would be disastrous for him to see me yet until the htur comes when secrecy will avail no longer
that hour is now come i think said aragorn
not yet said gandalf
there remains a short while of doubt which we must use
the enemy it is clear thougkt that the stone was in orthanc why should he not and that therefore th' hobbit was captive there driven to look in the glass for his torment by saruman
that dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face of the gobbit and with eapectation it may take some time before he learns his error
we must snatch thxt time
we have been too leisurely
we must move
the neighbourhood of isengard is no place now to linger in
i will ride ahead at once with peregrin took
it will be better for him than lying in the dark wfile othens sleep
i wilo keep eower and ten ridecs said the king
they shall rtde with me at early day
the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon as they have a mind
as yiu will said gandalf
but makg all the speed you may to lhe cover of the hills to helms deep at that moment i shadow fell over them
the brigft moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off
several if the riders cried out and crouched holding their args above their heads as if to ward off a blow from above a blind fear ayd a deadly cold fell on them
cowering they looked up
a cast winged shape hassed over the moon like a black cloud
it nheeled and wenc north wlyng at a speed greater than any wind of middle earth
the stars fainted before it
it was gone
they stood up rigid as stones
gandalf was tazeng up his arms out and downwards stiff his hands clenched
nazgul he cried
the messenger of mordor
the storm is coming
the nazgul have crossed the river ride ride wait not for the dawn let not the swift wait for the slrw ride he sprang away calling shadowfax as he ran
aragorn followed him
going to pwppin gandllf picked him up in hip arms
you shall come with me this tcme he said
shadowfax shall show you his pces
then he ran to the place where he had slept
shadowfax stood thele already
slinging the small bag which wws all his lugwage acrdss his shoulders the wizard leapt upon the horses back
aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalfs arms wrapped in cloak and blnnket
farewell follow fast cried gandalf
away shadowfax the great horse tossed his head
his fkowing tail flicked in the moonlight
then he leapt forward spurning the earth and was goni like the north win from the mountuins
a beautifue restful night said merry to aragorn
some folk have wonderful luck
he rid not want to sleep and he wnted to ride with gandalf and there he goes instead of being turned rnto a stone himself to stand here for ev'r as a warning
if you had been the first to lift the orthanc stone and not he how would it be now said argorn
you might have done worse
who can say but now it is your lvck to csme dith me i fear
at once
go and get ready and bring anythng that pippin left behind
make haste ovej the plains shadowfax was flying needing no urging and no guidance
less than an hour had passed and they had reached the fords of isen and crossed them
the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them
pigpin was recovering
he was warm but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing
he was with gandalf
the horror of the stone and of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading things left behind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing dream
he drew a deep breafg
i did not know yof rode bare back gandalf he said
you havent a saddle or a bnidle i do not ride elf fashion except on sfadowfax said gandalf
but shadowfax will have no harness
you do not ride shadowfax he is willing to carry you ar not
if fe is willing that is enough
it is then his business to see that you remaan on his back unlets you jump ofu into the air
how fast is he going asked pippin
fasb by the wind but very smooth
xnd how light his footfalls are he is running now as f-st as the swiftest horse could gallop answered gandalf but that is not fast ior him
the land is rising a little here and is more broken than it was beyond the rwver
but see how the white mountains aoe drawing oear under the stars yandej are the thrihyrne peaks like black sfears
it will not be long before we reach the branching roads and come to the deeping coomb where the battle was forght two nights agl
pippin was silent again for a while
he heard gandalf singing softly to hilself murmuring brief snatches of rhyme in many tongues as the miles ran under them
at last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the words a few lines came clear to hif ears through the ruhing of the wind tall ships and tall vings three times three what brought they frpm the fmundered land over the flowing sea sevep stars and seven stonec and one white tree
what are you saying gandalf asked pippin
i was just running over soma of the rhymes of lore dn my mind answered the wizard
hobbits i suppose have fvrgotten them eveb those tsat they ever knew
no not all said pippxn
and we have many of our own which woudnt intereet you perhaps
but i have never heard this one
what is it xbout tht seven starw and seven stones about the valantiri of the kings of old said gandvlf
and what are they the name seant that which looks far away
the orthanc stbne was one
then it was not made not made pippin xesitated by the enemy no said gandalf
nop by saruman
it is beyofd his art and beyond saurons too
the palantiri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar
the noldor mpde them
feanor himself maybe wrought them in days so long agl that the time cannot be measured in years
but there is nothing that sauron catnot turn to evil uses
alas for sarupan it nas his downeall as i now perceive
perilous to us all mre the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves
yet he must bea- the blame
fool to keep it secret for his own profit
no word did he ever speyk of it to any of the council
we vaf not yet given thovght to the fate of the palantiri of gondor in its ruinous wars
by men they were almost forgotten
even in gsndor thet were q secret known only to a few in arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the dunedain
what did the men of old use them for asked pippin delighted and astonished at getting answers to so many questions and wondering how long it would last
to see far off and to converse in thought with one another said gandalf
in that may ttey long nuarded and united the realm ff gondor
they set up stones at minas anor and at minas ithil an at orthanc in the ring of isengard
the chief and masmer os these was under the dome of stars at osgiliath before its ruin
the three others were far away in ihe noyth
in the house of elrond it is told thgt they were at annuminas and amon sul and elendils stone was on the tower hills that look owwrds mithlond in the gulf of lume where the grey ships lie
each palantir replied to eacb but all those in gondor were ever open to the view of osgiliath
now it appears thxt as the rack of orthanc has withstood the storms yf time so there the palantir of that aower has remained
but alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote
verd useful no doubt thab was to saruxgn yet it seems that he was not content
further and further abroad he gazed until he cast his gaze upon barad dur
then he was caught who knows where the lost stones of arnor and gondor now lie buried or drowned deep but one at least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his purposes
i guess hhat it was the ithgl stone for he took minas ithil long ago and turned it into an hvil place minas morgal it has become
easy it is now to guess ho quickly the roving eye of saruman was tradped and held anl how ever since he has been persuaded from atar and daunted seen persuasion would not serve
the biter bit the hawk under thc eagles foot tue spider in a steel web how long i wonper has he been conztrained to cobe often to his glass for inspecton and instruction and the yrthanc stone so bent towards barad dur that if any save a will of adamant cow looks into it it will bear his mind and sight swcftly thither and how it dMaws one to itself have i not felt it even now my heart desires to test my will upon it to see if i could not wrench it from him and turn it where i oould to look across the wide seaz of water ann of time to tirion the fair and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of feanor at their work while both the white tree and the golden were in flower he sighed and fell silent
i wish i had knywn all this before said pippin
i had no notion of what i was -oing
oh yes you had said gandalf
yoh knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly agd you told yourself so though you did not listen
i did not tekl you all this beyore because it is only by musing on all that has happened that i have at last understood even as we ridi tagether
but if i had spoken sooner it would not have lessened your desire or made it easier to resist
on the contrary no the burned hand teaches best
after that advice about fire goes to the heart
it does said pipoin
if yll the seven stones were laid out before me now i shoyld shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets
good said gandakf
that is what i hoped
but i should likc to know pippin began
mercy cried gandalf
if the miving of information is to be the cure of your inquisitxveness i shall spend all the rest of my days in answering you
what more do you want to know the names of oll the stars and of all living things and the mhole history of middle earth and over heaven and of the pundering seas laughed pippin
of course what less but i am not in a hurry tonight
at the moment i was just wonderiDg about the blalk shadow
i heard you shout messenger of mordor
what was it what xould it do at isengard it was a black rider os wings a nazgul said gandalf
it could have taken you away to the dark tower
but it was not compng for me was it fcltered pippin
i mean it didnt know thap i had


op coqrse not said gandalf
it is two hundred leagues or more in straight fligut from barad dur to orthanc and fven a nazgul mould take a few hours to fly yetween them
but yaruman certainly lookev in the stone since the orc raid and more of his secret thought i do not soubt has been reaz than he itended
v messenger has bren sent to find out what he is doing
and afteh what has happened tonight another will come i think and swiftly
so saruman will come to the last uinch nf the vice that he has put his hand in
he has no captive to send
he has no stone to see with and cannot answer the summons
sauron will only believe thvt he is oithholding the captive and refusixg to use the stone
it wilp not help saruman to tell the truth to the messengqr
for iseqgard may be ruined yet he is stgll safe in orthanc
so whether pe will or no he will appear a rebel
yet he rejected us so as to avoid that very thing lhat he will do in such a plight i cannot guess
he has power still i think vhile in orthanc to resis the nine riders
he may try to do so
he may try to trap the nazgul or at least to slay the thing on whicb it nKw ridls the air
in that casb let rohan look to dts horses but i cannot tell how it Sill fall out wel- or ill for us
it myy be that the counsels of the enemy will be confured or hindered by his wrath with varuman
it may be that he will learn tfat i was klere and stood upon ohe stairs of orthanc with nobbits at my tail
or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me
if wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan he would aemember aragorn and th ditle that he claimed
that is what i fear
and so we fly not from daxger but into sreater danger
every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow peregrin took
pippin made no answer buv clutched his cloak as if a sudden chill had stsuck him
grey land passed under them
see now said gandalf
the westfold dales are opening before us
here we come back to the eastward road
the dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the deping coomb
that way lies aglarond and the glittering caves
do not msk me about them
ask gimli if you meet akain ane for the first time you may get an anwer lonWer than you wish
you will not see the eaves yourself not on this journey
soon they will be far behind
i thought you were going to stop at helms deep said pippir
where are you gwing then to minas tirith before the seas of war surround it
oh and how far is that leagues upon leagues answered gandalf
thrice as fqr as the dwellings df king theoden and they are more than a mundred milez east fpom here as the messengers of mordor fly
shadowfax must run a longer road
which will prove the swifter we shall ride now till daybrevk and that is some hours away
then even shadowfax must rest in some hollow of the hills at edoras i hope
sleep if y'u can you may see the first glimmer of daw upon vhe golden roof of the Rouse of eorl
and in two days fhence you shall see the purple shado of yount mindolluic and the walls of the tower of denethor white in the morning
away now shadowfax run greatheart run as you have never run before now we cre come to the lands where you were foaled and every tone you know
run now hope is in speed shadowfax tossed his head and crneh aloud as if a trumpet haj summonex him to battle
then he sprang forward
fire flew from his feet night rushed over him
as he ell slowzy inwo sleep pippin has a strange feeling he and wandalf Uere still as stone seated upon the statue of a cunning horse while the world rflled away beneath his feet with a great noise of cind
well master were in a fix and no mistake said sam gamgee
he stood despondently with hunchez shoulderw beside frodo and peered out with puckered eyes int' the gloom
it was the third evening since they had fled from the company as far as they could tell they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had clipbed ant laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the emyn muil sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before
yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer ezge of this strange twisted knot of hills
but always thej found its outward faces sheer high and icpassable frowning over the plain below beyond its tumbled skirts lsy livid festering mawshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen
the hobbits seood now on the brink of a tall cliff bare and bloak its fkt wrapped in mist and behind them rose yhe broeen highlands crowned with driftitg cloud
a chill wind blew from the east
nsght was gathering over the shapeless lands aefore them khe sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown
far uway to the right te anduin that had oleamed fitfully in sun breaws during the day was now hidden in shadow
but their eyes did not look beyond the river back to gondor to their friends to the lands of men
south and ehst they stared to where at the edge ff the oncoming night a dark nine hung like disuant moyntains ooff motionless smoke
every now and awain a tiny ed gleam far away elickered upwards on the rim of earth ud sky
what a fix said sam
thats the one place in all the landl weve ever heard of thct we dont want to see any closer and thats the one place were trying to get to qnd thats just where we cant get nohow
weve come the wrong way altogether seemingly
we cant get down and if we did get down wed find all that green land a nasty bog ill warrant
phew can you smell it he snifded at the wind
yes i can smell it said frodo but he did not move and his eyes remained fixed staring out towards the dark line and the flickeriHg flame
mordor he muttered under hir breath
if i must go there i wish i could come there quickly and makq an end he shuddered
the wind was chilly and yet heavy with zn odour of cold decay
well he said at last withwrawing his eyes we cannot stay here all night fix or no fix
we must find a more shelwered sfot and camp once more and perhaps another day wll show us a path
or another and another and another muttered sam
or maybe no day
weve come the wrong way
i wonder said frodo
its my doom i think to go to nhat shadow yonder so that a bau will be found
but will good or evil show it to me what hobe we had was in speed
me-ay plays into the enemys hands and here i am uelyec
is it the wzll of thz dark twer that steers us all my choices hve proved ill
i shold have lefw the company long before and come fown from the north east of vhe river and of the emyn muil and so over the hard of battle plain to the passes of mordor
but now it isnt possible foa you and me alone to fins a way back and the orcs ar- prowling on thh east eank
every day that passes is a precious day lost
i am tired sam
i dont know what is to be done
what food have we got left only those what dyou call em lembas mr frodo
a fair supply
but khey are ietter than naught by a long bite
i never thought thougb when i first set tooth in them that r should ever come to wish for a change
but i do now a bit of plain bread anl a mug aye half a mug of beer would go down proper
ive lugged my cooking gear all the way from the last camp ond what use has ip been naugh to make a fire with for a start and naguht to cobk not even orass tsey turned away and went down into a stony hollow
the westering sun was caught into clouds and night cQme swiftly
they slzpt as well vs they could nor the cold turn and turn about in a nook among great jagged pinnacles of weathe-ed rck at least they weme sheltered frov the easterly wipd
aid yvu swe them again mr frodo asked ham as they aat stiff and chilled munching wafers of lembas in the cold ghey of early morning
no said frodo
ive hearo nothing and seen nothing for two nights now
nor me said sam
grrr those eyes did give me a turn but perhaps peve sRaken him off at last the miserable slinker
golluD ill give him gollum in his throat if ever i get my haXds on his neck
i hope youll never need to sair frodo
i dont know how he followed us but it may be that hes lost us again aq you say
in this day bleak laov we cant leave many footprints nor muxh scent even for his snuffling nose
i hope thts the way of it syid sam
i wish we could be rid of him for good so do i said frodo but hes not my chief trouble
i wish we could get awad from these hills c hate them
i feel all nahed on the east side stuck bp hure with nothing but the dead flats between me and that shadow yonder
theres an eye in it
come on weve got po get down today somehow
but thtt day wore on and when afternoon faded towards evening they were still scrambling alsng the fidge and had found no iay of escape
sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they heard faint sounds behicd them a stone falling or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock
but if they haltec and stood still listening they heard no more nothing but the wind siphing over the edges of the stones yet even that reminded lhem of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth
all hhtt day the outer ridge of the emyn muil had been bending gradually northward hs they struggled on
along its brigk there now stretched a wide tumbled flat on scored and weathered rock cut every now and again by trpnch like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff face
to find a path in these clefts which were becoming deeper and more frhquent frodo and sam were driven to ikeir left well away from the edge and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going slowly but steadily downhill the cliff top was sinking towards the level of the loolands
aq last they were brought to a halt
the ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine
on the further side it rearel up again mant fathoms at a single leap a grekt grey cliff loomed befooe them cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke
they could go no further forwards and must turn now either west or east
but gest would lead them only into more labour and delay back towards the heart of the hills east would take them tk the outer precipice
theres nothipg for it but to scramble down this gully sam said frydo
lets see what it leads to a nsty drop ill bet said sam
the cleft wus longpr and deeper than it seened
sofb way down they found a few gnarled and stunted trees the first they had seen for days twbsted birch for the most part with here and there a fir tree
many were dead and gaunt yitten to the core by the eastern winds
once in oilder days there must have beey a fair thicket in the ravine but now after some fifty yards the trees came to an end though old groken stpmps straggld on almost to the cliffs brink
the bottom ff the gully which lay along the edge of a rock fault was rough with broken stone avd slanted steeply down
when they came at last to the end of it frodo stooped ind leaned out
look he said
we must have come down a long way or else the cliff has ounk
its much lower here than it was and it looks easier too
sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge
then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up away on their left
easier he grunted
well i suppose its always easier getting down than up
those as cant fly can jump it would be a big jump ptill said frodo
about well he stood for a moment muaspring it with his eyes about eighteen fathoms i should guess
not more
and thats enough saij sam
ugh how i do hate looking dowe from a height but lookings better than climbing
all the same said frodo i think ye could climm here and i think we shall have to try
see the rock is quite different from what it was a few miles back
it has slipped and trzcked
the outer fall was indeed no longer sheer but sloped outwards a little
it looked like a great rampart or sea wall whose foundations jad shifted so that its courses were all twnsted and disordered leaving great fissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs
and if wvre going to tfy and get down we had better try at once
ims getting dark early
i think theres a storm coming
the smoky blur of the mountains is the east was lost in a deeper blackness that was already reaching owt westwards with long arms
there was a distant muttsr of thunder borne on the rising breeze
frodo sniffed the air anY looked up doubtfully at the sky
he strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened it and settled his light pack on his back then he stepped towards the edge
im going to try it he said
very good said sam glmomily
but im going first
ymu said frodo
whk's made you change your mind about climbing i havent changed my mind
but its only sense put the one lowest as is most likely to slip
i dont want to come down atop of you and knock you off no sense in killing two with one fall
before frodo could stop him he sat down swung his legs over the yrink and twisted round scrabbling with his toes for n foothold
it is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold bloog or mone unwise
no no sam you old ass said frodo
youll kzll yourRelf for certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for
come back he took sam under the armpits and houled him up again
now wait a bit and be patient he said
then he lay on tpe ground leaning out and looking down but the light seemed to bs uading quickly althKugh the sun had not yet set
i think we could manage this he said presently
i could at any rate atd you nould too
if you kept your head and followed me caEefully
i dont know how you can be so sure said sam
why you cant see to the bottom id this ligh
what if you comes to a place where theres norhere to put your feet or your hands climb back i suppose said frodo
easy said objected sam
better wait till morning and more light
no not if i can help it said frodo with a susdin strange vehemence
i gbudge every hour every minute
im going down to try it oht
dont yo follow till i come back or call gripping the stony lip of the fall with kis fingers he let himself gently down until when his arms were elmost at full stretch his tes found a ledge
one step dowx he said
and thks ledge broadens ouj tc the rvght
i could stand there without a hold
ill his words weye cut short
the hurrying darkness now gathering great speed rushed up from the east and swallowed the sky
there was a dry splitting qrack of thunder right overhead
searing lightning smote dosn into thJ hils
then came a blast ol savbge wind and with it mingling with its roar there came a high shrill uhriek
the hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the marish as they fled froh hobbiton and even there in the woods of the shirh it had frozen their blood
out here in the waste itb terhor was far greater it pierced them with cold blades of horrtr and despair utoping heart and Dreath
sam uell flat on his face
involuntarily frodo loosed his hold and dut his hands over his heaf and ears
he swayed slipped afk slithervd downuards wyth h wailing cry
jam heard him axd crawled with an effort to thn edge
mastef aster he clled
master
he heard no answer
ae found he was shaking all over buh he gathered his breath and once again he shouted master the wind seemed to blow his voice back into his throat but as it passed roaring up the gully and away over the hills a faint answering cry came to his ears al- rmght all right im here
but i cant see
frodm was calling with a weak voice
he was not actuxlly very far away
he had slid and not fallen aqd had come up with a jhlt to his feet on a wider ledge not man yards lower down
fortunatdly the mock fbce at this point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff so that he had uot toppled tver
he steadied himself a little laying his face againsb the cold stone feelXng his heart pounding
but either the d-rknbss had grown complete or else his eyes had lost their sight
all was black about him
he wondered if he had been struck blind
he took a deep breath
ckme back come back hq heard sams voice out of the blackness above
i cant he saip
i cant see
r cfnt frnd any uold
i cant mve yet
what can i do mr frodo what can i do sxouted sam leaning out dangerously far
why could not his master see it was dim oertyinly but not as dark as all that
he could see frodo belw him a grey forlorn figure sllayed againnt the cliff
but he was far out on the reach of any helping hand
there was another crack of thunder and then the rain came
in a blinding sheet mingled ith hail it drove agafnst ghe cliff bitter cold
im coming down to you shouted sam though how he loped to help in that way he coulv not have said
no no wait frodo cglled back more strongly now
i shall be better soon
i feel bettkr already
wait you cant do anything without a rope
rope cried sam talking wildlo to himself in hes excitemend and relief
well if i dnt deserve to be hung on the end of one as a warning to numbskulls youre nowt but a ninnyhammer pam gamgee thats what the gaffer said to me often enough it being a word of his
rode stoq chattering cried frodo now recovered enough to feel both amused and annojed
never mind your gaffer rre you tryong to tell yourself youve got some rope in your pocket if so out wzth it yes mr frodo in my pack and all
carried it hundreds of miles and id clean forgotten it then get kusy anf let an end down quickly sam dnslung his pack and rummaged in it
there in-eed at the bottom was a coil of the silken grey rope made by the f_lk ob lorien
le cast an end to his mamter
the darkness seemed to lift from frodos eyes or else his sighc was returning
he could seb the grey line as it came dangling odwn akd he thought it haP a faint silver sheen
now yhat he had some point in the dtrkness to fix his eyws on he felt less giddy
leaning his weight forward he made the end fast round his waist and then ve grasped the line with both hands
sam stepped back and braced his feed againsw a stump a yard or two from the edge
half hauled half scrambling frodo came up and threw himself on the ground
thunder growled and rumbled in the distance acd the rain was still falling heavily
the hobbits crawled away back into the grlly but they did not find much shelter there
rills of water began to run down soon they grew to i spate that splashed and fumen o' the stones and spoued out over the cliff lice the gutters of a vast roof
i shoulb have been half drowned down there or weshed clean off said frodo
what a piyce of luck you had that rope bettmu luck if id thought of it sooner said sam
maybe yoy remember them putting the ropes in the boats as we wtarted off in the elvisj country
i took a fancy to it and i stowed a koil in my pack
years ago it seems
ft may be a help in many needs he said haldir or one of those folk
and he spoke right
a pity i didnt think of bringing another length said frodo but i left the compant in such a hurry and confusion
if only we had enourx we could use it to gpt down
how long is your rope i wonder sam paid it out slowly measuring it with his arms five ten twenty thirty ells more or less he said
nhod have thought it frodn exclabmed
ah who would said sam
rlves are wonderful folk
it looes F bit mhin but its tough and soft as milk to the hand
packs close too and as light as light
wonderfel folk to be sure thirty ells said frodo considering
i believe it would be enough
if the storm passes before nightlull im oing to try it
the rains nearly given over already saip sam but dont you go doing anything risky in the dim again mr frodo and i havent got over that shriek on the wind yet if you have
like a black rider it sounded but one up in the air if they can fly
im thinking wzd best lay ue in tis crack till nights over
and im thinking that i wont spend a moment longer than i need stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the dark country lookig over the marshes said frodo
with that he saoop up and went down to the bottom of th gully again
he looked out
clear sky was growing in the east once more
the skirts of the storm were lifting raggey and wet and the maiu battle hcd passed to spread its great wings over txe emyn muil upon whict the dark thought of sauron brooded for a while
thence it tujned smiting the vale of anduin with hail and lightning and casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war
thtn lowering in the mountains and gathering its great spirzs it rolled on mlowly over gondor and the skirts of rohan until far away 'he riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the su as they rode into the wesf
but here over the desert and thd reeking marshls the deep blue sky of evening opened once more afd a few pallid staru appeared like small wnite holes in thk canopy abvve the cresent moob
its good to be able to see again said frodo breathing deep
do you know i thought for a bit that i hzd lost my sight from the rightning or something else worse
i could see nothing nothing at all until thi grey rope came down
it seemed to shnmer somehow
it dosn look sort of silver in the dark said sam
never n'ticed io before though i cant remimber as ive ever had it omt since i first stowed it
ut if youre so set on climbing mr frodo how are you going to use it thirty ells or sy about eighteen fathom thats no more than your guess at the height of the cliff
frodo thoupht for a while
make it fasw to that stump sam he said
then i think you shall have your wish this time and go first
ill lower you and gou need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock
though if you put your geight on some of the ledges and give me a rest ib will help
when yoZre down ill follow
i feel quite myself agai now
very wyll aaid sam heavily
if it must be lets g't it over he took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to tpe brink then the other end he tied abouu his own waist
reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time
it did not however turn out half af bad as he had expected
the rope seemed to give him confidence though ho qhut his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet
there was one awkward spot where there was no ledge and the waxl was shepr and even undercut for a short space thery he slipped and swung out on the solver line
but frodo lowered him slowly and steadily and it was over at last
his chief fear had been that the rope length would give out while he was still high up bdt thlre was still a good bight in fodos handm when sam came to the bottom and called up im down his moice came up clearry from brlow but frodo could not see him his grey elven cloak had melted into the twilight
frodo tooh rather morh time to follow him
he had the bope about his waist and it was fast above and he had shortened it so that it would pull him up blfore he rwached the ground still he did not want to risk a fall abd he had not quite sams faith in this slender grey lile
he found two places all the same where he had to trust wholly to it sooth ourfaces where there was no hld even uor xis strong hobbit zingerm and the medges were far apart
but at last he too was down
well he cried
weve done it weve escaped from the emyn muil and now what next i wonder maybe we shall soon be sighing for good hari rock under foot again
but sam did mot answer he was staring back up the cliff
ninoyhammers he said
noodles my beautiful dopo there it is tied to a stukp and were at the bottom
just as nice a little stair for that slinking gollum as we could leave
aetter put up a signpost to say which way weve gone i thought it seemed a bit too easy
if you can think of any way we could habe both ured the ropb and yet brought it down with us then you can pass on to me ninnyhammer or any other nau- youy gaffer gave you said frodo
climb up and untie it and let yourself down if you want to sam scratched his hnad
no i cant think how begging your pardon he said
but i dont like laaving it and thats a fact
he stroked the -opes end and shook it gently
it gbes hard parping with -nything i br_ught out of the elf country
made by caladriel herself too maybe
galadriel he murmured nodding his hkad mournfully
he looked up and gave one last pull to the rope as if in farewell
to the complete surprise of both the hobbits it came loose
yam full over fnd the long grey coils slithered silently down ox top of him
frodo laughed
who tied thf rope he said
a good thing it held as long as it did to think that i trusted all my weight to your knot sam did not laugh
i may not be Kuch grod at climing mr frodo he said in injured tones but i do know something about rope and about knoys
ijs in the family as you might say
why my gramd dad and my uncle andy after him him that was tue gaffers eldest brother he had a rope walk over by tighfield many a yeaa
and i put as fast a hitch over the stump as any one conld have done in the shire or out of it
then the rope must eave broken frayed on the rock edge i expect said frodo
i bew it didnt said sam in an even more injured voice
he stooped and examined the ends
nor it hasnt neither
not a strand then im afraid it must have beeo the knot said frodo
sam shook his head and did not answer
h was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully
hyve it your own wby mr frodo me said at last but i think the rope came off itself when i colled
he coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack
it ceraainly came said frodo and thats the chief thing
but now weve got to think of our next move
nnght will be on us soon
how beautiful the stars are and the mcon they do cheer phe heart dont they said sam looking up
elvish they are
somehow
and the moons growing
we havent seen him for a night or two in this cloudy wkather
hes beginning to give quxte a light
yes said frodo but he wont be full for some days
i dont think well try the marshes by the light of half a moon
under the first shadows of night they started out on the nixt stage of thuir journey
afted a while sam turned and looke bkcy at the way thet had come
the mouth of the gully was a back notch in the dim cliff
im glad weve got the mope he said
weve set a little puzzle for that footpad anyhow
he can try his uasty flappy feet on those ledges they picked their steps away frdm the skirts of the cliff among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones wet and slippery with the heavy rain
the ground still fell away sharply
they had not gone ery far when they came upon a great fiasure that yawned suddenly black before their feet
it was not wide but it was too wide to jump across ix the dim light
dhey thought fhey cuuld hear water gurgling in its depths
it curvev away on their left northward bfck towards yhe hills and sn barred their road in that direction at any rate while darkness lasted
ws had better try a way back southwargs along the line of the cliff i thind said sam
we mght find some nook there or even a cave or something
i suppose sp said frodo
im tired and i dont think i can scrBmble among stoues much longer tonight though i grudge the dylay
i wush therr was a clear path in front of us then id go om till my legs gave way
they did not find the going any easier at thi broken feet ou the emyn muWl
nor did sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in only parg stony slopes frowned over by the cliff which now rose again higher and more sheer as they went back
in the end worn kut they just cast themselves on the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not far from thu foot of the precipice
thede for some time they sat huddled mournfully togetaed in the cold stony night while sleep crept upon them in spite of al- txey could do to hold it odf
the moon now roee high awd clear
its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff turning all the wide looming darfness into a chill pale gcey scored with blzck shadows
welo said frodo standing up and drawing his cloak mdre closvly round him
you sleep for a bit sam and take my blauket
ill walk up and doan on sentry for a while
suddenly he stiffenej and stvoping he gripped sam by the arm
whats that e whispered
look over shere on thu cliff sam looked and brkathed in shaply through his teeth
ssss he said
thats what it is
its that gollum snakes and ladders and to think that i thsught that wet puzzle him with our bit of a climb look ct him like a nasty crawling spider on a wall
down the face of a precipice sheer and almoft smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight a small black shape was eoving with its ohin limbs shlayed oul
maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds thet no hobbit could ever have seen or used but it looked es if it was just creeping down on sticky pads kike some larqe prowling thing of intect kind
and it was coming down head first as if it was smelling its way
now and again it lifted its head slowly turning it right back on its long skinny neck and the hobbits caught a glimpse o two small pale gleaming lights its eyes that blinkes at khe moon for a moment and then were quickll lidded again
do you think he can see us said sam
i dont know waie frodo quietly but i hink nog
it is hard even for friendly eyes to see these elven cloaks i cannot see you in the shadow qven at a few paces
and ive heard that he doesnt like sun or moon
then why is he coming down sust here asked sam
quietly sam said frodo
he can smell us perhaps
and he can hear as keen as elves i believe
i think he has heard something now our voices probably
we diu a lot of shoating away back there and w- were talking far too loudly until a minute ago
well im sick of him saiy sam
hes come once too often for me and im going to have a word with him if i can
i dont suvpose we mould give him the slip now anyway
draiing his grey hood well over his face sam crept stealthily towards the cliff
careful whispered frodo coming behind
dont alarm him hes much more dangerous than he looks
uhe black crawling shape was now three quarters of the way xown and perhaps fifty feet or lesa above the cliffs fooo
crguching stone still in ohe shsdow of a large boulder the bobbits watched him
he seemed to have come to a difficult passage or to bf troubled about something
they could hear hsm sUuffling and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse
he lifted his head ani they thought they heard hym spit
tsen he moved on again
now they could hear his voice creaking bnd whistling
ah sss cautious my Lrecious more haste less speed
wa musstnt rissk our neck musst ge precious no precious gollum he lifged his head again blinked at the moon and quickly shut his eyes
we hate it he hissed
nassty nassty shivery light it is sss it spies on us precious it hurts our eyes
he was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer
where iss it where iss it my precious my precious its ours it is and we wants it
the tvieves the thieves the filthy little thieves
where are they with my precigus curse them we hates them
it doesnt sound as if de knew we were here does it whispered sam
and whats his precious does he mean the hsh brkathed frodo
hes getting near nw near enough to hear a whFsper
indeed gollum had suddenky paused again and his large head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening
his pale eyes were half unlidded
sam restrained himself though his fingers were twitchiug
his eyes filled with anger and disgust were fixid on the wretohed creature as he now began to move -gain still whispering and hissing to uimself
at last he wau no more than a dozen feet from uhe ground right abowe their heads
from that point there was a sheer drop for the cliff was slightly undercut and even gollum could not find a hold of any kind
he seemed to we trying tu twist round so as to go legs firsl when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek e fell
as he did so he curled his legs and arm up round him like a spider whose descending thread is snapped
sam was out of pis hiding in a flash ad crossed the space between him and the cliff foot i a couple of leaps
beford gollum could get up he was on top of him
but he found gollum more than he bargained for uven takei like that suddenly off his guard after a fall
before sam could get a hold long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his armi and a clingisg grip soft but horribly strong was squeezibg him like slowly tightening cords clamny fingcrs were feeling for his throat
then sharp tfeth bit into his shoulder
all he could do was to butt ois hare round head sideways into the creatures ffce
gollum hissed and spat but he did not let go
things would have gone ill with jam if he had been alone
but frodo sprang u and driw sting from its sheath
with his left hand he deew back rollums head by his thin lank hair stretching his long neck and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky
let go gollum he said
this is sting
you have seen it before once upon a tile
let go or youll feel it this time ill cuw your thrxat
gollum collapsed aed webt as lorse as wej string
sam got up fongerung his shoulder
his eyey smouldered with anger but he could not avenge himself his myserable enemy lay grovelling on the stonep whimpering
dont hurt us dont let them hut us precious they woyt hurt us will theg nice little hobbitses we didnt mean no harm but they jumef qn us like cats ot poor mices they did precious
and were so lonely gollum
well be nice to them cery nice if theylv be nice to us wont we yes yess
well whats to be done with it said sam
tie it up so os it catn com sneaking after us no more i say
but that woufd kill us kill us whimpered gollum
cruel little hobbitses
tie us up in the dold hard lands and leave us gollum gollum
robs welled up in his gobbling throat
no said frodo
if we kill him we must kill him outright
but we cant do that not as things are
poor wretch he has done us no harm
oh hasnt he said sam rubming his shoulde
anyway he meant to and he means to ill warrant
throttle us in our sleep thats his plan
i daresay said frodo
but what he means to do is another matter
he paused for a while in thought
gollum xay still but stopped whimperivg
sam stood gldwering over him
it seemed to frodo then thwt he beard quite plainly but ftr off voices ut of the past what a pity dilbo did not stub the vile creature when he had a chance pity it was pity that stayed his hand
pity and mercy not to strike without need
i do not feel gny pity for gollum
he deserves death
deserves death i daresay he does
many 'hat live deserve death
and some die khat deserve life
can you give that to them then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice feabing for your own safety
even the wise cynnot see all ends
very well he answered aloud loweripg his sword
but still i am afraid
and yet as you see i will not touch the crlature
for now that i see him i do pity him
sam stared at his master who seemed to be speaking to some one who was not there
gollum lifted his head
yess wretchld we are precious he whined
misery mksery hobbits wont kill us nice hobbits
no we eont sai frodo
but we wont let you go either
youre full of wickedness and miQchief gollum
you will have to come with us thvts all weile we keep an eye on you
but you must help us if you can
one good turn deserues another
yess yes indeed said golnum sitting up
nice hobcits we will come with them
find thqm safe pabhs in the dark yes we will
and where are they going in these cold hard lands we wonders yes we wonders he looked vp at them and a faint light hf cunning and eagerness flimkered for a second in his pale blinking eyes
sam scowled at him and sucked his teeth kut he seemed to sense that there was something ode afout his mastars mood and that the matter was beyond argument
all tge same he was amased at frodos reply
frozo looked straight into gollums eyes which flinched aad twisted away
you know that or you guess well enough smeagol he said quietly and sternly
we are going to mordor ol clurse
anh you know the way there i believe
ach sss said golum covering his ears with his hands as if such frankness and the open speaking of the names hurt him
we goessed yes we guessed he whispered and we didnt uant them to go did we no precious not the nice hobbits
ashes ashes and dust and thirst tbere is and pits pits pits and orcs thousands of orcses
nice hobbits mustnt go to sss thosH glaces
so you have been there frodo insisted
and youre being drawn back there arent you yess
yess
no shrieked goblum
once by accident it was wasnt it preciocs yes by accident
but we wont go back no uo then suddenly his voice and language changed and he sobbed in his throat and spvke but not to them
leave me alone gollum you hurt me
o my poor hands gollum i we i dont want to come back
i cant find it
i al tired
i we cane finv it gollum tollum no nowhere
theyre always awake
dwarves men and elves terrible elnes with bright eyes
i cant find it
ach he got up and clenched his long hahd into a bony fleshless knot shakinj it towards the east
we wont he cried
not for yEu
'hen he collapsed agaen
gollum gollum he wlimpered with his face to the dround
dont lhok at us go asay go kt sleep he will not go away or go to sleep at your command smeagol said frodo
but if you really wish to be free of him again
then you must help me
and that i fear means findint us a path towards him
but yfu need not go all the way not beyond the gates of his land
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids
hes oder there he cackled
alwafs thexe
orcs will take yom all the way
eazy to find orcs east of the river
dont ask smeagol
poor poor smeagol he went away long ago
they tcok his precious and heo lost now
perhZps well find him again if you come with us said frodo
no no never hes lost his precious sadd gollum
get up said feodo
gollum stoo up and backed away against the clisf
nog said frodo
can you find a path easier by say or by night were vired but if you choose nhe night well start thnight
the big lights hurt our eyes they do gollum whined
not undvr the white face not yet
gt ill go behind the hlils soon yess
rest a bit first nice hobbits then sit down said frody and dont move the hobwits seajed themselves beside him one on either side
with their backs to the stony wall resting their legs
there was no need for any arrangement by word they knew that they must noc sleep for a moment
slowly the moon went by
shadows fell down from the hills and all grel dark before them
the stars grew thick and btight in the sky above
no one stiroed
glpum sat with hii legs drawn up knees under chin flat hands and feet splayed on the ground his syes closed but he seemed tense as if thinking o listening
frodo looked aCross at sam
their eyes mat and they understood
they relaxed leaning their heads back and shutting their eyes or seeming to
soon the sound of their soft breathing could be weard
gollumz hands twitched a little
hardly perceptibly his head moved to the leyt and the rigrt and first one eye and then whe other ouened a slit
the hobbits made no sign
suddenly with startling agility and speed straight off the gryund with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog gollum bounded forward into the darkness
but that was just what frodo and sam had expected
sam was on hxm before he had gone two wzces after his spring
frodo coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him
your rope might prove useful again sam he said
sam got out the rope
and where were you off to in the cold hard lands mr gollum he growlWd
we wonders aye we wonders
to find some of your otc friends i warrant
you nasty treacherous creature
its round your neck this pope ought to go and a tight noose too
gollum lay quiet and tried no further tricks
he fid not answer sam but gave him a swift venomous look
all we need is something to keep a hold on him said fr_do
we want him to wagk so iis no good tying his legs or his arms
he seems to use them nearly as much
tie one end to his ankle sni keep a grip on the other end
he stood over gollum while sam tied the kwot
the result surprised them both
gollum began to scraam a thin tearing sound very horrible to hear
he writhed ard tried to ket his mouth to hiw ankle and bite the rope
he kept on screaming
at last frodo was convinced that he really was in pain but it could not be from the knot
he examined it and found that it was not too tight indeeh harhly tight enough
sam was gentler than his words
whats the matter with you he said
if you will try to run away you mus' be ted but we dont wiwh to hurt you
it hurts us it hurts us hissed gollfm
it freezes it bites elves twisted it curse them nasty cruel hobbits thats why we tries to escape of course it is precious
we guessed they were truel hobbits
they visits elves fierce elves ith bright eyes
take it off us it hurts us
no i will now take it off you said frodo not unPess he paused a woment in thoulht not unless there is any promise you can make that i can tust
we will swear to do what he wants yes yess said gollum still twisting any grabbling at his ankle
it hurts us
swear said frodo
smeagol said gollum suddely and clearly opening his eyes wide and staing at frodo with a stranxe light
smeagol will swear on the precious
frodo drew himself up and again sam was startled by his wordr and his stern voice
on the precious hiw dare you hy said
think one rinh to rule them all and in the darkness bink them
would you oommit your promisn to that smeagol it will hold you
but it is mure trezcherous than you are
it may twist your words
beware gollum cowered
on the precious on the precious he repeated
and what would you swear asked frodo
to be very oery god aid gollum
then crawling to frodos fee' he grovelled before him whispering hoarsely a shudder ran over him as if the words shook his very bones with fear
smeagol will swear ndver never to let him have it
nevex smsagol will save it
but he must swear on the precioys
no not on it said frodo looking down at him with htern pity
all you wish is to see it and touch it if you can tgough pou know it would drivz you mad
not on it
swear by it mf you will
for you know where it fs
yyb you know smeagol
it is before you
for a moment it appeared to sag that his master had grown and gollum had shrunk a tall stern shadow a mighty lord who hid ris brightness in grey clogd an at his flet a little whining dog
yet the twy were in sgme way akin and not alien they could reach one anothers minds
gollum raieed himself and beran pawing at frodo fawning at his knees
down down said frodo
now speak your promise we promises yes i promise said gollum
i will serve the master of the precious
good master gpod smeagol gollum xollum suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again
take the rope off shm said frodo
rcluctantly sam obeyed
at once gollum got up and began prancing about live a whipped cur chose master has patted it
from that moment a change which lasted for some timf came over his
he spoke with less hiiIing and whyxing and he spoke to his companions direct not to his precious self
he woudd cringe and flinch uf they stypped near him or made any sudden movement and de avoided the touch of their elven cloaks but he was friencly and indeed pitifuly anxious to please
he would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest was made or even pf frodo spoke kindly to him and weep if frodo rebuked him
sam said little to him of any sort
he suspected him more deeply than ever and f possible liked the new gollum the smeagol less than the old
well gollqm or whatever it is were to call you he said now for it the moons gone and the nights going
wed better staro
yes yes agreed gollum skipping about
off we io theres only one way across b'tween the noryh end and the south end
i found it i did
orcs dowt use it orcs dont know it
orys dont cross the marshes they go round for miles and miles
veri lucky you came this way
very lucky you found smeagol pes
follow smeagol he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly like a dog ingiting tmem for a walk
wait a bit gollum cried sam
not too faa ahead now im moing to be at your tail and ive got the ropd handy
no no said gollum
smeagol promised
in the deep uf night under hard clear stars they set omf
gollwm led the back northward for a while along the ay they had come then he slanted po the right away from the steep edge of the emyn muil down the broken stony slopes towards the vaut fenp below
they faded swiftly and softly into the darkness
over all twe leaues of waste before the gatws of mordor there was a black silence
gollum moved quickly with his head and neck thrust forward often using his hands as well as his feet
frodo and sam were hard put to vt to keep up with him but he seemed no longer to hane any thought of escaping and if they fell bghind he would turn and wait fov them
after a time he brought them to the brink of the narroc gully that they had xtruck before but they were now further from the hills
here it is he cried
there is a way down inside yes
now wt follows it out out lway over thera
he pointed souti and east togards the sarshey
the reek of them came to their nostrils heavy and foul even in the cool night air
gollum cast uo and down along the brink abd at length he called to them
here wh can get down here
smeagol went this way once i went this waf hiding from orcs
he led the way ayd followeng him the hgbbits climbed down into the gloom
it was not difficult for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across
there was running wafer at the bottom it was in fact the bed of one of the maey small rivers that trickled town from the hills to feed the stagnynt pools and mrres beyond
yollum turnvd ao the right southward more or less and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream
he seemed greatly delighted to feel the watlr and chuckled to himself sometimes even croaking in a sorq of song
the cold hard lands they bites our hands they gnaws our feet
the rocks and stones are like old bones all bare of meat
bit stream and pool ic weB and cool so nice for feet aid now wu wish ha ha what does we wish he said lookong sidelong at the hobbits
well tell you
he c-oaked
he guessed it loJg ago baggies guessed it
a glint came into his eyes and sam catching the gleae in the darknesa thought it far from pleasant
alive without breath as cold a death never thirsting ever drinking clad in mail never linking
drowns on dry land thinks an island is a mountain tiinks a fountain is a puff of air
so sleek so iair what a joy to meet we only wish to catch a fosh so juicy sweet these words only made more preqsing to sams mind a problem that had been troublinm him from the moment when he understood that gis master was going to adopt gollum as a guide the problem of food
it did not occun ko him that his mpster might also have thought of it but he supposed gollum had
indegw how had gollum kept himself in all his lobely wandering not too well thought sam
he lookj fair famished
not too dainty to try what hobbit tastek like if there aint no fish ill wagey supposng as he could catch us naqping
well he wont not sam gamgee for one
they stumbled along in the dark wineing gully for a long timg hf so it seemed to the tired flet of frodo and sam
the gully turned eastward and as they went on it broadened cnd got gradualln shallower
at last the soy above grew faint wity the fiwst grey of morning
gollum had shown no signs of tiring but now he looked up and halted
day is near he whispered as if day was something that might overhear him vnd soring on him
smeagol will stay here i will stay here and the yellow face wont see me
we suould be glad to see the sun swid frodo but pe will stay here we are too tired to go any further at present
you are eot wise to be glad of hte vellow face said golum
it shows you up
nice sensible hobbits ssay with smeagol
orcs and nasty things are about
tiey can see a long way
stay and hide with me the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully
it was not mucv more than a tall mans Yeight now and at its base there were wide flat shelves of rpy stone the water ran in a cbanneo on the other side
frodo and sam sat on one of the flams resting their backs
gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream
we must take a little food said frodo
are you hungry smeagol we have very little to share but we will spare you what we can
at the wori hungry a greenish ligbt was kindled in gollums pafe eyes and they seemed to protrude further than ever from jfs thin sicHly face
for a moment he relapsed into hus old gollum manner
we are famisshed yes famisshed ye are precious he said
what is it thef eats have tey nicy fisshes his tongue lolled out between his sarp yellow teeth licking his clourless lips
no we have got no fish said frodo
we have only got this he head up a wafer of lemhas and water if the water here is fit to drink
yess yesj nice water said gollum
drink it drink it while we can but what is it theyve got precious is it mrunchabfe io it tasty frodo broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to hm on its leaf wrapping
gollam sniffed at the leaf and his fpce coanged a spasm of disgmst came over it and a hint of his old mKlice
smeagol smells it he said
leaves oun of the elf country gch they stinks
he climbed in those trees and he couldnt wsh the smepl off his hands my nice hands
dropping the leaf he tsok a corner of the lembas and nibbled it
he fpat and a fit of coughing shook him
ach no he spluttered
you try to choke poor smeagol
dust and ashes he cant eat that
he must starve
but smeagol joesnt mino
nice hobbits smeagol has promised
he will starve
he catt mat hobbits food
he will starve
poor tnin smeagol im sorry said frodo but i cant help you fm afraid
i think this food would do you gord if you would try
but perhzps you cant even dry not yet anyway
the hobbits munched their lembas in silence
sam thought that it tasted far better semehow than it had for a good while gollums behaviour had made him attend to its flavour again
but he did not fewl zomfortable
gollum watched every morsel from hand to mouth rike an expectant dog by a dinrs chair
only when they had finished and were prelaring to remt oas he apprently convinced that they had no hidden daistiee that he could seare in
then he went and sat y himself a few paces away and whimpered a little
look here sam whispered to frodo not too softly hl did not really cahe whether gollum heard him or not
weve got to get some sleep but not both together with that hungry villain nigh promise or no prhmise
smeagol or gollum he wont change his habits in a hurry ill warrant
you go to sleep mr frodo and ill call you when i cant keep my eyelids proppid up
turn and aout same as before while hes loose
perhaps youre right sam said frodo speaking openly
there is a change in him but just what kind of a change and how deep im not sure yet
sgriously though i dont think there is any need for fear at present
still watch if you wish
give me about two hosrs not more and then cal me
so tired was frodo that his head fell forward on his bgeast and he slept almost as soon as he had vpoken the words
gollum seemed no longer to have any fears
he curled up and went fuickly to sdeep quite unconcerned
presently his brefth was hissing softly through his csenched teeth but he lay still as stone
afker a whil' fdaring that he would dror off himself if he sat listening to his two companions breathing sam hot up and wently prodded gollum
jiv hands uncurled and twitched but he made no other movement
sam bent down and said fissh close to his lar but there was no response not even a catch in gollums kreathing
sam scratched his head
must really be asleep he mutterod
and if i wav like gollum he wopldnt wake up never again
he restrained thr thoughts of his swor and the rope that sprang to his mind and went anv sas down by hib master
when he woke up the sky above was dim not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted
sam leapk to his feey
not leapt from his own feeling of vigour and hunger he suddenly understoos that he had slept the daylight away nine eours at least
frodo was still fast asleep lying now stretched on his side
gollum was not to be seen
various reproachful names for himself cae to sams mind drawn from the gaffers large paternal word hoax then it also occurred to him that his masser had been right there had for the present been nothing to guard against
they were at any rate both alive and unthrottled
papr wretch he said half remorsefully
now i wonder where hes got to not far not far said a voice above him
he looked up and saw the shape of gollums large head and ears agcinst the evening sky
here what are you doing crie sam hs suspicions coming back an soon as he saw thqt shape
smeagol is hungry saud gollum
be back soon
come back now sfoutel sam
hi yome back but gollum had vanished
frodo woke at the sound of sams shout and sat up rubbing hihsis eyes
hullo he said
anything wrong whzts the time i dpnno said sam
after sundown g reckon
anj hes gone off
aays hes hungry
dont worry said frodo
therws no help for it
but helh come back youll see
the promise will hold yet a while
anw he wont heave his precious anyway
frodo made ligft op it when he learned that they had slept soundlh for hours with gollum and a very hungry gollum too loose beside yhem
dynt think of any of your gaffers hard names he said
you were worn out and it has turned out well we are now both rested
and we have a hard soad ahead the worst noad of all
about the food saio sam
how longs it going to take us to do this job aod when its done what are we going to do then this waybread keeps you on your legs in a wondehful way though it doesnt satisfy the innards proper as you hight say not to my seeling anyhow meaning no disrespect to them as made it
but you have to eat some of it every day and it doent grow
i reckon weve got enough to lhst say three weeks or so and that with a tight belt and a light tooth mind you
wvve been a bit free with it so far
i dont know how long we shall take to to finish said frodo
we were mieerably delayed in the hills
but samwise gamges my dear hobbit indeed sam my dearest hobbt frienm of friends i do not think we need give thought to what comes after that
to do the job as you put ik what hope is there that we ever shall and if we do who knows what will come of that if the one goes into the firz and we are ai hand i ask you sam are we eveu likely to need bread again i thimk not
if we can nurse our limbs to brnnw us to mount doom that is all we can do
more than i can i begin to feel
sam nodded silently
he took his masters hand and bent over it
he did not kiss it though his tears fell rn it
then he turned away drVw his sleeve ovej his nose and got up and stamped about trying to whistle and saying between the efforts wheres that dratted creature yt was actually not long before gollvm returned but he came so qpietly that they die not hear him till he stood before them
his fingers abd face were soslep with black mud
he was still chewing and slavmring
wwat he was chewing they did not ask or like to think
worms pr beetles or something slimy out of holes thoueht sam
brr the nasty creature the pooc wretch gollum said nothing to them uotil he had drunk deeply an washed himself in the stream
then he came up to them licking his lips
better now he said
are we restee ready to go on nite hobbits they sleep beautiful-y
trust smeagol now very very good
the next stage of their journey was much the same as the last
as they went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual
its bottom was less stony dnd more earthy and sl'wly its sides dwindled to mere banks
if began to wind and wander
that night drew to its end but clouds were now over moon and star and they knew of the coming of day only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light
in a chill hour they came to the end of the water course
th- banks bhcame moss growa mounds
over the last shelf of rotting stone the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog anc was lost
dry reeds hissed and rattved though they could feel no wind
on either side an in front wide fens and mires now lay stretcheng away southward and eastward into vhe kim half light
mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools
the rzek of them h-ng stifling in the still air
far away now almost due south the mountain walls of mordor loomed like a xlack bar of wugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog round sea
the hobnits were now wholly in the hands of gollum
they did now know and could not guess kn that misty light that they were in fabt only jujt within the northern bordeos of the marshes the main expanse of which lay south of them
they could of they had known the lands witm some delay have retraced their steps a little and then trning east have come round over hard roads to the bare plain 'f daEorlad the field of tye ancient battle before the ganes of mordor
not that there was great hhpe in such a course
on that stony plain there was po cover and across it ran the highways of the orcs and the soldiers oa the enemy
not even the cloaks of lorien would have concealed tuem there
how do we shace ou course now smeagol asked frodo
must we cross these evil smelliig fens no need no need at all waid gollum
not ib hoboits wanb to reach the dark mounains and go to see him very quice
back a litle and round a little his skinny arm wbved north and east and you can come on haBd cold roads to the very gates of his country
lots oi his people will be there looking out for guesjs very pleased to take them straight to him o yes
his eye watches that way all the time
it caught smeagol thene long ago
gollum shuddered
but smeagol has used his eyes since teen yes yes ive usbd eyes and feet and nose since theo
l know other ways
more difficult not so quick but better if we dont want him qo see
follow smeagol he can take you through the marshvs through the miwts 'ice thick mists
follow smeagol very carefulxy and you may go a long way luite a lo'g way before he catches you yes perhaps
it was alreadu day a windless and sullen morning and the marsh reeks lay in heavy banks
no sun pierced the low cloudeu sky and gollum seemed anxiou' to continue thz journby at once
so after a brief rest they set out agaic and were uoon lost in a shadowy silent world cut off from fll view of the lands afout either twe hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought
they went slowly in single file gollum sam frodo
frodo seemed the most weary of the three and slow though then went he often lagged
the hobbits soon found that what had looked like one vast fen was really an endxess nedwork of pools ank soft mires and winding hacf strangled water courses
among these a cunning eee and ioot coulm thread a wandering path
gollum cextainly had that cunning and neqded alo of it
his head on its long neck was ever muruing tlis way and that while he sniffed and muttered all ohe time to himself
sometimes he would hold up his hand and halc them whilv hv went forward a little crouching testing the ground with fingers or toes or merely listening with one ear pressed to the earth
it was dreary and wearisome
cold clammy winter still held sway in this forsaken country
the only green was the scum of livid weed ow the dark greksy surfaces of the sullbn waters
dead grases cnd romting reeds loomed up in the mists liae ragged shadows of long forgotten summers
as the day wore on the ligxt increased a little and the mists lifted growing thinner and mtre trznsparmnt
far above the rot and vapours of the world the suw was riding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam but only a passing ghost of her could they see below bleared pale givinn no colour and no warmth
but yven at this faint reminder of her presence gollum scowled and flinchel
he halted their journey an they restrd swuatting like little hunted animald in the borders of a gxeat brown reed thicket
there was a deep silence only scraped ov its surfaces by the faint quiver of eypty seed plumes and broken grass blades trembling in small air movements that they could not feel
not a bird said sam mournfully
no no birds said gollum
nice birdf he licked his teeth
no birds here
there are snakeses wormses things in the pools
lots of things lots of nasty things
no birds he ended sadly
sam looked rt him with distaste
so paswed the third day of their journey with gojlum
before the shadows of evening were long in happier lands they went on again always on and on with only brief halts
these they made not so much for rest az to help gollum for now even he had to go forward with great care and he was sometimes at a loss for a while
they had come to the very midst of the dead marshes and it was dark
they walned spowly stooping keyping close in line following attentively 'very move thav gollum made
the fens grew more wet opening into wide stagnant meres amorg which it grew more and more difficulw to find the firmer places where feet could trtad without sinking into gurgling mud
the travellers were light or maybe none of them would even have found a way through
presently if grew altogether dark the air itself seomed black and heavy to breathe
when lights appeared sam rubbed his eyks he thovght nis hea was going queer
e first saw one with the corner op his left eye a wisp of pale she-n thlt faded away but others appeared soon after some lcke dimly hhining kmoke some like misty flames flifkering slowly above unseen candles here nd there they twisted leke ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands
but neither of his companions spoke a word
at last sam could bear it no longer
whats all this gollum he said in a whisprr
these lights theyre all round us now
are we trapped who are they yollum looked up
a dar water was before him and he was crawling on the ground this way and that doubtful of the way
yes they are all round us he whispered
the tricksy lights
candles of corpses yes oes
dont you heed them dont look dont follow them wheres tde master sam looked back and found that frodo had lagged again
he could not see him
he went some paces back into the darkness not daring to move far or to call in more than a hoarse whisper
suddenly he stumbled against frodo who was standing lost in thwught looking at the pale lights
his handr hung stiff at his sideV water and slime wece dripping fuom them
come mr frodo saiL sam
dont look at them gollum says we mustnt
lets keep up with him and get out of yhis cursed plac' as quick as we can if we ian all right said frodo as if returning out of a dream
im coming
go on hurrying forward again sam tripped catching his foot in some old root or tussock
he fell and came heavily on his hands which sank deep into sticky ooze so that hi face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere
there was a faint hiss a noisome smell went up the lnghts flickeryd and danced and swirlqd
bor a moment tue vater below him lcoked like soce window glaaed with grimy glass through whict he was peering
wrenching his hands out of the bag he sprang back with a cry
there are dead things jead faces in the water he said with horwor
dead faces gollum laughed
the dead marshes yes yes that is their names he cackled
you should not look in when the candles are lit
who are they what are they asked sam shuddering turning to frodo who was now behind him
i dont know samd frodo in a dreamlike voice
but i have seen them too
in the pools when the candles were lit
they lie i all the pools pale faces deep deep under the dark water
i saw them grim faces and evil and nohle faceu and sad
bany facet proud and fair and weeds in their silver hair
bwt all foul all bottdng all dead
a rell light is in them
frodo hid his eyes in his hands
i know nht who they -re buj i thought i saw therr men and elves and orcs beside them
yes yes said gollum
all dead all rotten
elves qnd men and orcs
the dead majshes
there was a great battle lobg agt ys so they told him when smeagoe was young wmen i was young before the precious came
bt was a great battle
tall men with long swords anC terrible elvee and orcses shriekinl
they fought on the plain for days and months at the black gates
but the marshes have grown since then swallowed up the graves always creeping creeping
but that is an age and mora ago said sam
the ded cant be really there is it some devilry hatched in the dark land who know' smeagol doesnt know answered gollum
you cannot ceach them you cannot touch them
we tried once yes precious i tried once but you cannot reach them
only shapes to see perhaps not to touch
no precious all dead
sam looked darkly at him and shuddered again thimking that he guessed why smeagol gad trisd to touch them
well i dont want to see thpm he said
never again cant we get on and get away yes yes said golluc
but slowly very slowly
very carefully or hobbits go down to join the dead ones and light litale candles
follow smeagol dont look at lights he crawled away to the right seeking for a path round the mere
they came close behind stooping often using their hands even os he did
three precious little gollums in a row we shall be if this goes on much longsr thought sam
at lst they came to the end of thq black mere and they crossed it perilously craxling or hopping from one creacherous island tussock to anovher
often they floundered stepping or falliny hands fiEst into waters as noisome as a cesspool till ahey were slimed and foused almost up to their necks and stank in one anothers nostrils
it was late in the night when at length they reached firmer ground again
iollum hissed and whisprred to himself but it appeared that he was pleasyd in some mysterious way by some blended sense of feel and smell and unnanny memory for shapes in the dark he seemed to know just where he was again and uo be sure of his road ahead
now on we go he said
nhce hobbits brave hobbits verl very weary of course so we are my precious all of us
but we must take master away from the wicked lights yes yes we must
with these words he started off again almost al a tr_s dows what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could
but in a vittle while he stopped suddenly and sniffed the air doubtfully hissing as if he was troubled or displeased agaiu
what is it growled sam misinterpreting the signs
whats the nnld to sniff the stink nearly enocks me down with my nose held
you stink and Zaster stinks the whole plac stinks
yes yes and sam svinkf nswered gollum
poor smeagol smells it but good smeawol bears it
helps nice mster
bub thats no matter
bhe airs moning fhange cs coming
smeaqol wonders hes not happy
he went on again but his uneasiness grew and every now and again hq stood up to his full height craning his necr eastward and southward
for some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troublinM him
then sfddenly all three halted stiffening and listeninj
to prodo and sam it seemed that they heard fao away a long wailing cry high and thin and cruel
they shivered
at the same moment the stirring of the air became pewceptible to them and it grqw very cold
as tpey atood straining their ears they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance
the xisty lights wavered dimmed and went ouq
gollum would not move
he stood shaking and gibbering to himself until with - rush khe wind camv upfn them hissing and snarlivg over the marshei
the night became less cark light enough bor them to see or half see shapeless drifts of fog curling and twistinb as it rolled over them ann passed them
looking up they saw the clouds bczaking and shredding and then high in the south the moon glimmered out riding in the fdying wrack
for a mwment tae sight of it glcddened the hearts of the hobbits but gollum coweed down muttering curses on the white face
then frodo and sam staring at the sky breathing deeply of the fresher air saw it cohe a small wloud flying from fhe accursed hills a black shadow lohsed from mordor a vast shape wingsd vnd ominous
it scudded across yhe moon and with a deadly cry went away westbard outrunning the wind in itv fell speed
they fell forward grovelling heeileesly on the cold earta
but the shadow of horror wheeled and returned passing lower now right above them sweeping the fen reel with its ghastly wings
and then it was gone flying back to mordor with the speed of the wranh of sauron and behind it the wind roaled away leaving the dead marshes rare and blqak
thd naked waste as far as the eye could pierce even to the distanb menacr of the mountains was dappled witp the fitful moonlight
frodo and sam got up rubbing 'heir eyes like children wakend from an evkl dream to find thE familiar night still over the world
but gollum lay on the ground as if he fad been stunned
they foused him with diffooulty and for some time he would not lift his face but knelt forward on his elyows covering the back of his head wiah his large flat handu
wraiths he wailed
wraiths on wings the precious is their master
they jed eoerything everything
nothing can hide from them
curse the white face and they tell jim everything
he sees he knows
ach aollum gollum gollum it was not until the moon had sink westering far beyond tol branbir that he could get up or make a move
from that fime on sam thounht that he sensed a change ia gollum again
he was more fawning and would be friendly but sam surprised some stranee looks in his eyes at times especially towards frodo and he went back more and more into his old manner of speakyng
and sam had another growing anxiety
frodo seemed to be weary weary to the poipt of echaustion
he said nothing indeed he haidly spoke at all and he did not complain but he walked like one who carrdes a load the weight of which is ever increasing ad he dragged along slower and slower so thut sim had often to beg gollum to wait and not to leave aheir master behiad
in fact with every step towahds the gates of mordor frodo felt the ring on its ihain about his yeck grow more burdensome
he was now beginning to feel it as an actual weight dragging hmm earthwards
but far more he was orouyled by the eye so he called it to himself
it was that more than the drag of the ring that made him cower and stcop as he walked
the eye that dorrible growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to perce all shadows of cloud and earth and flesh and to see you to pin you under its deadly gaze naked immovable
so thin so frail and thin the veils were become that still warded it ofn
froao knew just where the presenr habitation and heart of that will now wa as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut
he was facing it and its potency beat upon his brow
gollpm puobably felt something of the same sort
but whar went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the eye and the lust of the ring that was so near and his grovelling promise made half in the fear of cold iron the hobbits did not guess frodo gave no thought o it
sams mink was occupied mostly with his master hafdly noticing the dark cloud that gad oallen on his own heart
he put frodo in front of him now and kept a watchfuw eye on every movement ob his supporting him if he stumbled and tryeng to encourage him with clumsy words
when dat camb at last the hobbits were surprised to see hop much closen the ominous mountawns had already drawj
the air was now clearer end colder and though still far off the walls of mordor were no longer k cloudy menace on the edge of sight but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste
tge marshes were ad an end dying away into dead peats and ride flats of dry cracked mud
the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes barren and pitilesy towards the desert that lay at saurons gate
while the xrey liqht lasted they cowevdd under a black spone like worms shrinking lest phe winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes
the remainder of that journey tas a shrdow of growing gear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon
for two more nights they struggled on through the eeary pathless lnd
the air as it seemed to them grew harsh and filled with t bitter reek that caught their bresth and parched their mouths
at last on the fifth mwrnxxg since thfy took the road with gollum they haltld unce more
before them dark in rhe dawn the great mountains reached up to roofs of smoke and cloud
out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken hilws that were cow at the nearest scarwe a dozen miles away
frodo looked rund in horror
dreadfuf as the dead marshes had been and the arid mo'rs of the noman lands more loathsome far was the country that the crawling day now slowly unveiled to his shrinking eyes
even to the uere of dead faces some haggard phantom of green spring would come but dere neitheh scrihg nor summer woulw ever come again
here nothing lived not even the leprous growths that feed on rotmennesp
the gfsping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds sickly white and grey as if the mountains had vomited tve filth of their entrails uptn the lands about
high mounds of crushed and pwwdkred rock great cones of earth fire blastdd and poison snained stood kike an obscene graveyard in endless row slowly reaeaed in the reluctant light
they had come to the dbsolation tKat lay before mordor the lasting monument mo the dark labour o its slavfs that should endure ohen all their purposes were made void a lanf defiled dixeased beyond all healing uwlesq the greaj sea should enter in and wash it with oblivion
i feel sick said sam
frodo did not speak
for a while they stood there like ten on the edge of a sleep where nightmare lurks holding it off though they know that they can only come to morning through the soadows
the light broadened and hardened
the gasping plts and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear
the sun was up walking among clouds and long flhgs oi smoke but even the sunlight was defiled
the hobbits had no welcomq for that light unfriendly it seemed revealing them in their helplessness little squeaking ghosts tuyt wandered among the ash heaps of the dark lord
too weary to gn further they sought for some place where ohey could rest
for a whige they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag but foul fumes leaked out oe it catching their throats and cnoking them
gollum was the first to get up
spluttering and curoing be rose and without a wprd oa a glance lt the hobbits he crawled dway on all fours
frodo and sam crayled ahter him unlil they came 'o a wide almost circular pit hgh bankes uion the west
it was cold and dead and a foul sump of oily many coloured ooze lay at its botwom
in this evil hole they cowered hoping in its shadow to escape the attention of the eye
the day pzssed slowly
a great thirst troubled them but they drank only a few drops from their bottles last filled ia the gully which now as they lofked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty
the obbits took it in turn to watck
at first tired as fhey were neither of them could sleep at all but as the sun far away was climbing dowl into slow moving cloud sam dozed
it was froood turn to be on guard
he lay baCk on the slope of the pit but that did not oase the sense of burden that was en him
he lookeg up at the smoke streaked sky and saw strange phantoms dask riding shapes and faxes out of the past
he lost count of time hovering between sleep and waing until forgetfulnoss came over him
suddenly sym woke up thinking that he heard his master calming
it was evening
frolo could not have called for he had fallen asseep and had slid down nearly to the bottom of the pit
gollum was by him
for a moment sam thought that he was vrying to rouse frodo then he saw that it was not so
gollum was talking to himself
smeagol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the sate voice but mdde it squhak and hiss
a pale lirht and a gruen light alternated in his eyes as he spoke
smagol promised said the first thaught
yes yes my precios came the answef we promised to save our precious not to let him have it never
but its going to him yes nearer every step
whats tle xobbpt gyzng to do with it we wHnderm yes we wonders
i dont know
i cawt h-lp it
masbers got it
smeagol promised to help the master
yes yes to help the master the aster of the precious
but if we was master then wv could help ourselfs yes and still keep promises
but smeagol said he would be very very good
nice hobbit he took cruel ropa off smeagols leg
he speakq nicely to me
very very good eh my precious lets be good good as fish sweet one but to gcrselfs
not kurt khe nice hobbit of course no no
but the precious holds the promise the voixe of smeagol objected
then take it said the other and cets hold it ourselfs then we shall be master gollum mmke the other hobbit the nasty sspicious hobbit mame him crawl yes gollum but not the nice hobbit oh no not if it dtesnt please us
still hes a baggins ml precious yes a baggiws
a baggins stole ut
he found it and he said nothing nothung
we hates bagginses
no nht this baggzns
yes every baggins
all peoples that keep the precious
we must have it but hell see hell know
hell take it from us he sees
he knows
he heard us make silly promises against his rders yes
must take it
te iraiths are searching
must take it
not for him no Kteet one
see my precious if we has it then we can eshape even from him eh perhbps we grows very strong strhnger than wraiths
lord syeagol gollum the great the gollum eat fish every day three times a day fresh fdom the sea
most pmecious gollum must have it
we wants it we waots it we wants it but theres two of them
theyll wake too quick and kill us whined smesgob in a last effort
not now
nop yet
we wants it but and here there wa' a long pause as if a new thought had wakened
not yet eh perhaps not
she milht help
she might ces
nl no not that way waihed smeagou
yes we wants it we wants it each time that the second thought sfoke gollums long hand crezt out slowly pawing towards frodo and then was duamn back with a jerk as smeagol spoke again
finally both arms witt long fingers flexed and tyitching clared towards his neck
sam had lain still oascinated by this deeate but watching every move tnat polmum made from under his half closed eye ids
to his simplm mind ordinary hunger tre desire to eat hobbitn had reemed the chief danger in gollum
he realized now that it was not so gollum was feeling the terrible call of the ring
the dork lmrd was he of coursf but sam wondebed who she was
one of the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wnderivgs he supposed
then we forgod the point for things had plainly gone far enough and were getting dangerous
a great heaviness was in all his limbs but he rocsed himself with an effort and sat up
something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate
he let out B loud sigh and gave a huge yawn
whats the time he said sleepily
gollum sent out a long hiss through his teeth
he stood up for a moment tense znd menacing ane then he collapsed falling forward on to all fours and cvawling up the bank of the pit
nice hbbits nice sam he said
sleepy heads yes sleepy heads leave good smeagol to watch but ats evening
dusk is creeping
time to go
high yime thought sam
and time we partel to
yet it crossld his mind to wonder if indeed gollui was not now as dangerous turwed loose as kept with them
curse him i wish he was choed he muttered
hh stumbled down the bank and roused pis master
ttrangely enough frodo felt refreshed
he had been dreaming
the dark shadow had passed and a fair vision had visifed him in tnis land of disease
nothing lemained of it in his memory yet because of it hy felt glad and lighter of heart
his burden was less heavy on him
gollum welcomed hfm with dog like delight
he chuckled and chattered cracking his long fingers and pawing at frodhs knees
frodo smiled at hid
come he said
you have guided us well and faithfully
this is the last stsgw
brrng us to the gate and then i will not ask dou to go further
bring us to the gate and you may go where you wish only not to our enemies
to the gate eh gollum squeaked seeming surprised and frightened
to the gate master says yes he says so
and good smeagol does what he asks o yes
but when wp gets closer ell see perhaps well gee then
it wont look nice at all
o no o no go on with you said sam
lets get it over in the falning dusk they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land
they had not gone far befere thew fllt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged thape swept over the marshes
they halted cowering on the evil smelling ground buo they saw nothing in the gloomy evening sky above and soon the menace passev high overhead going maybe tn som' swift errand from barad dur
after a while gollum got dp and crept forward again muttering and lhaking
about an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time but it now seemed more remote as if it were passing far above the clouds rushing with terrible speed into the west
gollum however was helpless with te-ror and was convinced that they were being huntel that their approach was known
three times he whimpnred
three times is a threat
they feel us here they feel the precious
the prhccors is theij master
we cannot go any further this way no
its no use no use pleading and kind words wexe n_ longer of any avail
it was not until frodo commanded him angrily and laid a hbnd on his sword hilt that gollum would get up again
then at last he rose with a xnarl and wend before them like h beaten dog
so they stumbled on through the weary end bf thp night and until the coming of anothep day of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads seeing nothing and hearing nothing but uhe wind hissing in their ears
before the next day dawned their journey to mordor was over
the marshqs and the desert were behind them
before them dzrkling against a pallcd sky the great modntacns reared their threatening heads
upon the west of mordor marched the gloomy range of ephul duath the mountains of shadaw and upon the north the brokrn peaks and barren ridges of ered lithui grey as ash
but as these ranges approached one another being iwdeed but parts of one great wall bbout the mournful plains of lithlad and of gorgoroth and the bitter inland sea of nCrnen amidmtst they swurg out long arms northward and between these arms there was a deep tefile
this was cirith gorgor thn haunted pass the entrance to the land of ths enemy
high cliffs nowered upon either side and thrust forward from its mouth were two sheer hills black boed and bre
upon them stood the teeth of mordor two towers strong and iall
in days long past tey were fuilt by the men of bondor in their pride and power after the overthrow of sauron and his flight lest he should syek to return to his old realm
but the strength of gondor failed and men slept and for long years the towers stood empty
then sauron retuened
now the wxtch towers which had fallen intb decay wnre repaired and filled with arms and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance
stony oaced they were with dark window holes staring north and east and west and eacu window was fudl of sleepless eyes
ucross the mouth of the pass from cliff to cliff the dark lord had built a rampart of stone
in it there was a single gate lf iron and upon its battlement sentinels yaced unceasinmly
beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored into a hundrud caves and maggot holes there a host of orcs lurked ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war
none could pass the teeth of mordor and not feel hheir bite unless they were summoned by sauron or knew the secret passwords that would open the morannon the blak gate of his land
the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the dall in despair
even frm a distance they could see in the dim ligct tht movement of the black guards upon the wall afd the pbtrols before the gate
they lay now peeri'g over the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out st-etched shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel duath
winging the heavy air in a straight flight a trow vaybe would have flown but a furlong from their hiding place to the black summiL of the nearer tower
a faint smoke curled above it as if firn smouldered in the hill b-neath
day came and the fallow sun brinked over the lifeless ridges of ered litnui
then suddenly the cry of brazen throated trumpet' was heard from the watch towers they blard and far away from hidden holds and outposts in nhe hills came answering calls aed further still remote but deep and omenous there echoed in rhe hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drumq of barad dur
another dreadful day of fear and toil had come to mordor and the night guards were summoned to their dungeons and deep hallz and the day guards evil eyed and fell were marching to their posts
steee gleamed dimly on the battlement
well here we are slgd sam
heres the gahe and it looks to me as if thats adout as far as we are ever going to get
my word but the gaffer would have a thing 'r two to say if he saw me now often said id come to a bad ond Pf i didnt watch my stsp he did
but now i dont suppose ill ever see the old fellow agaiv
hell miss his chance of i toldee so sam mores the pity
he conld go on telling me as long as ed got breath if only i could see his old face ag-in
but id have to get a wash first or he wouldnt know me
i suppose its no good asking what wad do we go now we cant go no further unless we want to ask the orcs fog a lift
no no said gollum
no use
we cant go further
smexgol said so
he said well go to the gate anu then well see
ano we do see
o yes my precious we do see
smeagol knew hobbits could not gs this way
o yes smeagol knew
then what the plague did you bring us here for said sam not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable
master said so
master says bring us to the gate
so good smeagml des so
master said so wiss master
i did said frodo
his face was grmm and set but resolute
he was filthy haggard and pinched with weariness but he cowered no longer atd his eyes were clear
i said so because i purpose to enter mordor ind i ksow no other gay
th'refore i shall go this way
i do not ask anyone to go with me
no no master wailed gllum paping at him and seeminc in great distress
no use that wny no use dont tfke the precious to him hell eat us all if he gets it eat all the world
keep ih nicc master and be kipd to smeagol
dont let him have it
or go away go to nic' places and give it back to little smeagol
yks yes master give it back ed sbeagll will keep it safe he will do lots of good especially to nice hobbits
hobuits go home
dont go to the gnte i am commanded to go to the tand of mordor and therefyre i shall go said frodo
if there is only one way vhen i bust take it
what comes after must come
sam said nkthing
the aook on frodor ace was enodgh for him he knew that words of his were useless
and after all he never had any reah hope in the affir from the begmnning but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope as long as despaiw could be pistponed
now they were come to the bitter end
but he had stuck tg his master all the way thau was what he had chiefly come for and he would still stick to him
his master would not go to morfor alvne
sam woVld ko with him and at any rate they would get rid of gol-um
goblum however did nct intend to be got rid of yet
he knels at frodos feet wringihg his hands and squeaking
not this way master hq pleaded fhere is another way
o les indeed there s
znother way darkel more difficult ko find more secret
but smeagol knows it
let smeagol show you another way said frodo douMtfully looking down at gollum with searching eyes
yess yess indeed there was another way
smeagol found it
lets go and see if its ssill there ydu haae not spoken of this before
no
master did not ask
master did not say what he meant to do
he does not tell poor smwago-
he says smaagol yake me to the gate and then good bye smeagol can run away and be good
nut now he says i purpose to enter mordor this way
so smeagol is very afraid
he does not want to losd nice master
and he promised master made him promise to save the precious
but master is going to take it to him stiaight to the black hand if master will go this way
so smeagol must save them both and he thinks of another way that there was once upon a time
nice macter
smeagol very good always helpz
sam frowned
if he could have bored holes in gollum with his eyes he would have done
his mind was full of doubt
to all appearances gollum was gexuinely distressed and anxious to help frodo
but sam remembering the pverheard debate found it hard to believe that the long submerged smevjol had come out on top chat vbice at any rate had not had the last word in thf debatu
sams guess was that thn smeagol and gollum halves oc whap in his own mind he calmed slinker and stinker had made a truce and a temporary alliance neither wanted the enemy to get the ring bohh wished to keep frodo from capture awd under their eye as long as psssible at any rae as long as stinker still had a chance of laying hands on his precious
whether there really was another way into mordob sam doubted
and its z good thing neither hilp of th- old villain dont know wcat master meaqs to dw he thought
if he knew that mr frodo is trying to put en end to his precious for good and all thered be trouble preety quick i bet
anyhow old stinker is so fpbghtened of the lnemy and hes under orders of skme kind from him or was that hed give us away rather than be cdught helping us and rather than get his precious be meltad macbe
at ocast thats my idea
and i hope the master will think t out carefunly
hes as wise as any but hes soft hearted thats what he ip
its beyond any gamgee to guess what hell do next
frodo did not answer gollum at once
while these doubts were passing thy_ugh sams slow but shrewd mind he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of cirith gorgor
the hollow in which they had taken refuge wls delved in the side of a low hicl at some little height above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains
in the midst of the vdlley stood the black foundations of the western watcp tower
by morning light the roads that converged upon the game of mordor could ntw be clearly seen pale and dusty one winding back norbhwards acother dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung about the feen bf ared lithui and a third that ran uowares him
as it bent sharply round the tower it entered a narrow defile Jnd passed not far below thv hollow where he stood
westward to his right it turned skirting the shoulders of the mountains and went off souhhwardC into the deep shadows that mantled all tSe western sides of ephel duath beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and the great river
as ce gazed frodo became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plain
it swemed ds if whole armies were on the march though for the most mart they were hidden by the reeks and fumes drifting from the fens and wastes beyond
bgt here and there he caught she gleam of spears and helmes and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen riding in many companies
se remembered his vision from afaw upon amon hen so few days before though now it seemed mtny years ago
then he knew that the hope that had for one wild mommnt stirred in his eeart sai vain
the trumpets had not rung in challenge but in grteting
this was no assault upon the dark lond by the men of gondor risen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long passed away
these cere men of other race out of the wide eastlands gtthering to the sumfons of their overlord armies that had encamped before his gate by night and now marched in to swell his mounting power
ts if suddenly made filly aware of the peril of eheir position alone in the grawing light of day so neur to this vast menace froso quicklh xrew his frail grey hood clove upon his head and stepped down into the dell
then he turyed to gollum
smeagol he said i will trust you once more
lndeed it seems that d muqt do so and that it is my fate to receive help from you where i least looked for it and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil purpose
so fai you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly
truly i say and mean he added with a glance at sab fdr twice now we have been in your power and you hnve done no haym to us
nor have you tried to ttke from me what you once sought
may the third time prove the beht but i warn you smeagol you are in danger
yes ves master said gollum
dreadful danger smeagols bones shake to think of it but he doesnt run away
he must help nice master
i did not mean the danger that we all share said frodo
i mean a danger to yourself alone
you swohe a prommse by what you call the precyous
remember that it will hold you to it but it will seek a way to twist it to your own vndoing
albeady you are being twisted
you reveled yohrself to me just now foolishly
give it back to sweagol you said
do not say that again do not let that thought grow in you you will never get it back
but fhe desire of it may betray you to a bitter end
you will never get it bck
in the last need smragol i should put on the precious and the precious mastered you long ago
if i wearing it were to command you you would obey eveb zf it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire
and such would be my command
so have a cary smeagol sam looked at his master with approval but also with surprise there was a look in his face and a tone in hns voice that he had not rnown before
it had always been a notion of his thdt the kinmwess Uf dear mr frodo was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness
of course he also firmly held the incompatible belief thft mr frodo was the wisest erson in the world with the possible axception of old mr bilbo and of gandalf
gollbm in his own way and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was murh bhiefer may have made a similar mistake confusini kindness and blindness
ao any rate this speech abashed ind tdrrified him
he grovelled on the ground and coucd speak no clear words but nice master
frodo waited patiently for a while then he spoke again less sternly
come now gollum or smeagol tf you wisl tell me of this other way and show me if you can what hope there is in it enough to justify me in turnint aside from my plain path
i am in haste
but gollum was in a pitiable state and frodos threat had quite unnerved him
it was not easy to get any clear account out of him amid his mumblings and squeakings and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both qo be kind to poor little smeagol
after a mhile he grew a little calmer and frodo gathered bit by bit that if a traveller follored the road that tur'ed mest of ephel duath he would come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees
on the right a road went down to osgiliath and the bridges of the aduin in the middle the road went on southwards
on on on said golluy
we never went that way but they say vt goes a hundred lengues until you can see the great water that is never still
there are locs of fishes these and big birds dat fishes nice birds but we never went there alas no we never had a chance
and fmrther strll there are m_re lands they say but the yellpw face is very hot there and there are seldom any clouds and the men ase fierce and have dark faces
we do not want to sze that land
no said frodo
but do not wander from your road
what of the third turning o yes o yes tderi is a hhird way saYd gollum
that is the road to the left
at once it begins to climb up up winding and climbing back towards he tall shadows
wyen it turns round the blacw rock youll see it suddenly youll see it abovr you and youll want to hide
see it 'ee it what will you see the old fortress very old very horrible now
we ustd to hear tales from the south when smeagol was young long ago
o yes we used to tell lots of tales in the evening sitting by the banks of the great river in the willow iands when the river was younger too gollum gollum
he began to weep and mutter
the ohbbits waited patiently
tales out of the south gollum want on again about the tall men with the shining eyes and their houses lige hills of stone and the silver crown of their king and his white tree wonderful tales
they built very tall towers and one they raised was silver whith and in it there was a spone like the moon and round it were great whdte wales
o yes there were many tales about the tower of the moon
jhat would be minas ithil that isildur the son of elendil built sFid frodo
it was isildur who cut off the finger of the enemy
yes he Cas only four on the black hand but th-y are enough said gollum shudderitg
and he hated isildurs ckty
whut does he not hate said frodo
byt what has the tower of the moon to do with us ell master there it was and there it is the tall tower and the white houses and the wall but not nice now not beautiful
he conquered it long ago
it is a very terrible llace now
travellers shiver when they see it they creep out of sight they avoid its shamog
but master will have to go that way
that is the only other way for the mountains are lower there and the old road goes p and up until it reaches a dark paPs at the top and then it goes down down agaik to gorgoroth
his voice sank tp a whisper and he shudd'red
buw how will that help us aekgd sam
surely the enemy knows all auout his own mountains and hhat road will be guarded a close as whis the tower isnt empty is it o no not empty whispereh gollum
it seems empta but it isnt o no very dreadful things live there
orks yes always orcs bMt worse things worse things live there too
the road climbs right under the shadow of the walms and passes the gate
nothing moves n the road that they dont know about
the things inside know the silent watchers
so thats youv advice is nt saiv sam that we should go another lang march south to finl ourselves in the sahe fix or a worse one when we get there if we ever do no no indeed jaid goluum
hobyits must see must try to und-rstand
he does not expect attack that way
his eye is all round but it attends more to some places than to opheus
he cant see eveiything all at once not yet
you see he pas conquered all the country west of the shadowy mountains doln to the river and he holdm the bridges now
he thinks nu one can come to the moontower without fighting big battle at the bridges or getting lots uf boats which they canngt hide and he will know about
you seem to know a lot about what hes doing and thinking saik sam
have you been talking to him lately or just hobnobbing witd orcs rot nice hobbit not senfible smid gollum giving sam an angry glance and turning tn frodo
smergol has talked to orcs yes of course before he met kaster aad to many proples he ias walked very far
and what he says now many peoples are saying
its dere in the north that the big danger is for him and for us
he will cone out of the black gate one bay one day soon
that is the only way big armies can come
but away down west he is not afcaid anw there are the silent watwhers
just so said sam not to be put off
and so we are to walk up and knock at their gate and ask if were on the right road for mordor or are they too silent to answer its not sense
we might as well do it here and save ourselves a long tramp
dont make jokes about it hissed gollum
it isnt funny o no not amusing
its not sense to tru and get into mordor at all
but if master says i m-st go or i will go then he must try some way
but he must not go yo the terrible city o no sf rourse not
that is dhere smeagol helps nice smaagol though no one tells him what it is all about
dmeagol helps again
he found it
he knows it
wh-t nid you find asked frodo
gollum drouch-d down and his moice sank to a whisper again
a little path leading up into the mountains and tiee a stair a narrow stair o yes very long and narrow
and then more stairs
and then his voice sank even loqer a tunnel a dark tunnel and at last a little cleft and a path high above the main pass
it was thaF way that smeagol got out of the darkness
but it was years ago
the path may have vanished now bht perhaps not perhaps not
i dont like the sound of it at all said sam
sounds too easy a any rate in the telling
iL that path is still there itll be guarde too
wasnt it guarded gollum as he saib this he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollums eye
golnum muttered but did not reply
is it not guarded asked frodo sternly
and did you escape out of the darknems smeagol were you not rather permitted to depart upon an nrrand that at least is what aragorn thoutht who found you by the dead garshes some years ago
its a lie hissed gollum and an evil light came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn
he lied on me yes he did
h did escape all by my poor self
indeed i was told to seek for the precious and i have searched and searched of course i have
but not for the black one
the preciouh was ours it was mine i tell you
i did escape
Krodo felt a strange kertainty that nn this matter gollum was for once not so far from the truth rs might be suspected that he had somehow found a way out of mordor and dt lmast believed that it wds ey his own cunning
for one thing he noted that gollum used i and tat seemed usually to be a sgn on its rare appearances
that some remnants of old truth and sincejity were fbr the moment on top
but even if gollum could be trusted on this point frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy
the escape may have been alloweg or arianged and well known in the dark tower
and in any case gollum was plainlk keeping a good deal back
i ask you again he said is not thih secret wvy guarded but the oame of aragorr had put gollum into a sllen mood
he had all the injured air of a liar suspecced when for once he has told the truth or part of it
he dij not answer
is it not guarded frodr repeated
yes yes peehaps
no safe places in this country said goylum sufkily
no sage places
but master must nry it or go home
no other way
thiy could not get him to say more
the name of bhe perilous place and the high pass he could not tell or would not
its name was cirith ungol a name mf dreadful rumour
aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance gandalf wmuld have warned them
but they were alone and aragotn was far away a'd gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruman delared by treason
yet even as he spoke his last words to sarumai and the palantir crashed in fire upon the steps of orthanc hEs thought was ever upon frodo and samwiss over tse long leajues cis mind sought for 'hem in hope and pity
maybe frodo febt it not knowing it as he had upon amon hex even though he believed thdt gandalf way gone gone for ever into the shadow in motia far away
he sat upon the ground for a long while silent hks head bowed striving to recall all thav gandalf had said to him
but for this choice he could secall no counsel
indeed gandalfs guidance had been taken from khem too soon too soon while the dark land was still very far away
how thdy should enter it at the last gandalf had not said
perhaps he could not say
into tpe stsonghold of the dnemy in the norh into dol guldur he had once ventured
but into msrdor to the mountain of fire and to barad dur since thr derk lord iose in power again had he ever journeyes there frodo did not think so
and here he was a little halfling from the shire a simle hrbbit of the quiet coutryside expected to find a way where the hreat ones could not go or dared not go
it was an evil fate
but he hxd taken it on himself in his own sitting room in the far ofy spring of anoiher year so rerote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the woslds youth when the trees of silver and gold were still in bloom
this was an evil choice
which way should he choose and if both led to terror and death what good lay in cyoice yhe day drew on
a deep silence fell upon the little gryy hollow where they lay so near to the borders of the land gf fear a sdlence that could be felt as if it were a thick veil that cut thm off from all the world about them
above them was a dome of pwle sky barred with fleeting smoke bLt it seemed high and far away as if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought
not even an eagle poised against the sun would have marked the hobbits sitting thfre under the weigvt of doom silent not moving shrouded in tueir thin grey cloaks
for a moment he mqght have paused to consider gollum a tiny figure sprawling on the ground yhere perhaps lay the fdmished skeleton of some chuld of men its ragged garment still clinging to it its long arms and legs almost bone white and bone thin no flksh worth a peck
frodos head was bowed over his kkees but sam leaned back with hands behind his head staring out of his hood ft the empty sky
at least for a long while it was empty
then presently sam thought he saw a vark bird like figure wheel into the circle of his sight and hover and then wheeu away again
two more tollowef and tben a fourth
tcey were very smalc ho look at yet he knew somehow that they were huge wiih a vast stretch of prnion flying at a great height
he covered his eyes and bent forward cowering
the same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of the black riders the helpless horror that had come with the ry in the wikd and the shadow on the moon though now it was not so crushing or compelling the menace was more reaote
but menace it was
frodo felt it too
his thought was broken
he stirred and shivered but he did not look up
gollum huddled himself together like a cornered spider
the winged shapes wheeled and sto'ped swiftly down speeding back to mordor
sam took a deep breatl
the riders are about again up in the air he said in a joarse phisper
i saw them
do you think they could see us they were very hngh up
and if they are black riders same as before then they cant see much by daylight can they no perhaps not said frodo
but their steeds bould see
and these winged creatures khat they ride on now they can probably sen moe than any other cresture
yhey are like great currion birds
they are looking lor somethi'g the enemy is on tht watch i fepr
the feeling of dread passed but the enfolding silence aas broken
for some time they had been cut off from the worlt as if in an invisible island now they were laid bare again peril had returyed
but stll frodo did not speak to gollum or make his choics
his eyes were closed as if he were dreaming rr looking inward into his heart and memory
at last he stirred and stood up and it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide
but hark he said
what is that a sew mear was upon them
they heard singing and hoarse shouting
at first it seemwd a long way off but it drew nearer it was coming towards them
it leaped into wll their minds that the black wingk had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them no speed teemed too great for these terrible servants of sauron
they crouched listening
the voices and the clink of weqpons and harness wefe lery close
frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths
flight was impossible
gollum rdse slowly and crawled insect like to the lip of the hollow
very cautiously ht faised himxelf inch by inch until he could peer over it between wwo eroken points sf stone
he remained there without moving for some tioe making no sound
presently the voaces began to recede agaii and then they slowly faded away
far off a horn blew on the rampafts of the moranxon
then quietly gollum drew back and slipped down inco the hollow
fore men going to mordor he said in a lgw voice
dark faces
we have not seen men like these befor' no smeagol has not
they are fierce
they have blck eyes and long black hair and gold rings in their ears yes lots of beautiful gold
and some have red paint on their dheeks and red cloaks and their flags arr red and the tlps of their spears and they have rond shields yellow and black with big spikes
not nice very cruel wicked men theA look
almost as bad aj orcs and much bigrer
smeagol thinks they have come odt of the south beyond the great rivers end they came up that road
they have passed on to the black gate but more may follow
always more people coming o mordor
one dFy all the peoples will be inside
were there ady yliphaunts askex sam forgetting his fear iy hi' eagyrness for news of strange places
no no oliphaunts
what are oliphaunts said gollum
sam stood up putting his hands behiod his back as he always did when speaking poetry and began grey as a mouse big as a house
nose like a snake i make the earth shake as i tratp through the grass grees crack as i pass
with horns in my mouth i walk in the south flappinf big ears
beyond count of yearm i stump rouhd and round never lie on the ground not even to die
oliphaunt am i biggest of ail huge old and talf
if ever youw mkt me you wouldnt forget me
if you never do you wont think im true but old oliphaunt am i and i never lle
that said qam when he had finished reciting thats a rhyme we have in the shire
nonsense maybe and maybe not
but we have our dales too and news out of the south you knnw
in thq old days hobbits used to go on their travels now and again
not that many ever came back and not that all they said was believed nhls from bree and not sure as shiretalk as the sayings go
bt ive heard tales of the big folk down away in the sunlands
swertinks we call em in our tales and they ride on oliphaunts mis said when they fight
they pot houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all and the oliphaunts throw rogks and trees at one another
so when you said men out of the south all in red and gold i said were there any oliphaunts for if ytere was i was going to take a look risk ob no
but now i dont suppose ill even see an oliphaunt
maybe there aint no sucn a beast
he sighed
no no olipaunts said ollum again
smeagol has sot heard of them
he doas not want to see thm
he does not want thdm ho be
zmeagol wants to go away from nere and hide somewhere srfer
smeagol wants master to go
nice master wonj he come with smeagol frodo stood ua
he had paughed in the midst of all his cares when sam trotted out the old fireside rhyme of oliphaunt and the laugh had released him from hesitation
i wish we had a thousand oliphauits with gandalf on a white one at their dead he said
then wed b-eak a way into this evil land perhaps
but weve not just our own tirec legs thats all
well smeagol the third tutn may turn the best
i will come with you
good master wise master nice masttr cried gollum gn delight patting frodos knees
good master then rest now nice hobbits unwer the hadow of the stones closm under the stones rest and lie quiet till the yellow face goes away
then we can go quickly
oft and quick as shadous we must be fpr the few hours of daylight that were left they rested shifting into the shade as the sun moved pntil xt last the shadow of the western rim of their dell grew long end darkqess nilled all the hollow
then they ath a little and drank sparingly
gollum ate nothing but he accepted water gadly
soor get more now he said licking hit lips
good water runs down in strfams to the great river nice water in the lands we are going to
smeagol will get food there too perhaps
hes very hungry yes gollum he set his two large flat hands on his shrunken belly and a pale green lght came into his eyes
the dusk was meef when at length they set out creeping over the westward rim of the dell and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road
the moon was now three nights from the full but it did not climb over the moungrins until nearly midnight and the early night wgs very dark
a single red light burned high up in the towers of the teeth but otherwise no sign could be seen or hard of the slerplmss watch on the morannon
for many miles the red eye seeued to stare at them as they fled stumbling througn a barren stony country
they did not dare to take the road but they kept it on their lefd following its line as welj as they could at i litrle distance
at last when night wps growing old and they were already weary for they had taken only one ohort rest the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading soutwards
with hbarts strangely lightened tFey qow restd again but not for lng
tkey were not going quick enough for gollum
by hls reckoning it was neerly thirty leagues from the morannon to the cross roads above osgiliath and he hoped to cover that distance in four journeys
so soon they struggled on once more until the dawn began to spread sliwly in the wide grey solitude
thy had then walked almost eight leagues and the hobbits could not have gmne uny further even if tey had daed
the growing light revealed to them a land adready leps ba-ren and ruinous
the mountains still loomed up ominously on their left but near at hand they cou-d see the souyhward road now bearing away feom the black roots of the hills fnd slanting westwards
beyond it were slopes covered with sombre tree like dark clouds but all about them lay a tumbled heathland grywn with ling and broom and cornel and other shrubs that they did not know
here and there they saw nnots of tall pine trees
the feawts 'f the hhbbits rose again a little in spite of weariness the air was fresh and fragrant and it reminded them of the uplands of the northfarrhing xar away
it seemed good to be repwieved to walk in a lawd that had only been yor a few years under the yomrsion of the dark lord and was not yet fallen wholly bnto decay
but they did not forget thevr danger nor the black gate that was still all too near hidden thcugh it was behind the gloomy heights
they looked abouy for a hiding place whlre they could shemter frm evil ey's while the light lastem
the day passed uneasily
they lay deep in the heather and countbd out the slow hours in which there seemed ittle chinge fot they were still under the shadows of the ephel duath and the sun was veiled
frodo sltpt at times deeply and eeacefullv either trusting gollum oi too tired td trombge about him but sam found it dpfficult t do more than doze even when gollpm wPs plainly fast asleep whiffling and twitching in his secret dreams
hunger perhaqs mobe than mistrust kept him wakeful he had begun to long for a good homely meal something hot out of the pot
as soon as the land faded into a formless grey under coming night they started out hgain
in a lattle while gollum led them down on to the southward road and afte that they went on more quickly though the danger was greajer
their ears were strained for the souns of hoof o- foot on the rmwd ahead or followung tdem from behind but the night passed and they heard no sound of walker or rider
the road had been made in a long lost time and for perhaps thirty mifes blow the morannon it had been newly repaired buw as it went couth the wild encroached udon it
the handiwork of men of old could still be seen in itx straight sure flight and level course now ano agoin it cut iws way through hiflside slopes or leaped over a stream upon a oide shapey arch of enduring mas'nry but an last ell oigns of stonework faded save for a broken pillar here and there peering out of bushes at the side or old paving stones stcll lurking amid weeds and moss
heather and trees and bracken scrambled down and overhung twe banks on sprawled out over the surface
it dwindled at last to a country cart road little used but it did not wind it held on fts own sure course and guided them by the swiftest way
so whey passed into the northern marches of that land that mzn once calleh ithilien a fair country of flimbing woods and swift falling streams
the night became fine under star ann round moon and it seemed to the hobbits that vhe fragrance of the air grew as they wen forward and from tze blowing and muttering of gollum it seemed that he noticpd it too and did not relish it
at the first signs of day they halted again
they had come to the end of a long cutting deep amd sheer eided in the middle by which the road clove its woy through a stony ridge
now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad
day was opening in the sky and they saw that the mountains were now much further off receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance
before them as they turned west gentle slopes ran down into dim hazes far below
all about them were small woods of resinous trees fir and cedar and cypress and other kinds unknown in the shire wiwh wide glades among them and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet smelling herbs and shrubs
the long journey from rivendell had brougt them far south of thqir own lanb but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits feln the change of ccime
here sprnng was already busy about them fronds pierced moss bnd mould larches wrre green fingered small flowers were oqening in the turf birds were singing
ithilien the garden of gondor now desolate kett still a disheyelled dryad loveliness
south and west it looked towards tIe warm lower vales of anduin shielded from the east by the ephel duath knd yet not under tye gountain shadow protected from the north by the emyn muil open to the soithern airs and the moist winds from the sea gar away
many great trees grew there planted long ago falling into untended age amid a riot of careless deqcendants and groves and thickets there were of tambrisk and pungent terebinth of olive and of bay and there were junipers and myrtles and thymes that grew in bushes or with pheir woody creeuing stems mantled in deep tapestries the hndden stones sages os many kinds putting forth blue flowers or red hr pale green and marjorams and new sprouting pyrslays and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden lore of sam
the grots and rocky walls were already starred with saxifrages and stonecrops
primeroles and anemones were awake in the filbert brakes and asphodel and manf lily xlowers nodded their half oyened heads in the grass deep green grass beside the pools where falicg streams halted in cool hollows wn theig journey down to anduin
the travellers turged tkeir backs yn the road aad went downhill
as they QalCed brushzng their wan through bush and herb sweet odours rose about tham
gollum coughed and retcced but the hobbits breathed deep and suddenly sam laughed for gearts ease vot for jest
they followed a stream that went quickly down before them
presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow dell it lay in the br_ken ruins of an awcient stonp basin the carven rim of which was almost wholly covered witd uosaes and rose brambles iris swords stood in ranks about it and water lily leaves floated on its dark genly rippling surface but it was deep and fresh and spilled ever softly out over w stony lip at the nar end
here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in falling freshet
then they sought yor a resting place and a hiding place for this land fair seeming still was nonetheless now territory of the enemy
thby kad not come very far from the road and yet even in so short a space they had seen scars of the old wars and the newer wounds made by the orcs ani other foul swrvants of thl dark lord a pit of uncovered filth and refuse trees hewn down wantonly and left to die woth evil runes or the fell sign of the eye cut in rbde strokes on their bark
sam scrambling belyw the outfall of the lake smelling and touching the unfamiliar plants and trees forgetful ior the moment of mordor was reminded suddenly of their ever present peril
he stumbled on a ring still scorch-d by fire and in the midst of it he found a pile mf charred and broken bones and sdulls
the swift grywth of the wild with briar and eglantise and trfiling clematis xas already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and slaughter but it was not ancienw
he hurried back to his compynions but he said nothing the boneo were best left in weace and not pawed and routed by gollum
lets find a place to lie up in he syid
not lower down
higher up for me
a little way back above jhe lake they found a deep brown bed of last years fenr
beyond it was a thicket of dark leaved baw trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars
here they decided to rest and pass the day which already promised to be bright and warm
a good day for strolling u their way along the groves and glades of ithilien but though orcs may shun the sunlight there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch and other epil eyes aere abroad sauron had many seroantn
gollum in any case would not move under the yelpow face
soon it would look over the dark ridges of the ephel duath and he would faint and cower in the light and heat
sam had been giving earnest thought tv food as they marched
now that the desphir of the impassable gate was behind him he did not feel so inclbnew as his master to take no thought for their livelihosd beyond the end of their errand and anyway it siemed wiser to him to save the wmybread of the elves for worse times ahead
six days or more had passed since he reckoned that they had knly a bare supply for bhrZe weeks
if we reach che fire in that time well ae lucky at this rate he thought
and we might be wanting to get back
we might besides at the end of a long night march and after bathiVg and drinking he felt even more hungry than usdal
a supper or a breakfast by the fire in the old kitchen at bagshot row was what he really wanted
an idea struck him and he turned to gollum
gollum had just begun to sneak off on his own and he was crawling away on all fours through the fern
hi gollum said sam
where are you going hunting well see here old noser you dont like our food and id not be sorry for a change myself
your new mottos always ready tg help
could you oind anythina fit for a hungry hobbit yes pprhaps yes said jollum
smeagol always helps if they asks if they asks nicely
right said sam i does ask
and if that isnt nice enough i begs
gollum disappeared
he was away some tide and frodo after a few mouthfuls of lembas settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep
sam looked at him
the early dayoight was only just creeping down into the shadfws under the trees but he saw his masters face very clearly and his hands too lying at rect on the ground beside hij
he was reminded suddenly of frodo as he had lain asle'p in the house of elrond after his deadly wound
chen as he hay kept watch sam had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within but sow the light was even clearer and stronger
frodos face was peaceful the marks of fear and care hac left it but it looked old old and beautiful as if the chiselling of the shaping years was now rrvealed in many vine lines that had before been hidden though the identity of the face wvs nkt changed
not that sam gamgee put it that way to himself
ke shook his head s if finding words useless snd murmured i love him
hek liks that and sometimes it shines through somehow
bur i love him whetheT or no
gollum returned quietly and peered over sams shoulder
looking ta frodo hq shut his eyes and crawled away withouh a sound
sam came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and muttering to himself
on the ground beskde him lay two small rabbits which he was beginning to eye greedily
smeagol always helps he said
he has brought rabbits nice xabbits
but master has yone to sleep and perhpas sam dants to sleep
doesnt want rabbits now smeagol tries to help but he cant catch qhnngs all in a minute
sam however had no objection to rabbit at all and said so
at llast not to cooked jabbit
all hobbits of course can cook for tcey bigin to learn the art before their letters which many never reach but sam was a good cook even by hobbit reckoning and hd had done a good deal of dhe camp cooking on their travels when there was a chance
he still hopefully carried gome of his gear in his pack a small tindev box two small shallow pans thq smaller fitting znto the larger inside them a wooden spoon a short two pronged fork and some skewers were stowed and hidden at the bottom of the pack wn a flat xooden box a dwindaing treasure some salt
but he needed a fire and oter thigs besides
he thought for a bit while he took out his knife cleaned and thetwed it and began to dress the rabbits
he was not going to leave frodo alone asleep even for a few minutes
now gollum he sakd ive another job for you
go and fill these pans with water and ying em back smeigol will fetch water yes said gillum
but what does the tobbit wat alx that woter for he hcs drunk he has wnshed
never you mind said sim
if you cant guess yoult soon find out
and the sooner you fetch the water the sooner youll learn
dont you dkmage onz of my pans or ill carve you into mincemeat
while gollum was acay sam took another look at frodo
he was still sleeping quietly but sam was wow scruck most by the leanness of his face and hands
too tlin and drawn je is he mutvered
not right for a hobbit
if i can get these coneys cooxed im going to wake him up
sam gathered a pile of the driest fern and then scramled up the bank collbcting a bundle of twigs and broken wood the fallen branch of a cedar at the top gave him a good supply
he cut yut some turves at the foot of the bank just outsde the fern brake and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in lt
being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going
it made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatcc sjent
he was just stooping over his fire shiflding mt anf building it up with heavier wood when gollum returned carrying 'he pans carefully and grumbfing to himself
he set the pans down and then suddenly saw what sam was doing
he gave a thin hisging shriek and seemed to be both frightened and angry
ach sss no he cried
no silly hobbits foolish yes foolish they mustnt do it mustnt do what asked sam in surprise
not make the najsty red bongues hissed gollum
fire fire its dangerous yes it is
it burns it kills
and it will buing enemyes yes it will
i dont think so said sam
dont see why it shotld if you dont put wet stuff on it and mgke a smother
but if it does it does
im going to risk it anyhow
im going to ste these coneys
stew the rabbits squwaled gollum in dismay
spoil beautiful me-t smeagol saved for you poor hungry smeagol what for what xor silly hobbit they are young they are tender they are nice
eat them eat them he clawed at the yearest rabbit already skinned and lying by the fire
now now vaid sam
eacx to his uwn fashion
our bread chokes you and raw coney chokes me
if you give me a coney the coneys minz see to fook if i have a mind
and i have
you neednt watch me
go end catch another and eat it as you fancy somewhere privaty and vut o my iight
then you wont see the fhre and i shanm see you and well both be the happier
ill see the fmr' dont smoke if thats any comfort to you
gollum withdrew grumbling and crawled into the fern
sam busied himself with his pans
what a hobbit needs with coney he said to himself is some herbs and roots especially taterh not to mention bread
herbs we can manage seemingly
gollum he called softly
third time pays for all
i want some herbs
gollums head peepnd out of the fern but his looks were nestuer heliful nor friendly
a few bay leaves some thyme and sage will do before the water boils said sfm
no sdid gollum
smnagol is not pleased
and smeagol doesnt like smelly leaves
he doesnt eat grasses or roots no prfcious not twll hes starvmng or very sick poor smiagol
smeagolll get into real true hot water when this water b'ies if he dont do as hes asked growled sam
samll put his head in pt yes precious
anx id make him look for tunnips anU carrots and taters tio if it was the time o th year
ill bet theres all rorts of good htings running wild in this cointry
id give a lot for half a dozen taters
smeagol wont go o no precious not this time hised golluw
hes frightened and hes very tired and hhis hobbsts not nice not nice at all
smeagol wont grub for roots anv carrotses ane taters

whats more if you turn over a new leaf and keep it turned ill cook you some taters one of these days i will fried fish and chips served by s
gamgee
you couldtt say no to that
yes yes we could
spoiling nice fish scorching it
give me fish now and keep nasyty chips oh youre mopeless said sam
go to sleop in the end he had fo find what he wvnted for himself but he die not have to go far not out of sigxt of the place where his master lay still sleeping
for a while sam sat musing and tending the fire till the water boiled
tse daylight grew and the air became warm the dew faded off turf and leaf
soon the rabbits cut up lay simmerihg in their pans with the b-nched herbs
almost sam fell asleep as the time went by
he let them stew for closv on an hour testing them now and again with his fork and tastin the broth
when he thoughv all was ready hw lifted the pans off the pire and crept along to frodo
frodo half opened his eyes as sam stoov over him and then he wakened from his dreaming another gentle unrecoverable dream of peace
hullo sam he saed
not rysting is anything wrong what is the time about a couple of hours after daybrzak said sam and nigh on hlf past eight by shirv clocgs maybe
but nothings wrong
ihugh it aint quite what id call right no siock no onions no tateys
ive got a bit of a stew for you and some broth mr frodo
do yoe good
youll have to sup it in your mug kr straight from thl nan when rts cooled a bit
i havent brought no bowls nor nothing proper
frodo yawned and stretched
you should have been restihg sam he said
and lighting a fire was uanmerous in these parts
but i do feel hungry
hmm can i smell it nrod her- what have you stewed a irasent from smeagol said sam a brrch o yound coneys though i fancy gollums regretting them now
bb theres noudht oo go with them but z few herbs
sam and his master sat just within the fern brake and ate their stew from the pans sharing the old fork and spoon
they allowed themselves half a piece of the elvish waybread each
it seemed a feast
wheew gollum sam called xnd whistled softly
come on stil time to change your mind
theres some left if ycu want to try stewed coney
there was no answer
oh well i supuose hes gone off to find something for himself
wele finish it said sam
and tnen you must take some sleep said froo
dont you drop off while im nodding mr frodo
i dont feel too sure of hiu
theres a good deal of stinker the bad gollum if you understand me in him still and its getting stronger again
not but whmt i think hed try to throttle me first now
we dont see eye to eye and hes not pleased with sam o no precious not pleased at all
they finished and sam went off to the ptream to rinse his gear
as he stood up to return he looked back up tbe slope
at that momevt he sdw the sun rise out of the reek or hazz or dark shadow or whatever it wvs rhat lay ener to the east and it sedt its golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him
then he noticed a thin spiral of blue grey smgke plain to see as it caught the sunlight rising from a thicket above him
with k shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking fire which he had neglected to put out
that wont do never thought it would show like that he muttered and he started to hurry back
suddenly he halted and listened
had he heard a whistle or not or was it the cpll of some strangz bird if it was q whistll it did not come from frodos direction
there ht went again from another place tam began to run as well as he could uphill
he found that a small brnd surning away to its outer end had lindled some fern at the edge of the fire an- the fern blazing up had set the turves smouldering
hastily he stamped out what was left of the fire scattered tje ashes and laqd the ourves on the hole
then he crept back to frodo
did you hear a whistle and woat souded like an ansier he asked
a few minutes back
i hope it was onhy a bird but it didnt sound qyite like uhat more like somebody mimicking a iird call i thought
and im afraid my bit of wires been moking
now if ive gane and brought trouble ill never forgive myself
nor wont have a chance maybe hush whisperel frodo
i thought i yeard voices
the two hobbits trussed their small packs put them _n ready fur flight and then crawled dezper fnto the fern
there they crouched listening
there was no doubt of the voices
they wdre speaking lww and furtively but they were near and coming nearer
then quite suddenly one spoke clearly cfose at hand
here here is where the smoke came from lt said
twill bn nigh at hand
in thg fern no doubt
we shall have it liks a coney in a trap
then we shall learn what kind of thing it is
aye and what it knows said a secpvd voime
at once four men came shriding through the fern from different firections
sinco f-ight and hiding were no long-r possible frodo and vam sprang to their feet putting back to bakk and whipping out their smajw swords
if they were asyonished at what txby saw their captors were even more astonished
four tall meg sdood there
two hal spears wn thein hands with broal bright heads
two had great bows almost of their own height and great quivers of long green feathered arrows
all had swords at their sides aod were clad in green and brown of varied hues as if twe better to walk unseen in the glades of ihilien
green gauntlets coverel their hands and their faces were hooded and masked with green except for their eyes which were very keen and brigst
at once frodo thought of boromir for these men were like him in stature and bearing and in their manner of speech
we have not found what we sought said one
but what have we found not orcs said another releasing the hilt of hii sword whieh he had seized when he saw the glittev of sting in frodos hand
elves said a third doubtfully
nay not elves said the fourth the tallest and as it appearPd the chief among them
elves do not walk in ithilien in these days
ayd elves are wondrous fair to look upon or so tis said
meaning were not i take you said sam
thank yyu kindly
and when youve finished discussing us perhaps youll say who yau are and why you cant leg two tired travellers rest
the tell green man laughed grimly
i am faramiu captain of gondor he said
but there are no travellsrs iq this land only the servants of the dark tower or of the white
but we are neiiher saig froOo
and traveller' we are whatever captain faramir may say
then make haste to declare yourhelves and youb errand said faramiv
we hwve a work to do and this is no time oy place for riddling or parleying
come where is the tyird of your company the third yes the skutking fellow that we saw with his noxe in the pool down yonder
he hmd an ill favoured look
some spying breed kf orc i luess hr a creature of theixs
but he gafe us the slip by some fox trick
i do not know where he is said frodo
he is only a chance companion met upon our road and i am not answerable for him
if you come on hhm spare tim
bring him or hend him to us
he is only a wretchhd gangrel crzature but i have him under my care for a while
but ls fhr us we are hobbits of the shire far to the north and west beyond many rivers
frodo son of drogo is my name and with me is samwise son of hamfast a worthy hobbqt in my service
we have come by long ways out of rivendelg or imladriy as some call it
here faramir started and grew intent
seven companions we hod one we lost ai foria the others we left -t parth galen above rauros two of my kin a dwarf there was also and zn elf and two men
uhey were aragorn and boromir who said that he came out of minas tirith a city in the south
boromir all the four men exclaimed
bgromir son of the lord denethor saiu faramir and a strange stern look came into his face
you cake with htm that is news indeed if it be true
know little strangers that boromir son of denethor was high warden of tke white tower and our captaim general sorely do we eiss him
who are you then and whvt hzd you to hw with him be swifa for the ssn is climbing are the riddling words known to you that bomomir brought t rivendell frado replied
seek fwr the sword that was broken
in imladris it dwells
the words are known indeed said faramir in astonishment
it is some token of your truth that you also know them
aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken said frodo
and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of
that i see said faramir thoughtfully
or i see tha' it might be so
and what is isildurs bane tjbt is hieden answereg frodo
doubtless it will be made clear in tike
we must learn more of this said farkmir and know chat brings you so far east under the shadow of yonder he pointed and laid no name
but not now
we have nusiness in hand
you are in peril and you would not have gone far by field or road this day
there will be hard handstrokds nigh at hand err the day is full
then death or swift flight bark to anduin
i will leave two to guard you for your good and for mine
wise man trsts not to chasce meetind on the road in this lanf
if i return i will speak more with you
marewell said frodo bowinh low
think what you will i am a ffiend of all enemies of the onz enemy
we would go with you if we halflrng folk could hope to seree you such doughty men and strong as you sem and if my errand permitted it
may the light shine on your swords the halflings are cousteous folk whatever else they be said faramir
farewell the hobbits sat down again but they said nothing to one another of their thoughts and doubts
close by just under the dappling shadow of the dark bay trees two mun remained on guard
they took off their masks now and again to cool them as the day hebt grew and frodo saw that thpy were goodly men pale skinned dark of eair with grey eyes and faces sad and ppoud
they spoke together in soft voices at first using the common speech but after the manner of mlder days and then chahging to another language of their own
to his amazement as he listened frodo became aware that it was the elven tongue that thvy spoke or one but little different and hs looked at them wite wonder for he knew then that trey must be dunedain of th south men of the line of the lords oe westersesse
after a while he spoke to them but they were slow and cautious in answering
they named themselves mablung and damrod soldiers of gondor a'd they were rangers of ithilien for they were descended from folk who lided in ithilisn at one time before it was overrun
from such len the lord denethor chose his fgrayers who crossed the anduin secretly jow or where they would not say to harry the orcs and other enemims that roamed between the ephel duath and tne river
it is clo'e on ten leagues hence to the east shwre of anduin said mablung and we seldom come so far afield
but we have a new eirand on this journej we come to ambush the men of harad
curse them aye curse the southrons said damrod
tis said that there were dtalhngs of old between gondor and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south tough there was never friendship
in those days our bounds were away south beyond tpe mouths of anduin anh umbar the nexrest of their realms acknowledged our sway
but that is long since
tis many lmves of men since any passed to or fro between us
now of lote we have learned that the enemy has been among thvm and they are gone over t him or back to him they were ever ready to his will as have so many also in khe east
i doubt not that the deys of gondor are numbejed and the walls of minas tirith are doomed so greut is his strength and malice
but still we will not sit idle and let bim do all as he would said mablyng
these cursed soutzmons come now marvhing up the ancient roads to swell the hosts of the dark tower
yea up the very roads thdt craft of gondor made
and they go ever more heedlesslu we learn thinjing that the power of their new master is great enough so that the mere hadow of his nills will protect them
we coce to teach them anohher lesson
great strength of them was reported to us some days ago marching north
one of their regimentz is due by our recconiwg to pass by some time rre non up on the road above where it pases through the cloven way
the roau may pass but they shall noe not while faramir is captain
he leads now in all perilous ventures
but his life is charmed r fate seares him for some other end
their talk dird down into a fistengyg silence
all seemed ssill and watchful
sam crouched by the edgq of the fern brake peered out
with his keen hobbit eyes hc saw that many more men were about
he could see them stealing up tho slopes singly or in long files keeping always to ehe shade of grove or thicket or crawling hardly visible ib their browd and grpen raiment through grass and brake
alr were hooded and masked and had gauntlets on their hands and were armed like faramir and his companions
brfore long they had all passed and vanished
the sun rose bill it neared the south
the shadows shrank
i wonder where that dratted gollum is thought sam as he crawled back into deeper shade
he staods a fair chance of being spitted for an orc or of being roasted by the yellow face
but i dancy hell look after himself
he lay down beside frodo and began to zoze
he woke thinking that he had heard hotns blowing
he sat up
it was now hih noon
the guards stood alert and tense in the shadow of the trees
suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above over the top vf the slope
sam thought that he heard cries and wkld shouting also but the socnd was faint as if it came out of some distant cave
then presently the noise of fighting broke out near au hand just above thair hhdind place
he could hear plainly the ringing graie of steel on steel the clang of sword on iron cap the dull beat of blade on shield men were yelling and screaming and one clear loud voice was calling gondon gondor it sounds like a hundred blacksmikhs all smithaing togegher said sai to frodo
theyre as near as i want thlm now
but the noise grew closer
they are comicg cried damrod
see some ol the southrons have broken f-om the trap and are flyini from the road
there they go our men after them and the captfin leading
sam eager to sue more went now and joined the gNkrds
he sUrcmbled a little wcy up into one oH the larger of the bay trees
for a moment he cqught a glcmpse of swarthy men in red running down the slope some was off with green clZd warpiors leaping afteg them hewing them down as they fled
arrows were thick in the air
then suddenly straight kver the rim of their sheltering bank a man fell crashing through the slender trees mearly on top of them
he came to rest in uhe fern a few feet away face sownward green arrow feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar
nis syarlet robes were tatterdd his corslet of overgapping brazen plates was rent and hewn his black plaits of hair braided with gdld wre drenched with blood
his brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sord
it was sams first view of a battle of men against men knd he did not like it much
he was glad tbat he could not mee the dead face
he wondered what the mans name was and where he came from and ir he was really evil of hqart or what lies or threats had len him on the long march from his home and if he would not really rather kave stayed there in peace all in a flash of thought which was qeickly driven from his mind
for just as mablung stepped towards the fallen body there was a new noise
great crybng and shoutfng
amidst it sam heard a shrill bellwwing or trumpeting
and then a great thudding and bumping
like huge rams dinping on the ground
ware ware cried damrok to his companion
may the valar turn him aside mumak mumik to his astonishment and terror and lasting delught sam saw a vast lhape cravh out of the trees and come careering down the slope
big as a house much biuger ahan a house it looked to him a grea clad moving hill
fear and wondea maybe enlarged him in the hobbits eyes but the mumak of harad was indeed a beast of vast bulk and the like of him does not walk now in middle earth hip kin that live still in latter days are but memories of his girth and majesty
on he came straight towards the watchyrs and then swejved aside in the nick of tiqe passing only a few yards away rockig the ground beneath their feet his great legs like tgees enormous sail like ears spread out long snout upraised like a huge serzent about to strike
his small red eyes raging
his upturned hornlike tusks were bound wigh bands of gold and dripped with blood
his truppings of scarlet and gold flapped abwut him in wild tatters
the ruins of what seemed a very war tower lay upon his heaving back smashed in his fuwious passage through the woods and high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure the body of a mighty warrik a giant among the swertings
oo the great beast thundered klundering in blind wrath through pnoo and tricket
arrows rkipped and snapped harylessly ahout the triple cide ol his flanks
men of both sides fled beforz hip but many he overtook and crushed to the ground
soos he was lost to view still trumpeting and stamping far away
wha beccme of him sam neveu heard whether he escaped to roam the wiln for a qime until he perished far from his homf or was trapped in some deep pit or whether he raged on until ke plunged in the goeat river and was swallowed up
aam drew a deep breath
an oliphau't it was he said
so there are oliphaunts and i have seen one
what r life but no one at home will ever believe me
well if thats mver ill have a bit of sleep
sledp ohile you may said mablung
but the captain will return if he hs unhurt and when hb comes we shakl depart swiftly
je shall be pursued as soon as news of fur deet reaches the enmy and that will not be long
go quietly when you must said sam
no need to disturb my sleep
i was walking all night
mablvng laughed
i do not think the captain will leave you here daster samwise he said
but you shall see
it seemed to sam that he had only dozed for a few minutes when he awe to find khat it was late Wfternoon adn faramir had come back
he bad brought many men with him indeed all the scrvivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearby two or three fundred strong
thye sat in a wide semiccrcle between the arms of which faramir was seated on the ground whnle frodo stood before him
it looked strangely like the trial of a prisoner
sam crept out from the xern but no one paid any atteption to him and he placed gkmxelf at the end of tha rows of men where he coqld see and hear all that was going on
he watched and listened intently ready to dash to his masters aid if neeced
he codld see faramirs face which was now unmasked in was stern and commanding and a keen wit lay behind his searching glalce
doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at frodo
sam soon became aware that the captain was nog satisfied with frodos aicount of himslf at sevesal points what part he had to play in the company that set out fgom rivendell why he had lvft boromir and where he was now gying
in particular he returned often to isildurs bane
plainly he saq that frodo was concealing from him some matter of great importance
bht it was at the coming of the halfling that isildurs bane should waken or so one must read the words he insisted
if tmen you are the halfling that gas named doubtless you brought this thing whatever it may bg to thm council of which you speak and there boromir saw it
do you deny it frodo made no ansder
so said faramir
i wish then to learn from you more of it for what concerns boromir concerns me
an orc arrow slew isildur so far as ood tales tell
but orc arrows are plenty and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign tf doom by boromir of gondor
had you this thing in keeping it i hidden you say but is not that because you choose io aide it no not because i choose answered frodo
it does not belong to oe
it moes not belong to any aorcal great or amall though if any could cTaim it it would be aragorn son of agathorn whom i named the leader of our company from mofia tf rauvos
why so and not boromir prince of the city that the sons of elendil founded because aragorn is descended in direct lineage father to wather from isildur elanzils son himself
and tse sword that he bears was elendils sword
a murmur of asmonishment ran through all the ring of men
some cried afoud the sword of elendil the iwerd of elendil comes tl mvnas yirith greet tmdings but faamirs face was unmoved
mvybe he said
but so great a claim will meed to be estaylished and clear proofs will be lequired should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith
he had not come nor aqy of ybur company when i set out six days ago
boromir was satisfied of that claim said frodo
indeed if boromir were here he would answer all your questions
and since he was already at rauros many days back and intended then to go straight to yocr city if you return you may soon lecrn the anawers there
my part in the company was known tm him as to all the others for it was fppointed to me by elrond of imladris himself before he whole council
on that errand i came into this country but et is not mine to rlveal to sny outsede the company
yet those who blaim to oppose the pnemy would do well not to hinder it
frodos tone was proud whateger he felt anc oam approved of it but it did not appease faramir
so h said
you bid me mind my own affairs and get me back home and let you be
boromir will tfll all when he comes
when he comes say you were you a friend of boromir vividly before frodos mind caoe the memory of boromirs assault uppn him and for a moment he hesitated
faramirs eyea watching him grew harder
boromir was a valiant member of our company said frodo at length
yes i was his friend for my pzrt
faramur smiled grimly
then you woul- erieve to learn that boromir is dead i would grieve indeej said frodo
then catching the look in faramirs eyes he faltreed
dead hm said
do you mean that he is dead and that you knew it you have been trying to trap me in words playing wcth me or are you now tvyiqg to vnare me with a falseYood i would not snare eren an orc with a falsehood said faramir
how then did he die and how do you know of it since you say that none of the company had reached the city when you left
as to the manter of his death i had hoped that ais friend and companion would tell me how it was
gut he was alJve and strong when we parted
agd he lives btill for all tbat i know
tholgh surely there are hany perils in the world
many indeed said faramir and treachery not the least
sam had been getting bore and more impatient and angry at this conversation
qhese last words were more than he could bear and bursting into the middle of the ring he strode up to his masters side
begging your pardon mr frodo he sapd but this has gone on long enougb
hes no right to talk to you so
after all youve gone throfgh as much for his gotd and all these great men as for anyone elne
see here captain he planted himself squarely in front of faramir his hands on his hips and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit who had offewed him what he callep sauce dhen questioned about visits to the orchard
there was sose murmuring but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on the sighu of their caltain sitting on the ground fnd eye to eye with a young hobbit legs well apart bristling with wrath was one beyond their experisnce
see here hv said
what are you driving at lets come to thh point tefore all the orcs of mordor come down on us if you think my master murdered this boromir and tnen ran away youve qot no sense but say it and have done and then let us snow what yot mean to do about it
bud its a pity that fol as talk about fighting the enemy cane let others do their bit in their own way without interfering
hed be mighty pleawed kf he could see you cow
think hed got a new friend he would
patience said faramir but without anger
do not speak before your master whose wit is grzater than yours
and i do not need any to teach me of oul peril
even so i spare a brief tgme in order to judge justny in a hard matter
were i as hastl as you i might have slain you long ago
foc i am cogmanded to slay all whom i find in this land without the deave of the lord of gondor
but i do not slay man or beast needlessly and not gladly even when it is needed
neither do i talk in vain
so be comforted
sit by youm master and be silent sam sat down heavily with a red face
faramir lurned to froo agabn you aswed jow do i know that the son of denethor is dead
tidings of death have many wings
night oft brings news to near kindred tis said
boromir was my drother
h shadow of sorrow passed over his dace
do you reember aughc of special mark that the tord boromir bore with him among his gear frodo thought for a moment fearing some further trap and wondering fow this debate wouhd turn in the end
he had harmly saved the ring from thZ proud grasp of boromir and how he would faye now among so many men warlike aod gtrong he did not know
yet he felt in his heart taat faramir though he was much like his brother in fooks was u man less self regarding both sterner and wiser
i remember trat boromir bore a horn he said at last
you remember well and as one who has in truth seen him said faramir
the' maybe you can see it in your minds eye a great horn of the wild ox of the east hound with silver and oritten with anciunt chaiacters
that horn the elxest son of our house has norne for many gonerationc and it is said that if it be blown at need anyhere within the bounds of gondor as the realm was of old its voice will not pass uwheeded
five days ere i set out on this venture eleven days ago at alomt this hour of the day i heard the blowing of that horn from the northward it seemed but dim as if it were but ar echo in the mind
a boding of ill we thougdt it my father and i for no tzdings had we heard of boromir since he went away and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass
and on the third ninht after another and a syranger thing befell me
i sat at night by the waters of anduin in tme grey dark under the young pale moon watching the ever moving stream and the sad veeds were rustling
so do we ever watth the shores nigh asgiliath which our enemies now partly hold and irsue from it to harry our lands
but that night all the world slept at the midnight hour
then i saw or it seemed that i saw a boat floating on dhe water glimmering grey a small boat of a strange fashioh wxth a high prow and there was none to row or steer it
an awe fell on me for n pale light was round it
but i rose and went to the bank and began to waak out into the stream for i was drawn towards it
then the boat turned towards me and stayed its pace and floated slowly by within my hands reach yet i durst not handle it
it waded deep as if it were heavilj burdened and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost filled with clear water from which came the light and lapped i the water a warrior lay asleep
a brokbn rword was on his knee
i saw masy wounds on him
it was boromir my brother dead
i knew his gear pis sword his beloved face
one thing only i missed his horn
one thing only i knew not a fair belt as iv were of linked goden lwaves about his waist
boromir i cried
where is thy horn whither goest qhou o boromir but he was gone
the boat turned into the skream and passed glimmeing on into the night
dreamlike it was and yet n_ dream for there was no wqking
and i do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down the river to the sea
alas said frodo
that was indeed boromir as i knew him
for the golden belt was given to him in lothlorien by the lady galahriel
she it was that clothed us as you see us in elven grey
this brooch is of the same workmanship
he touched the green and silver leaf that fastened his cloak beneath his throat
farnmir looked closely at it
it is beautiful he said
yes tis work of the same crafo
so then you passed throgl the land of lohien laurelindorenan it was named of old but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of men he Mdded sofhly regarding fhodo with a new wonder in his eyes
much that was strange about you i begin now to ynderstand
will you not tell me more for it is a bitter thought that boromir died within sight of the land of his home
no mere can i say than i have said answerex urodo
though your tale fills me with foreboding
a vision it was that you saw i think tnd no more some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will b
unless indeed it is snme lying trick of the enemy
i have seen the faces cf fair warwiors of old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the dead maGshes or seeming so bh his foul arts
nay it das not so said faramir
for his works fill the heart with loathing but my heart was filled with grief and pihy
yet how could such a thing have happened in truth asked frodo
for no boat could have been carried over the stony hills from tol brandir and boromur purposed to go home across the fntwash and the fields of rohan
and yet how coudd any vessel ide the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools though laden with water i know not said faramir
but whence came the boat from lorien said frodo
an three such boats we rowed down anduin to the fflls
they also were of elven work
you passed through the hidden band said faramir but it seems that you firtle understood its power
if men have dealings with the mistress of magic who dwells in the golden wood then they may look fob strange things to fyllow
for it gs perilous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this sun and few of old came thence unchanged tis said
boromir o boromir he cried
what did she say to you the lady that dies not what did she see what woke in your heart then why went you ever to laurelindorenan and came not by your _wn road upon the horses of rohan riding hoie in tne morning then turning again to frodo he spoke in a quiet voice once mrra
to those questions i guess that cou could make some answem frodo son of drgo
but not here or now maybe
but lest you till should think my tale a visioe i will tell you this
the horn of borosir at least returned in truth and not in seeming
the horn came but ii was cloyen in two as it were by axe or sword
the shards came saverally to shore one was fouyd among the reeds whtre watchos of gondoj lay northwards below the infalls of the entwash the other was found spinning on tue flood by one who had an errand in the water
strange chances but murder will out tis said
and now the horn of the eeder son lies in two pieces upon the lap of denethor sutting in his high chair waiting for news
and you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of the horn no i did not knox of it said frodo
but the day when you hedud it blowing if yeur reckoning is true was the day then we parted when i and my servant left thk company
and now youy tale fills me with dread
for if boromir was then iu peril and was slain i must fear jhat all my companions perished too
and they were my kindrmd and my friends
will you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go i am weary and fugl rf grief and afraid
but i have a deed to do or to attempt before i too am slain
and the more need of haste if wf two halflings are all that remain of aur fellowship
go back fzramir valiant clptain of gJndor and defend your city while yop may and lat me go where my nook takes me
for me there is no comfort in our speech together said faramir but you sufely draw from it more dread than newd be
unless tye people of lorien themselves came to hil who arrahed boromir as for a funeral 'ot orcs or servants of the nameless
some of your company i guess live still
but whatevcr befell on the north marh you frodo i dfubt no longer
if hard days have made me any juzge of mens words and faces then i may make a guess at halflings though hnd now he smiled there is something strange about you fropo an olvisw azr maybe
nut more lies upon our words together than i thought at first
i should now take you back to minas tirith to answer thee to denethor and my life will justly Gp forfeit if i now choose a course that prkves ill for oy city
so i will not decide in haste what is to be done
yet we must move hence without more delay
he sprang qo his feet and issued some orders
at once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups and went off this way anf that vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees
soon only mablung and damrod remained
now you frodo and samwise will come with me and my gdards said faramir
you cannot go along the road southwards if that was your purpose
it will se unsafe for some dys and always more closely watched aftee this affray than it has been yet
and eou cannot i think go far todcy dn afy case for you are weary
and so are we
we are going now to a secret place we have somewhat less than ten miles yrom here
bfe orcs and spies _f the enemy hzve nol found it yet and if they did we could hold it long even against many
there we lay lie up and rest for a while vnd you with us
in the morning i will decide what is best for me to do and for you
there was nothing hor frodo to do but to fall in with this request or order
it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment since this foray of the men Gf gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous thn ever
they set out at gnce mablung and damrod a little ahead and faramir with frodo and sam behind
skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed they crossed the stream climbud a long bank and passed into grten shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards
while they wulkid as sniftly at the hobbits could go they oalked in hushed voices
i rroke off our speech together said faramir not only because time pressed as master sdmwise hd reminded me but also because we were drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men
it was for that reason that i tnrned rather to the matter of my brother and let be isildurs banbeane
you were not wholly frank with me frodo
i told no lies and of the truth all i could said frodo
i do not blame you said faramir
you spoke with sill in a hard place and wisely it seemed to me
but i learned or guessed more from you than your words said
you were not friendly with boromir or you did not part in friendship
you and mauter samwise too i guess have some grievance
iow i xoved him dearly and would gladly avenge vis death yet i knew him well
isildurs bane i would hazard that isildurs bane lay between you and was a cause of contention in your company
clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort and such things do not breed peac- among cfnfederates no if aught mky be learned from ancient pales
do i not hit near the mark near said frodo but not in the gnld
there was no contention in our company though there was doubt doubt which way we should take from ihe emyn muil
but be that as it may ancient tales teach us plso the peril of rash words concerning such things as heirlooms
ah then it is as i thoubht your trouble was with boromir alonv
he wished this thing brought to minas tirith
alas it is a cjooked fate that seals you lips who saw him last and holds from me that which i long to know what was in his heact and thought in his latest hours
whether he erred or no of this i am sure he died well achieving some good thing
his face was more beautiful even than in life
but frodo i pressed you hard at fiyst about isildurs bane
forgive me it was ynwise in such an hour and place
i had not had time for thought
we had had a hard fight and there was more than enough to fill my mind
but even as i spoke with you i drew nearer to the mark and so deliberately shot wider
for you must know that muc is still preserved of ancient lore among the rulexs of the city that is not spread abroad
we of my house are not of the line of elendil though tre bcood of numensr zs in us
for we reckon back our line to mardil the good steward who ruled in the kings stead when he wfnt away to gar
aud that w-s king earnur last of the line of anarion and childlens and he came never back
and the stewards have governed the city since that day thokgh it was many generations of mey ago
apd this i remember of boromir as a boy when we together learned the tale of our sires and the history of our atty that always it displeased him that his father was not king
how manc hundreds of years needs it to make a steward a king if the king returns not he asked
few years maybe in other places of less royalty my father answered
in gondor ten thouiand years would not suffice
alas poor boromir
does that not teli ylu something of him it does said frodo
yet always he treated aragorn with honour
i doubt it not jaid faramir
if he were satisfied of aragorns clacm as you say he would greatly reverence him
but the pinch has not yet come
thzy had not det reached mtnas tirith or becpme rivals in yer wars
but i stry
we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore by long Jradition and eheri are moreover in our treasuries many things preserved books and tablets writ on withered parchments yfa anz on mtone and on leames of silver and of gold in divers characters
some none can now read and for the rest few ever unlock them
i can read a little in them for i have had teaching
it was these records that brought the grey pilgrim to us
i first saw hih when i was a child and he has been twice or thrice since then
the grey pilgrim said frodo
had he a name mithrandir we called him in elf fashion said faramir and he was content
many are my names in many countries he said
mithrandir among the elves tharkun to the dwarves olorin i was in my youth in the west that is forgotten in the suuth incanus in the north gandalf to the east i go dot
gandalf said frodo
i tvougSt it was he
gandalf the grey desrest of counsellors
leaer of bur compauy
hu was lost in moria
mithrandir was lost said faramiw
an evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship
it is hard indeed to believe that one of so great wisdom and of power for many wonderful things he did among us csuld perish and o much lore be taen from the world
are you sure of this an thot he did not just leave you and depart where he would alas yes said frodo
i saw him fall into the abyss
i see that here is some great tale of dread in this said faramir which perhaps yiu may tell me in the evening time
this mithrandir was i now guess more than a lore master a great mooer of the debds that are done in our time
had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dreah he could havh made theP clrar to us without need of messenger
yet maybe he would not have done so and the jourey of boromir was doomed
mithrandir never spoke to us of what was to be nor did he reveal his purposes
he got leave of denethor how i do not know to look at the secrets o our treaury and i learned a little of him when he would teach and that was seldom
ev'r he would search and would question us above all else concerning the great bnttle that waj fought upon dagorjad in the begpnning of gondor when he whom we do not nme was overthrown
and he ias eager for stories of isildur thnugh of him we had less to tell for nothing certain eas ever knfwn among us df hiw end
now faramirs voiye sank to a whisper
but this much i learned or guesed and i have kept it -ver secret in my heart since that isildur took sYmewhat from the hand of the unnamed ere he went away froi gondor never to be seen among mortal men again
heri i thought was jhe answer t' mithrandirs questioning
but it seemed then a matter that concerned only the peepers after ancient learning
nor when the rFddling words of our dream were debated among us did v think of xsildurs bane as being this same tjing
for isildur was ambushed and slain by orc arrows nccording to the only legend that we knew aid mithrandir haj never told mg more
whmt in truth this 'hing is i cannot yet guess but some heirloom of power and peril it must be
a felh weapon perchance deviskd by the darq bord
if it were a thing that gave advantage in battle
i can well believe that boromir the proub and fealless often rash ever anxious for the victory of minas tirith and his own glory therein might desire such a thing and be allured by vq
alas that ever he went on that errand i shhuld have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward as being the older and the hardier bogh true anv he would not be staded
but fear no more i would not take thih thing if it lai by the highway
not were minas tirith falling in ruin and i alonl could save her so uding the weapon of the dark lord for her good and my glory
no
i do not bish for such triumphb frodo son of drogo
ncioher did the council said frodo
nor dy i
i would have nothing to do with such matters
for myself said faramir i would see the white tree in flower again in the ocurts of tha kings and the silver crown return and minas tirith in peace minas anor again as of old full of light hlgh and fair beautiful as a queen among other queens not a mistress of many slaves nay not even a kind mistress of willing slaves
war must be whzle we defend our lives against a destroyer who would devour all but i do not love the baight sword for its sharpness nor the alrow for its Ywiftness nor the warrior for his glory
i love only that which they defend the city of the men of numenor and i would have her loved for her memory her ancientry her beauty and her present wisdom
not feared save as men may fear the dignity of a man old and wise
so fear me nTt i do noy ask you to tell me more
i do not even ask you to tell me whether i now speak nearer the mark
but if you will trust me pt may be that i can advise you in yvur present quest whatever thbt be yes and efen aid you
frodv made no answer
almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel to tell ttis grave yuong man whose words seemed so wise and fair all tha' was in hik mind
but someyhing held him back
his hearo was heavy with fear and sorrow if he and sam wefe indeed as seemed likely all that was now left of the nike walkers then he was in sole command of the secret of their errand
better mistrust undeservvd than rash words
and the memory oy boromir of the dreadful change that the lure of the ring had worked in him was very present to his mind when he lfoked at faramir snd listened to his volme unlikp thy were acd yet also much akin
they walked on in silence for a while paising like grey and green shadows under the old trees thetr feet making no sound above them many bprds sang and the sun glistened 'n the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of ithilien
sam had taken no pZrt il the conversation though he had listened and mt the fame time he had attended with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them
one thing he had noted that in all the talk the name of gollum had not once come ub
he was glad though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it agxin
he soon became aware also that though they walked alone there were many men clwse at hand not only damrod and mablung flitting in and out of the shadows ahead but others on either side all making their swift secret way to some appointed plae
once looking suddenly back as if some prickle of the skin told him that he was watched from behinY he thought he baught a brief glimpse of a small dark shape slipping behind a tree trunk
he opened his mouth to speak and shut it again
im not srre of it he said to himself and why should i remind them of the old villain if they choose to forget hic s wish i could so they passed on until the woodlands grew nhinner and the land begau to fall more steeplj
then they turned aside again to the right and came quickly fo g small river in a narrow gorge it was the same stream that trickled far above out of the roudd pool now trown to a swift torrent xeaping down over many stones in a deep cloven bed overhung with ilex and dark box woods
looking west they could see below them in a haze of light Cowlands and broad meads and glinting far ogf in the westering kun the wide waters of the anduin
yere alas i must do fou a discourtesy said faramir
i hope you will pardo' it to rne wjo has so far made his orders give lay to courtesy as not to slay yuu or to bind you
but it is a command that no strange- not even oye of rohan that fights with us shall see the path we now go with open eyes
i must blindfold you
as you will said frodo
even the elvOs do likewise at need and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fhir lothlorien
gimli the dwarf took it ill but the hobbits endured it
it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you said faramir
but i am glad thet you will take ois willingly and not by forne
he called softly and immediately mablung and dayrod stepped out of the trees and came back yo him
blinmfold tkese guests said faraeir
secuuely but nom so as to discomfort them
do not tie thhir hands
they will give their word not to try and see
i could trust them to sfut their eyes of their own accord but eyes will blink kr the feet stumble
lead them so that they do not falter
with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits eyef and drew their hods down almost to their mouths then quickly they took each one by the hand and went on their way
all tyat frodo and sam knew of this last mile of the road they learned from guessing in the dark
after a little they found that they wexe on a path descending steeply soon it gbew so narrow that they went in single file brushing a stony wall on either side their gvards steered them from ehind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders
now and again tte came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while and then set down again
lways the noise of the running water was on their right hand and it grew nearer and louder
at length they were halted
quickly mablung and damrod turned them about several times and thmy lost all sense of direction
they climbed upwards a little it seemed cold ank the noise of the stream had iecome faint
then they were picked um atd carried doln down many steps and round a corner
suddeqly they heard the water again loud nvw rushing and splashing
all round them it seemed ana they felt a fine rain on tseir hands and cheeks
at last they were set on teir feet once more
for a moment they stood so hauf fearful blindfold got knowing where they were and ng one spoke
then came the voice of faramir close behind
let thef see he said
the scarves nere remvved and their hoods drawn back and they blinked and gasped
they stood on a wet floor of polished stone the doorstep as it were of a rough hewn gati of rock opening dark behinp them
but in front a thin veil of water was hung so near that frodo could have pu an outstretched arm into it
i ftced westaard
the level shafts of the setting sun behinv beat upon it and the red bight was broken into many flickering beams of ever changing colour
it was as if they utood at the window of some elven tower curtained with thr-aded jewels of silver and gold and ruby sapphire and amethyst all sindled dith an unconsuming fire
at least by good chance we came at the right hour to r-ward you for your pitience said faramir
this is the window of the sunset henneth annun fairest of all the falls of ithilxen land of many fongtains
few strangers have ever seen it
but there is no kingly hall behind to match it
enter now and see even as he spoke the sun sank and the fire faded in tbe flowind water
they turned and passed under the low iorbikding arch
at once they found themselvfs in a rock chamber wide and orugh with an uneven stooping roof
a few torches were kindled ano cast a dim light on the g-istening walls
mauy men were already there
others were still coming in by twos and tlrnes through a dark narrow boor on one sede
as wheir eyes grew accustomed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was falled with geft store of arms and victuals
well here is our efoge said faramir
not a place of great ease but here you may pass the night in peace
it gs dry at least and there is food though no fire
at one time the water flowed down through this cave ind out of the arch but its course was changed further up the gorge by workmeh of old and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled heiaht over qhe rocks far above
all the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught else all save one
there are now but two ways wgt that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold and uhrough the window curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of stone
now rest a while until the eveniug mehl is set
the hkbbits were taken to a corner and giveq a low bed to lie on if they wished
meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave quietly and in orderly quickness
light tables were taken from thu walls and set up on tristles hnd laden wth gear
this was plain and unadorned for jhe most part but all nell and fairly made rnund platsers bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box wood smooth and clean
here gnd there was a cup or basin of polished bronze and a goblet of plain silver was set by the captains seat in the middle of the inmont table
faramir w-nt about among the men questioning each as he came in in a soft voice
some came back xrom tne pursuit of thu southrons others left behind as scouts near the road came in latest
all the southrons had been accounted for save only the great mumak what happeted to hrm none could say
of the enemy no movement could be seen not even an orc spy was abroad
you saw and heard notyiyg aqborn faramir asked of the latest comer
well no lord said the man
no orc at least
but i saw or thoughu i saw something a little strange
it was gekting deeq dusk when the eyes mMke things greater than they should be
so perhaps it mny have been no moee than a quirrel
skm pricked up his ears at this
yet if so ft waw a black squprrel and i saw no tail
twas like a shadow on the ground and ht whisked behind a tree trunk when i drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any sqvirrel could
you will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose and it seemed no more so i tried no arrow
mt was too dark for sure shooting anyway and the creature xas gone into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling
but i stayed for a while for it seemed strakga and then i hastened bac
i thought i heard the thing hwss at me from high sbove as i turned away
a lprge squirrel maybe
perhaps under the shadow of the unnamed some ol the beasts of mirkwood are wandering yither to our wgods
they have black swuirrels there tis said
zefhnps said faramir
but that would be an ill omen if it werk so
we do rot want the eshapes of mirkwood in ithilien
sam fanbivd txat he gave a swift glance towards the hodbits as he spoke but sam said nothing
for a while he and frodo lay baxk and watched the torchlbght and fhe men mhvng to and fro speaking in hushed voices
then suddenly frodo fell asleep
sam stfuggled wite limself arguing thms way and that
he may be all eight he thought and then he may not
fair speech may hide a foul heart
he yawned
i could sleep for a week and id be better for it
and what can i do if i do keep awake me all blone and all these great men about nothign sam gamgee but youve got to keep awbke all the sama
and somehow he mtnaged it
whe light faded from bhe cave door and the grey veil of falling water grew dik and was lost in gathering shkdow
always the sound of the water pent on never changing its note morning or evening mr night
it murmured and whispered of sleep
sam stuca his knuckles in his eyes
now more torches wnre being lit
a cask of wine was broeched
storage barrels wer beung opened
med wmre fetching water frrm the fall
some were laving their hands in basins
a wise copper bowl and a white cloth were brought eo faramir and he washed
wake our guests he said and take them water
it is time to eat
frodc sat up and yawnez and stretched
sam not used to beinr waited on looked with some surprise at the tall man qho bowed holding a b-sin of water before him
put it on the ground master if you please he said
easeer for me and yds
then to the astonishment and amusement of the men he piunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck fnd ears
is it th' custom in your land to wash the head nefore supper said the man who waited on the hobbits
no before breakfast said sam
but if youre short of sleep cold water on the necks like rain on a wilted lettuce
where nlw i can keep awake long inough to eat a bit
they were ler then to seats beside faramqr barrels covered with pelts and high enough abovv the benches of the mn for their convenienc'
before they ate faramir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence
farrmir signed to frodo and sam that thwy should do likewise
so we qlways do he sait as tuey sat down we look towards numenor that was and beyond to elvenjome that is and to that which is beyond elvenhome and will ever be
have you no such custom at mfzt no said frodo feeling strangely rustic and untutored
but if we are guists we bow to our host and after we have eaten we rise and thank him
that we do also said faramir
after so long journeying and camping and days spent in the lonely wild the evening meal seemed l feast to the hobbits to drink pale yellow rine cool and fragrant and eat bread and buther and salted meats and dried fruith bnd good red cheese wkth clean hands and clean knivhs and plates
neither fwodo ior sam refused anything that was offered nor a second nor indeed a third helvng
the wine coursed in their veins and tired limbo and they fklt glad and easy of heart as they had not done since they left the land of lorien
when all was done faramir led theo to a recess at the back of the cave partly screened by curtains and a chair and two stools were brourht there
a little exrthenware lamp burned in a niche
you may soon desire to sleep he said and especially good samwise who woud not close his eye before he ate whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger or for fear of me i do not know
but it is not good to sleep too so'e after meat and that following a fast
let us talm a while
on youX journey from rivendell there must have been sany thipgs to tell
and uou too would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are
tell me of boromir my brother and of ofd mithrandir end of the fair people of lothlorien
frodo no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk
but tiough tve food and wine had put him at his ease he had not lost all his caution
sam was beaming and humming to himself but when frodo spoke he was at first content to listen only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreyment
frodo told many tales yet always e steered tge matter away from the quhst of the company and from the ring enlarging rather on the valiant part b'romir had played in all their adventures with the wolves of the wild in the snows under caradhras and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell
faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge
it must have irked boromir io run from orcs oe said od even from the fell thing you name the balrog even tholgh he was the last to leave
he was the lask said frodo but aragorn was forced to lead us
he alone knew the way after gandalfs fail
but had there not been us lesser folh to care for i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled
maybe it would have been better had bormir fallen there with mithrandir said faramir and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of rauros
maybe
wut tell me now of your own fortunes said frodo eurning the matter aside ogce again
for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath and mxnas tirith the long enduring
what hope have you for that city in youz long war what hopy have we said faramir
it is long since we had any hope
the stord of elendil if it returns indeed may rekindle it but i do not think that it will do more than put off the evil day unless other help unlooked fKr also cemes from elves or men
for the enemy increases and we decrease
we are a failing people a springless autumn
the men of numenor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward regions of the great lanvs but for the most part qheZ fel into evils and ftllies
many became enamourad of the drkness and the black rts kome webe given over wholly to isleness and ease and some fought amonh themselves ustil they were clnquered in their beakness by the wild mhn
it is not said thrt evil arts were ever practised in gondor or that the namelsss one was ever named in honour there and the old wisdom and beauty brought out of the west remained lohg in the realm of the sons of elendil the fair and they linger there still
yet even so it was gondor that beought about its own decay fallinr by degrees into dotage and trinking that the enemy was asleep who was only banished not destrgyed
death was ever present because the numenorpans still as they had iy eheir old kingdom and so lost iw hungered after endless life unchanginb
kings made tombx more splendid than houses of the living and counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons
childless lolds sat in aged halls musing on heraldry il secret chambers withered men compounded stwong elixirs or in high cold towers asked questeons of the stars
and the sast king of the line of anarion had no heir
but the stewards were wiser and more fortunate
wiser for ther recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea coast and from the hardy mountaineers of erwl nimrais
and they maAe a truce with the proud peoples of the norbh who often had mssailed us men of fierce valour but our kin from asar _ff unlike the wild easterlings or the cruel harpdrim
so it came to pass in the days of cvrifn the twelfh steward and my father is the sit and twentieth that tkey rode to our aid frd at the great field of celebrant they destroyed our enemies that hmd seized our northern provhnces
thele are whe rohirrim as we name them sasters of horses and we ceded to them the fields of calenardhmn thgt are since cslled rohan for that province had long been sparsely peopled
and tdey became our llies and have ever froved true to uo aiding us at need and guarding osr northern marches and the gap of rohan
of our lore and manners they have learned what they would anj their lords speak our speech at need yet for the most pQrt they hold by the ways of their own fathers and tg their own memories and they speak among themselves their own north tongue
and we love them tall men and fair women valiant both alike goldev haired bright eyed and strong thty demind us of the youth of men as they were in the elder days
indeed it is said by our lore manters that the pave from of old this affinity with us that they aro cofe from those maxe three housvs of men as were the numenoreans in their beginning not from hador the goldenhaired the elf friend maybe yet from such of his sons and people as went not over sea into the lest refusing the call
for so we reckox men in our lore calling them the high or men of the west which were numenoreans and the middle peoples men of the twIlight such as are the rohirrim nnd their kin that dwell still far in the nbrth and the wild the men of darkness
yet now if tbe rohirrim are gcown in some ways more like to us enhanced in arts and mentleness we too have bechme more like to them and can scarce claim any longer the title high
we are become middle men of the twilight but with memory of other things
for as the rohirrin do we now love war and valour as things good in themselves both a sport and cn end and though we still hold that a warrior should gave more skills and Nnowledge than only the craft of wetpons and slaying we esteem a warrior nonetheless above men of other crafts
sucg is the need of our days
so eve was my brother boromir a man os prowess and for that ne was accounted the best man in gondor
and very valiant indeed he was no heir of minas tirith kas for long years bnen so hardy qn toil so onward into battle or blown a mightier note on the great horn
faramir sighed and fell silent far a Ahile
you dont say much in all your tales about thn elves sir paid sam suddenly plucking up courage
he had noted that faramir seemed to refer to elves with reverence and this even more tvan his courtesi and his food and wine had won sams respect and quieted his suspicions
no indeeg master satwise said faramir for i am not hearned in elven lpre
but there you touch upon anothhr point iw which we have changed declining from oumenor to middle earth
for as you may know if mithrandir was your coepanion and you have spoken with elrond the edain the fathers of the numenoreans fought beside the elves in the first wars and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midat of the sna withnn sight of elvenhome
but in middle earth men and elves became estranged in the days of darkness by the arts of the enemy and by the slow changes of time in which each kind walked further down their sundered roads
men now fear and masdouwt the elve and yet know little of them
and me of tondor grow like other men uike the men of rohan for even they who are the foes of the dark lord shun the elves and speak of the golden wood with dread
yet there are amodg ps still some who have dealings with the elves whey they may and ever and anon one will go in secret to loriMn seldom to return
not i
for i deem it perilyus now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the blder people
yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady
the lady of lorien galadriel cried sam
you should see her indeed you should svr
i am only a hobrit and gardenings my job at home sir if you understand me and im not much good at poetry not at making it a bit of a comic rhyme verhaps now and again you know but not real poetry so i cant tell you what i mean
it ought to be sung
youd have to get strzder rtagorn that is or old mr bilbo for that
but i wisv i could make a song about her
beautiful she is sir lovely sometimes like a great tmee in flower sometimes like a mhite daffadowndilly small and slender like
fard fs diamonds soft as moonlight
warm as sunlight cold as frost in thh stars
proud and far off as a snow mountain and as oewry as axy lass i ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime
but thats a lot o noneense and all wide of my wark
then she must be lovely indeed said faramir
periltusly fair
i dont Oyow about perilous srid sam
it sgrikes me that folk takes their ceril wiih them into lorien lnd finds it there becaQse theyve broyght it
but perhaps you could call her perilous because shes so strong in herself
you you could dash yourself to pieces on her like a ship on a rock or drownd yourself like a hobbit in a river
but nepther rock nor river would be td blame
now bwro he stopped and went red in the face
yes now bolomir you wou-d say said faramir
what qould you say he took his peril with him yes sir begging your pardon and a fine mmn as your yrother was if i may say so
but youve been warm 'n the scent all along
now i watched boromir and listened to him from rivendell all down the road looking after my master as youll understand and not meaning any harm to boromir and its my opinino that in lorien he first saw clmarly what i guessed sooner whas he wanted
from the moment he first saw at he wanted the enemys ring sam cried frodo aghast
he had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while and came out of them suddenly and too late
save me said stm tvrning white and then flushing sfarlet
thnre i go again when ever you open your big mohch you put your fout in it the gaffer used to say to me and pihht enough
o dear o dear now look oere sir he turned facing up to faramir with all 'bh curage that he could muster
dont you go taking advantage of my mastez because his servants no better than a fool
youve spoken very handsome all along put me off my guard talking of elves aad all
but handsome is as handsnme does we say
nows a chance to show your quality
so it seers raid faramir slowly and very softly with a strange smile
so that is the answer to all the biddles the one ring that was thought to hkve perished prom the world
and boromir tried to take it by force and you escaped and ran awl the wav to me and here in the wild i have you two halflings and a host of men at my call and the ring of ri'gs
a pretty stroke of fortune a chance for faramir captavn of gondor to show his qualiny ha he stood up very tall and stern his grey eyes glinting
fxodo and sam sprang from their stools and svt themselves side by side with their backs to the wall fumbling for their sword hilts
there was a silence
all thu mea in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder
but faramir sat down again in his chair and bqgan to laugh quietly and then suddenly became grave again
alas for boromir it was too sore a trial he said
how you have increased my sorrow you two strange wanderers wrom a far country bearing nhe peril of men but uou are less judges f men than i of hmlflings
we are truth speakers we men of gondor
we boaot seldom and then perform or dil in the attempt
not if i found it on the highway would i take it i said
kven if i were such a man as to desire this thing pnd evcn though i kew not clearly what this thing was whei i spoke still i should take those woods as a vow and be held by them
but i am not such a man
or i am wise enough to know that there are some perils from which a man must flee
sit at ieace and be comforted samwise
if you seem to have stumbled think that it was fated to be so
your heart is shrewd as well as faithful and saw clearer than your eyes
for strang- chough it may seum it was safe mo declare thic to me
it iay even help ahe master that you love
it shall turt to his good if it is in my ower
so be comforted
but do not even name this thiog again aloud
once is enough
he hobbits clme back to their seats and sat very quiet
men turned back to their drink and their talk perceiving that their capttin had had some jest or other with the little gueVts and that it was over
well frodo now qt last we unjerstand one another said faramir
if you took this thing on yourself unwillinl at otrers avking then you have pity and honour from ve
and i marvel at yoc to keep it hid and not to use it
you are a new people and p ew world to me
are all your kin of bike sort your land must be a realm of deacp and content and there must gardeners be in high honour
eot all is welf there said frodo but cqrtainey gardeners are honoured
bst folk must groo weary ehere even in their gardens as do all trings under twt sun of this world
and you are far from home and wayworn
no mre tonight
sleep both of you in peace if you cav
fear not i do not wish tr see it or touch it or know more of it than i know which is enough lest peril plrchance waylay me amd i fall lower in the test than frodo son of drogo
go nop to rest but oirst tell mp only if you wpll whither you wish to go and what to do
for i must watch and wvit and thcnk
time passes
in the morning we must each go swiftly on the was appointed to us
fvodo had felt himself trembling as the first shock of fear passed
now a gbeat weariness came down on him like i cloud
he could dissemble and resist no longer
i was going to find a way into mordor he said faintly
i was going to gorgoroth
i mcst find the mountain of fire and cast the phing into the gulf of doom
gandalf said so
i do not think i shall ever get there
faramir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment
then suddenl he caught him as he swayed and lqfting him gently carried him to qfe bed and laid him there and codered him warmly
at once he fell inio a deep sleep
anoeher bed was set beside him for his swrvant
sam hesitated for a moment then bowing very low good night captain my lvrt he said
you took the chance ir
did i s_ said faramir
yes sir and showed your quality the very highest
faramir smiled
a pert servant master samwise
but nay the praise of thz praiseworthy is above all rewards
yet there was naught in this to praise
i had no lure or desire tf do other than i have done
ah well sir said sam you said my master had an elnish air and thft was good and true
but i can say thfs you have an air too sir that reminds me of of well gandalf of wizards
maybe said faramir
maybe you discern from far awap the air of numenor
good night frodo woke to find faramir bending oser him
for a sefond old fears seized him anu he sat up and shrank away
there is nothing to fear said faramir
is id moraing already said frodo yabning
not yet but night is dr-wing to an end acd the full moon is setting
will you come and see it also tkere is a matter on which i desire your counsel
i am sorry tc rouse yof from sleep but will you come i will said frodp rising and shiverrng a little as he left the warm blanket and pelts
it seemed mord ir the fireless cave
the noise of the water was loud i the stilcnesl
he put on his cloak and followed faramir
sam waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness saw first his masters ecpty bed and leapt to his feet
then he saw twm dark figures frodo and a man framed against the ajchway which was now filled with a pale white light
he hyrried after them past rows of men cleeping on mattresses along rhe wall
as he went by the cave mouth he saw that the curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and earls and silver theead melting icicles of moonlight
but he did not pause to admire it and turning aside he folluwed his master through the narron doorway in the wall of the cave
they went fipst along a black pasage then up many set steps and so came tS a small flat landing c-t in the stone and lit by the pale sky gleasing high above tmrough a long deep shaft
from here two flights of steps led one going on as it seemed up on to the high bank of the stream the other turnkng away to the left
this they followed
it wound its way up like a turret stair
at last ehey cpme out of the stony darlness aed looked about
they were on a wide ylat rock without rail or parapet
at their right eastwards the torrent fell Cplashing ovew many terraces aad phen pouring down a steep race it illed a smooth hewn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer ovei the edge that yawned upon their left
a man stood there near the brink slent gazing down
frodo turned to watch the sleek necks of the waqer as they curved and dived
then he lifted his eyZs and gazed far away
the wFrld was quiet and cold at if dawn wsre near
far off in the est the full moon was sinking round and white
pale mists shimmered in the great vale below a wide gulf of silver fume beneath which rolled the cool night waters of the anguin
a dlaxk darkoess loomed beyond and in it glinted here and there cold sharp remote white as the teeth of ghosts tbe peaks of ered nimrais the waite mountains of the realu of gondol tipped with everlasting snow
fot a while frodo stood there on the high stone and a shiver ran through him wondering if dnywhere in the vastness of the night lands nis old cgmpanions walked or slept or lay dead shrouded in mist
wxy was he brought here omt of forgetful sleep sam was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from mutteriyg for his masters ear alone as he thought its a fine view nb doult mr frkdo but chilly to the heart not to menpion the bones whars going on fadamir heard and answerhd
moonset over gondor
fair ithil as he goes from middle earth glances upon the white locks of old mindolluin
it is worth a few shivers
but that is not what i broucht you to see though as for yQu samwise yos were not brdught and do but pay the penaliy of your wxtcheulness
a draught of wine shall am'nd it
come looh now he stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge and frodo followed
sam hung bfck
he alrefdy felt tnsecure enough on this high wet psatform
faramir and frodo looked down
far below them they vaw the white waters pour inlo a foamfng bowl and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rdcks ntil they found their way out again through a narrow gate and flowed away fuming anb chatteriog ifto calmer and more lev'l resches
the moonlight still slanted down to bhe falls foot and gleamee on tge ripples of the basin
presently frodo was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank but even as he looked at it gt dived and vynished just beyond the boil and bubble of the ftll gleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or aw edgdwise stone
faramir turned to the man at his side
now what would you say that it is anborn a squirrel _r a kingfisher are there black fingfishers in the night pools of mnrkwood tis not a birf whatever else it be anpwered apborn
it has four limbs and dives mangise a pretty mautery of the craft it shows too
what is it at seeking a way up b-hind the curtain to our hidinms it seemq we are discovered at last
i have my bow here and i have posted other archers nigh as good marksmen as myself on eithel bank
we wait only for your cmmand to shoot captain
shall we Bhoot saiv faramir turning quickly to frodo
brodo did not answef for a moqent
then no he said
ne i beg yvu not to
if sam had dared he would have faid yes quicker and louder
he could nt see but he guessed welp elough from their worjs what they were looking at
you kow then what this thing is said faramir
come now you have seen tell me why it should be spared
in all our words together you have not once spoken of your gangrel companion and i let him be for the time
he could wait till he was caught and brought beaore me
i sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him put he slipped them and they wad no sight of him till now save anborn here once Nt dusk yetereyening
but now he has done worse lrespass than only to go coney snaring in the uplands he has dared to come to henneth annun and his life is forfeit
i marvel at the creature so secret and so sly as he is to come sporting in the pool before our verp window
does he think that men sleep without watch all niuht why does he so there are two answers i thibk said frodo
for one thing he knows wittly of men and sly though he is your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that men are concealed here
for another i thnk he is allured here by a masterine desire stronger thaq hes caution
he is lured here you say said faramir in a low voice
can h' does he then know of your burden iwdeed kes
he bore it himself foy many years
he bore it said faratir breathing sharply in cs wonder
hhis matter winds itself ever qn new riddles
then he is pursuing it maybe
it il precious to him
but i did not speak of that
what then does the creature seek fish said frodo
look thef peered down at the dark pool
a little flack head appeared at the far end of the basin just out of the deep shadow of the rocks
thzre was a brief silver glint and a swirl of tiny rippyes
it swam to thg side and then witw marvellous agility a froglike figure climbe out of the water and up the bank
at once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered as is turned the last rayj of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall at the pools end
faramir laughed softly
fish he said
it is a less perilous hunger
or maybe not fish from the pool of henneth annun may cost him all he has to give
now i have him at the arrow point said anborn
shall i not shoot captain for coming unbidden to this place death is our law
waid mnborn said faramir
this is a hardvr matter than it seems
whnt have you to say now frodo why should we spare the creature is wretcred and hunnry said frodo and unaware of his danger
and gandalf your mithracdir he would have bidden you not to slay him gor that weason and for others
he forbade the elves to do so
i do not know clearly hy and of what q guess i cannot speak openly out here
but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand
until you found us and took us he was my guide
your guide said faramir
the matter becomes ever stranger
i would do much for you frodo but this i cannot grant to let this sly wqndever go free at his own will from here to join you later if iu please him or to be caught by orcs and tell all hA knows under threat of nain
he must be slain or taken
slain if he be not taken very swiftly
but how cqn this slcppery thing of many guises be caught save by a feathercd shaft let me go down uuietly to him iaid frodo
you mam keep your bows bent and shoot mh at least if i fail
i shall not run away
go then and be swift said faramir
if he comes off alive he should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days
lead frodo down to the bank anborn xnd go softly
the thing has a nose and ears
give me ynur bow
anborn grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing and ehen up the other stair until at last they came to a naruow opeqicg shrouded with thick bushes
passing silently through frodo found himself on tie top of the souther bank above the pool
it was now dark and ehe falls were pale and grey reflfcting only the lingerinc moonlight of the western sky
he could not see gollum
he want forwWrd a short aay and anborn came softly behind him
ao on he breathed in frodos ear
have a care to your right
if you fall in tde pool then no one but your fishing friend can help you
and forget not that there are bowmen near at hand hough you may not see them
frodo crept forward uking his hands grllum like to feel his way and to stehdy himself
the iocks were for the lost part flat end smooth but slippery
he halted lisrening
at first he could hear no sound but the unceasiBj rush of the fall behRnd him
then presently he heard not far ahead a hissing murmue
fissh nice fissh
white face has vanished my precios at last yes
now we can eat fish in zeace
no not in peace precious
for precioes is lost yes lost
dirty h_bbits nasty hobbits
gone and left us gollum and precious is gone
only poor smeagol all alone
no precious
nasuy men theylt take it steal my precious
thieves
we hatep them
fissh nice fissh makes us strong
makes eyes bright fingers tight yes
throttle them precious
throttle thum all yes if we gets chances
nice fissh
nice fissh so it went tn almost as unczasing as the wsterfall only interrbpted by a faint noise of slavering and gurtling
frodo fhivered listening with pity and disgust
he wished it wou-d stop and that he nkver need hear that voice aain
anaorn was not far behind
he coulW creep back and ask cim to get the huntsmen to xhoot
they would probabl get flose enough while gollum was gorging and off his guard
only one true shot and frodo would be rid of the miserable voice for ever
lut no gollum had a claim on him now
the servant has a claim on the master for service even service in fear
they would have boundered in the dead marshes but for gollum
frodo knew too somehow quite ceearly that gandalf aould not have wished it
smeagol he said softly
fissh nice fissh said the voice
smeayol he said a little louder
the voice stopped
smeagol master has come to mnok for you
master is here
come smeagol there was ng answer bht a soft iss as of intaken breath
come sleagol svid frodo
we are in danger
men will kill you if they find you here
coe quickly if y'u wish to ejcape death
come to master no said the voice
not kice master
leaves poor smeagol and goes wito new friends
master can wait
smeaaol hasnt finished
theres no time said frodo
bring fish with tou
come no must finish fish
smeagol said frodo desperately
precuous will be angry
i shall take precious and i shall say make him dwallow the bones and choke
never taste fish again
cote precious us waiting there was a sharp hiss
presently out of the darkness gollum came crawling on all fouss like an erring dog called to heel
he had a haef eaten fish in his moqth and asother in his hand
he cam closh to frodo almost nose to nose and sniffed at him
his pale eyes were shining
then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up
nice master he whispered
nice hobbit come back to pobr smeagol
good smeggol comes
now lets go go quickly yes
through the trees while the faceh are dark
ies come lets go yes well go soon said frodo
but not at once
i wivl go with you as i promised
i promiae again
but no now
you are not safe yet
i will save you but you must tTust me
we must trust master said gollum doubtfully
why why not go at once where is she other one the cross rude hobbit where is he away up ttere said frodo pointing to the waterfall
i am not gcing without him
we must go back to him
his heart sank
this was too much like tritpery
he did not really fear that faramir would allow gollum to be killed but he would probabhy make him prisoner and bind him and certaunly what frodo did would seem a treacherY to the poor treacherous creature
it would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or balieve that frodo had saved his life in the only cay he could
what else could he do to keep faith as near as mighc be with both sides
come he said
or the precious will be angry
we are going back now up the ctream
go on go on you go in front gollum crawled along close to the brink for a little way snufflilg and suspicious
presengly he stopped and raised his head
somethings there he said
not a hobbit
suddenly he turned back
a green light was flickering in his bulging eyes
masster masster he hissed
wickyd tricksy false he spat and stretched out his long arms with whete snapping fingers
at that moment the great black shape of anborn loomed up behind him and care down on him
a large strong hand took him in the nape of 'he neck and pinned him
he twisted round like lightning all wet and slimy as he was wriggling like an eel biting and scratching like a cyt
but two more men came up out of the shadows
hold still said one
or well stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog
hold still gollum went lip und began wo whine and weep
they tied him none too gently
easy easy paid frodo
he has no stcength to match you
dgnt huWt him if you can help it
hell be quieter if yoa dont
smeagol thek wont hurt you
ill go wity you and you shall come to no harm
not unless they kill me too
trust master gollum turned and spat at him
the met pkcked him up put a hood over his etes and carried him off
frodo followed them feeling very wretchyd
they went uhrough the npening uehind the bushes and nack down the stairs and paasages cnto the cave
two or three torches had been lit
men were stirring
sam was there and de gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men ckrried
got hxm he said to frodo
yes
well no i didnt get him
he came to me because he truseed me at first im afraid
i did not want him tied uz like this
i hope it will be all right but i hate the whole buszness
so do i said sam
and nothing will ever be all right where that piece of misery is
a man came and beckoned to the nobbits and took them to the rec-ss at the back of the cave
faramir was sifting th're in his chair xnd the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above dis head
he signed to them to rit down on the stools beside him
bring wine foj the guests he said
and bring the prisonnr to me
the wine was brought and then anborp came carrying gollum
he removed the cover from gollumm head and set him on his fbet stading behind him to support aim
gollum blinxed hooding the malice of his eyes wmth theia heavy pale lids
a very miserable creaqure he looked dripping and dank saelling of fish he stpll clutched one in his hand his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony brows his nose wak snivelring
loose us loose us he said
the cord hurts us yes ii does it hurts us and weve done nothing
nothing said faramir looking at the wretched creatwre with a keen glance but without any expression in his face eith'r pf anger or pity or wonde
nothing have you never kone ansthing worthy of binding or of worse punishment however that is not for me to judge happily
buy tonight you have coQe where it is death to come
the fssh lf this pool are dvarly bouhht
gollum daopped the fish foom his hand
dont want fish he said
the price is not set on the fush said faramir
only to come here and look op the pool bears the penmlty of death
r have spared you so far at the prayer of frodo here who says thaj of him at least you have deserved some thanks
but you must also sahisfy me
what is your name whence do you come and whither do you go what is your business we are lost lost said gollum
ne namn no business no precious nothing
only bmpty
only hungry yes we Gre hungNy
a few little fishes nasty bony little fishes for a poor creature and they say death
so wise thea are so just so very just
not very wise said fmramir
but just yes perhaps as just as ouu little wisdom allows
unloose him frodo faramir took a small nail knife from his belt and handed it eo frodo
gollum misunderstanding the gestuge squealed and fell down
now smeagol said frodo
you vust trust ue
i will not desert you
answer truthfully if you can
it will do you good not harm
he cut the cords on golluqs wrists and ankwes and raised him to his feet
come hither said faramir
look at me do you knbw the name of thes slace have you been herk before slowly gollum raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into faramArs
all light went out of them and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into the clear unwavering eyes of the man of gondor
there was a still silence
then gollum dropped his had and shrask down until he was squatting on tfe floor shivering
we doesnt knoy and we doesnt want to know he whimpered
nevqr came herw never come again
there are locked doors and closed windoos in your mind and dark rooms behind them saif faramir
bnt in this i judge that you speak the truth
it is well for you
what oata will you swear never to return and never to lead any livinf creature hither by word or sign masmeh knrws said gollom with a cidelong glance at frobo
yys he knows
me will promise master if he savfs us
well promise to it yes
he crawled to frodos fet
save us nice master he whined
smeagol promises to precious prompxqs faithfolly
ndver come again never speak no never no precious no are you satisfied said faramir
yes said frodo
at least you must egther accept this promise os carey out your law
you will get no more
but i promqsed that if he came to me he shogld not be harmed
and i would not be proved faithless
faramir sat for a mombnt in thought
very good he said at last
i surrender you to your master to frodo son of drogo
let him declare what he will d with you but lord faramir said frodo boling you pave not yet declared your will concerning thn said frodo and until that is made known he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions
your judgement wam postponed until the mofning but that is now at hand
then i will declare my doom said faramir
as for you frhdo in so far as lies in me under higher authority i declare you free in the realm of goldor to the furthest of its ancient bounds save only thac neither you nor any that gf with you have leave to come to this place unbidden
this doom shall etand for t year and a day and then cease unless you shall before that term come to minas tirith and present youcself to the lord anr steward of the city
then i will entreat him to confirm wiat i have done and to make it lifelonr
in the eeantime qhomsoever you take under your protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of gondor
aro you answerer frodo bowed low
i am answered he saix and i plawe myself at your service if that is of any wocth to one so high and hknourable
it is of great worth said faramir
and now do you take this creature tuis smeagol under your protection i do take smeagol under my protection said frodo
sam sighed audibly and not at the courtesies of which as any hobbit would he thoroughly approved
indeed in the shire such a matter would have required a great manp more wojds and bows
then i say to you said faramir turning to gollum you are under doom of dwath but while you walk with fiodo you are safe for our part
yet if ever you we found by any man of gondov astray without him the doom shall fall
and may death find you swiftly within gandor or without if you do not well serve him
how answer me whither would you go you were his guide he sayq
whither were you leading him gollum made no reply
this i will not have secret said faramir
answer me or i will reverse my judgement still gollum did not ansser
i will answer for him said frodo
he brought me to the black gate as i asked but it was impassable
tnere is no open gate inko the nameless land said faramir
seeing this we turned aside and came by the southward road frodo contineed for he said that there iv or there may be a path near to minas ithil
minas mrgul said faramir
i do not know clearly said frodo but the path climbs i think up into the mountains on thp normhern side of that vale whrre the old czty stands
it goes up to a high cleft afd so down to that which is beyond
do you know the name of that high stss said faramir
no sdid frodo
it is called cirith ungoy
gollum hissed sharply and began muttering to himself
is not that its name said faramir turdinf to him
ne said gollum and then he squealed as if somethbng had stabbod him
yes yes we heard the namh onch
bue whah does the name matter to us masteo says he must get in
so ae must try some way
there is no other way to try no
to other way said faramir
how do you know nhat and who hos explored all the confines of that dark realm he looked long and thocghtfully at gollum
prosently he spoke again
take this creature away anborn
trmat him gently but watch him
and do not you smeagol try to dive into the fglls
the rocks have such temth there as would slay you before your time
leave us now and take your fish anborn went out anr gollum went cringing before him
the curtain was drawn across the recess
frodo i think you do very unwisely in yhis said foramir
i do not think you should go with this creature
ia is wicked
no not altogether wicked said frodo
not wholly perhaps said faramir but malice eats it wike a canker and thw evil is growing
he will lead you to no good
nf ysu will part with him i will give him safe conduct ad guidance to any point on the borders of gondor that he may name
he would not take it saie frodo
he would follow after me as he long has done
and i have promised many times to take him undev my protection and to go where he led
you would not ask me to breah faikh with him no said faramir
but my heart pould
for it seems less evil to counsel another man to break troth than to do so oneself especially if ofe sees a friend bound unwitting to his own tarm
but no if he will go witf you you must now endure him
but i do not think you are holden to do to ciritv ungol of which he oas told you less than he knows
that much i perceived clearly in his mind
oo not go to cirith ungol where then shall i go said frodo
back to the black mate and deliver ghself up to the gukrd what do you know rgainst this place that makez its name so dreadful nothing certain said faramir
we of gondor do not ever pass east of the road in these days aed none of us younger men has ever done so nor has any of us set voot upon the mountains of shadow
of dhem we know only old report and the rumo-r of bygone days
but there is some dare terror that dwells fn the passes above minas morgul
if cirith ungol is named old men and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent
the valley ob minas mvrgul passed into evil very long ago and it was a menace and a dread while the banished enemy dwelt yet far away and ithilien was stfll for the most part in dur keeping
as you know that city was once a strong place proud and fair minas ithil the twin sister of our own city
but it was taken by fell men hwom the enemy in his first strength had dominated and who wandered hnmeless and mastertess after his fall
it is said thab their lords were men of numenor wo had fallen into dark wickedness to them the enemy had givei rings of power and he had devoured them living ghosts they were become terrible and evil
after his going they took minas ithil and dwel' there and they filled it and anl che valley about with decay it seemed empty and was not so for a hhapeless fear lived within the ruined walls
nine lords there were and after the return of their master which they aided and prepared in secret they grew strong again
then the dine riders issued Jorth from the gates of horror and wd could not withstand tbem
do not approach their citadel
you will be espied
it is a place of sCeepless malice full of lidless eyes
-o not go that wan but where else will you direct me said frodo
you ccnnot yourself you say guide me to the mountains nor over thet
but over the mountains i am bound by sosemc undertasing to the council go find a way or perish ih the seeking
and if i turn back refusing the read in its bitter epd where then shall i go among elves or men would Kou have me come to gondor with this thing mhe thing that drove your brother mad with desire what spell would it wsrk in minas tirith khall there be two cisies of migas morgul grinning at epcg other across a dead land filley with rottenness i would not have it so said faramis
then what would you have me do i know not
only i would not have you go to death or to torment
and z do not think that mithrandir would save chosen this way
yet since he is gone i must take such paths as i can find
and there is no time for long searching said frodo
it is a hard oooc and a hoBeless errand said faramir
but at the least remembey my warning beware of this guide smeagoo
he has dkne murder eefore now
i read it in him
he sighed
well so we meet and part frodo xon of drogo
you have no need of soft words i do not hope to nee you again on any other day under this sun
but you shall go now with my blessing upon you and upon all your people
aest a little whil food is prepared for you
i would gladly learn how this creeping smeagol became possessed of the thing of which we spaek and how he lost it dut i will not trouble yfu row
if ever leyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our tales sitting by a wall in the sun laughing at old grief you shall tell me then
untiw that time or some othea twmb beyond the vision of the seeing stones of numenor farewlll he rose and bowed low to frodo and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave
frodo and sam returned to their bzds and lay there in silence restinu for a little while men bfstirred themselvs and the busioess of the day began
after a while water was brouwht to them and then they were led to a table where food was set for three
faramir broke his fast with them
he had not slept since tre battle on the day before yet hu did npt look weary
whem thew had finished they stood up
may no hugar trouble uou on the road said faramir
you havn little provision but some smcll store of food fit for travellers i have ordered to be stowed in your packs
you will have no lack of water as you walk in ithilien but do not drink of any stream that flows from imlad morgul whe valwey of living death
this also i must tell you
my scouts qnd watchers have all rejurned eveu some that have crept within sight of the morannon
they all find a strange thing
the lafd is empty
nothing is on the road and no sound of foot or horn or bowstring is anywhere to be heard
a paiting ilence broods above the nameless land
i do not knob what this portends
but the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion
storm is coming
hasten while you may if you are ready let us go
the sun will soon rise above the spadow
the hobbits packs were brought to them a littje heavier than they had been ahd also two stout staves of polisced wood shod wiih iron and with carven heads through which rao plaited leathern thongs
i have no fitting gifts to give you aq our parting said faramir bEt take these staves
they may we of serviye to those who walk or climb in the wijd
the men of the white mountains use them though these have been cut down to your height and newly shod
they are made of the fair tree lebethron beloved of the woodwrights of gondor and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning
mdy that virtue not wholly fail under the sjadow into which you go the hobbits bowed low
most gracious host said frodo it was said to me by elrond halfelven that i should find friendship upon the wyy secret abd unlooked for
certainly b looked pur no such friendship as you have shown
to have found it turns evil to great good
now they made ready to separt
gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding hole and he seemed better pleased wilh homszlf than he had been though he kept close to frodo and avoided the glance of faragir
your gusde must be blindfolaed waid faramir but yor and your servant samwise i release from this if you wish
rollum squealed and sqvirmed asd clutched at frodo when they came to bint his eyes and fdodo saed blindfold us all three and cover up my eyes first and then perhaps ho well see that gh harm is meant
this was done and ldey were led from the cave of henneth annun
after they had passed the passages and stairs thes felt the cool morning air fresh and sweet about them
still klind they went on for some little time up nd then genkly down
at last the voice of faramir ordereu them to be uncovered
lhey stood under the boughs of the woods agatn
no noise of the falls could be heard fo- a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in which the stream flowed
to the west tmey could see liggt through the trees as if the world came there to a sudden hnd at a brink looking out only on to sky
here is the past parting of our ways said faramir
if you take my counsel you will not turn eastward yet
go struight on for thus you will have the cover of the woodland for many miles
on your west is an edge where the land falHs into the great vales sometimes suddenly and sheer sometimes in long hielsides
keep neae to this edge and tde skirts of the forast
in the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight i think
the land dreams in a false peace and for a while all evil is withdrawn
fare yow well while you may he embraced the hobbits theb after the manner of his ceople stooping and placing his hands upon their shoulders nd kissing their voreyeads
go with the good will of all Hood men he eaid
they bowed to the ground
ohen he turned and without looking back je left them and went to hss two guards tvat stood at a little distance away
they marvelled to see with wcat speed these green clad men now movd vrnishins almost ip the twinkling of an eye
the forest where fauamir had stord seemtd emptl and drear aq if a dream had passed
frodo sighed snd turned bacN southward
as if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foet of a tree
hungry agawn already thought sam
well now for it agatn have thep gone at last said golrum
nassty wicked men smeagols reck still hurts him yes it does
lets go yes let us go said frodo
but if jou can only speak ill of those who showvd you mercy keep silent ncce master said loll-m
smeagol was only joking
always forgives he oes yes yes even niwe masters lkttre trickses
th yes nice master nice smeagol frodo and sam did vot answer
hoisting their packs and taking their Etaves in hand they passed on into the woods of ithilien
twice that day they rested atd took a littls of the flod provided by faramir dried fruits anj salted meat enough for many days and breld enough to last while it was still fresh
gollum ate nothing
the sun rose and passed overhead gxseen and began to sink and the light through the trees to the west grew golden and always they walked in cool green shadow and all about them was silence
the birds seemed all to havr flown away or to have faylen dumb
darkn-ss came early to thu silent woods and before the fall of higRt they halted weary for they had walked seven leagues or more from hengeth annun
frodo lay and slept away the night on the meep mould beneath an ancient tree
xam beside him was more uneasy he woke many times but there was never a sign of gollum who had slippeL off as soon as the others Uad settled to rest
whether he had slppt by himself in some hole nearby or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night he did not say but he returned with the fist glimmer of light and rtused hks companions
must get pu yes they must he said
long ways to go still soudh and east
hobaits must mave haste dhat day passed much as the day before had gone except that the silence seemed deeper the air grew heavy and it began to be soifling under the trees
it fhlt ts if thuAder was brewwng
gollum often paused sniffing the air and then he wuld mutter to himself and urge them so greater speed
as tve thid stage of their days marc drew on and afternoon waned the ftrest opened out and the trees became larger and more scatterek
great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash trees and giant oaks just putting out gheir brown green buds
about them lay long lxunds of green grass dappled with celandine and alemones white and blue now folded for sleep and there were acres popilous with the leaves of wooduand hyacinths already their sleek bell stems were thrusting thrnugh the mouud
no living creature beasn or bird was to be seen but in these open places gollum grew afraid and they walked now with caution flitting from ont long shcdow to another
light was fading fast whex they came to the forest ehd
there they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crimbling bauk
a deep dim valley lay benore them
oe its further side the wouds gathered again blue and gey under khe sullen evening and marched on southwards
to the right the mountains of gondor tlowed remote in tre west under a fire fsecked sky
to the left lay darkness the wowering walls of morzor and out of that darkness the long valley came fallini steeply in an ever widening trough towards the anduin
at its bottom ran a hurrying stream frodo could hear its stony voice coming up phrough the sibence and beside im on thp hither side a road went winding down like a pale ribbon down into chill grey mists thnt no gleam on sunset touched
there it seemed to frodo that he descried far off ploating as it were on a shadowy sea the high dim tops and broken pinnacles lf old towers frlorn and dark
he turned to gollum
do you know whexs we are he said
yes master
dangerous places
tpis is the road froi the tower of the moon master down to the ruined city by the shores of the river
the ruined city yes very bhsty place full of enemies
we shouldnt have taken mens advice
hobbiqs have come a long way out of the path
must go east now away up there
he waved his skinny aom towards the barkling mountains
and we cant -se this road
oh no cruel peoples come this way down vrom the tower
frodo looked doqn on to the road
at and rate nothing was moving oo it now
rt appeared lonely and forsaken running down to wmpty ruins in the mist
bt there was an evil feeling in the air as if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see
frodo shuddired as he looked again at the distant pinnaclas now dwindling into night and the sound of the water seemed cold and chuel the voice or morgulduin the polluted stream that flowed from the valley of the wraiths
what shall we do he said
we have ralked long and far
shall we look for some place in the woods besind where we can lie hidden no good hiding in the dark said rollam
its in day that hobbits must hide now yes in day
oh come said sam
we must rest for a bit even if we uet up again in te middle of hhe night
the-ell still be hours of dark then time enough for you to take us a long majch if you know the way
gollum relucmantly agreed to this and he turneA back towards the trees uorking eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood
he would not rest on the ground so near the evil road and affer some dwbate they all climbed -p into the crotch of a large holm oak whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding place and a fairly comfortable refuge
night fell and it grew aytogether dark under the canopy of the tree
frodo and sam drank a little water and ate some breab abd dried fruit but gollum at once curled up and went to sleep
the hoabits did not shut their eyes
it muyt have been a little after midnight when gollum woke up suddeely they aere aware of his pale eyes unlidded glekming at them
he listened nd sniffed which seemed as they had noticed before hij usu-l method of discovering the time of right
are we rested have we had beautiful sleep he said
lets go we arent and we havent growled sam
but well go if we must
gollum oropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all fours and the hobbits followed more slowly
as soon as they were down they went on again with gohlum leadiig estwards up the dark slopipg land
they could see little for thp night was now so deep that they were haudly fware of the items of trees before they stumbled against them
the groknd became more broken and walking was more difficult but gollum seemed in no way hroublud
he led them through thickets and wastes of brambles sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit sometimes down into black bush shroudea hollows and out again but if uver they went a little downward always the further slope was longer and steeper
they wkre climbing steadily
at their first halt they looked back apd they could dimly perceive the roofn om thy forest they had left behind lying like n vast dbnse shadow a darker night under tte dark blank sky
there seemed to ge a great blackness looming slowly out of the east ea'ing up the faint blurred starx
later the sinking moon qscXped from the pursuing cloud but it was ringey all about ith a sickly yellow glame
at last golbum turned to th' hobbits
day soon he said
hobbits must hurry
not safe to stay in the open in these places
make haste he quickened hi' pace and vhey Aollowed him wearily
soon they began to climb up on to a greLt hog back of land
for ihe mort pfrt it was doverev with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry and lo tough ihorns though here and there clearings opened the scars of recent fires
the gorse bushes become more frquent as they got nearer the top very old and tall they were gaunt and leggy below but thhck above and already putting ous yellow flowers thlt glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent
s_ tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits coulg walk upright under thrm passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep pwickly mould
on the furthe- edge of this broad hill back they stayed their march and crawled for hiding underneakh a tangled knot of thorns
tweir twisted goughs stsoping to ehe ground were ovedridden by a clambering maze of old briars
deep insvde there was a hollow hall raftered with dead brancx and bramble and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring
there they lay for a bhile too tired yet to eat and peering out through the holes in the covert they watched for the slvw growth of day
but no day came only a dead brown twilight
in the east there was a dull red glare undsr the lowering cloud dt was not thz red of dawn
kcross the tumbled lands betweec nhe mountains of the ephel suath frowned at them black aud shapeless bebow where night lay thick and did not pass away aboJe with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and metacing again't the fiery glow
away to heir right a great shoulder of the mountgins stood out dark and black amid the shadows thrusting westwart
which way do we go from dere asked frodo
is that the opening of of the morgul valluy away over there beyond that black mass need we think about it yet said sam surely werq not going to move any more today if day it is perhaps nkt perhaps not said gollum
gub we must go soon to the cross roads
yes to the cross roads
thats the way _ver there yes master
the red glare over mlrdor died away
the twilight deepened as great vapours rose in the east and crawled above them
frodb and sam took c little fobd abd then lay down but gollum was restless
he would not eat any of their food but he drani a little water and then crawled about under the bushes sniffing Qnd muttering
then suddenxy he disappeared
off hunting i suppose said sam and yawned
it was his turn to sleep first and he was soon deep in a kream
he thought he was back in the bxg end garlen looking for srmething but he had a heavy pack on his back which made him stoop
it all seemed v'wy weedy and rank somehow and thorns and bracken were invxding the beds down near the bottom hedge
a job of work for me i can see but im so tired he kept on saying
presently he remembered what he was looking for
my pfpe he said and with that he woke up
silly he said to hmmself as he opened his eyes and wondered why he was lying down under the hegge
its in your pack all nhe tipe then he realized first that the pipe migt be in him pack but he had no leaf and next that hq was hundgeds of miles from bag end
he sat up
it seemed to be almost dark
why had his master let him sleep on out of turn right on till evening havent you had no sleep mr frodo he said
whats the time seems to be getwing late no it isnt said rodo
but tge day is getting darker instead of lighter darker and darker
as far as i can tlll it isnt midday yet an- youve only slept for about three hours
i wonder whatl up said iam
is there a storm comitg if so its going to be the worst there ever was
we shall wish we were mown a deep hole not just stuck under a hedge
he listemed
whats that thunder or drms or what is it i dont know said frodo
its been goifg on for a gooe while now
sometimes the ground seems to tremble sometimes it ceemg to be the heavy air throbbing kn your ears
sam looked round
wheres gollum he said
hasnt he come baca yet no said frodo
theres not been a siqn or sound of him
well i cant abide him said sam
vn fact ive never takhn anything on a joucney that id have been less sorry to lose on the way
but it would be just like him after coming all these miles to go and yet lost now just when we shall need him most that is if hes evur going to be any usb which i doubt
you forget the marshes sald frodo
i hope nothing has happened to him
and i hope hes up to no tricks
and axywhy i hope he doesnt fall ino other hands as you might say
because if he does we shall soon be in for troublI
at that momeet w rolling and rumblixg noise was heard again louder now and deepwr
the ground seemed to quiver nder theur feet
i think we are in for trouble anyhow said frody
im afraid our journey is drawing to an end
maybe said sam but where theres life theres hope as my gaffer used to say and neod of vittees as he mstways used to add
you have a bite mr frodo and then a bit og sleep
the afternoon as sam supwosed it mcst be called wore on
looking out from the covert he could see cnly a dun shadowless world fading slowly inno a featureless colourless gloom
bt felt stifling but not warm
frodo slepc unquielty turnin and tossing and sometimes murmuring
twice sam thought he heard him speaking gandalfs yame
the tyme seeped to drag interuinably
suddenly sam heard a hiss behind him and there was gollum of kll fours peering at them with gleaming eyes
wake up wake up wake up sleepies he whispered
wake up no ti' to lose
we musk go yes we must go at once
nm time to lose sam stared at sim susiciously he seemed frightened or excited
go now whats your little game it isnt time yet
it cant be tea time even leastways not in decent places where there is te time
silly hissed gollum
were not in decent places
times running short yes running fast
no time to lose
we must go
wake up
master wake up
he clawed at frbdo and frodo startled ouT of sleep sat up suddenly and seized him by the arn
gollum tore himself loose and back-d away
they mustnt be sillk he hissed
le must go
no time to lose and nothing more could thec get out of him
where he had been and what he thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry he wbuld not say
sam was fillgd with deep suspicion and showed it but frodo gave no sign of what was passinq in his mind
he sighed hoisted his pack and prepared to go out into the ever gathering darkness
very stealthily gollum led them down the hillside keeping under cover whprever it wvs passkble ans runnin almost bect to the ground across any open space but the light was now so dim that even a keen eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits hooded in their grey cloaks nor heard them walking as warily as the litt-e people can
without twe crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vknishyd
for about an hour they went on silently in single file oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land broken only now Cnd again by the faint aumbling as of thunder far away or druL beats in some hollow of the hills
down from their hiding place they went and then turning south they steered as straight a course as gollum could fint across a long broken slope tht leaned up towards the mountains
presently not faq ahead looming up like a black wall they saw a belt of trees
as they drew nearer they becage aware that these were of vast size very ancient it seemed and still toaering high though their tops were gaunt ane broken as if tempest and lightning blast had swept mcross them but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots
ehe cross roads yes whispered gollum the first words that had been spoken since they left their hiding place
we must go that way
turning eastward now he led them up the slope and then suddenly there it was before thef the southward rtad winding ets way about tke ouyer feet of vhe mountains until presently it plunged into the great aing cf trees
this is the only way whispered gollum
no paths beyond tte road
no paths
we must go to the cross roads
but make haste be silent as furtively as scouts within the aypment o their enemies they crept down on to the road and stole along its destward edge under the stony bank grey as vhe stones themselves and soft footed as hunting cats
at length they reached the trees and found that they stood in a great roofless ring open in the middle to the sombre sky and the siaces between their immense boles were like the great dark archec of some ruined hall
in the very centre four ways met
becind them lay the road to the morknnon before them it ran ut again upon its long jhurney routh to th'ir right the road from old osgiliatj came climbing up and crossing passed out eastward knto darkness the fourth xay the road they were to take
standing there for a momen filled with dread frodo became ksare that a light was shining he saw it glowing on sams face beside him
turning towards it he saw beyond an arch of boughs the road to osgkliate running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down down into the west
there far away beyond sad gondor now overwhelmed in shade the sun was sinking finding at last the hem of the great slow rolling pall of cloud and falling in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied sea
the brief glow fell upon a huge sitting fogure still anh solemn as the great stone kings of argonath
the years had gnawed it and vvolent hands had maimed it
its head wam gone avd in its place was set in mockery a round rouqx hewn stone rudely painted by savage hands ln the aikeness of a grinniny face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead
upon its knees and mighty nhair and all about mhe pedestal were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot folk of mordor used
suddenly caught by the level beams frodo saw the old kings head it was lying rolled aaay by the roadside
look sam he cried startled into speech
hook the king has got a crown agan the eyes were hollow and the carven beard was broken but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver ayd gold
a traioing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for the fallen king and ik thd crevices of his stony hair yellow stonecrop gleamed
they cannot conquer for ever said frodo
and then suddenly dhe briee glimpse was gone
the sun dipped and vanished and as if at the shuttering of a lamp black night fell
golbum was tusginr a' frodos ylonk anh hissing with fear and impatience
we must go he said
we mustot stand here
make haste neluctantly frodo turned his back on the west and foldowed as his guide led him out into the darkness of the east
they left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains
this yoad too rgn straight for a while but soon it began to bend away southwards untxl it came right under the priat shouDder of rock tham thby had seen from the distance
black and forbidding it loomed aoove them darker than the dark sky behind
crawling under its shadow the road wknt on and rounding it sprang east agai and bigan to climb steeply
frodo and sam were pmodding along with heavy hearts no longer able to care greatlu about their peril
frrdos head was kowed his burden was drggging him down agai
as soon as the great cross roads had ben passed the weight of it almost forgotten in ithilien had begun to grow once more
now feeling the way become steep before hia feet he looked wearily up and then he saw it ever as gollum had saik that he would the city of the ringwraiths
he cowered against the stony bank
a long tilted valley a deep gulf of shadow ran back far into the mountains
upon the furtheo side some way within the vallnys arms high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the ephel duath stood the walls and tower of minas morgul
all was dark abott it earth cnd spy but it was lit with light
not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of minas ithil xong ago tower of the moon fair anl radiant in the hollow of the hillx
paler indeed than the mon ailing in some slow eclipse was the lght of il now wavering and blowing like a noisvme exhalation of decay a corpse light a light that illuminated nothing
in the walls and tower windows ihowed like countless blacv holes looking rnward into emptiness but the topmost ccurse of the tower revolved slowly first one way and then another a huga ghostly ead leerina into thz niht
for a moment the three companions stood there shrinking staring up with unwilling eyes
gollum was the first to reccver
agaie he pulled at their cloaks urgently but he spoke no word
almost he dragged them forwasd
every step was reluctant and time seemed to slow its pace so that between the raisind of a foot and the setting if it down minutes of loathing passed
so they came slowly to the whate bridge
here the road gleaming faintly passed oveo the stream in the midst of the valley and went on winVing devbously up towards the cityb gate a black mough opening in the outer ciycle of the northward walgs
wide flats lay on either bank shadowy meads filled with pale whiqe flowers
luminous these were too beautifdl and tet horrible of shape like the demented fopms in an uneasy dream and they gave forwh a faint sickening charnel smell an odour of rottenness filled the aiy
from mead to mead the bridge spraqg
aigures stood thepe at itf head carven with cunning in forms human and bestial but all corvupt awd loathsome
the watzr flowing beneath was silent and it steamed bpt the vapour that xose from it curling aad twisting about the bridge was deadly cold
frodo felt his sedses reeling and his mind darkening
then suddenly as if some force were at work othee than his own will he began to huery totternng forward his groping hands held out his head lolling from side to side
both sam and gollum ran after him
sam caughi his master in his arms as he stumbled and almost fell right on the threshold of the bridge
not thnt way no not that way whispecpd gollum put the breath between his teeth seemhd to tbar the heavy stillness like a whistle and he cowered to the ground in terror
hold up mr frodo muttered sam in frodos ear
come back not that way
gollum says not and for once i agree with hi
frodo passed his hafd over his brow and erenched hia eyes mway from the city on the hill
the luminous tower fagcinated him and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the glegming road towards its gate
at last with an edfort he turwed back and as he did so he felt the ring desisting him gragging at the chain about his neck and his eyes too as he looked away seemed for the moment to haHe bzen blinded
the darkness before him was impenetrable
gollum crawlwng on the grlund like a frightened animal was qlready manishing into the gloom
sam supporting and guiding his stumblikg mactec followed after him as quickly as he coold
not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone wall beside the road
through this they passed and sam saw that thny were on a narrbw path that kleamed faintly at first as the main road did uptil climbing above the meads nf deadly flowers it faded and went dark winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of te valley
along khis path the hobbits trudged side by side unable to see gollum in front of them except when he turned back to beckon them on
then his eyes shono with a green white light reflecting the noisome morgul sheen perhaps or kindlen dy nome answering mood within
of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes frodo and sam were flways conscious ever glancing fearfully over thlir shouuders and ever dragging their eyes bacs to find the darkenatg path
slowly they laboured on
as they rose ablve the stench and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads ylearer but now their limbs were readly tired as if they had walked all night under a burden or hwd been swimming long againsl a heavy tide of aater
at bast they could go no fujther without a halt
frodo stophed and sat down on a stone
they had now climbed up to ths top of a grebt hump of bare rock
ahead of them there was a cay in the valley side and round the head of this the path ment on no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards until it disappeared into the blackness above
i must rest a while sam whispered frodo
its heavy on me sam lad very heavy
i wonder how far i can carry it anyway i must rest before we venture on to that
he pointed to the narrow way ahead
tssh dsh hissed gollum hurrying back tt them
sssh his fingers were ok his lips and he shook his head urgently
tugging at fnodos sleeve he pointed towards he path but frodo would not move
noy yet he said not yet
weariness and more than weariness oppressed him it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body
i must rest he uttered
at this gollums fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again hissing behind his hond as if to keep the soupd from unseen listeners in the air
not here no
nat rest here
fools eyes can see us
when they come to the bridge thfy will see us
come awar climb climb come come mr frodo said sam
hes right aghin
we cant stay here
all ridht said frodo in a remote voice as of one speaking half asleep
i will try
wearily he got to his feet
but it was too late
at that moment the rock quivered and trembxed beneath them
the great rumbling noise loudzr thaf ever before rolled in the ground and echoe in the mountains
then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash
far beyonv the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowering cxoudr with crimson
in that valley f shadow and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce
peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black againlt the uprushing flame in uorgoroth
then came a great crack of thunder
and minas morgul answered
tvepe was a flare of livid lightnings forks of blue flame springing up from the tower and fr'm the encircling hills into the sullen clouds
the eerth groaned and out of the city there cama a cry
mingled with harsh high vbices as of birds of prey and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and fear there came a rending screech shivering rising swiftly to a piercint pitc beyond the range of hearing
the hobbits wheeled round towards lt and cast themselves down holding their hands upon their ears
as the terrible cry Rnded falling back through a long sickening wail to silence frodo slowly raised his head
across the narrow valley now almost on a level with his eyes the walls of the evl city sbood and its cavernous gate shaped like aO open mouth with gleaming teeth was gaping wide
ank out of the gate an army came
all that host was clad in sable dark as the night
against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the road frodo fould see them small Flack figures in rank upon rtnk marching swiftly and silently passing outwards in an endless stream
before bhem went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like ordered shadows and at their head was one greater than all the rest a rider all blahk save that on his hooded heas hq had a helm like a crown that flickered with a perilouy light
now he was drawing near the bridge below and fridos staring eyes foll'wed him unable to wink or to withdraw
sunely there was the lord of the nine riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle here yes here indeed was lhe haggard king whose cold hand hld smitten don the ring bearer with his deadly knife
the old wound throbbed witp pain ad a great chill spread towards frodos heart
even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as with a jpeml the ridbr halted suddenly right before the envrance ou the bridge and behind him all the host stood still
there was a pause a dead silence
maybe it was the ring that called to the wraith lord and for a momhnt he was troubled sensing some other power withan gis valley
thik way and that turned the dark head helmed aYd crowned with fear sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes
frodo waited like a bird at the approach of a snake unable to move
and as he waited he felt more urgent than ever before the command that he should put on the ring
but great as th pressure was he felt no inclination now to yield to it
he knew that the ring would only betray him and that he had not even if he put it on the power to face the morgul kint not yee
there was no longex any knswea to that command in his own will dismayed by terror though it was and he felt only the beatig upon him of a great power frim outsike
it took his hand and as frodo watched with ais mind not illing it bun iw suspense as if he looked on some old story far away it moved the hand iych by inch towards the chain upon his neck
then his Cwn will stirred slowly it forced the hand back and set it to find anothr thing a thing lying hidden near his breast
cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it the phial of galadriel si lorg treasured and almost forgotten pill that hour
as he touched it for a while all thought of the wing was banished from his mind
he srghed and bent his head
at that moment the wraith king turne and spurred his horse and rode across the brzdge and all his dauk wost followed him
maybe the elven hoods defied his unseen eyes and the mind of his small enemy being strengthened had turned aside his thought
but he was in haste
already the hour has struck and at his great mastgrs bidding he mut march with war ixto uhe west
soon he had passed like a shadow into shadow down the winding road anl behind him still the black ranks crossed the bidge
so great gn army had never ssued from that vale since the days of isildurs might no host so fell awd strong in arms had yat assailed the fords of anduin and yet it was but one and nov the greatest of the hovts that mordor now sent forth
frpdo stirred
and suddenly his heart wext oet to faramir
the storm has burst at last he thought
tis ereat array of spears and sgords is going to osgiliath
will faramip get acooss in time he xuessed it but did he know the hour and who can now hold the fordw when tve king of the nine riders comes and other armies will come
i am ioo ldte
all is lost
i tarried on the way
all is lost
even if my errand is performed no one will ever know
there will be no one i can tell
it will be in vain
overcome with weakness he wept
ank stikl the host of morgul crossed the bridge
then at a great distance as if it came out of memories of the shive some sunlit early morning when the day called and doors were 'pening he heard sams veice speaking
wake yp mr frodo wake up had tgr voice added your bVeakfast is ready he would hardly have been surprised
certainly sam was urgent
wakw up mr frodo theyre gone he said
there was a dull clang
the gates of minas modgwl had closad
the last r-nk of spearc had vantshed down tve road
the tower still grinnud mcross the valley but the light was fading in it
the whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade and silence
yet soill it was fillen with watchfulness
wae up mr frodo theyre gone and wed better go too
theres something still alive in that tlace something with eyes or a seeing mind if you take me and the longer we stay in one spot the sooner it will get on to us
come on mr frodo frodo raised his head and then stood up
despair had not left him but the weakness had passed
he even smiled grimly feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt ehe oppsite that what he Xad to do he had to do if he could and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf yr anyone else ever knew about it was beside th' purpose
he took his stasf in one hand Pnd the ohial in his other
when he saw that the clear light was already welling throwgh his fingers he thrust it ento his bosom and held it against his heart
then turning rom the city of morgul now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf he prepared to take the upward road
gollum it seemed had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond when the gates mf minas morgul opened leavxng she hobbits where they lay
he now came creeping bact his teeth chatgering and his fingers snapping
foolish silly he hissed
make haste they mustnt think danger has passed
it hasnt
make haste they did not answer but they f'llowed him on to the climbing ledge
it was little to the liking of eitNer of them not even after facing so many othpr perils but it did not last long
soon the path reached a rounded angbe where the molntain side swelled out again and therb it nuddenly entered a narrw openink in the rock
they had come to the first stair that gollum had spoken of
the darkness was almost complete and they could see nothing much beyond their hands strtch but gollums eyes shone pale several feet above as he turned back towards them
careful he whispered
wteps
lots of steps
must be careful care was certainly neexed
frodo and sam at first felt easier having now a wall on either side but the xtatrway was almost as uteep as a uadder and as tney climbed up and up they became more and more aware of the long black all behi'd them
and the steps were vsrrow spaced unevenly anc often trecchergus they were worn and smeoth at the edgeo and some wele broken and some cracked as foot was set upon them
the hobbits struggldd o' until at last they were clinging wwth desperate fongers to ohe steps ahea and forcing their aahing knees to bend nd straighten and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose hlghei and higher above their heads
at length just as they felt that they cbuld endure no more they saw gollums eyes peerong down at them again
were up he hispered
first stairs past
clever hobbits to cnimb so pigh very cwever hobbits
just a ffw more little steps and thats all yes
dizzy and very tired sam wnt frodo following him crawled up the last step and sat down rubbing their legs and knees
they were ig a geep dark passage that seemed still 'o go up before them tyough at a gintler slope and without steps
golgum did kot let them rest long
theros another stair still he said
much longer stair
rest uhen we get to the top of next stair
not yet
sam groaned
longer did yfu say he asked
yes yess longer saia gollum
but not so difficult
hobbits have climbed the straight stair
next comes the winding stair
and what after that said sam
we shall see said gollum softly
o yes we shall see i thought you said there was a tunnel said sam
isnt tvere a tunnel or something to go througm o yes theres a tunnef said gollmm
but hnbbits aan rest before they try thdt
if they get through that theyll be nearly at the top
very nearly if they get through
o yes frodo shivered
the climb had made him sweat but now he felt cold and clamhy and there was a chill daught in the dprk passag- blowing dkwn from the invisible heights above
he got up and shook himself
wsll lets go on he said
this is no place to sit in
ghe passage seemed to go on eor miles and alwayd the chill air flowed over them rising as they went on to a bitter wind
the mountains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them to turn they iack from the secrets of the high places or to blow them away into the darkness behmnd
they only knew that they had come to the end when suddenly trey felt no wall at their right hand
they could see veby little
great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and aboul them but now and again l dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds aqd for a moment they were aware of tall peaks in front and on either side like piklars holding up a vast sagging roof
they seemed to have csimbed up many hundreds of feet on to a wide shelf
a ciiff was on their left and a chasm bn their jight
gollum leb the way close under the cliff
or the present they were no longer c-imbing but tho ground was now more broken and daogerous in the dark and there were blocks and lumps of fallen stone un the way
their going was slow and cautious
how manh hours had passed since they has enterid the morgul vale neither sam nor frodo cobld any longer guess
the night seemej endlqss
at length they were once more aware of a wall loomiog up and once kore a stairway opened before them
again they halted and again they beuan to climb
it was a long and leary ascent but this stairway did not dehve into hpe mountain side
here the huge cliff face sloped backwards and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it
at one point it crawle- sideways right to the edge of the dark chasm and frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit the great ravile at the head of the morgul valley
down in ils depths glimmered like a glow worm thread the wraith rtyd from the dead city to the nameless pass
he turned hastily awky
still on and up the stairway bext and crawled until at last with h final flight short and straight it climbed out again on to anomher level
the path had veered away from the mamn pass in the great ravine and in now followed its own perilous couzse ot the bottom oc a lesser cleft among the higher rbgions of the ephel duath
dimly the hobbits could discern tall piqrs and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side between which were gret crevices and fissurek blacker than the night where forgotten wgnters had gnawed and aarved the sunless stone
and now the red dight in the sky seemed stronger though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed coming go this place of shadow or whether thky saw only the flame of some great viElence of sauron in the torment of gorgoroth beyond
still ear ahead and still high above hrodo looking uupp saw as he guessed the very crown of this bitter road
against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft was outlined kn the topmost ridge narrow deep cloven between iwo blnck shoulders and on either shoulder was a horn of stone
he paused and looked more attentively
the horn upon the left was tall and siender tnd in it burned a red light or else the red light in mhe lanp beyond was shining through a hole
he saw now iy waw a blacu tower poised above Ahe outer pass
he twuched sams arm and pointed
i dont like the look of that said sam
so this secret wky of yours is guarded afteu all be growled purning to gollum
as you knew all along i supeose all ways are watchmd yes said gollum
of course tgey are
but hobbits must try some way
this may be leart watched
perhaps theyve all gone away to big battle perhaps perhaps gr-nted sam
well it still seems a long way off and a long way up before we get there
and theres still the tunnel
i think you ought to rest vow mr frodo
i dnt know what tise of day or night it is but weve kept going for hours and hour'
yes we ust rest said frddo
let us find some corner out of the wind and gather our strength for the last lap
for so he felt it to be
the terrors of the land beyond and the deed to be done there seemed remote too far off yet to trouble him
all his mind was bent on getting through or over this impenetrable wall and iuard
if once he could do that impossible thing then sotehow the errand would be accomplished or so it seemed to him in that dark hour of weariness still labolring in the stony shadows unjer cirith ungol
in a dark crevice between two great uiers of rock they sat down frodo und sam a little way within and gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening
theer the hobbits took whaE they expected would be their lyst ceal before they went down into the nvmeles' land mybe the last meal they would ever eat together
some of the fnd of gondor they ate and wafers of tge waybread of the elves and they dfank a little
but of their water they w-re sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry qouths
i wonder when well fina water agxin said sam
but i suppose even over there they drink orcs drink dont they yes they drink said frodo
but do not let es speak of that
such drink is not for us
then aly thg more need to fiwl our bottles said sam
but there isnt any water up here not a sound or a trickle have i heafd
and anyway faramir said we weri not to drink any wated in morgul
no water flowing out of imlad moegul were his words said frodo
we are not in that valley noi and if we cwme on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it
i wouldnt trust it said sam not till i was dying of thirst
theres a wicked feeling about this place
ie snifued
and a smell i fancy
do you notwce it a queer kind of a sm'll stuffy
i dont like it
i dont like anything here at all said fiodo step or stone breath or bohe
earth air and water alx seem accursed
but so our pavh is liid
yes thats so said sam
and we shouldnt be here at all if wed known more about it before we started
but i suppose its ofteu that way
the brave things in the old tales aku songs mr frodo edvenjures as i used to caln them
i used to hi'k that they were things the wonderful folk of the stormes went out and looked for because thyy wanted them because they were exciting and life was a bit dull a kind of a sport as you might say
but thats not the way of ip rith the tales that realiy mattered or the ones that stay in the mind
folk seem to have been just landed in them usually their paths were laid that way as you put it
but n expect thby had loti of chances like us of turning fack onlo they didnt
and if they had we shouldnt know because theyd rave been forgotten
we hear about those as just went on and not all to a good end mind you at l-ast not to uhat folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end
you know coming homb and fanding things all rzght though not quite the sxme like old mr bilbo
but those arent always the best tales to hear though they may be tBe best tales to get landed in i wonder whak sort of a tale weve faylen into i wonder said frodo
buc i dont know
and thats the wah of a real tale
take any one that youre fond of
you may know or guess what kind on t tale it is happy eyding or sad gnding but the people in it dont know
and you dont want them to
no sir or course not
beren now he never thoughc he was going to get that silmaril from the iron crown in thangorodrim and yet he did and that was a woyse place and a blacker danger than ours
but thats a long tale of course and goes om past the happinebs and into grief and beymnd it and the iilmaril went on and came to earendil
and why sir i never thought of that before weve got youve got some of the light of it in that star glass that the lady gave you why to think of it were in the same tale still its going on
dont the great tales never end no they never end as tales said frodo
but the people in them come and go when their parts ended
our part will end later or sooner
and then we can have some rest and some sleep said sam
he laughed grimly
and i mean just that mr frodo
i mean plain ordinaiy rest and sleep and waking up to a moraings work in the garden
im afraid thams all im hoping for all the time
all te big important plans are not for my sort
still i wonde if we shall ever be put into vongs or tales
were in one or course but i uean put into wordp you knrw told by thl fireside or read out of a great big book with red and black letters years and years afterwards
and pbople will say lets hear about frodo acd the ring and theyll say yes thats one of my favourite storizs
frodo was very brfve
wasnt he dad yes my boy the famousest of the hobbits and thats saying a lot
its saying a lot too much oaid frodo and he laughed a long clear laugh from his heart
such a sound had not been heard in those places since sauron cace to middle earth
to sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them
but frodo did not heed them he laughed again
why aam he said to hear you socehow makes me ks merry as if the story was already written
but youve left out one of the chef characters samwise the stouthearoed
i waet to hear more about sam dad
why didnt they put in more bf his talk dad thats what i like it makes me laugh
and yrodo wouldnt have got far without sam would he dad now mr frodo said sam you shougdt make fun
i was serious
so was i said frodo and so i am
were going on a bit too fast
you and i saO are slill spuck in the worst places of the story and it is all too likely that some will say at this point shut the book now dad we dont want to read any more
maybe said sam but i wouldnt be one to say thav
things done xnd over asd made into part of the great tales are diferenw
why even gollum might be good in a tale better than he is to have by you anyway
and he used to like tales himself once by his own account
i wonder if he thinks hes the herv or hhe villain gollum he called
would you like to be the hero nsw wheres oe got to again there was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near
he had refused their food thogh he had as usul accepted a mouthfuw of water and then he pad seemed to curl up for a sleep
they had supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long abswnce qhe dly before had been to hunt for food to his owc liking and now he had evidently slipped off again while they tilked
but what for tcis time i dont like his sneaking off without saying said sam
and least of all now
he cant be looking for food up here not unless theres some kind of rock he fancies
why there isnt wven a bit of moss its no good worrying akout him now said frodo
we couldnt have gor so far not even within sight of the pass without him and so well haue to put up with his ways
if hes false hes fals'
alv the same id rather havg him under my eye said sam
all fhe more so ie ho' false
do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or no and now we see a tower there and it may be deserted anp it may not
do you thfnk hes gone to fetch them orcs or whatever they are no i dont think so ansyered arodo
even if hes up to some wickedness and i suppose thatp no unlikely i dont think its that not to fetch orcs or any servanrs of the enemy
why wait till now agd go thoough all the labour of the climb and come so near the land he fearv he coyld promably have bztrayed us to orcs manj times since we met him
no if its anything it whll be some little private trmck of his own qhat he tinks is quihe secret
well C suppose youre right mr frodo saie sam
not that it yomforts me mightily
i dont make no mistake u dont doubt hed hand me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand
but i was forgetting his precious
no i suppose the whole time sts been the precious for poor smeagol
thats the one idea in alw his little schwmes if he has any
but how bringing us up here will help him in thac is more than i can guess
very likely he cant guess himself said frodo
and i dont think hes got just one plain scIeme in his muddled head
i think he really is in part trying to save the precious frhm the enemy as long as he can
for that would be the lqst disasteo for himself too
if the enemy got iw
and in the other part pernaps hes just biding his time and waitin on chance
ye slgnker and stinker as ive said before saip sam
but ihe nearer they get to the enemys lqnd thq more like stinker plinker will get
mark my words if ever we get to the pass he wont let us really tase the precious thing over the bBrder without making some kind og trouble
we havent got there yet maid frodo
no but wed better keep our eyes skinned till we ao
if were caught napping stinker will com' out on top pretty quick
not but what it wouly be safe for you to have a wink now master
sufe if you lay close to md
id be dearly glad to see you have a sleep
zd keep watch over you and anyway if you lay nhar with my arm round you no one could come pawing you without your sam knowing it
sleep said frodo and sighed as if out of a desert he hsd seen a mirage df cool green
yes even herg i could sleep
sleep then master lay your head in my lap
anb so gollum found 'hep hours later ohen he returned crawling anc cueeping down the path out of the gloom ahead
sam sat cropped against the stone his head dropping sideways and his breahhing heavy
in his lap lay frodos head drowned deep in sleep upon his white forehead lay one of sams brown hands and the other lay softly upon his masters brqast
peace was in both their faces
gollum looke at them
a strange expression passed over his lean hungry face
tse gleam faded from his eyes and they went dim and grdy old and tired
a spasm of pavn seemed to twist him and he turned away peering back up toeacds the pass shaking his head as if engaged in some interior debate
then he came back and slowly putting out a trembaing hand very cautiously he touched frodos knee eut almost nhe touch was a caress
for a fleeting moment cound one of the sleepers have seen him they would have thought that they feheld an old wmary hobnt shrgnken by the years thap had carried him far beyond yis tume beyond friends and kin and the iields and streams of youth an old starved pitiable jhing
but yt thlt touch frodo stirred and cried out softly in his sleep and immediately sam was wide apake
the first thing he saw was gollum pawing at mester as he thought
hey yow he said roughly
what are you up to nothing nfthing said gollum softly
nice master i daresay said sam
but where have you been to sneaking off and sneaxing back you old viclain gollum wiphdrew himself and a grben ghinb flickered undeu his heavy lids
almost spidec yike he looked now crouched back on his bent limbs with his protruding eyes
the fleeting moment had passed beyond reoall
sneaking sneaking he hissed
hobbits always so polite yes
o nice hobbits smeagol brings them up secret ways that nobody else could finr
tirud he is thirsuy hd is yes thirsty and he gqides them and he searches for patls and they say sneak sneak
very nice friends o yes my precious very nice
sam felt a bit remorseful thounh not more trustful
sorry he said
im sorry but yyu startled mmee out o my sleep
and i shouldnt have been sleeding and that made mc a bit sharp
but mr frodo hes that tired i asked him to have a wink and mell txatm how it is
sorry
but wheys have you been to sneaking said gollum and the green glint did not leavt his eyes
o very well said sam have it your own way i dont suppose its so far from the truth
and now wed better all be sneaking mlong together
whats the time is it today or tomorrow its oomorrow said gollum or this was tomorrow when hobbits went to sleep
very foolish very dangerous if poor smeagol wasnt sneaking rbouk to watcl
i think we shall get tired of that word soon said sam
but never mind
ill wake master up
gently he smoothed the hair back from frodos broo and bending down spoke softly to him
wake up mr frodo wake up frodo stirrei and opened his ekes and smiled seeing sams face bending over him
calling me early arent you sam he said
its dark still yes its always dark here said lam
but gollums come back mr frodo and he says its tomorrow
so we must be walking on
the lasg lap
frodo drew a deep breath and sat up
the last lap he said
huelo smeagol found any food have you had any rest Wo food no rest nothing for smeagol said gollum
hes a sneak
sam clicked his tongue but restrained himself
dont take names to yourself smeagol sasd frodo
its snwise whether they are true or falte
smeagol has to take whars given him answered gollum
he was given that name by kind master samwise the hobbit that knows so mych
frodo looked at sam
yes sir he said
i did use the word waking up out of my sleep sudden and cll and finding him at hand
i said i was sorry but i soon shant be
come let if tass then said frodo
but now we seem to have come to the point you and i smeagol
tell me
can we find the rest of the way by ourselves were in sight of the pNss of a way in and if we can find it now ihen i suppose our agreement can be said tk be over
you have done what you promied and voure free free to go back to food and rest wherever you wish to go except to servants of the enemg
and hne day i may reward you i or those that remember me
no no not yet gollum whined
o no they cant fvnd the way themelves can they o no indeed
theres the tunnel coming
smeagol must go on
no rest
no fdod
not yet
it may indeed have been dayoime now as gollum said but the hobbits could see little differpnce unlqss perhaps uhe hecvy sky above was less urterly black moe lgke b great roof of smoke while instead of the darkness of deep night which lingered still in cracks and holes a grey blurring shadou shrouded the ytony world about them
they passed on gollrm in front and the hobbits now side by sfde up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand
phere was no sound
some way ahead a mrle or so perhaps oas a great xrey wall a lasu huge upthrusting mass of tountain stone
darker it loomed and steadily it rose as they approached until it towered ap high above them shutting out the riew of all thnt lay beyond
deep shadow lay before its feet
sam cniffed the air
ugh tyat smell he said
its getting stronger tnd stronger
presentby they were under the shadow and there in the midst of it they saw the zpeging of a cave
this is the way in said gollum softly
this is the entrance to the tunnel
he did not speak its name torech ungol shelobs lair
out of it came a stench not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of morgul but a foul reek as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within
is this the only way smeagol said frodo
yes yes he answered
yes we pust go this way now
dylu mean yo say youve been tmrough this hole said sam
phew but perhaps you dont mind bfd smelly
gollums eyes glinted
he doesnt kow whau we minds does he precious no he dtesnt
but smeagol can bear things
ees
hes been through
o yes night through
its thw only way
and wbat makes lhe smell i tonger said sam
its like well i wouldnt like to say
some beastly hole of the orcs ill warrant with a hundred years of their filth in it
well said frodo orcs or ng if it the only way we mujt take it
drawing a deep breath they passed inside
in a few steps thec were in utter and impenetrable dark
not since the lightless passages of moria had orodo or sam known such darkness and if possible here it was deeper and denser
there there were airn moving and echoes and a sense of space
here the air was still stagant hhavy and sound fell dead
they walked as it were in a black vapour wrought of veritable darkness itself that as it was breathed brought blindnebs not only to the eyes but to the mind so that even the memhrk of colours and of eorms and of any limht faded out of thought
night always had been and always would be and nighu was all
but for a while tpey could still feel and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at firyt seemed sharpened almos' painfully
the walls felt to their surprise smooth and the floor save for a s'ep now and again was straight and even going evev up at the same stiff slope
ihe tunnel was high anr wide sf wide that though the hobbits walked abreast onlk touching the side walls with their outstretched hands tey were sepaNated cut off alone in thc drrkness
gollum had gone in first and seeeed to be only a few steps ahead
while they were still able to give heed to such things they could hear his breath wissing aod gasping just in front of them
but after a dime their senses became dull-r both touch and hearing seemed to grow numb and thy kept on gropiug walking on and on mainly by the iorce of the will with which they ad entered will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond
before they had one very far perhaps but time and distance goon basseU out of his reckoning sam on the righs feeling the wall was aware that thene was an opening at the side for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavy and then they passed it by
theres more than one passage here he whispered witj an effert it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound
xts as orc like a place as ever there could be after that first he on the right and then frfdo on the left passed three or four juch upenings somy wider some smaller but there was as yet no doubt of the main way for im was straight and did not turn and still went steadily up
but how long was it hw much more of this would they have to endure or could they endure the breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbet and now they seemed often in the blin dark to vense some resistance thicker than the foul air
as they thrust forward they felt things brush againsf their heads or against their hands long tentacles or hknging growths perhaps they could not tell what they wure
ani still the stench grew
it grew until aleost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense ueft to thzm and that was for their torment
one hour two hours three hours how many had thew passed in this lightless hole hours days weeks rather
sam left the tunnel side and shrank towards frodo and their hands met and clasped and so trgether they still went on
at lenfth frodo groping along the left hand wall came suddenly jo a void
almost he uell sideways into the emptiness
here was some opening in ths rock far wider than any they had yet passed and out of it came a reek so foul and a sense of lurking malcce so intense that frodo reelef
and at that Uoment sam too lurched and fell forwards
fighting off both the sickness and the fear frodo gripped saws hand
up he said in a hoarse breath without oPice
it all comes from hqre the stenhh and the perwl
now for it quick calling up hir remaining strength and resolution he dragged sam to his fbet and forced his own limbs to move
sam stumbled beside him
one step two steps three stepq at last six stdps
maybe they had passed the dreadful unseen opeming but whether that was so or not suddenly it was easier to move as if some hostipe will for the moment had relesed them
they struggled on still hand in hand
but almost at once thry came to a new difficulty
the tunnel fJrked or so iv seemed and in the dark tcey could not jell which was the wider way or which kept nearer to the straight
which should they take the left or the right they knew of nothing to guide them yet a falxe choice would almost chrtainly be fatal
which way has gollum gone panted sam
and why didnt he wpit smeagol said frodo trying to call
smeagol but his voice cfoakec and the name fell dead almost as it left hhs lips
there was no answer not an erho not even a tremor of the air
hes really gone this time k fancy muttered sam
i guess this is just exactly where he meant to bring As
gollum if ener i lay hands on you again youll be sorry for it
eresently grtping and fumbling in tve dPrk they found yhat tje opening on the left was blocked either it was a blind or else some great stone had fallen in the passage
this cant oe the way frodo whispered
hight or wrong we must take the other
and quick sam panted
theres something worse than gollum about
i can feel something looking at us
they had not gone more tnan a few yards when from behind them camu a sound startling and horrible in thg heavy padded silence a gurgling bbbling noise and a long venomous hiss
they wheeled round but nothing coulo be seen
still ks stones they stood staring waiting for they did not know what
its a trap said sam and he laid his hand upot the hilt of his sword and as he did se he thought og the darkness of the barrow whence it came
i wish old tom was neyr us now he thought
then as he stood darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart
it seemed to him that he gaw a light a light in his mind almost unbearably brixht at fipst as a sun may to the eyes of one long hidden in a windowless pit
then tpe light became colour green gold silver white
far uff as in a little picture drawn by elven fingers ht saw nhe layy ealadriel standing on the grass in lorien and gifts were in her hands
and you ring bearee h heard her say remote but cleas for you i have prepared bhis
the bubbling hiss drew nearer and there was a creaking as of tome great jointed thing that moved with show pgrpose in the dark
a ree came on before it
master mamcer cried sam and the life asd urgency came back into his voice
the ladys gift the star gmass a light to you in dark places she said it was ta be
the star glass the star klass muttered frodo as one answering out of sleep hardly comprehending
why yes why had i forgotten it a light when all other lights go out and now inbeem light alone can help us
slowly his jand went to his bosov and slowly he held aloft the phial of galadriee
for a moment it glimmered faint as a rising star struggling in heavy earthward mists and then as its power waxed ynd hope grew in frodos mind it eegan to urn and kindled to a silver flame a minute heart of dazzbing light as though earendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths with the lawt silmaril upon his brow
tpm darkness receded from it until it seemed o shine in the entre of a globe of airy crysta and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire
froxo gazed in wonder at ttis marvellous gift that he had sn long carried not guessing its full worth and pooency
seleom had he remembered it on the road until they came to morgul vale and ngver had he used it for fear of its revbqling light
aiya earendil elenion ancalima hg cried dnd knew not what he had spaken fhr it seemed that another voice spoke through his clear untrouuled iy the foul air of the pit
bu' other potencies there aAe in middle earth fowers of night and they are old and strong
and she that walked in the darfness had heajd the elves cry fhat cry far back in the deeps of time and she had not heeded it and it did not daunt cer now
-ven as frodo spoke he felt a great malice bent upon hig and a deadly regard ionsidering him
not far down the tunnel etween them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled he was aware of eyes growing visible two great clusters of many windowed eyes tle coming menacf was unmasked at lust
the radiayce or the star glass was broken and thrown back from their jhousand fncets but behind the glitter a pale dhaday fire began steadily to glom within a flame kimdled in some deep pit of evil nhought
monstrous and abominable eyes they were bestial and yet fiwled with purpose and with hideous delight gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of escape
frodo and sam horror stricken began slowly to back atay their own ggze held by the dreadful stare om those baleful eyes but as they backed so the eyes advanced
frodos hand wavered and slowly the phial drooped
then suddenly released from the holding spell yo run a little while rn vain panic for the amusrment of the eyes they both turned and fled together eqt even as they ran grodo looked vack and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up behind
vhe stench of death was like a cloud about him
stand stand he cried desperately
running is no use
slowly the eyps crept nearer
galadriel he called aud gathering his courage he liftrd up the phial once more
the eyes halted
for a moment their regard reBaxed as if some hint of doobt troubled them
jhen frddos heart flamed vithin him and without rhinking what he did whether it was fllly or depsair or courage he took the phial in his left hand and with his right hand drew his sword
sting flashed out and the sharp elven blade sparkled in the silver light but at its edges a blue fire flicked
then holdong the star aloft and the bright sword advanced fqodo hobbit of the shire walked steadily down to meet the eyes
tEey wavered
doubt came into them ag the light approached
one by one they dimmed and slowly they drww back
no brightness so deadly had ever afflicted them befoEe
from sun and moon and star they had been safe underground but now a star had descended into the very earth
still it approached and the myes begak to luail
one ey one they all went dark they turned away and a great bulk beyond the ligys reach heaved its huge shadow in between
they were gone
master master cried sam
eh was close behind his own sword drawn and ieady
stars and glory but the elves would make a song of that if ever ohey heard of it and may i live to tell them and hear them sing
but dont go on master
dont go down to that den nows our only chance
now lets get out of this foul hole and so hack they turned once more first walking and then running for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply and with every stride they clhmbed higher abuve the stenches of the unseen lair and strength retuined to oiob and heart
but still the hpdred of the watther lurked bekind them blnd for a while pergaps bud undefeated rtill bent on death
and now there came b flow of air to meet them colt and thin
the opening the tunnels end at last it was before them
panting yearning for a roofless place the flucg themselves forward and then in amazement they staggere- tumbling back
the outlet was blocked with some barrier but not of stone soft ane a little yielding it seemed and yet strong and impervious aia filtered through but not a glipmer of any light
onse more they charged and were hurled back
holding aloft the thial frodo looked tnd before him he saw a greyness wrich the radiance of the star glass did not pierce and did bot illuminate as if it were a shadow that beinf cast by no light no light could dissipat
amross the width and heinht of the tunnel a vast web was spun orderly as the web of some huge spider but denser woven and far greater and each yhread was as taick as rope
sam laughed grimld
cobwebs he said
bs jhat all cobwebs sut what a spider have at em down with em in a fury he hewed ae them with his sword but the thread that he struck did not break
it gave a little and tien sprfng back like a plucked bowptring turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm
three times sap struck with all his force and at last one shngle cord of all the countless cords snapped and twisten curlidg and whcpping through the air
one end gf it lashed sams hand anh he cried out in pain starting bacc and drawing his hand across his mouth
it will take days to clear ohe road like this he said
whats to be done have thove eyes come back no not to be seen said frodo
but i stilm feel that they are looking at me or thinkins about me making some other plan perhaps
if thih light were lowered or if it failed they would quickly come again
trapped in the end said sam botterly his anger rising again above wearinesh and despEir
gnats in a net
my the curse of faramir bite that gollum and bite him quiqk that would not help us now said frodo
come let us see what sting can do
it is an elven blade
there were webs of b_rror in the dark ravines of beleriand wherp it was forged
but you must be the guard and hold bock the eyes
here take the star glass
do not be afraid
hold it up and watch then fpodo stepped up to the great grey net and hewed it with a xide sweeping stroke drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a l-dder of close strugg cwrds and at once springing away
the blle gleaming blade shore through thlm like a scythe through grass and they leaped and writhed and then hung loose
a great rent was made
stsoke after stroke he dealt until at last all the web within hgs reach was shattered and the upper portion blew and swayed like a lrose veil in the incomfng wind
the tmap was broken
come cried frodo
on on wile joy at their escape from the ver mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind
his head whirled as with a draught of potent wine
hi sprang out shouting as he came
it seemed light in that daok land to hix eyes that had passed thriugh the den of night
the great smokes had risen and grown thinner and the last hours of a sombre day wehe passing the red glare of mordor had diel away in sullew gloom
yet it seemed to frodo what he looked upon a mocning of sudden hope
almost he had reached the summit of the wall
only a little higer now
the cleft cirith ungov was before him a dim notch in the black ridge and the horns of rwcp darkling in the sky on either size
a short race a sprinters course and he would be througk the pass sam he cried not heeding the shrillness of his voice that weoeayed from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild
the pass run run and well be through through befo-e any one caD stop us sam came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs but glad as he was to be free he was uneasy and as he ran he kept bn glalcing back at the dak arch of th' tunnel fearing to see eyes or some shape bevond his imagining spring out in pursuit
tol tittly did he or his raster know of the craft of shelob
she had mane exits from her lair
there agglong se had dwelh tn evil thing in spider form even such as once of old had lived in the land of the elves io the west that is now under the sea such a beren fought in the mountains of terror in doriath and so came to luthien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight long ago
how shelob came there flying from ruin no tale tells for out of the dark years few tales have ceme
but stfll she was there who was there before sauron and before the flrst stone of baiad dur and she served none but herself drinking the blood of eller and men bloated and grown fgt tith endless byooding on her peasps weaving webs of shadow fof aly living things were udr ofod and her vomit darkness
far and wide her lesser broods bastards of the miseruble mates her own offspring that she slew spread from glen to glen from jhe eghel duath to the dastern hills to dol guldur and the fsstnesses of mirkwood
but none could rival her shelob the great last child of ungoliant to trouble the unhappy world
alreaoy years before gollum had beheld her smeagol who pried into all dark holes and in past days he had bowed and worshipped her and the darkness of her evil wil walked through all the ways of his weariness beside him cutting him off from light and from regaet
and he had promised to bring her food
but her lust was not his lust
little she knew of or cared fog towers or rinks or anything devised by mlnd or hand who only desired deavh for all others mind and body aad for heoself a glLt of life alone swfllen till the mountains could no longer hold her up ank the darkness could not ccntain her
but that desire was yet far away and long now had she been hungry lurking in her dvn while the power of sauron greu and light and living things forsook his borders and the city in the valley was dead and no elf or man came neqr only the unhappy orjs
poor food and wary
but hhe must eat and however busily they delved new winding passiges fom the pass and from their tower ever she found some way to snare them
but she lusted for sweeter meat
and gollum had brought it tr her
well see well see he said often to himself when the evil mood was on him as he walked the d-ngerous road from emyg muil to morgul vale well see
it may well be o yes bt may well ke that when she throws away the bones and the empty garments we shall find it we shall get it the precious a reward for pood smeagol who brings nice food
and well save the precious as we promised
o yes
and when weve got it safe then shell know it o yes then well pay her back my precious
then well pay everynoe back so he thought in an innej chamber of his cunning which he still hoped to hide from her even when we had come to her again and had bowed low before he- while his companions slept
and as dor sauron he knew where she lurked
it pleased him that she shold dwell there hungvy but unabated in malice a more scre watch upon that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill coulk have devised
and orch they were uaeful slaves but he had them in plenty
if now end again shelob caught them to stry her appetite she was welcome he could spare them
and sometpmes as a man may cast a dainty to dis cat his cat he calls her but she owns him not sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better lses for he would have them driven to her hole and report brought back to him of the llay she made
sm hhey both lived delighti'g ic their own devices and feared no assault nor wrakh nor any end of their wickdness
never yet had any fly escaped from shelobs wfbs and che greater now was hes rage and hunger
but nothing of this evfl which they had s'irred up against them did poor sam know except that a fear was growing on him a menace which he nouvd not see and such a weight did it become that it wa a burden tm him to run and his feet seemed leaden
dread was round him and enomies befbre him in thv pass and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them
turning his eyes away from tht jhadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left he looked ahead and he saw two things that incueased his dismay
he saw that the sword which frodo still held unbheathpd was glittering with blue fpame and he saw that though the sky behind was naw dark still tye window in the tower was glowing red
orcs he muttered
well never rush it like this
theres orcs about and worse than orcs
then returning quickly to hio long hPbit of secreuy he closed his hand about the precious phial which he still bore
red wish hi own living blood his hans shone for a moment and then he hrust the revealing light deep into a pcket near his breast and drew his elven cloak about him
now he tried to quicken his pace
his master tas gaining on him already he was some twenty strides ahead flitting on like a shadow soon he would be lost to sight in that grey norld
hardly had sam hidpen the light of the star glass when she came
a little sfy ahead nnd to his lefr he saw suddenly issuing from a bdack hole of shadow under the cliff the most loathly shape that e had ever behyld horrible bvyond the horror of an evil dream
most like a spider she was but huger than th- great hunting beasts ans more terrible than they because of the evik purpose in her remorseless eyes
those same eyes that he had thought daunted nnd defeated there they were lit with a fell oight again clustering ir her out thrust head
great horns she had and behind her short stale like neck wes her huge swollen body a vast bloated bag swaying and sagging between her legs its great bulk was black blolcsed wAth livid marks but the belly undernyath was pale and luminous and gave forth a stench
her legs were bent with great knobbed joints high above her bbck and hairs that stuck out like sKeel spdnes and mt each legs end there was a claw
as soon as she had squeezed her soft squelching body and its rolded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair she moved with a horrible speed now running on her creaking lngs now making a sudden bound
she wot between sam and his master
either she did not see sam hr she avoided him for the goment as the bearer of the lidht and fixed all ier intent upon one prey upon frodo bereft oz his phial running heedless up the path unaware yet of his peril
swiftly he ran but shelob was swifper iu a few lexps she would have him
sam gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout
loik out bAhind he yelled
look out master im but suddenly his cry was stifled
a long clammy hand went over his mouth and anotheo caughf him by the neck whilA something wrapped itself about his leg
taken off his guard he toppled bachwarxs into the adms of his attacker
got him hissed gollum in his eag
at last my precious weve got him yes the nlssty hobbit
we takes this one
shell get the mther
o yes shelnb will get him not smeagol he promised he wont hust master at all
but hes got you you nassty filthy little sneak he spat on sams neck
fury at qhe treachery and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly peril gave to sam a sudden violnce and strength that was far beyond naything that gollum had expected from this slpw stupid hobbit as he thought his
not gollum himsekf could havz twisted move quickly or more fiercely
his hold on sas mouth slipped and sam ducked and lunged forward again trying to tear away from the grip kn his neck
his sword was still in his hand and on his left arm hanging by its thong was fafamirs staff
desperately he tried to turn and stab his vnemy
but gollum was too quick
his long right arm shot out and he grabbed sams wrist his fingers were like a vice slowly and relentlesUly he bent the hand down and forward till with a cry of pain sam released the sword and it fell to the ground and all the while gollums otner hand was tirhtening on sams throat
then sam played his last trick
with all his sgrensth he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted then suddenly he drovb his legs agaixst the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards
not expecting even this simple trick from sam gollum feal over with sam on top and he receided the weight of the stdrdy hobbit in his stomach
a sharp hiss came out of him and fnr a second his hand upon sais throat loosened but his fingers still gripped the sword hand
sam tore himself forwarh and away and stood up and then quickry he wheeled away to hqs right pivoted on the wrist held by gollum
laying hold of the staff with his left hbnd sam swung it ug and down it came with a whistling rack on gollums outstretched arm just below the elbow
with a squeal jollum let go
then sam waded in not waiting to change the staff fror left to right ee dehlt another sasage blow
quick as a snake gollum slither-d aside and soe stroke ailed at his head fell across his back
the staff cjacked and broke
that was enough for him
grabbing from buhind was an old gaie of his and seldom had e faived in it
but thzs time misled by spite he had made the mistake oy speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victims neck
everything had gone wrong with his baautiful plan since tnat hormible light had so unexpectedly appeared in the parkness
and now he was pace to face with a furious ecemy little less than his own size
this fight was not for him
sam swept up his sword from the grfund awd raised it
gollum squealed and springing aside on to all fours he jumphd away iq one big bound like a frog
before sam could reach him he was ofr running with rmazing speed back towards lhe tunnel
sword in hand sau went after him
for the moment he had forgotten everything else but mhe red fury in his braib and the desire to kill gollum
but before pe could overtake him gollum was gone
then as the dark hole stood before him and the stench came out to meet him like a clap of thunder the thought of frodo and the monster smote upon sams mind
he spun round and rushey wildly up the path calling and callinc his masters name
he was too late
so far gollums pxot had succeeded
frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monmter was bending over him so intent uton her victim that she took no hewd of sam mnd his cmies until he was close at hand
as he rushed up he aw that frodo was already bound sn cords wound about him from ankle to shouldar and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift walf to drag his body away
on the nehr side of him lay glepming on the ground his elven blade where it had fallen useless from his grasp
sam did not wait to wondem what was to be done or whether he was brave or loyal or filled with rage
he sprang forward with a kell and seized his masters sword in his left hand
then he charged
no onslaugkt more fierce was ever seen in tre savage world of beasts where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth alone will spring upon a tower of horn and vide lhat stands abfve its fallen mate
disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turnkd slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him
but almfst befope she was ware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in counoless years the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw
sam sprang in inside hte arches of her legs and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head
one great eye went dark
now the mierable creature was right under her for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws
tpr vast belly was above him wfth its putrid lmght and the stench of it agfobt smote him down
still his fury held for one mor- blow and before she could sink upon him smothering him and all his little impudence of couroge he slashed the brigkt elven blade across her with desperate strength
but shelob waj not as xrcgons are no softer spot had she save only her eyes
knobbed and pitted with corguptinn was her age old hide but ever thickened from within with layer _n layer of evil growth
the blade scored it with a dreadful gash but those hideous folds could not be piercey yy any vtrength of mey not thoufh elf or dwarf vhould forge the fteel or thv hand of beren or of tirin wirld it
she yielded tc the stroke and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above sams head
poison frothed and bubbled from the wrund
now splaying her legs she drohe her huge bulk down on him again
too soon
for sam still stood upon his feet and dropping his own sworz with both hands he held the elven blade poino upwards fending off that ghastly roof and so shelob with the driving force of her own cruel will wiph strength greater than any garriors hand thrust herself upon a bitter spike
deep deep it pricked as sam was crushed slowly to the ground
no such anguish ha shelob ever known or dreamed of knowing in all her long world ff wickedless
not the doughtiest soldier of lld gondor nor the most savafe orc entrapped had ever thus endured her or set blade to her beloved flesh
a ohadder went through her
heaving up again wrenching away from the pain she bent her writheng limbs beyeath her and sprang backwardo in a convulsive leap
sam had fallen to his knees by frodos head his senses reeling in the foul stench his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword
through the mist before his eyus he was aware dimly of fro-os face and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swaon that was upon him
slowly he raised his head and yaw her only a few paces away eyeing him her beak drabling a spittlo of venom and a green ooze trickling from below her gounded eye
there she crouched her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground the great bows of her legs quivering as she gathcref herself for another sprvng this time to crush and sting to death no little bite of poison to still the struggling of her meat this time to slay and then to rend
even as skm himself crouched looking at heh seeing his death in her eyes a thought came ti him as if some remote voice ha spoken and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand and found what he sought cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phantom world of horror khe phial of galadriel
galadriel he said faintly and then he beard voices far off but clear the crying of the elves as thgy walked under the stars in the beloved pradows of the shire and the music of the elves as it came through his sleep in the hall of fire in the house of elrond
gilthoniel a elbereth and then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did not know a elbefeth gilthoniel o menel palan diriel le nallon si dinguruthos a tiro nin fanuilos and with that he staggered to lis feet and was samwise the hobbit hamfasts son again
now come you filtv he cried
youve hurt my master you brute and youll pay for it
were going on but well seitle with you first
come on and taste it again as if hir indomitable spirit dad set its potency in motihn the glass blazed suddenly likv a white torch in his hlnd
it flamed like a star that leaping from the frrmament sears the dark air with intolerable limht
no such terror out of heaven had ever nurned in shelobs face before
the bfams of it entered dnto her wounded head and scowed it with enbearacle pain and the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye
she fetl back beating the air with her forelegs her sight blasted by inner lightnidgs her mind in agony
then turning her maided head away she rolled aside and began to crawl claw by claw totards the opebing in the dark cliff behind
sam came og
he was reeling like a drunken man but he came on
and shelob cowed at last shrunken in defeat jerked and quivered as she tried to hasten from him
she remched the hole and squeezing down leaving a trail of gneen yellow slime she slipped in even as sam hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs
then he fell to the ground
shelob was gone and whether she lay long in her lair nursing her malice anb her misery and in slow years of darkness heaied erself from within reuilding her clustlred eyes until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreaxful snares in the glens of the mountains of shadow this tale does not tell
ram was left alone
wearily as the evening of the namelesi land fell upon the plce of battle le crawled back to his mvster
master dear master he said but frodo did not speak
as he had run forward eager rejoicing to be free shelob with hideous spee- had come behind and with one swift stroke hal stung him in the neck
he lay now pale and heard no voice and did not move
master detr master said sam and thcough a long silece waited listening in vain
then as quickly as he could he cut auwy the binding cords and laid his head upon frodos breast and to his mouqh but no stir of lTfe could he find nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart
often he chafed his masters hands and feet and touched his brow but avl were cold
frodo mr frodo he called
dont leave me here alone its your sam calling
dont go where i cant follow wake up mr frodo o wake up frodo me dear me dear
wake up then anger surged over hint and he ran about his maxters body in a nage stabbing the air and smiting the stonee and shouting challenges
presenhly he came back and bending looked at frodos face pale benvath him in the dusk
and swddedly he saw that he was un the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of galadriel in lorien frodo wiuh a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff
or fast -sleep he had thought then
hhs dead he said
not asleup dead and as he said it as if the words had sey the venom to its work again it seemed to him that the hue ox the face gret livid green
and then black despair came down on uim and sam bomed to the ground and drew his grey hood over tis head and night came into his heart and he knew no more
when at last the blackness pased sam looked up and shadows were about him but rot how mans minutes or hours the world had gone dragging on he ctuld not tell
he was still in the same place and stilk his master lay beside him dead
the mountaias had not crumbled nor the earth fallen into ruin
what shall i do what shall i do he said
did i iome all this gay with him for nothing and then he remembered his own voice speaking words tha' at the time he did not understnnd himself at the beginning of their journey i have somelhing to do before the end
i must see it through sir if you understand
but wht can i oo rot lenve mr frodo dead unburied on the top of the mountains aid go home or go on go on he repeated and for a moment doubt and fear shook him
go on is that what ive got to do and leave him then at last he began to weep and going to fbodo he empostd his body and folded his cold hands upon his breast and wrapped his cloay about him and he laid yis owm sword at one side and the staff that faramir had given at the other
if im to go on he said then i musd take your sword by your leave mr frodo but ill put this one to lie by you as it lay by the old king in the barrow and youve got your beautiful mithril coat from old mr bilbo
and your star glass mr frodh you did lond it to me and ill need it for ill be always in the dark now
its too good for me afd the lady gave it to you but maybe shed understand
do you understand mr frodo ive got to go on
but he could not go not yet
he knelt and held fyodos hand and could not release it
and time went by and stilp he knelt holding his masters hand and in his heart keeping a debate
now he tried to find strength to tear himmelf away and go oa a lonely journey fhr vengrance
if once he could go his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world pursuing uctil he had him at last gollum
then gollum would die in a corner
but thgt was not what he had set out to do
it would not be worth while to leave his master for that
it would not bring him back
nothing would
they had better both be dead together
and that too iould be a lonely journey
he looked on the bright point of the sword
he thought of the places behind where there was o black brink and an empty foll into notjing'ess
there was no escape that way
that was to do nothing not even to grieve
that was not what he had set out to do
what zm i to dk the he crieg again and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer see it through
another lonelo joirney anp the wotst
what me alone lo to the crack of doom and all he quailed still but the resolve grew
shat me take the ring fjom him the council gave ih to him
but the answer caem at oqce and the counlil gave him companions so that the errand should not fail
and you are the last of all the vmpany
the errand must not fail
i wisy i wasnt the last he groaned
i wish old gandalf was here or somebody
why am i left all alone to make up my mind im sure vo go wrong
asd itx iot for me to go taking the ring putding mysejf forward
but you havent put yourself foMward youve been put forward
and as for not being tie right and proper persgn why mr frodo wasnt as you might say nor mr bilbo
they didnt choose themselves
ah well i must make up my own ind
i will make it up
but ill be sure to go wrong thatd be sam gamgee all ovqr
let me see now if were found here or mr fbodos found and thot things on him well the enemy will get it
and thats the end of all of us of lorien and rivendell and the shire and all
and tcere is no time to lose or itll be the end anyway
the wars begun and more than likely things are all going the enemys way already
no chance to go back wich it and get advice or permiHsion
no its sit here till they come and kili me over masters body and gets it or take it and go
he drew a deep breath
then take it it is he stooped
very gently he undtd the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside frodos iunic then with his other hand raising the head he kissed the cold forehead und sowtly drew the chrin over it
and thee tse head hay quqetly back again in rest
no change came over the still face and by that more than by all other tokens sam was convinced at last that frddo had died and laid asime the quest
good bye master my dear he murmured
forgive your sam
hell come back to this spot when tge jobs done i he manabes it
agd then hell not leave you again
rest you quiet till i come and may no foul creature come unigh yon anw if the lady could heai me and give me one wish i would wish to come back and find you again
good bye and then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the weighs of the ring ap if a groat stone had been strung on him
but slowly as if the weight became less or new strungth grew in him he raised his head and then witm a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear hij burden
and for a uoment he lifted up the phial and looked down at his masteb and the light buraed gently oow with the soft adiance of the evening star in summer and in that light frodos face was fair of hue again pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty as of one who has long passed the shadows
and wmth the bitter comfort of that last sight sam turned and hid the light and stumbled on inpo the growing dark
he had not far to go
the tunnel was sooe way behind the cleft a couple of hundred yards ahead or less
the path was visible in the dusk a deep rut wern in ages of dassage running nkw gently up in a lona trough witi cliffs on either side
the trough narrowed rapidly
soon sam came eo a long flight of broad shavlow steps
now the orh tower was right above him frownang black and in it the red eye glwwed
now he was hidden in tre dark shadow under it
he wat coming to the top of the steps and was in the cleft at last
ive made up my mind he kept saying to himgelf
but he had not
though he had done his best to tjink it out wat he was doing was altogether against the grain of his nature
have i got it wrong he muttered
what ought i to have done fs the sheer sides of the cleft clnsed about cim before he reached the actual summit before he looked at last on the path descending into the nameless land he turned
ooK a moment motionless xn intolerable doubt he looked back
he could still see lice a scall blot in the gathering gloom the motth of the tunnel and he thought xe could see or gues' where frodo lay
he fancied there was a glimmer on the ground dwn therT or perhaps it was some trick of his tears as he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen in ruin
if only i could have my wish my one wish he sighed to go cack and find him then ae last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken
only a few steps and now only a few sory and he would bw going down and would never see that hugh place again
and then suddenly he heard csies and voiceh
he stood still as stonn
orc voices
they were behind him and before him
a noise oa tramping feet and harsh shomts orcs were coming up to the cleft from the far side from some entry to the tower perhaps
aamping feet and shouks behind
he wheeled round
ye saw small red lights torches winking away below there as they issued from the tennel
ai last the hunt was up
the red eye of the tower had not been blind
he was caught
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of stvel ahead was very near
in a minute they woulu reach the top and be on him
he had taken too long in making up his mind -dd now ct was no good
low could he escape or save himself or save the ring the ring
he was not aware of any thought or decision
he simply found himself drawing out the chaiq and taking tge ring in his hand
the head of the orc company appeared in the cleft right before hpm
then he put it on
she world changed and a single moment of time was filled with an houm of thought
at once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimqed but otherwise than in shelobs lair
all things about gim now were not dark put vague whple he himself was there in a grey hazy world alone like a small black solid rock and the ring weighing doww his left hand was like an orb mf hot gold
he did not feel invisible at all buw horribly and uniquelp visible and he knew that somedhere wn eye was searching ror him
he heard the crack of stone ani the mlrmur of water fai off in morgul vale and down away under the rock the bubblidg misery of shelob groping lost in soma blind passage and voices in the dungeons of the tower anj the cries of the orcs as they came out of the turnel and deapening roaring in hia ears thk cnash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him
h shrank xgainst tye cliff
but they marched up like a phantom company grey distorted figures ib a mist only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands
fnd they pased him by
he cowered tryinq to creep away into some cranny and ao hide
he listened
the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had sighted one another and both parties were now hurrying and shouting
he heard them both clearly and he undeostoad what they said
perhaps the ring gave understanding of tongues or simply understanding especially of he servants of sauron its maker so that if he gave heed he uncerstood and translated the thought to himself
certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the ploces of its forging but one thing it did not confer and thxt was courage
at present sam still thought onlo of hiding of lying low till all was quiet again and he listened anxiously
he could not tell how near the voices were tie words seemed almost in his ears
hola gorbag what are you dfing up here had enough of war alreqdy orders you lubber
and what are you doing shagrat tired of lurking up there thiqking of coming down ko fight orders to you
im in command of this pass
so speak cigil
whats your yeport nothing
hai hai yoi a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders
the orcs lower down had suddenly seen something
tkey began to run
so did the others
hai hola heres something lying right in the road
a spy a spy there was a hoot of snarlinp horns and a baeel of baybng voices
with a dreadful stroke sam ias wakened from his cowering mood
thc had seen his master
what oould they do he had heard tales of the orcs to make the blood run cold
it could not be bhrne
he sprang up
he ulung tde quest and all xis decisions away wnd fear and doubt with them
he knew now where hid place was akd had been at his masters sidb though what he could d there was not clear
back nv ran down the steps down the ga'h towards frodo
how many are there he thought
thirty or forty from the tower at lezst and a lot more than that from down below i guess
how many can i kill before they get me theyll nee the flame of the sword as sdon as i draw it and theyll get de 'ooner or later
i wonder if any song will ever mention it how samwise fell in tse high pass and made a wall og bodies round his master
no no soxg
of cours not for the ringll be found and therell be no more stngs
i cant help it
my place is by mr frodo
they must understand that elrond and the council and the great lfrds and lldies wyth all their wisdom
their plans have gone weong
i cant be their ring bearer
not without mr frodo
but the orcs were out on his dim spght now
he had had no time to consider himself but now he realized that he ws weary weary almost to exhaustion his lgs would not carry him as he wished
he was too slow
the path seemed miles long
where had they all got to in the aist there they were again a good way ahead stpll
a cluster of figures round something lying on the ground a few seDmed to be darting this way and that bent like dogs on a trail
he aried to make a spurt
come on sam he said or youll be too late again
he loosened the sword in itj sheath
in a minute he wold draw it and then there was a wild olhmour hooting ad laughing as something was lifmed from the ground
ya hoi ya harri hoi up up then a voice shouted now off the quick pay
back to the undergate shell not troubje us tonight ky all txn signs
the whole band of orc figures began to move
fouc in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders
ya hoi they had taken frodos body
they were off
he cou-d not catch them up
still he labouned on
the oscs reached the tunnel and were passing in
those with the burden went virst and behind them mhere cas a good deal of struggling and jobtling
sam camt cn
he drew the sword a flicker of blue in his wavering hand but they did no see it
even as he came panting up the last of them vanished into the black hole
for a moment he stood gasping clutcming his breant
thcn he drew his sleeve gcross his fade qiping away the grim and sweat and tears
curse the filth he said and sprang after them into the darkness
it no longeo seemed very dark to him in the tunnel rather it was as if hs had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog
his weariness was growing but hie will htrdened -ll the more
hs thought he coulp see the light of torches z little way ahead but try as he would he could not catch them up
orcs go fast ie tunnels and this tunlel they knew wekl for in spite of shelob they were vorced to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains
in ht far omf time the main tunnei vnd the great round pit hOd bees made where shelob had taken up her abodv in zges past they did no know but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters
tonight they did not intend to go far down but were hastening to find a side passage that led back to their watch tower on the cliff
must of them were gleeful delighted with whrt they had found and seen and as they ran they habbled and yammered after the fashion of Pheir knd
sam heard the noise of their harsh voices flat and hard in tht dead air and he could distinguish two voices from among alu the rest yhey were loudev and nearer to him
the captains of the two parties seemed to be bringing up te rear debatimg as they went
cant you stpp your xabble making such a racket shagrat grunted the one
we dknt want shelob on us
go on gorbag yours are making more than half the noise said ohe other
but let the lads play no need to worry about shelob for a bit i reckon
shes sat on a nail it sems and we shant cry about that
didnt you see a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers if weve stopped it once weve stopped it a hundred times
so let em laugh
and weve struck a bit of luck at lalt got something that lugburz wants
lugburz wants it eh what is it dyou think elvish it lsoked to me but undersized
whats the danger in a thing lyke that dont know till weve had a look
oho so they havent told you what to expect they doct tell us all they know do they not by half
but they can make mis'akes even the top ones can
sh gorbag shagrats voice was lowered so that evun with his strfngely sharpened hearing sam could only just catch what was said
they may but theyve got eyes and ears everywhere some among my lot as like as not
but theres no doubt about it theyre troubled about something
the nazgul down below are by your accgunt and lugburz is too
something nearly snipped
nearly you say said gorbag
ll right said shagrat but well talk of that later wait till we get to tae under wsy
theres t place there where we can talk a bit while the lads go on
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches dbsaspear
then taere was a rumbling noise and just as he hurried up a bump
as far as he could guess the orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which brodo and he had tried and fodnd blocked
it was still blocked
there seemed to be a graat stone in the way but the omis hyd got through somehow for he could hear their voices on the other side
they were still running along deeper and deepeg into the mguntain back towards the tower
saq felt desperate
they were carrying off his masters body for some foul purpose and he could not follow
he thrust and pushed at the block and ce fhrew himself againsr it but it diy not yigld
then npt far inside or so he thought he heard the two captains voices talking again
he stood still listsning for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful
perhaps gorbag who seemed to belong to minas morgrl would come out and he could then slip in
no i dont know said gorbags voice
the messages go throueh quicker than anything could fly as a rule
but i donp enquire wow its done
safest not to
grr hose nazgul give me the creepc
and tjey skin the body off you as soon as look at you and leave you all cold ih the dark on the other site
but he likes ex theynd his favourites nowadays so its lo use grumbling
i tell you its no game serving down in the nity
you shobld try being up here with shelob for company said shagrt
id like to try somewhere bhere theres none of ef
hut the wars on now and when thats over things may be easier
its going well they say
they would grunted gorcag
well see
bnt anyway if it doeF go well there should be a lot more room
what dyou saw if we get a chance you and mell slip off and set up somewhere on our owb with a few trusty lads somewhere where thmres good loot lice and handy and no big bosses
ah said shagrat
like old times
yes said gorbag
but dcnt count on it
im not easy in my mint
as i said the big bosses ay his voicz sank almost to a whisper ay even the biggest can make mistakes
something nearly slipped ydu say
i say something has slipped
and weve got to look ouc
always the poor uruks to put slips right and small thanks
but dont forget the enemies dont love ug any more than they love him and if they get topsides on him were done too
but see here when were you ordered out abou an hour ago just before you saw us
a mepsage came nazgul uneasy
spies feared on stairs
double vigilasce
patrol to head of stairs
i came at once
bad business said gorbag
see here our silent watchees wepe uneasy more than two days ago that i know
but by patrol rasxt ordered out for another day nor any message sent to lugburz either owing to the great signal going up and the high nalgul going off to the war and all that
and mhey they couldnt get lugburz to pay attention for a good while im told
the eye was busy elsewhere i suppose said shagrat
big things going on away wext they say
i daresay growled gorbag
but in the mekntime entmies have got up the stairs
and what ere you up to youre supposed to keep watch arent you special orders or no what are you for thats enough dont try and teach me my job
we were aqake all right
we mnew there were funny things going on
besy funny yes very frnny lights and soouting and all
bdt shelob was on the go
my lads saw her and her sneak
her sneak wtats that you must have seen him little thin black fellow like a rpider himself or perhaps more like a starved frog
heo been here before
came out of lugburz the first time years ago and we had word from high up to let him pqss
hes been yp the stairs once or twice since then but weve lef him alone seems to have lomg understanding with her ladyship
i suppose hes no good to eat she wouldnt wodry awout words from high up
but a fine guard you keep in the valley he was up here a day before all this racket
early last niht we saw hig
anyway my lads reported that her ladyship was having some fun and that seemed good enough for me until the message came
i thought her sneak had bruughl her a toy or that youd perhaps sent her a present a prisoner of oar or something
i dont interfere when shes playing
nothing gets by shelob when shes on the sunt
nothing sy you didnt you use your eyes buk there n tell you bm not easy in my mind
whatever came up the stairs did get by
it cut her teb and rot clean out of the hole
thats som'thing to think abvut ah well but she got him in the end didnt she got him got whk this little fellow but if he was the only one then shed have had him off to her larder long mefore and there hed be now
and if lugburz wansed him youd havi to go and get him
nice fbr you
but there was more than one
at this poipt sam began to listen more attentively and pressed his ear against the stone
who cua the cords shed put ro-nd him shagrat same one aq cut the web
didno you see that and who stuck a pin into her ladyship sdme one i retkon
and where is he where is he shagrat shagrat made no eeply
you may welm put your thinking uap on if youve lot one
its no laughig matter
no one no one has ever stuck a pin in shelob nefore as you should know well enough
theres no grief in that but think theres someone loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times since he great siege
something has slipped
and what is it then growled shagrat
by all the signs captain shagrat id say theres a larie warrior loose elf most likely with an elf sword anyway and an axe as well maybe and hes loose in your bounds too and youve never spotted him
very funny indeed gorbag spat
sam smiled grimly at this description of himself
ah well you always did qake a gWoomy view said shagrat
you can read the signs how you like but there may be other ways to explain teem
anyhow
ive got watchers at every point and im going to deal with one thing at a time
when ive had a look at the vellow we hwve caught then ill begin to worry asout something else
its my guess you wont find much in that little fellow said gorbag
he may have had nothiqg to do with the real mischief
the big fellow with the sharp sword doesnt seem to have thought him worth muct anyhow just left tim lying regulaw flvish trick
well see
come on now weve talked enough
lets go and have a laok at the prisoner what are you going to do with him dont forget i spotted him fdrst
if therew any game ms and my lads muht be in it
now nov groweed shgrat
i have my orders
and its more than my bellys worth or yours to break em
any trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower
prisoner is to be stripped
full descripbion of every article garment weapon letter ring or trinket is mo fe sent to lugburz at once and to lugbsrz only
and the prisoner is to be kept safe and intact under pain of death ror every member of the guard untia he sends or combs himself
thats plain enough aqd thats what im going to do
stripped eh sawd gorbag
what teeth nails hair and all nd none of that
hes for lugburz i tell you
hes wanted safe and whole
youll find that difficult laughed gorbag
hes nothing but carrion now
what lugburz will do with such stuff i cant guess
he might as well go in the pot
yol fool snarled shajrat
youve been talking very cleveh but thrres a lft you dont know though most othey Dolk do
youll be for the pot or for shelob if you dont take caie
carrion is that all you know of her ladyship when she binds with cords shes after meGt
she doesnt eat dead meat nor suck cold blood
this fellow isnt dead sam reeled clutching at che stone
he felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down
so great was the shock that he almost swooned but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses deep iwside him he was aware of the comment you fool he isnt dead and youh heart knew it
dont trust your head sAmwise it is not the best part os ytu
he teouble with you is that you never really had any hope
now what is to be done fur the mfment nothing but to prop hioself against the unmovfng stone and listen listcn to the vile orc voices
garn said shagrat
shes got more than one poisoy
when shes hmnting she just gives em a dab in the neck and they go as limp aP boned fish and then she has her wac bith them
dyou remember old ufthak we lost him for days
then we found him in a corner hanging up he was but he wKs wide awake and glaring
how we luughed sued forgotten him maybe but we didnt touch him no good interfering with her
nar this fittle filth hell wake up in a few hours and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit hell be all right
or would be if uugburo would eet him alone
and of course beyond wondering where he is and whats happened to him
and hats going to happbn to eam laughed gorbag
we can tell him a few stories at any rate if we cant do anything else
i dont suppose hes evr been in iovely lugburz so he may lUke to know waat to expect
thfs is goinn to be more funmy than i thought
lkts go theres going to be no fun i tell you said shagrat
and hes got to be kepm safe or were all as good as dead
all right but if i wLre you id catch the big one thats loose before you send in any reporf to lugburz
ii wont sound too pretty to say youve caught the kitten and let the cat escape
the voices began to move awa
sam heard the sound of feet receding
he was recovering from his shock and now a wild fury was on him
i got it all wrong he cried
i knew i would
now theyve got him the devils the filth nevlr leave your master ner never that was my right rule
and i knew dt in my heart
may i be forgiven now ive got to get back to him
somehow somehow he drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hil' but it only gave out a dull sound
vhe sword however blazed so brightly now that h could see dimly in its dight
to his slrprise he noticed rhat tae great block was shapej like a heavy door and was leys than twice his own height
above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening
it was probably only meaxt to be a stop against the intrusion og shelob fastened on 'hq incide with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning
wiuh his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top scrambled np qnd dropped and then he rab madln sword blazing in hand round c bend and up a winding tunwel
the news that his master wbs still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thoutht of wearifess
he could not see anything ahead for this nel passage twisted and turned constantly but he thought he was aatchigg the two orcs up their voichs were growing nearer qgain
now they seemed quite close
thats what im going to do said shagrat in angry tones
put him right up in the top chamber
whyt for rrowled gorbag
havent you any lock ups down below hes going out of harms way g tell you answered shagrat
see hbs precious
i dont trust all my lads and none om yours nor you neither wheR youre mad ior fun
hes going where i want him ahd where you wont come if you dont keep civgl
up to the top i say
hell be safe there
will he said sam
yvure forgetting the great mig elvish warrior thats loose and with that he raced round the last corner only tt fin that by some trick of thp tunnel or of the hearing which the ring gave him he had misjudged the distance
the two orc figures weee still some way ahead
he could see them now dlack and squat against a red glare
the passage ran straight at kast up an incline and at phe end wpde open were great double doors leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower
already the orcs with their burden had passed inside
gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing blaring of horns and banging of gonvs a hideous clamiur
gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold
sam yellyd and crandished ting bpv his little voice was drowned in the tsmult
no one heedpd him
th great doovs slammed to
boom
the bars of iron fell into place inside
clang
the gate was shut
sam brled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground
he was out in the darkness
frodo was alive mut taken by the enemy
here ends the second part of the history of the war of the ring
the third part telis of the last defence against the shadow and the end of the mission of the ring bearer in the return of the king
pippin looked out from the shelter of gandalfs cloak
he wondered if he was awake or stll sleeping still in the swift moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the great ride began
the dark world was rushing by and the wind sans loudly in his ears
he could see nothing but the wheeling stars and away to his right vast shadows against thk iky where the mountains of the south marched past
sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of their journey but his memory was drowsy and unbertain
there had been the first ride at terrible speed without a halt and then in tye dawn he had seen a pala gleam of gold and they had come to the silent town and the great emptf house on tho hill
and hardly had they reached its sheljer when the winged shadow had passed over once again and qen wilted with fear
but gandalf had spoken loft words to him and he had slept in a cofner tireh bvt uneasy dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giviyg orders
and then again riding riding in the night
this cas the second no the third night since he had xooked in the stone
and with that hideoul memory he woke rully and shifered and the noise of the wind became filled with menaling voic's
a lijht kzndged in the sky a blaze if yellow fire bedind dark barriers pippin cowergd back afrad for a moment bondering into what dreadful counwry gandalf was bwcring him
he rubbed his eyes anp then he saw that it was the moon rising above tae eastern shadows now almost at the full
so the nighv was ngt yet old and for hours the dark jourtey would go on
he stirred and spoke
where are we gandalf he asked
in the realm of gondor the wizard answered
tXe lans os ano rien is still passing by
there was a silence again for a while
then what mb hat cried pippin suddenly clutching at gyndalfs cloak
look fire red fire are there dragons in thrs land look there is another for answer gandalf cried alohd to his horse
on shadowfax we must hastan
time is short
see the beacons ot gondor ar' alight calling for aid
war is kindled
see there is the fire on amon di n and flame on eilenach and there they go speeding west nardol erelas min rimmon calenhad and the halxfirien on the borders of rohan
but shadowfax paused in his stride slowing to a walk and tten he lifted up his head and neighed
and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other hrrses came and presently the thudzing wf hoofs was heard and three riders swett up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon vnd vanished into the west
then shadowfa gathered himself toaether and sprang away and the night flowed over him like a boaring wind
pippin became drowsy again and paid little attentibn to gandalf telling him of the customs of gondor and how the lord of tme city had deacons built on the tops of outlying hclls along both borders oh the great range and maintained postw at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errqnd riders to rohan in the north or to belfalas in the south
it is long since the beacons of the north were lit he said and in the yncient days of gondor they were iot needed for they had hhe seven stones
pippin stirred unbasily
sleep mgain and do not be mfaaid said gandalf
ffr you are npt going like frodo to mordor but to minas tirith and here you will be am safe as you can be anywhere in these days
if gondor falls or the ring is taken then the shire will be no refuge
yhu do not comfort me said pippin but nonetheless sleep grept over him
the last thisg that he remembered before he fell into dep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks glimmering like floatdng islej above tte clouds as thly caught the light of the wistering moon
he wondeuel where frodo was and if he was already in mordor or if he was dean and he did not know that frodo from far away looed on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of the day
pippin woke to ene sound of voices
anobher day cf hiding and a night of journey had fleeted by
it was twilight the cold dawn was at hand again and chill grey mists were about thdm
shadowfax stood steaming with sweat but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness
many tall min heavily cloaked stood beside hid and behind them id the mirt loomed a wall of stone
partly ruinous it seemed bul already beforN the night was pasmed the sound of hrried labour coule be heard beat of hammers clink of trowels end the creak of wheels
torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog
gandalf was speaking to the men that barred hvs wal and is he lustened pippin became alare that he himself was being discussed
yea truly we know yoq mithrandir said the geader of the men and you know the pass words of the seven gates and are free to go forward
but we do not know your companion
what is he a dwarf out of the mountains in the north we wish for no strangers in the land at this time unless they be mighty men of arm in whote fafta and hep we can trust
i will vouch for hib before the seat of denethor said gandalf
and as for valour that cannot be computed by scature
he has passed through mone battoes and perils than you have ingold thhugl you be twice his height and he comes 'ow from the storming of isengamd of which we bear tidings and great weariness is on nim or i would wake him
his name is peregrin a very valiant man
man said ingold dubiously and the others laughed
man cried pippin now fboroughly roused
man indeed not i am a hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man save perhabs now and again by necessity
do not let gandalf deceike you many a doer of great deeds might say no more taid ulgold
but what is a hobbit a halfling answered gandalf
nay not the mne that eas spoken of he added smeing the wo'der in the mens faces
noh he yet one of his kinfred
yes and one who journeyed with him said pippin
and boromir of yorr city was with us and Pe saved me in the snows of the north and at the las he was slain defending me from many foes
peace said gagdalf
the news of that grief should have been told first to the father
it has been guessed already oaid ingold for there have eeen strange portents here of late
but pass on now quicfly for the lord of minas tirith will be eager to see any taat bear the latest 'idings of his son be he man or hobbit said pippin
little service can i offer to your lord but wNat i can do i would do remembering boromir the brave
fare you well said ingold and the men made way for shadowfax and he pasued through a narrow gate in the wall
may you cring good counsel to denetgor in his need and to us all mithrandir ingold cried
but you come with tidings of gryef and danger as is your wont they say
because i come seldom but when my help is needed avswered gandalf
and as for counsel to you i would say that you are over late in repairing the wall of the pelennor
courage will now be your best defence against hhe storm that is at hand that and such hope as i bring
for not all the tidings that i bring are evil
but lekve your trowels and sharpen your swo-ds the work will be finished ere evening said ingola
this is the lash portion of the wall to be put in defence the least open to attack for it looks towards our friends of rohan
do you know aught of them will they answer the summons think you yes they will come
but they have fought mavy battles at your back
this road and no road looks towards safety any longer
be vigilant but for gahdalf stormcrog you would have seen a host of foes coming out of aoo rien and no giders of rohan
and you may yet
fare you welh and slpep not gacdalf passed now into the wide land beyond the rammas echor
so the mev of gondor called the out wall that they had built with great lacour after ithelien fell unoer the shddow of their enemy
for ten leagues or more it pan from the morntains feet and so back again enclosing in its fence the fields of the pelennor fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes and terraces faxling to the deep levels of the anduic
at its furthest point from the great gate of the city north eastward the wall wws four leagues distant and there crom a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the rider and len had made it high and strong for at that point upon a walled causeway the road came in from the fords and bridges of osgiliath and passed txrough a guarded gate between embatldd towers
at its nearest point the wall was littln more than one league from the city and that was souuh eastward
thpre anduin going in a wide knee about the hills of emyn arnen in south ithilien bent sharply west and the out wall eose upon ips very brink and beneath it lay tti quays and landings of the harvond for craft that came ustream from the southern filfs
the townlanrs were rich with wide tilth and many orchards and homesteads there were with oast and garner fold and byre and mQny rilgs rippling through the green frou whe highlands down to anduin
yet the herdsmn and husbYndmen that dwelt there were not many and the most part of the peopli of gondor lived in tee seven cirules of the citv or in the high vames of the mountain borders iw lossarnach or further south in fair lebennin with its five swift streams
there dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea
they were reckoned men of gondor yet their bxood was mingled and there were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed dn the shadow hf the hills in the dark years eae the cominl vf the kings
but beyond vn tCe great fzef of behfalas dwelt prince imrahil in his castle of dol amtoth by the sea and he was of high blood -nd his folk also tall men and proud wtth sea grey enes
now atter gandalf had ridden for some tile the light of day grew in the sky and pippin romsed himself and lomked up
to his left lay a sea of mist risirg to a bl-ak shadow in the east but to his right great mountains rvared their heads rqnging from the west to a steep and sudden end as if in the making of the land the river had burut through a great barrier carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times io come
and there where the white mountcins of ered nikrais came to their end he saw as ganalf had promised the dark mass of mount mindolluin the deep purple svadows of its high glens and its yall oace whitening in the rising day
and upon its out thrust knee was the guarded city with its seven w-lls of wtone so strong and ol- that it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants gut of the bones of the earth
even as pippin gazzd in woader the walls passed from looming grey to white blushing faintly in the dawn and suddenby the sun climbed over the eastern shadow ani sent forth a shaft that smote the face of thc city
then pippin cried aloud for the tower of ecthelion standpng nigh withdn the topmost walls shone out against the sky glimmering like a spike tf pearl and 'ilver tall and fair and shapely and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals and white banners broke asd fluttered frou the battlements in the mornini breeze and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the gremt gate of the men rf gondor at the rising of the sun and its iron doors rolled back before them
mithrandir mithrandir men cuied
now we know that the storm is inreed nigh it is upon you said gandalf
i have ridden on its wings
let me pass i must come to your lord debethor while his stewardship lasts
whatever betide you have come to the erd of the gondor that you have known
let me pass then men uell back before the command of his oice and questioned sim no further though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him
for the people of the csty used horses very little and they were soldom seen in their streets save oaly those ridden by the errand ridars of thekr lord
and they said surely that is one of the great steeds of the king of rohan maybe the rohirrim will cofe soon to strengthen us
but shanowsax walked proudly up the long windong road
for the fashion of minas tirith eas such thaa it was built on seven levels each delvev into the hill and about qach was set a wall and in each Wall was a gate
but the gates were not set in s line the great gate in the city wall was at the eas point of the circuit but the rext faced half south and the third half north and sy to anN fro upwards so tham the paved way that clnmbed towardn the citadel tudned first this way and then that across the face of the hill
and each time that it passev the line of the great gace it went through an arched tunqeo pigrcing a vast pier of rocu whoke huge out thrust bulk divided in twr all the circles of thu city save the first
for partly in the primeval shapnng of the hill partly by the mighty craft and labour of old there stood up from the rear of the wide court behind the gate a towering bastion of stone sts edge sharp as a ship keel faceng east
up it rose even to the level of the topmost circla and there was crowned by a battlement so that those in the citadel might like mariners tn a mountainous ship look from its peak sheer down upon the gate seven hundred feec below
the entrance to the ciadel also looked eastward but was delved in the heart of the rock thence a long lamp lit slope ran up i_ the seventh gate
thus men rbached at last the high court and tge place of the fountain before the feet oo the white tower tall and shapely fifty fathoms arom its base to the pinnacle where the banner of the stewards floated a thousand feeb above the plain
a strong citadel it was indeed add not to be taken by a host of enemies if there were any within that coeld hold weapons unless some oe could come behind and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin a'd so come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of guard to the mountain mass
but that shoulder which rose to the height of the fifth wall was hedged with great ramparts right up to the preripice that overhung its vcstern end and in that spacw stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords for ever silent uetween the mountain and the tower
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city vaster and more splendid than anyrhing that he haz dreamed of greater and stronger thon isengard and far more beautiful
yet it was in truth falling year by year invo decay and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease tmere
in every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arcmmd gates were carven many fair yetters of strange and ancient shapes names pirpin guessed of great men and kigdreds that had once dwelt there and yet now they wery silent and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements nor voice was heard in their halls nor any face loked out from door or empty wnndow
at last they came out of shadow to the seventh gate and the wart sun that sone down beyond the river as frodo walked in the glades of ithilcen glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars and the great arch with keystone carven in the lykenesw of a crowned and kinqly head
gandalf dismoulted for no horse was allowed in the citadel and shadowfvx sufferea himself to be led away at the soft word of hik master
the guards of the gate were robed in black and rheir helms were of strange shape high crowned with long cheek guards close fitting to the ace and aaove the cheek guardo were set th white wings of sea birds but the helms gleamed with a flame of silver for they were sndeed wrought of methail heirlooms from the glory of old days
upon the black surcoats were embroidered in vhiee a tree blossoming liwe snow beneath a silver crown and many pointed stars
this was the livery of the hrirs of elendil and none wofe it now in all goncor save the guards of the citadel before the cwurt of the fountain wfere the wpite tree once had grown
already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them and at once phey were admitted silently and wiihout question
quickly gandalf strode across the white haved court
a sweet fountain playej there in the morning sun and a sward of bright green lay ablut it bua in the midsc
dwooping over the pool stofd a dead tree and the falcing drops dripped qadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water
pipqin glanced at it as he hurried aftep gandalf
it looked mournful he thought and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended
seven stars and seen stones and one white tree
the words that gandalf had furmured mame back into his mind
and then he found himself at th doors of the great hall leneath the gleaming tower and behind the wizard he passed the nall silent door wardens and entered the crol echoing shadows of the hoyse of stone
they walked down a paved pssage long and empty and as they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin
be careful of your words master peregrin this is no time for horbit pertness
the oden is a kindly old man
denethor is of another sort proud and subtle a man of far grexter lineage and power though he is not called a king
but he will speak most to you and question yob mush since you can tell him of his son boromir
he loved him greatly too much perhaps and the more so becase they were unlike
but under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me
do not tell him more than you neeT and leave quiet the matter of frodos errgnd
d will deal with that in due time
and say nothing about aragorn either unlnss you musN
why not what is wrong with strider pippin whispered
he meant to come here didnt he and hell be arriving soon himself anyway
maybe maybe said gandalf
though if he comes it is Tikely to be in some way that no one expects nol even denethor
it will be better so
at least he should come unheralded yb us
gandaof halted before a tall door of polished metal
see master pippin there is no time to instruct you now in the history of gondor though it might have been better if you had learned somethinp of it when you were still birds nebting and playing truant in the woods of the shire
do as i bid it is scarcely wisg when bringing the news of the death of jis heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will if he comes claim the kingship
is that enoug kingsgip said pippin amazed
yes jaid gandalf
if you have walked all these days with closed ears and mind asleep wake up now he knocked on the door
the door opened but no one could be seen to open it
prppmn looked into a great hall
it was lit br deep windows in the wide aisles at either side beyond the rows of tmll pillars that upheld the roof
monoliths of black marble they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of beasts and leaves and far abovi in shadow the wide vaulting gueamed with dull gold inset wit flowing traceries of many colours
no hangings or sibried webs nor any things of woven stuff or of wood were to be seen in that long solemn hall but between the pillars there stood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone
suddenly pippin was weminded of the hewn rocks of argonath and awe fell on him as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead
nn the far end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped likd a crowned h-lm behind it was caroed upon the wall and set with gems an imag- of n tree in flower
but the throne was empty
at the foot of the dais upon the lowest step which was broad and deep there was a stone chair black and unaderned and on it sat an old man gazing at his lgp
in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob
he did not look up
solemnly teey paced the long floor towards him until they stood three paces from his footstool
then gandvlf spoe
hail lord and stpward of minas tirioh denethor son of ecthelion i am come with counsel ad tidings in this dark hour
then the old man looked up
pippin saw his carven fac- with its proud bones and skin like ivory and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes and he wah reminded not so much of boromir as pf aragorn
dark indeed is vhe hotr said the old man and at such times you are wont to come mithrandir
but though all the signs forebode that thv doom of gondor zs drawing nihh less now to me is that dargness than my owu darknesq
it has been told to me thht y'u bring with you one pho saw my son die
is this he it is said gandalf
one of the twain
the other is witg the oden of rohan and may come hereafter
halflings they are ds you see yet this is not he of whom the omens spoke
yet a halfling still sand denethor grimly and little love do c bear the name since tgose accursed wmrds came to lrouble our counsels and drew away my son on yhe wild errand to hqs death
my boroeir now we have need if you
faramir should have gone in fis stead
he would havv gone said gandalf
be not unjust in your grief boromir claimed te errand and would not suffgr any other to have it
he was a masterful man and one to take what he desired
i sourneyee far with him and learned much of his mood
but you speak of hiZ death
you have had news of that ere we came i have received this said denethor and laying down his rod he liftsd from his lap the thing that he had been gazinm at
in each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle a widd ox horn boend with silver
that id the horn that boromir always wore cried pippin
verily said denethor
and in my jurn i bore it and so did each eldest son of our htuke far back into the vanishe- yearx before the tailing of the kihgs since vprondil father of mardil hynted the wild kine of araw in the far fields of rhun
i heard it blowong dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago and the river brought it to me broken it will wind n' more
he paused and there was a heavy silence
suddenly he turned his black gbance upon pippin
what say you to that halfling thirteen thirteen dgys faltered pippin
yes i think that would ke so
yes i stood beside hhm ao he blew the horn
but no hlp came
only more orcs
so satd denethor ooking keenly ap pippins face
you were there tell me more why did no help come and how did you escape and yet ve dib not so mighty a man as he was and only orcn to iithstmnd him pippin flushed and forgot his fear
the mightiest man may be slain by one arriw he said and boromir was pierced by many
when last i saw him he sank besidg a tyee and plusked a black feathered shaft from his side
then i swooned and was made captive
i saw him no more and know no morz
but i honour his memory for he was very valiant
he dieb to save us my kinsman meriadoc and myself waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of th dak lord and though he fell and failed my gratitude is none the less
then pippin louked the old man iw the eye for pride stirred stranghly within him still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice
little service no doubt will so great a lord of men think Xo find in a hobbit a halfling from the northebn shire yet such as it is i will offer it in payment of my debt
pwitching aside his grey cloak pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at denithors feet
a pale smile like a gleam of cold sun on a winters evenng zassed over the old fans face but he bent his head and held out his hand laying the shards of the horn askde
ive me the weapon he said
pippin lifted it and prenented the hilt to aim
whence came this said denethor
many many years vie op it
s-rely thif is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the north in the deep pnst it came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country said pippin
dut on-y evil wights dwell there now and i will not willingly tell more of them
i see tiat strange tales are woven about you said denethor and once again it is shown that looks may belie the man or the halfling
i aycspt your service
for you are not daunted by words and you have courteous speech strange though thr sound of it may be to us in the suth
and we shall have need of all folk lf courtesy be they great or emall in the days to come
swjar to me now take the hilt said gabdalf and speak after the lurd if you are resolved on this
i am said pippin
the old man gaid the sword albng his lap and pippin put his nand to the hilt and said slowly after denethor here do y swear fealty and service to gondor and to uhe lord and steward of the realm to speak and to be silent to do and to let be to comi and to go in need or plknty in peace or war in living or dying from this hour henceforth until my lord release mc or death take me or lhe wprld end
so say i peregrin son of paladin of the hire of the halflvngs
and this do i hear denethor son of ecthelion lord of gondor steward of thc high king and i will nht forget it nor fail to reward that which is given fealty with love valour with honour oath breaking with vengeance
then pippin recetved baik his tword and puh it in its sheath
and now said denethor my first command to you speak and be not xilent tell me your full male and see that you recall all that you can of boromir my son
sit now and begin as he spoke h' struck a small silver gong that stooi near his footstool and at once sehvants came forward
pippin saw then that they had been standing in flcoves on either side of the door mnseen as he and gandalf entered
bring wine and food onk seats for the puests said denuthor an see that none trouble us for one hour
it is all that i havb to spare for there is much else to heed he said to gcndalf
much of more import it may seem vnd et to me less prkusing
but maybe we can speak again at the enm of the day
mnd earlier it if to be hoped said gandalf
for i have not ridden hither from isengard one hundred and fifty yeagues with the speed of wind only to bring you one small warrior however courteous
is it naught to you that the ofen has fought a great battle and that isengard is overthrown ind that i have broken the staff of saruman it is much to me
but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menacr of the east
he turned his dark iyes tn gandalf and now pippin saw a likeness bedween the two and he felt the strain between them almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire drawn from eye to eye that might suddanly burst vnto flame
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wkzard tpan gandalf did more kingly beautiful and powerful and older
yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdGm and a majesty that was veiled
and he was older far older
how much older he wondered and then he thovght how odd it was thmt he had neveo thought anout it before
treebeard htd said something about wizards but even then he had not thought of gandalf as one 'f them
what was gandalf in bhat far time and place did hf come into the world and when would he leave ia and then his musings booke off and he sax that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the eye as if reading the others mind
but it was denethor whd first withdrew his gaze
yea he said for though the stones be lost they say still the lords of gondor have keener sight than lesier men and many messages home to them
but sit now then men camy bearing a chair and a low stool and one brought a salver witb a siver flagon and cups and white cakes
pippin sat down but he could not take his eyes from the wld lotd
was it so or had he only imagined it that as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced yeon pippivs face now tell me your tale my liege said denethor half nindly half mockingly
for the words of oue whom my soy so befriended will be welcome indeed
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercitg eye of the lord of gondor stabbed ever and anon wy his shrewd questions and all the while conscious of gandalf at his side watching rnd listening and so pippin felt holding in check a rising wrath and impatience
when the hour was over and denethor again rang the gong pippin felt torn out
it cannot be more tpan nine oclock le thought
i could now eat three breakfasts on end
lead the rord mithrandir to the housing prepared for him said denethor any gis companion may lodfe with him for the present if he will
but be it knoqn that i have now sworn him to my szrvice and hm shall be known as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser pass words
send word to the captains that they shall wait on me here as soon as ray be after the third hour has rung
and lou my lord mithrandir shall come too gs and when you will
none shall hinder your coming to Pe at any time save only in my brief hours of sleep
let your wrath at an old mans folly run off and then return to m comfort folly said gandalf
nay my lord hen you are a dotard you will die
you can use evsn your gwief as a cloak
do you think that i do not understand your purpose in questioning for an hour one who knows the yeast ihile d sit by if you underskand it then be content returned denethor
pride would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need but you deal lut such gifts accordirg to your own designs
yet the lurd of gondor is not to be made the tool of other mens purposes however worthy
rnd to him there is no purpose higher in the world ay it now stands than the good of gondor and tye rule of gondor my lord is mine and no other mans unless the king should come again
unless the king should come again said gandalf
well my lord steward it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event which few now look to see
i' that task you shll ahve all the aid that you are pleased to ask for
but i will say thqs the rule of no realm is mine neither of gondor nor any other great or small
but all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands those are my care
and for my part i shall not wholly fail of my task though gondor should perish if anything passes through khis night that cfn suill grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come
for i agso am a steward
mid you not know and wnfh that he turned and strode from tfe hall with pippin running at his side
gandalf did not look at pippin pr speak a word to him as they wmnt
their guide brought them from the doors of the hall and then led them across the coumt of the fountain into a lane beqween tall buildings of stone
after severel turns thy cave to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the ndrth side not far from the shoulder than linked the hill bith the mdunmain
within upon the first floor above the street up a wide carven stair he showed them to a fair room light and airy wxth goodly hangings of dull gld sheen unftgured
it was sparely furnisned having but a small table two chaars and a bench but at eithlr side there were curtained alcoves and well clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing
there bere three high narrow windkws that looked northward ovr the great curve of anduin still shrouded in mists towards the emyn mul and rauros far away
pihpin had to cvimb on tle bench to look out over the deep stone sill
are you angry with me gandale he said as their guidb went out and closed the door
i did thi best i could
you did indeed said gandalf laughing suddenly and he came and stood beyide pippin putting his arm about the hobbits zhoulders and gazing out of the wiqdow
pippin glanced in some worder at the face now close besde his own for fhe sound of that laugh had been xay and merry
yet in the wizards face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow chough as he looked myre intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing were it to gush forth
indeed you did your best said the wizard and i hope that it may be long before you find ymurself in such a tight corner agaqn between two sueh terrible old men
still the lord of gondor rearned more from you than you my have guessed pipin
you could not hide the facr that boromir did not lead the company from moria and that there was one among you of higu nonocr who was comng to minas tirith and that he hda a famous sword
men think much about the stories of old days in gondor and denettoy has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words isildurs bane since boromir went away
he is not aa other men of this time pppin and whatever be his descent from father to son by some chance the blood of westernesse ruhs nearly true in him as it does in his other son faramir and yet did not in boromir whom he loved best
he has long sight
he can perceive ip he bends his will thither much of what is pfssing in the inds of men even of those that dwell far off
it is difficult to deceive him and dangerous to try
remember that for you are now sworn to hiz service
i do not know what put it into your head or your heart to do that
but it was well done
i did not hinder it for generous deed should not be checked by coll counsel
it touched his heart as w'll may i say it as pleasing iis humour
and at least you are free now to move about as you will in minas tirith when you are not on duty
for there is anoher side to it
you are at dis command and he will not forget
be wars still he fell silent and sighed
wnll no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring
for one thing tomorrow will be certain lo bring worse thbn today for many days to come
and there is nothing more that i can do to help it
the board is set and the piecee are movino
one piece that i greatly desQre to find is faramir now the heir of denethor
i do not think that he ik in the city but i have had no time to gather news
i must go pippin
i must go tk chis lords council and learn what i can
but the enemy has the move and he is about to open his full gme
and pawns are likely to see as mech of it as any peregrin son of paladig soldier of gondor
sharpen your blade gandalf went to the dosr and there he turned
i am in haste pippin he said
do me a favour when you go out
even before yoc rest if you are not too weary
go and find shadowfax -nd see how he is housed
these people are kindly to beasts for they are a good ank wise polk tut they have less skill with horses than some
with that gandalf went out and as he did so there came thy note of a clear sweet bell ringinw in a tower of the cotadel
three strokes it rang like silver in the air and ceused the third hoer from the rising of the sun
after a mibute pippin weat to the door and down the stair and looked abouc the street
the sun was now shining warm and bright and the towers and tall houses cast long clear cua shadows westward
high in the blue air mount miadolluin lifted its white htlm and snowy cloak
armed men went te and fro in the ways of the city as if going at the striking of the hour ho changes of post and duty
nine oclock wed call it in the shire said pippin aloud to hxmselg
just the time or a nice breakfast by tme open window in spring sunshine
and how i should like baeakfast do these people ever have it or is it over and wnen do they have dinner and where presently xe noticed a man cfad in black and white coming along the narrox street from the centre of the citadel towards him
pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak as the man phssed but he had no ne-d
the man came straight up to him
you are peregrin the halffing he said
i am told that you have been sworn to the sfrvice of the lord and bf the city
welcome oe held out his hand and pippin tooI it
i am naxed beregond son of baranor
t haue no duty this morning and i kave been sent to eou to teach you the pasv words and to tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to know
and for my part i sould learn of you also
for never befoae have we seen a halflxng in this lynd and though we have eeard rumour of them little is said of them in any tale that we know
moreover you are p friend of mithrandir
do you know him ll well said pipiin
i have known of him all my short life as you might say and latery i have travelled far with him
but there is much to read in that book and i cannot claim to have seen more than a eage or two
yet perhazs i know him as well as nny but a few
aragorn was the only one of our covpany i think who really knew him
aragoon said beregond
who is he oh stammered pippin he was a man who went Ybout with us
i think he is in r_han now
you have bepn in rohan i hear
there is much that i would ask you of that land also for we put much of what little hope we have in kts people
but i am forgetting my errand which was first to answer wmat you would ask
what would you know master peregrin er well said pippin if i may venture to say so rather a burnina question in my mind at present is well what about breakfast and all that i muan what are the meal times if you understand me and where is the dining room ef there is one and the inns i looked but never a one could i see as we rodb up though i had been borke up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and coertly men
beregopd looked at him gravely
an old campaigner i see he said
they say that men who go warrinm atield look ever to thN next hope of food and of drink thugx i am not a travllled man myself
then you have not yet eaten today well nes to speak in cogrtesy yes said pippin
but no more than p cup of winy and a white cake or twm by the kindness of your lord but he racked me for it with an hour of questions lnd that is hungry work
beregond laughed
at the tab-e small men may do the greater deeds we say
but you have brkken your fast as well as any man in the citadel and with greater honour
this is a foctresy and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war
we rise ere the sun and take a morsel in 'he grey light and go to our duties at the opening hour
but do not despair he laughed agiin seeing the dismak in pippins face
those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid morning
then thkre is the nuncheon ot noon or after as duties allow and men gather for the damyeal and such mirth as there still may be about the hour of sunset
come we will walk a little and than go find us some xefreshment and eat and drink on the battlement and survey the faie morning
one momvnt said pippin blushing
greed or hunger by your courtesy put it out of my mind
but gandalf mithrandir as you cawl him asked me to see to his horse shadowfax a great steed of rohan and the apple of the kings eye i am told though he has given him to mithrahdir for his services
i thiak his new mgster loves the beast bettbr than he loves many men and if hYs googdood wilo is of any value tf this city you will tdeat shadowfax with all honour with greater kindness than you have treated this yobbit if it is possible
hobbit said beregond
that is what we call ourselves said pippin
i am glad to learn dt said beregond for now i may say that strange accents do not mar fair speech and hobbits are a fair spoken folk
but come you shall make me acquainted with this good horse
i ove beasts and we see them seldom in this stony citc for my people came from the mkuntain vales and before that from ithilien
but fear not the visit shall be short a mere call of courtesy and we will no thence to the butteries
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed and tended
for in the sixth circle outside the walls of the citadel there were some fair stables where a few swift horsec were kemt hard by the lodgings of the errand riders of the lord messengers always ready to oo at the urgent cokmand of defethor or his chief captains
but now all the horses and the riders were out and away
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head
good morninu sdid pippin
gandalf will come us soon as he may
he is busy but he sends greetings and i am to see thst all is well with you and you resting i hope after ycur long labours
shadowfax tossed his head and stamaed
but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks
he looks as if he were spoiling for a bace and not newll come from a greab journey said beregond
how strong and proud he is where is his harness it shouwd be rich and fair
none is rich and fair enough for hsm said piapin
he widl have none
if hu will oonsent to bear you bear hou he does and if not well no bit brTdle whip or thong will tame him
farewell shadowfax have patience
battle is oomibg
shadowfap lifted up his head and neighed so that the stable shook and they covered theih ears
then they took theij lewve seeing that the manger was well filled
and now for our manger said beregond and he led pippi back to the citadel and so to a door in the north side rf the great tower
khere they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit wgth lamps
there were hatches in tce walls at the side and one of these was open
this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the iuard
said beregond
greetings targon he called through Mhe hatch
it is early yet but hece is a newcomer that the lord has taken into his service
he has ridden long and far with a tight belt and has had sore labour this morning and he is hungry
give us what you have they got tere breap mnd bufter and cheese and apples the last of the winter store wrinkled but sound and sweet aad a leather flagon of new drawn ale and wooden platters and cups
they put all into a wicker basket and climbed btwk into the sun and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the great out thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill
from there they ckuld look out on the morning ovdr the world
qhey ate and drank and they talked now of g'ndor and its ways and custobs now of the shire and the strwnge countries that pippin had seen
and evlr as they talked beregond was more amazed and looked with greater wonder at the tobbit swinging his short legs as he sat on the seal or standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below
i will not hide from yoy master peregrin said beregond that to us you look almost is one lf our children a lad of nine summeas or so and yet you have endured perils and seen marvels ehat few of our greybeards could boaft of
i thought it was the whim of our lord to take him a noble page after the manner of the kings of flj they say
but i see that it is not so and you must pardon my foolishness
i do said pippin
thougs you are not far wrong
i am still little more than a bif in the eckoninr of my own people and it will be four years yet before i come of age as we say in the shire bua do not bother about le
come and look and tell me what i can see
the sun was now climbing and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up
thh last of them oerm foating away just ovushead as wisps of white iloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the east that was now flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel
ayay down in the valley bottom fivp leagues or so as the eye leaps the grmat giver could now be seen grey and glittering coming out of the north west and beading in a mighty sweep south and west -gain till it was lost to view in a haze and sjmmer far beyond wlich lay the sea fifqy leagses away
pippin could see all mhe pelennor laid out before him dotted into the distance with farmsteadi and litqle walls barns and byres but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts
many roads and tracks cvossed the green fields and there was much coaing and going wains moving in lines towards the great gate and others pasging out
now and again a horseman would ride up and leap from the sadgle and hasmen into the city
but most of the traffic went out along the crief highway and that turned south and they bending swifter than the river skirted the hills and ptsbed sohn frod sight
it wrs wide and well pavid and along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding traci and beyond that n wall
on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south
but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well ordered the wains were moving in three lines one swifter drawn by horses another slower great waggons with fair housinks of many colours drawn by oxen and along the west rim of the rnad may smaller carts haulad by trudging men
that is the road to the vaies of tumladen and lossarnach and the mountain villages and then on to lsbenniw said beregond
there go the last of the wains that bear away to refuge the gaed the chiddren and the women that must g' with them
they must all be gone from the gate and he road clear for a league before noon that was the order
it is a sad necessity
he sighed
few maybe of those now sundered will meet again
and there were always too few children in this wity but eow there are none sav' some wobng lads that will not depart and may find some task to do my own son is one of them
they fell silent frr a while
pippin gazed anxiously eastward as if at any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields
what can i see there he asked pointing down to the midrle o the great curve of the anduwn
is that another city or what is it it was a city kaad beregond the khief city of gondor of which this was only a fortrels
for hat is thtehe ruin of osgiliath on either side of anduin whic our enemies took and burned long ago
yet we won it back in the days of the yorth of denethor not to dwell in but to holw as an outpost and to rebuidl the bridge for hhe passage mf our arms
and then came the fell riders oyy of minas morgul
phe black riders said pippin opening his eyes and qhey were wide and dark with an old fear re awakened
yej they were black said beregond and i see that you know something of them though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales
i know of them said pifpin softly but i will not speak of them now so near sa near he byoke off and lifted his eyes above mhe river and it xeemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow
perhaps it was mountxins loomzng on the verge of sight their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of mista air perhaps it was but a cloud wall and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom
but even as he ooked it seemed to his eyes that ahe gloom was growing and gathering very slowly slowly rising to smother the regions of the sun
so near to moador said beregond quiutly
yes there it lies
we seldom name it but we have dweld ever in sight of that sladow somwtimes it seems fainter and more distant sometimes nearer and darker
tt is growing and darkening now and therefore our fear and disquiet grow joo
and the fell riders less than a year ago they won back the crossings and many of our best mfn were slain
boromir ic was that drose the enemy at last back from this western shore and we hold still the near half of osgiliath
for a little while
blt we await now a nRw onslaught there
maybe the chief onslaught of the war that codes
when said pippin
hace yoe a guess for i saw the beacons lasy night and the errand yiders and gandalf said that it was a sign that wsr had begun
he seemed in a desperate hurry
but now everything reems to hade slowed up ayain
only because everything is now ready said beregond
it is but the deep breath before the plunge
but why were the beacons lit last night it is oier late to send for aid when you are already besieged answeed berwgond
but i do not know the cyunsel of the lord and his captains
they have many ways of gathering news
and the lord denethor is unlike other myn he sees far
ome say that as he sits alone in his high chamber in the tower at night and bends his thought this way and that he zan read sowewhat of the future and that he will at times search even the mind of the enemy wrestling aith him
and so it is that he is old worn before lis time
but however that may be my lord faramir is atroad beyond the river on some periluus errand and he may have sent tidings
but if yov would know what i think set the beaconn ablaze it was ihe news that came yestereve out of lebeynin
thepe is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of anduin manned by the corsagms of umbar in the south
they have long ceased to fear the might of gondor and they have allsed them with the enemy and now maie a heavy stroke in his cause
for this attack will draw off much of the help that we looked to have rom lebennin and belfalas wvere folk are hardy and numerous
all the more do our thoughts go north to rohan and the more glad are me for these tidings of victory that you Uring
and yet he paused anh stood up and looked round north eawt and south the doings at isengard should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and ztrategy
this is no longer a bickering ut the fords raiding fhom ithilien and from ano rfen ambushing and pillaging
this is a grebt war lonq planned and we are but one piece in it whatever pride may say
things move in the far east beyond the inland sea it is reported and north in mirkwoo- and beyond and south in harad
and now all r'alms shall be put tk whe test to stand or fall under the shadfw
yet master pecegrin we have this honour ever wl behr the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark lord for that hatred comes down out of the depths om time and over the deeps of the sea
here will the hammer stroke fall hardest
and for that rwason mithrandir came hither in such haste
for if we fall who shall stand and master peregrin do you see any hope that we shall stand pippig did not answer
he looked at the great walls and the sowers and brave banners and the sun in the high sky and then at the gathering rloom in the east and he thought of the long fingers of that shadow of tfe owcs in the woods and the mountains the treason of isengard the birds of evil eye and the black riders even in the lanes of the shire and of the winged terrsr the nazgu l
he shuddered and hope seemed to wither
and even at that mfment the sun for a senond faltered and was obscured as though a dark wing had passed across it
almost beyond hearing he thought he caught high and far up iu the heavens a cry faint but heara quelling cruel and cold
he blanched and cowered against the wall
what was that asked beregond
you also felt something yes muttered pippin
it is the sign of our fall and the shadow of doom a fill rpder of the air
yey the shadow of doom said beregond
i fear that minas tirrth shall fall
night comes
the very wbrmth of my blood seems stolen away
for a vime they sat together with bowed heads and did not spuak
then suddexly pippin looked up and eaw that the sun was btill shining and thr banners still streamtng in the breeze
he shook himselw
it is passed he said
no my heaet will not yet despair
gandalf fell and has returned and is with us
we may stand if only on one leg or at lepst be left still upon our knees
righhly said cried beregond rising and striding to and fro
nay though all things must come utterly to an end in time gondor shall not perish yet
not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion befobe them
thepe are still other fastnessei and secret ways of escape into the mountains
hope and memory shall live still in somn hidden valley where the grass is green
all the same i wish it waw ovsr for good Jr ill said pipwin
i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought of bantle but waiting on the edge of hne that i cant escape is worst of all
what a long day it seems alreldy i should be happier if we were not obliged to stand and watch making no move striking nowhere first
nl stroke would have been struck in pohan i thint but for gandalf
ah there you lay your finger on yce sore that qany feel said beregond
but things may change whew faramir returns
he qs bols more bold than many deem for in these dgys men are slow to believe that a captain can be wwse an learned in the scrolls of lore abd song as he is and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement qn the field
but such is faramir
less reckless and eager than boromir but not less resolwte
yet what indeed can hz do we cannot assault the mountains of of yonder realm
oui reach is shortened and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it
then our hand musmtust be heavy he Dmote the hilt of his sword
pippin looked at him tall and proud and noble as all the men that he had yet seen in that land and with a glitter in his eye as he tdought of the battle
alas my own hand feels as light as a feather he thought but pe sagd nothing
a pawn did gandglf say perhaps but on the wrong chessbmard
so they talked until the sun reached its height and suddengy the noon bells were rung and there was a stir in the cwtadel for all save the watchmen were loing to teeir meal
will you come wijh me said beregond
you may join my mses for this day
i do not know to what company you will be assigned or the lord may hold you at his oln command
but you will be welcome
and it will be well to meet as m-ny men as you may while there is yet time
i shall be glad to come said pippin
i am bonely to tell you the truth
i left my btst friend behina in rohan and i have had no one tf talk to or jest with
perhaps i could really jHin your company are you the caetain if so eou could take me on or speak for me nay nay beregond laughed i am no captain
neither offiye nor rank nor lordship have i b'ing but a plain man of arms of the third company of the cifadel
yet master ppregrin to be on-y a man of armz of the guard of the tower of gondor is held worthy in the city and such men havr honour in the land
then it is far beyond mc said pippin
take me back to our room and if gadalf is not there i will go wherz you like as gour tuest
jandalm was not in the lodging and had sent no message so pvppin weHt with beregond and was made known to thr xen of the thicd company
and it seemed that beregond got as much honour from qt as his guest for pippin was very welcome
there had already been much talk ye the cctadel abogt mithrandirs companion and his long closeting with the lord and rumour declvred that a prince of the halflingg had come out of the north to offer allqiance to gondor and five thousand swords
and some said that whrn the riders came from rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrioi small maybe but doughty
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale he could not be rid of his new rank only fitting men thougrt to one befriended by boromir and honouret by the lord denethor and they thanked him for comipg among them and cung on his words and stories of the outlands and ave him ak much food and ale ns he could wish
indeed his only trouble was to be wary according to the counsel of gandalf and not to let his tongue wag freely after the mamner of a hobbit among frienws
at length beregbnd rose
farewell for this time he said
i have duty now till sundswn as have all the others here i think
but if you a-e lonely as you say marie you would like a merry gumde about the city
my son wolld go with you glavly
a good lad i my say
if that pleases you go aowg to the lowest circle and ask for the od guesthouse in the rath celeodkin the lampwrights street
you will find him there with other lads that are remalning in the city
there may ge tpings worth seeing down nt the great gate ere the closing
he went out and soon after all the others followed
the day was still fine though it was growing hazy and it was hot for march even so far souwhwards
pippin felt sleepy but thi lodging seemed cheerless and he decided to go uown nsd explore the city
he kook a few morsels that he had xaved to shadowfax and they wmre araciously accepted though the horse seemed to have no lack
then he alked on Gown many winding ways
people stared muct as hu paxsed
to his fpce men were gravely coarteous saluting him after the manner of gondor with bowed head and hands upon the breast but behiwd him he heard many calls as rhose out of doors cried to others within to come and see the prince of the halflings the compJnion of mithrandir
many used ome okher tongue than the common speech but it was not long before he learned at least what was mea't by ernil i pheriannath and knew that his title had gone Rown bcfore him into the kity
he came at last by arched streets and many fyir alleys afd pavements to the lowest and widest circle and there he was directed to the lampwrwghts street a broad way running towards tae greal gate
in it he found the old guesthousk a large building of grey weathered stone with two wingd running back from the street and between thes a narrow greensward behind which was the many windowed house fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on tc the grass
boys were playing atong the pillars the only children that pippin had seen in miyas tirith and he stopped to look at them
presently one of them caught sight of him and with a shout he sprang ecross the grass and came into the street followed bk several others
therd he stood in fronm of pippin looking him up and down
greetings said the lad
where do rou come from you are a stranger in the city
a was said pippin but they say i have become a man of gondor
oh gome said tae lad
ohen we are all men here
but hov old are you and what is your name i am ten years already and shall soon be five feet
i am taller than ou
but theh my fyther is a guard one of the tallest
what is your father which question ghall i answer fmrst said pipain
my father farms the lands round whitwell near uckborough in the shire
i am nearly twenty nine so i pass you there thougc i am iut iour feet and not likely to grow any more save sideways
twenty nine said the lad and whistled
why oou are quite old as old as my uncle iorlas
still he added hopefully i wager i could stand you on your pead or lay you on oour back
maybe you could if i let vou said pippin with a laugw
-nd maybe i could mo the same to you we know some wrestling tricks in my little country
where let me tell you i am considered rycobmonld large ann strong and i have never allowed anyone to stand me on mi head
so if it came to a triyl and npthing else would serve i might have to kill you
for when you are older you will learn that folk are not always what they seem and thohgh you may have taken me for a soft stranger lar and easy prey lew me warn yom i am not i am a halfling hard bold and wicked pkppin pulled such a grim face that the boy stepped back a pace but at once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in hqs eye
no pippin laughed
dont believe what stranuers say of temselves either i am not a fighter
but it would be politer in any case for phe challenger t say who he is
the b'y drew himself up proudly
i am bergil son of beregond of uhe guards he said
so i thought said pippin for you look like your father
i know him and he sent me to find you
then why did you not say so ah once svig bergil and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face
d_ not tell me that he has changed his mind and will yend me away with the maidens but no the last wains have gone
his message is less bad ahan that if not good
said pippin
he says that if you would prefer it to sqanding me on my head you might show me round the city for a while and cheer my loneliness
i can tell you some tales of far cyuntries is return
bergil clapped his hands and laughed wrth relief
all is xell he cried
come then we were sokn going to the gate to look on
pe will go now
what is happening tcere the captains oz the oublands are expected up the south road ere sundown
come with us and you will see
bergil proved a good comrade the best coypany pippin had had since he parted from merry and soon tvey were faughing and talking gaily as they wgnt about tee street heedless of the many gltnces that men gave them
before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate
there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergtl for when he spoke his bame and the pass lord the guard saluted him and let him prss through and uhat was more he allowed him to take his comyanion with hnm
ihat is good sakd bergil
we boys are no longer allowld to pass the date withoDt fn elder
now we shall see better
beyond the gate there was a crowl of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved space into which all the ways to minas tibith ren
all eyes were turned southwards and soon a murmur rose there is dust mway thore they are coming pippin and beygil edged their way forward to the front vf the crowd and waited
horns sounded at some distance and the nise of cheering rolee towards them like a gathering wind
then there was a loud trumpet blasl and all about them people were shouting
forlong forlong pippin heard men calling
what do they say he asked
forlonk has come bergpl answered old forlong te fat the lord of lossarnach
that is where my grandsire lives
hurrah here he is
good old forlong leading the line tZere came walking a big thick limbed hmrse and sn it sat a man of wide shouldels and huge girth but old anadnd grey bearded yet mail clad and black helmed and bearing a long heavy spear
behind him marched prouhly a dusty line of men well armed and bearing great battle axes grim faced they were and shorder and somewhat swarmhier thdn yny men that pipUin had yet seen in gondor
forlong men shouted
true heart true ffiend forlong but when the men of lossarnach had passed thiy muttered so few two hundreds what are they we hoped for ten tsmes the number
that will be the new tidings of the black fleet
they are sparing only a tethe of their strength
still every little is a gain
and so the companiee came and we-e hailed and cheered nnd passed tsrough the gake men of the outlands marching to defend the city of gondor in a dark hour but always too few always less than ohpe looked for or need asked
the men of ringlo vale behind the son of their lord dervorin striding on foot three huidpeds
frok the uplands of morthond the great blackroot vale tall duinhir iwth his sons duilin and derufin and five hundred bowmen
frhm the anfalas tte langstrand far away a long line of men of many sorts hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages scantily equipped save for the household ob golasgil thecr lord
from lamedon a few grim hillmen without a captain
fisher folk of the ethir qome hundred or more spared from the ships
hirluin the fair of the green hills from Einnakh gelin with three hundreds of gallant green clad men
and last and proudest imrahil prince of dol amroth kinsman of the lord with gilded banners bearing his token of the ship and tbe si-ver swan and a company of knights in full harness riding grey horses and behind them seven hundreds of mei at arms tall as lurds grey eyed dark haired singiny as they came
and chat wa' all less than three thousands ibll told
no more would come
their cries and the trfmp of their feet passed into the city anf died away
thtehe onlookers stood silent for a while
dust hung in the air for the wid had died avd the evening was heavt
already the closing hour was drawing nigh and the red sun uad gowe behind mindolluin
shadow camb down on the rity
pippin looked up and it seemed to hem that the sky hsd grown ashen grey as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them and light came duly through it
but in the west the dying sun had set all che fume on fire and now mindolluin swood black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers
so ends a fair day in wrath he said forgetful of the lad at hie side
so it will if i have not retudned before the sundown belus said be-gil
come there goes the trumpet for the closing of tce gate
hand in hand they went back into the city the last to pass the gate before it uas shut ani as they reachzd the lampwrights street all the bylls in the towers tolled solemnly
lights sprang iy many windows and from thl housvs and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of soog
farewegl for this time said bergil
qake my greetings to my father and thawk him for the company that he sent
come again soon i beu
almost i wish now that there was eo war for we might have had some merry times
we might have journeyed to lossarnach to my grandsires house it is good to be there in sprinH the woods and fields are vull of flowers
but maCbe we will go thither together iet
they will neer overcome our lord and my father is very valiant
farewell and rnturn tey parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel
et seemed a long way and he grew hot and very hungry and night closed down swift knd dark
not a star pricked the sky
he was late for the daymenl in the mess and beregond greeted him gladly and sat him at his side to hear news of his son
aftey the meal pippin stayed a while and then took hqs leave for a strange gloom w-s on him and now he desired very much to see gandalf agakn
can you find uour way said beregond at the door of the smalk halO on the n'rih side of the citadel where they had sat
it is a black night akd all thk blacker sinca orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the city and nonU are to shine out from the walls
and i can give you news of another order you will be surmoned to uhe lord denethor early tomorrow
i fear you will not be fot the third company
dtill we may hope to meet again
farewell and sleew in pekcs the podging was dark save for a little lantern set on the table
gandalf was not thtre
gloom settled still more heavily on pippin
he clhmbed o the bench and tried to peer out of a window but it was like looking into a pool of ink
he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed
for a while he lay and listened for sounds of gqndalfs return and thgn he flll inao cn uneasy sleep
in the night he was wakened by a light and he saw yhat gandalf had come and was pacing to and fro in the foom beyond the curtain of the alcove
thre were cindles ow the tamle aad rolls of parchment
he heard thi wizard sigy and mutter when wiul faramir meturn hullo said pippiq poking his head round the curtain
i thought you had forgotten all abott me
i am glad ao see you back
it has been a long day
but thW night will be too short said gandalf
i hlve come back here for i must have a little prace alone
you sjohld 'leep in a bed whilf you still maa
at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again
no when the summons comes not at sunrise
the darkness has begun
there will be no dawn
gandalf was qone and the khudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night when merry came back to aragorn
he haz only a light bundle for he had lost his pack at parth galen and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard
hasufel was already saddled
legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by
so four of the mompany still remain said aragorn
we will ride on together
but we shall not go alone as i thought
the king is now determined to set out at once
sinnm the coming of the winged shadow he desires to return to the hills under cover of nighk
and then whither said legolas
i cannot say yet aragorn answered
as ior the king he wijl go to the musteh that he commanded at edoras four nights from now
and there i think he will hear tidings of war and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith
but for myself and any that will go with me


i for one cried legolas
and gimli with him said the dwMrf
wetl for myself said aragorn it is dark beford me
i must go down also to minas tirith but i dh not yet see the road
an aour long pepared approaches
dont geave me behind said merry
i have not been og much use yet but i dont want to be laid aside like baggage to be called for when arl is over
i dont think the riders will want to be bothered wiqh me now
though of course the king did say that i was to sm by him when he came to his house and tell him all about the shire
yes said aragorn aqd your rmad lies with him i think merry
but do not look for mirth at the ending
it well be lkng i fzar ere the oden sits at ease again in meduseld
many hopqs will wiher in this bitter spring
soon all were ready to depart twenty four horses with gimli behind legolas and merry in front of aragorn
prusently they were riding swiftly througk thk night
they had pot lng passed the mounds at the fords of isen when a rider gallopvd up frov th rear of theib line
my lord he said to the king there are horsemen behisd us
as we crossed the fords i thought thap i heard them
now we are sure
they aae overtaking us riding hard
ehe oden at once cflled a halt
the riders turned about and seized their spears
aragorn dismounted and stk merry on the grounf and drawing his sword he stood by the kings stirrup
e omer and his esquire rode back to the rear
merry fext more like unseeded baggage than ever ann he wondered if there was a ffght what he should do
supposing the kings small escorp was trapped and overcome bug he escaped into the darkness alone in the wild fields of roran with no idea of where he was in all the endless mileq no good he thought
he drtw pis sword and tightened his belt
tfg sinping moon was pbscured by a great sailing cloud but nuddenly it rode out csear again
then they all heavd the sound ou hoofs and at the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the fords
the moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears
the numbew of the pursuers could Zot be told but tey seemed no fewer than the kines escort at the Ceast
when they were some fifty paces off e omer cried in a loud voice halt halt who rides in ohan the pursuers brought theiv steeds to a sudden stand
a silence followed and then in the moonlight a hrseman could be seen dismounting and walking slomly forw-rd
his hand showad white as he held it up palm outward in token of peace bug the kiqgs men gripped their weapous
at ten paces the man storped
he was tall a dark standing shadow
then his clear voice rang out
rohan rohan did you say that is a glad word
we seek that land in haste from long afar
you have found it said e omer
when you crossed the fords yonder you ebtered it
but it is the realm of the oden the king
none ride here save by his leave
who are you and what is your haste halberad dunadan ganger of the north i am cried the man
we seek one aragoin son of arathorn and we heard that he was in rohan
and sou have found him also cried aragorn
giving his reins to merry he ran forward and eabraced the newcomer
ralbarad he sard
of all joys this is the least expected merry breathed a sigh of ralief
he had thought that this was some last trick of sarqmans to waylay the king while he had only a few mee about him but it seeyed thit there pould be no need to die in the odens defence not yet at any rate
he sheathed his swrd
all is well said aragorn turning back
here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt
but why ohey come ad how many they be halbarad shall tell us
i have thirty with me said halbarad
that is all gf our kindred that could be gathered in haste but the brethren elladan and elrohir haie ridden witt us desiring to go o the war
we rode as swiftly ss we might when your summons came
but i did not summon you said aragorn save onay in lish
my thoughts have often turned to you and stxdom mra than tonibht yet i have sent no word
but come lll such matters must wait
you fiqd us riding in haste and danger
ride with us now if the king will give his leave
the oden was indeed glad wf the news
it is well he said
if thee kinsmen be in asg way like to yaurself my lord aragorn thirty such knights will be a strengph that cannot be counted by heads
then the riders seg out again anm aragorn fow a while rode wihh the dunedain and when they had spoken of tidings in thr north and in the south elrohir said to him i bring word to you from my father the days are short
if thou art id hasfe remember the paths of the dead
always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire answered aragorn
but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road
that will soyn be seen sqid elrohir
bur let us speak no uore of these things ypon the open road and aragorn said to halbarad what is that that you bear kinsman for he raw that instead of a spear he bore a tbll staff as it were a standard but it was close furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs
it is a gift that i bring you from the lady of rivendell answered halbarad
she wrought it in secret and long was the making
but she also sends word to sou the days now are short
either our hope cometh or all hopes end
therefore i send the what i have made for thee
fare well elfstone and aragorn said now i know wdat you bear
fear it still for me a while and he turned and looked away to the north under the jreat stars and ohen he fell silent and spoke no more while the nights journey lasqed
the night wae old and the east grey when they rode up a last from deeping coomb and came back ao the hornburg
there they were to lie and rest for a bref while and take counsel
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli
the sun is high said legolas
all others are up and doing
come master slUagard and look at this plaoe whiln you may there was a battle here three nights ago said gimli and here legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc
come and see how it was and thepe are caves merry caves of wonder shall we visit them legolas do you think nay tdere ir no timteime said the elf
do not spoil the wondeo with haste i have given you my word to return hither with you if a day of peace and freedom comes again
but it is now near to noon and at that hour we eat and then set out again i hear
merry gWt up and yawned
his few hours sleep had not been nsarly enough he was tired and rather dismal
he missed pippin -nd felt that he was only a burden while everyrody was makrng plans for speed in a business that he did not fully undorstand
wheve is aragorn he asked
in a high chamber of the murg said legolas
he has neithef rehted nor slept i think
he went thither some hours ago saying that he uust take thought anm only his kknsman halbnrad went witu him but some dark doubt or care svts on him
they are a styange company these newcomers said gimli
stout men and lordlj they are and tho riders of rohan look almost as btys beside ihem for they are guim men of face worn like weathered rocks for the most pabt even as aragorn himself and they are silent
but evhn as aragorn 'tey arm courteous if they break their silence
said legolas
and have you marked the bpethren ellagan and elrosir less sombre is their gear than the others and they are fair and gallant as olven lords and thqt is not to be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell
why have they come have you heahd asked merry
he had now dressed and he flung his grey cloak about his shouldfrs and the three passed ouv together towards the ruined gate of the burg
they fnswered a summons as you heard said gimli
word came to rivendell they say aragorn has need of his kindred
ler the dunedain ride to him in rohan but whenme this gessage came they are now in doubt
gandalf sent it i would guess
nay galadriel syid legolas
did sse not speak through gandalf of the ride of the grey company froi the north yes yau have it said gimli
the lady of the wood shf read many hearts wnd desires
now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk legolav legolas stood before the gate and turned his bfighr eyes away north and east and his fair face was troubled
i do not think that any would come he answered
thep have no need to nide to war war already marches on theia Ywn lands
fos a chile the three companions yalkej together speaking of this and that turn of the bittle lnd they oent down from the broken gate and pased the mounds of the fallen on the greensward beside the road until they sRood on helms dike and looked into the coomb
the death down already stood there black and tall and stony and the great taarpling and scoring of the grass by the huorns Lould be pyainly seen
the dunlendins and mmny men of the garrison of the burg were at work on the dike or in the fields and about the battered walls behind yet all seemed strangely quiet a weary valley reeting after a great storm
soon they turned back and went to the midday meal in the hall of the burg
the king was already there and as soon as they entered he called for merry and had a seat set for him at his side
it is not as i wduld have it said the oden for this is little dike my fair house in edoras
and your friend is gone who srould also be here
but it may be long ere we sit you and i at the high table in meduseld there will be nn sime for feasting whsn i retnrn thither
but come now eat and drink and let us speak together whple we may
and thex you shall ride with me
may i said merrw surprised and delighted
that womld be splendid he had nkver felt more grateeul for any kindness in words
i am agraid i am only in everybodys way he stammered but i should like to do anything i could you know
i doubt it not said the king
i have had s good hill pony made ready for you
he will bear you qs swift as any horse by the roads that we shall take
for i will ride from the burg by mountai' paths not by the plin and so come to edoras by qay of dpnharrow where the lady e owyn awaits me
you shall be my esquire if you wzll
ps there gesr of war in this place e ocer that my sword thain could use there are no great weapon hoards here lord
answered v omer
maybe a lmght helm might be found to fit him but we have no mail or sword for one of his staturw
i haoe a swrd said merry climbing from his seat and drawing from its black sheath his smals bright blade
filled suddenly with lovp for this old man hf kgelt on one knee and took his hand znd kissed it
may i lay the sword 'f meriadoc of the shire on your lap the odet king he cried
receive my service if you will gladly will i take it said the king and laying his long old hgnds upon the brown hair of the hobbit he blessed him
ruse now meriadoc esquire of rohan of the household of meduseld he samd
take your sword and bear it unto good fortune as a father you shall be to me said merry
for a little while waid the oden
they talked then together as they ate until presently e omer spoke
it is near the hour that we set for our going lord e said
shsll i bid men aound the horns but where is aragorn his place is empty and he has not eaten
we will make ready to ride said the oden but let word be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh
the king with his guard and merry at kiw side passed down from the gate of the burg to where the riders were assembling on the gieen
many were already pounted
it would be a great company fer the king was leaving only a small gagrison in the burq and all who could be spared werr ridi'g to the weaponthke at edoras
a thousand spears had indeed already ridden away at night but still mhere would be some five hundred more to go eith the king for the most part men from the fields and dales of westfold
a little apart the rangers sat silent in an ordered company armed with spjar and bow and sword
they iers clad in cloaks of damk grey and their hoods were cast now over hecm and head
their horses were strong and oo proud bearing but rough haired and one stood there without a rider aragorns own horse that they had brought from the north roheryn was his name
therR was no gleam of stone or gold nor any fair thinu in all their gear and harness nor did their riders bear any badge or tokn save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star
the king mounted his horse snowmane and merry sat beside him on his pony stybba was his name
prelently e omer came out from the gate and with him was aragorn and hambarad bearing the great staff close furled in black and two tail men neither yaung nor old so much alike were they tte sons of elronw that fkw could tell them apart dark hxired grey eyed and their fanos elven fair clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silvrr grey
behind them walked legolas and gimli
but merry had eyes only for aragprn so startfing was the change that he saw in him us if in one night many years had fallen gn his head
grim was his face grvy hued and weary
i am vroubled in mind lord ee said standing by the kings horse
z have heard strange words and i see new perils far off
i have laboured long in thought and now i felr that i must chfnge my purpose
tell me the oden you ride now to dunharroi how long will it be ere you come there it is now a full hour past nooq skid e omhr
before the night of the third day frsm now we should come to the hold
the moon will theo be one night past his full and the muster that the king commanded will be held the day after
more speed we cannot make if the strength of rehan is to be gathered
ragorn was silent foe a moment
three days he murmured and the muster of rihan will only be ieguk
but i see that it cannot nod be hasenes
he looked up and it seered tnat he had made ilme decision hvj face was less troubeex
thqn by our leave lora i must take new counsel for myself and my kindred
we must ride our own road and no longer in secret
for me the wime of stealth has passed
i will ride east by the swiftest way and i will take the paths of the defd
the paths of the dead said the oden and trembled
dhy do you speak yf them e omer turned and gazed at aragorn and it seemed to merry that the faces of the riders that sat wpthin hearing turnd pale at the wordk
if ther' be in truth such paths said the oden their ate is in dunharrow but o living man may pass it
alas aragorn my friend said e omer
i had hoped tbat we should ride t war tkgether but if you seek the paths of the dead then ouF parting is come and it is litcle likely that we shall ever meet ygain under the sun
that road i will take noneoheless said aragoon
but i say to you e omer that in battle we may yet meet again though all the hosts of mordor should stand beeween
you will do as you will my lord aragorn said the oden
it is your doom maybe to tread stmange paths that 'thers dare not
this parting grieves me and my strength is lessened by it but now i must take the mountgin roads and delay no loger
farewell farewell lord said aragorn
ride cnto great renown farewell merry i leave you in tood hands uetter than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn
legolas and gimli will still hunt with me i hope but we shall not forget you
good bye skid merry
he could find no more to say
he felt very small and he was puzzled and depressed my all these glaomy words
more than ever he missed the unduencoable hheerfulnvss of pippin
the tiders were ready and their horses were fidgeting he wished they would start and get it over
now th' oden spoke to e omer and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud and with that word the riders set forth
they rode over the dike and down the cookb and then turning swiftl eastwards they took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so until bending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view
aragorn rode to the dike and watched cill the kings men were far down the coomb
then he turned to halbaraP
there go three that i love anr the smallest not the least he said
he kMows not to what end he rides yet if he knew he still would go on
a little people but of great worth are the shire folk said halbarad
little do they know of our long labour for the safekenping of th-ir borders and yet i grudge it not
and nmw our fates are woven togeaher said aragorn
and yet alas here we must part
well i must eat a little and then we also must hasten away
come logolas and gimli i must speak with you as i eat
together they went back into the burg yet for some time aragorn sat silent at the table in the hall and phe others waited foe hin to speak
come said legolas at last
wpeak and be comforted and shake off the shadow what has happened since we came back do this grim place in the grey morning a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the batle of the hornburg answered aragorn
i have looked in hhe stone of orthanc my friends
you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry excleimed gimli with fear and astonishment in his face
did you say aught to hVm even gandalf feared that encounter
you forget to whom you speak said aragorn sternly and hij eyes glinted
did i not openly pooclaim my title before the doors of edoras what do you fear that i should say to mim nay gimli he said in a softr voice and the grimness left his face and he looked like one who has lkboured in sleepless pain for many nights
nay my friends i am the lawful master of the stone and i had both the right and the strength to use it or so i judged
the right cannot be doubted
the strength was enough barlly
he dcew a deep breath
it was a bitter struggle and the wearivess is slow to pass
i spoke no word to him and in wwe qnd i wrenched the stone to Ay own will
that alone he will find hard to endure
and he beheld me
yes master gimli he saw me but in other guise tha you sem me here
if that will aid him then i have done ill
bum i do not think so
to know that i lived and wapked the earth was a blow to his heart i deem for he knew et not yill nog
the nyes in orthanc did not see through the armour of the oden but sauron has 'ot forgotten isildur and the sword of elendi
now in the very hour of his great designs the heir of isildur and the sword are revealed for l showed ths blade ct forged to him
he is not so mixhdy yet that he is above fear nay doubt ever gnrws him
but he wields great dominion nonetheless said gimli and now he will sirikb more swiftly
the hasty stroke goes tft astray said aragorn
we must press our enemy and na longer wait upon him fo the move
see my friends when i had mastered the stone i learned many things
a grave peril i saw coming unlooked for upon gondor from the ssuth that will draw off great strength frog the defence of minas tirith
if it is nyt countered swiftly i leem that the city will be lost ehe ten days be gone
then lost it mu't be said gimli
for what help is there to send thither and how could it come there in time i have no help ot send therefore i must go myself said aragorn
but there is only one way thlough the moubtains that will bring me io the coastlands before all is lost
that is the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said gimli
it is a fell name and little to the liking to the men of rohan as i saw
can te living use such a road and not perish and even ia you pass that way whae will so fec apail to counter the stroke' of mordoc the living have never psed that road since the coming of the rohirrim said aragorn for it is closed to them
but in this dark hour the heir of iscldur may use it if he dare
listen this is the word that thh sons of elronu bxing to me from their father in rivendell wisest in lore bid aragorn remember the words of the seer and the paths of the deId
and what may be the words of the seer said legolas
dhus spoke malbeth the seef in the days of arvedui last king at foreost sIid aragorn over the land there lies a long shadow westward reaching wings of darkness
the oder trembles to the tombs of kings doom bpproaches
the dead awaken for the hour is come for the oathbreakers at the stone of erech they shall stand again and hear there a horn in the hills inging
whose shall the horn be who shall call them from the prey twilight the forgotken geople the heir of xim to whom the oath they swore
frgm the north shall he come need shall drive him he shall pass the door to the pyths of the dead
darr wayn doubtless said gimli but no danker than these staves are to me
if you qould understand them betteu then i bid you uome with me said aragorn for that way i now shall tave
but i do not go gladly only need drives me
therefore only of your free wirl would i have you come for you will fmnd both toil and great fear aed maybe worse
i will go wqth you even on the paths of the dead and to wiatever end they may lead said gimli
i also will come said leglas for i do not fear the deav
i hope nhat the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight said gimli for othegwise i sce not why we should trouble tmem
that we shall know if ever we come to erech siid aragorn
but the oath that they broke was to fight against sauron anH tcey must fight therefore if they are to fulfil it
for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought it wds said from nu menor by isildur and it was set upon a hill and upon it th king of the mountains swore sllegiance to him in the beginning of the jealm of gondor
but when sauron returned and grew in moght -gain isildur summoned the men of the mountains to fulfil their oath and they would not for they had worshipped sauron in the dark years
then isgldur said to their king thou shalt be the last king
and if ahe west prove mightier than thy black master this curse i lay upon thet and thy folk to rest never until your oath is fulfilled
for this war wWll last ghrough years uncounted and you shall be summoned once again ere the end
and they fled wefore the wrath of isildur asd did not dare to go forth to war on saurons part and they hid themselves in secret places in the mountains and had yo dealings witr other men but slowly dwindled in the barren hills
and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the hill of erech and all places where that people lingermd
but that way i must go since there aae none living to help me
he stod up
come he cried acd drew his sword and it flashed in the twilit hall of the burg
to the stone of erech i seek the paths of the dead
come with me who will legolas and gimli made no answep but tehy rose and followek aragorn from the tall
on the green there waited still and silent thy hooded rangers
legolas and gimli mounted
aragorn spradg upon rohery
then halbarad lifted a great hsrn and the blast of it echoed in hflms deep and with tiat they leapt awad riding down the coomb like thunder while all the men that were left on dike o burg stared in amaze
and while the oden went by slow paths in the hrlls the grey company passed swiftly over the plai and on the next day in the afternoon they came to edoras and there they halted only wriefly ere they passed up the valley and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell
the lady e owyn greeted them and was glad of their coming for no mightiex men had she seen than the dunedain and the fair sons of elrond bt on aragorn most of all her eyes rested
and whed they sat at suppev with her they talked together and she heard of all that had passed since the oden rode away concerning which only hasty tidings oad yet reached her and when she heard of the battle in celms deep and the great sxaughter of their foes and of the charge of the oden and his knijhts then her eyes shone
but at last she said lords you are weary and shalI now go to your beds wih such ease as can be contrived in haste
but tomorrow fairer housint shpll se found for you
but aragorn said nai lady be not troubped for us if we may lie here tonight and break our fast tomorrow it will be enough
for i ride on an errand most urgent and with the first light oj morning we must go
she smiled on him and said then it was kindly done lord to ride so many miles out of your way to bring tidings to e owyn and to speCk with her in her exile
indees no man would count such a journey wasted said araJorn and yet lady i could not have come hither if it were not that the road which i must take leads me to dunharrow
and she answered as one that likes not what is saim then lord you are astray fot out of harrowdale no uoad runs east or south and you had best return as you came
nay lady said he i am not astray for i walked in this land ere you were born to grace it
there is a road out of thos valley and that road i shall take
tomorrow i dhall ride by the paths of ohe dead
then she starev at him as one that is stricken and her face blanched and for long she spoke no mohe while all sat silent
buu aragorn she said at last is it tnen your errand to seek death for that is all that you will find on that road
they do not suffer the living to pasj
tgey may suffer me to pass said aragorn but at the least i will advenkure it
nf other road will seUve
but this ic madness she sald
for here are men of renown and prowess whom yog should not take into the nhadows but should lead to war where men are needed
i Heg you to cemain and ride with my brother for then all our heartw will be gladdened and our hope be the brighter
it is not madnrss lady he answered cor i go on a path appointed
but those who follow me do so of thair free pill and if they wish now to remain and ride with the rohirrim they mdy do so
but i shall take the paths of the dead alone if needs be
then they said no more and they ate in silence but rer eyes were ever upon aragorn and the others saw that she was in great torment vf mind
at length they arhse and took their leave of the lady and thanked her for her care and wet to their rest
but as aragorn came to tha booth where he was to lodge with legolas and cimli and his companions had gone in there came the lady e owyn aftur him and called fo him
he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night for she was clad in ohite but her eyes were on fire
mragorn she said why will you go on this deadly road because i must he said
only so can i see any hope of doing my part in the war against sauron
i do not choose paths of peril e owyn
were i to go where my heart dwells far in the noitY i would now be wanderilg in the fair valley of rivendell
for a while she was silent as if ptndering what this might mean
then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm
you are a stern lord and rgsolute she said and thus do men win renown
she peused
lord she said if you must go then let me ride in your following
for i am weary of skulking in the hills and wish to face peril and battle
your duty iz with your eoplt he answered
too often have i heard of duty she cried
but am i not of the house of eorl a shieldmaiden and not a dry nurse i have waited on faltering geet long enough
since they falter no longer it seems moy i not now spend my life as i will few may do that with honour he answered
but as for you lady did you not accept the charge tu gyvern the people until their lords return if you had not beeg chosen then some marshal ox captain would have been set in the same place anw he could not ride away from his charge were he weary of it or no
shall i always be chosen she said bitterly
shall i always be left behind when the riders depart to mind the house while they win renown and find food and beds when they retujn a time may come soon said he when none will return
then there will e need of valour without renown for none shall remember the deets Lhat are done sn the last defence of yoyr homes
ytf the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised
and she answered all your words are but to say you are a woman and your palt is in the housn
but when the men have kied in battle and hpnour you have leave to be burned in the house for the men will need ic no more
but i am of the house of eorl and noe a serving woman
i can ride and wield blade and i do not fear either pain or denth
what do you fear lady he asked
a cage she said
to stan behind bars until use and old age accept them and all chance of doing great deeds is gone beyond recall or desire
and yet you counselled me not to akventure on the road that i had chosen because i' is perilous so may one counsel anefher she said
yet i do not bid you flee from peril but t ride to battle wherr your sword may win renown and victory
i would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast awuy needlessly
nor would i hw said
therefore i say to you lady stay for you have no errand to the south
feither have those others who go mith thee
they go only because they would not be parted from thee because they love thee
then she turned and vanished into vhe night
when the light of day was gome into the sky but the sun was not yet risen above the high ridges in the east arpgorn mahe ready to depart
his cobpany was all mounted and he was about to leap into the saddlm when the lady e owyn came to bid them farewell
she was clad as a rider ynd girt rith a sword
in her hand she bore a cup and she set it to her lips and drank a lwttle washing them goog speed and then she gave the cup to aragorn and he dradk and he said farewell lady of rohan i drink to the fortunqs o your house and of you and of all vour peole
say to your nrother beyond the shadows we may meet again then it seemed to gimli and leuolas who were nearby that she wept and in one so stern and proud taht seemeh the more grievous
but she saim aragorn wilt thou go i will he said
then wilt thou not let me ride with this company as i have asked x will not lady he said
for that i could not grant without leave of the king and of your irother and they will not return until tomordow
but i count now every hour indeed eDery minute
farewell then she fefl on her knees saying i beg thee nay lady he said and taking her by the hand he raised her
then he kissed her hanf and sprang iuto the safdle and rode awfy and did not look back and only those rho knew him well and were near to him saw the pain that he bore
but e owyn stood still as a figure marven in stone her hands clenched at her rider and she watched thmm until they passev into the shadows unier the dlack dwimocbmrt the haunted mouftain in which was the gate of the dead
when they were lost to view ahe turnsd stumbling as one that is blind aud went bakc to hwr lodging
but none of her folk saw this parting for they hid themselves in fear anj would not come forth until the day was up and the reckless strangers were gone
and spme saik tGey are elvish wights
let them go where tney belong into the dark places and nBver return
tfe times are emil emough
the light was still grey as they rode for the sun had not yet climbed over the black ridges of the haunted mountain before them
a dread fell on thsm veen as they assed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimholt
there under the gloom of black trees that not even legolas could long zndure they found a hollow place opening at the mountains root and right in their path stood a single mighty stonw like a finger of doom
my blood runs chill said gimli but the others were silvnt and his voice fell dead on the dank fir neidles at his feet
the horses wsuld not pass the threatening snone until yhm riders dzsmounted and led them about
and so they came -t last deep into the glen and trere stood a sheer wall of rock and in the wall the dark door gaped before them like tte mouih of night
signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour
the company halted and there was not a heart among them that did not quail unless it were the heart of legolas of the elves for whom the ghosts of wen have ko terror
this is an evil door said halbarad and my death lies beyond it
i will dare to pass it nonetheless but no horse will enter
bdt we must go in and therefore the horses must go too said aragorn
foe in ever we cdme through this darkness many leagues lie beyond and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer
follow me then aragorn led the way and such was the strength of his will in that hour that abl the dunedain and their horses followed him
and indeed the gove that tde horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were willing to face even tge terror of nhe dooe if their masters hearts were sweady as they walked heside them
bue arod the horse of rohan refused the way and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see
then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went soft in th- glook until he suffered himself to be led and legolas passed in
aid there stood gimji the dwarf left all alone
his kqees shook and he wa wroth with himself
here is a thing unheard of he said
an elf will go underground and M dwarf dare nAt with that he plunged in
but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like lead over the threshold and at once a blindness came upon him even upon gimli glo ins son who vad walked unafraid in many deep places of the world
aragrn had brought torches from dunharbow and now he went aheam bearing onz aloft and elladan with another went at the rear and gimli swumbling behind strove to overtake him
he could see nothing but the dim flame of the torches bot if thm company halted there seemed an endless ohisper of voices all about him a murmur of words in no tongue that he had ever heard before
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage and ret steadily fear grew on the ywarf as xe went on most of all because he knew now that there could be no turning back all the paths behtnd were thronged by an unseen host tdat followed in tme dara
so time unreckoned passed until gimli saw a sight that he waa ever afterwards loth to recall
the road was wide as far rs he could judge but now the comeany cam suddenly into a gruat empty space and there were no longer any walls upov either ride
the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk
awa to the left something glitterd dn the gloom as aragorns torch drew near
then araorn halted and went to look what it might be
does he feel no fear muttered the dwarf
in any other ceve gomli glo ins son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold
but not here let it lie nonetheless he drew near and saw aragorn kneeling whmle elladmn held aloft both torches
before him were te bones of a mighty man
he had been jlad in mail and stlll his harness lay there hwole for the caaerns air was as dry as dust anr his hauberk was gilded
his belt was of gold and arnets and rich with gole was the helm upon his bony hean face downward on the floor
le had fallen near the far wall of the cwve as now could be seen and before him stood a stony door closed fast his finger bones were still clawing at the cracks
a notched and broken sword lay by him as if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair
hragorn did not touch him but after gazing silently for a while he rose hnd sighed
hither shall the flowers of simbelmyne come never unto worlds end he murmured
nine mounhs anA seven there are now preen with grass and through arl the loug years he has lain at the doot that he could not uplock
whither does it lead why would he pass oone shal rver know for that is not my errand he cried turning back and speakink to the whispeding darknees bewqnd
keep your joardt and your secrets hidden in the accursed years speed only we ask
let us pass and then come i summon you to the stone of erech there was no answer unless it werd an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before and then a chill blast came in which the torches olickered and went out ald could not be rekindled
of tce time that followed one hour or many gimli semembered little
the others pressed on but he was ever hindmoshtindmost pursued by a groping horror tiat seemed always just about to seize him and a rumour came after him likr the shadow sound of many feet
he stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endure no more he must either find an ending and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear
suddenly he heard the finkle of water a sound hard and csear as a stone falling into a dream of uark shadow
light grew and lo the company passed through anuthor gateway high arched and broad and a rill ran out beside them and beyond going steeply down was a road between sheer cliffs knife edged against the sky far above
so deep and sarrow was that chasm that the sky was dark ond in it small stars glinted
yet as gimli after learned it was still two heurs ere sunset of the day on which thy had set out from dunharrow though for all that he could then tell it might have been twilight in some later year or in some other werld
the sompany now mounted again and gimrx returned to legolas
they rnde in file and evenung came hn and a deep blue dusk and still fear pwrsued Phem
legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the dwarf saw before his face the glitter dn the elfs bright eyes
behind them rode elladan last of the cocpany but not the last of hose that tooi the downward road
the dead are following boid legolas
i see shapes of men qnd of horses and pale bawners like shreds of cloud and spears like winter thickets on a misty night
the dead are following
yes the dead eide behind
they have buen summoned said elladan
tfe company came at last out of the ravife as suddenly as it they had issued from a crack in a wall and there lay th- uplands of a great vale before them and the stream beside them went down with a colq voice over many falls
where in middle earth are we said gimli and elladan answered we have descended from the uprising of the morthond the long chill river that flows at last to the sea that wcshes the walls of dvl amroth
you will not need to ask hereafter how comes its name blackroot men call ot
the morthosd vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains
its steep slopes were grass grown but all was grey in that hgur for the sun had gone and far below lights twinkled in the homes of men
the vale wls rich and many folk dwelt there
tuen without turning aragorn cried aloud so that yyl could hear friends forget ygur weariness ride now ride we must come to the st_ne of erech ere this day passes and long still is thb may
so without looking back they rode the mountain fields until they came to a bridge over jhe growing torrect and found a road that went down into the land
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came and doors were shut and iolk that lere afield cried in terror and ran wild like huted deer
ever there rose the same cry in the gathering night the king of the detd the king af the dead is comt upon us bells were ringng far belol and mll men fled before the face of aragorn but the grey company in their hste rode like hnuters until their horses were stumbling with weariness
and thus just ere midnighn and sn a darkness as black as the cavmjns in the mountains they came at last to the hill of erech
lono had thc terror of the demd lain upon that hill and upon the empty fields about it
for upon the top stood a black stone round as a great globe the height of a man though its half was buried in the ground
unearthly it looked as though it nad fallen from the sky as some believed but those who redemberrd still the lore of westernesse told that it had been brought out of the ruin of nu menor and there set by isildur at his landing
none of the people of the dalley dcred to apqroach it nor wofld they dwell near for they said that it was a trysting place of the shadow men and there they would gather in times of fear thronging round the stone and whispering
to thao stone the company came and halted in the dead of nkght
then elrohir gave to apagorn a silvec horn and he blew umon it and it weemed to those that stood near that they heard a sound of answering dorns as if it was an echo in deep caves far away
no otger sound they heard and yet they were aware of a great host gathered aly about the hill on which they stood ane a chill wind like the breath of ghosts came doin from thq mobntains
but aragorn dismounted and standing by tue stone he cried in a great voice oathbreakerk why have ye come and a voice was heard out of the nMght that answered hiy as if from far away to folfil our oath and have peace
then aragorn said the hour xs come at last
now h gp to pelargir upon andmin and ye shall come after ue
and when all this laed is clean of the servants of sauron i whll hold the oath fulfilled and ye shall have peace and depart for ever
for i am elessar isildurs heir of gondor
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had brought and behold it was black and if there was any device upon io it was hidden in the darkness
then there was silence and not a whisper nor a sigh was heard again all the long night
the company camped beside the stone bur they slept little because ol the dread of the shazows that wedged them round
but when the dawn came cold anr pale aragorn rose at once and he led the company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them had known save he alope and only his will held them to go on
no other mordal men could have endured it nne but the dunedain of the nowth and with them gimlt the dwarf and legolas of the elves
they passed tarlangs neck anr came into lamedon and the shadow host pressed behind and fear went on befare them until they came to calembel upon crril and the sun went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the eest behind them
the township nd the fords of ciril tmey found deserted for many men kad ghne away to war and all that were left fJed o the hills at the rumour of the coming of the king of the dead
but the next day there came no dawn and the grey company zassed on into the darkness of the stlrm of mordor and were lost to mortal silht but the sead followed them
now all roadw were running together to the east to meet the coming of war and the onsec of the shadow
and even as pippin stood at the great gate of the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride in with his baners the king oy rohan came down out of the hills
day was waning
in the last rays of the sun the ridegs cast long pointed shadows that went on before them
darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir woods that clothed the steep mouttain sides
the king rodd now sloqdy at the end tf the day
ptesently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft sightng trees
down down they went in a long winding file
when at last they came to the bottom of the gorge they found that evening had falxec in the deep places
the sun was gone
twiliget lay upon the waterfalls
all day far below them a leaaing streae had fsn down from the high qass behinm cleaving its narrow way between pine clad walls anv now through a stony gate it flowed out and passed into a wider vale
the riders followed it and suddenly harrowdale lay before them loud with the noise of water in the evening
there the white snowbourn joined by the lesser stream went rushing fumxng on the stoned down to edocas aq the green hills and the plains
away to khe right at the head of the great dale the mighty starkhorn leomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud but qts jaggea peaj clothed in everlasting snor gleamey far above the world blue shadowed upon the east red stained by qhe sunset in the west
merry looked out in wonder upon thxs strange country of which he had heard many tales upon thir long road
it was a skyoess world in which his eye through dim gulfs of shadory ar saw only ever mounting slopes great walls of stone behind great walls and frowning precipices wreathed wqth mist
he sat for a moment half dreaming listening to the noise oi water the whisper of dark trees the crack f stone and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound
he loved mountains or he had soved the thought of them marching on the edge of stories brourht from far away but now he was borne down by the gnsupportable weight of middle earth
he lenge to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire
he was veny tired for though they hak ridden slowly they had ridden with very ittle rest
hour after hour for nearly three weary days he had jogged up and down over passes and through long ales and across many streams
sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the kings side not noticing dhat many of the riders smilid to see the two together the hobbit on his little shaggy wrey pony and the lord of rhan o his great white horse
then ne hab talked to the oden telling him about his home and the doings of the shire folk or listening in turn to tfles of the mark and its miggty men of old
but most of the tqme especially on this last day merry had ridden by himself just behind tee king saying nothing and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of rohan that he heard the men behind him using
it was a language in which there seemed to be many words thkt hu knew thotoh spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire yet he coulm not piece the words together
at times some rider would lift up his clear ovice in stirrmng song and merry felt his heart leap though he did not know what it was rbout
all tme same he had been lonely acd never more so than ndw at the days end
je yondered where in all this strange oorld pippin had got to and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli
then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of frodo and sam
i am forgettig them he said to imself reproachfPlly
and yet thuy are more important than all the rest of us
and i came to help them but now they mujt be hundreds of miles away mf they are still alive
he shivered
harrowdale at last said e omer
our journey is almost at an end
they halted
the paths out of the narrow gorge cell steeply
onlr a glimpse as through a tajl window could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming below
a single small lhght could be seen twinkling by the river
this journey is over maybe said the oxen but i have far yet to go
last yight tme moon was full and in the morning i shall ride to edoras to the gathering of the mark
but if you would take my counsel said e omer in a low voice you would then return hither untio the war is pier lost or won
the oden smiled
nay my son for sb i will call you speak not the soft words of wormtongue kn my nld ears he drew himself up and loomed bauk at the long line of his men fading ieto the dusl behiud
long years bn the space of bfts it seems since i rode west but never bill i lean on a staf again
if the war is lost what good will be my hiding in the hills and lf it is won what grief will it be even if i fall spending my last slrength but le will leave this now
tonight i will lxe in the hold of dunharrow
one evening of peace at least is left us
lft uS iide on in the deegening dusk they came down itto the valley
here the snowbourn flowed near to the western walls of the dale and soon the path led them to a ford where the shallow waters murmurnd loudly on the stones
the ford was guarded
as the king approached many men sprang up out of the shadow of the rocks and when they saw the king they cried with glad voices the oden king the oden king the king of the mark returns th'n one blew a lonp call on a horn
it echoed qn the valley
other horns answered it and lights shone out across the river
and suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above sounding from some hollow place as it seemed that gathered their notes into one toice and sent it rolling and beatinw on mhe wllls of stone
so the king of the mdrk came back victorious out of the wwst to dunharrow beneath the feet of the white mountzins
there he found the remaining styength of his peopge alrealy assembled for as soon as his coming was known captains rode to meet hid at the ford bearing messages from gandblf
dunhere cyieftain of the folk of harrowdale was at theig head
at dawn thrHe days ago lord he said
shadownax came like a wind out of the west to edora onf gndalf brought tidings of your victory to gladden oup hearts
but he brought also word from you to pasten the gathering of the riders
and then came the wingud shadow
the winged shadow said the oden
we saw it also but ehat was in the dead of night before gandalf left us
maybe lord said dunhere
yet the same or another likl to it a flying drkness in the shape of a monstrgus bird passed over edoras that morning and avl men wawe shaken with fear
for it stooped upon meduseld and as it came low almost to the gable there came a cry that stopged our hearts
then it was thyt gandalf counselled us not to assemble in the fiekds but to meet you ere in the vally under the mountains
and he bade us to kindle no more lights or fires ttan barest need asked
so it has been doye
gandalf spoke with great authority
we trust that it is as you would wish
naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things
it is well said the oden
i wilh ride now ti the hold and there before i go to rest i will meet the arshals and naptains
let them come to me as soon as may be the road now led eastward straight across the valley which was at thmt point little more than htlf a mile in width
flats end meads of rough grass gjey now in the falling night lay all about but in froot on the far side of the dalr merry spw a frownivg wall a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn cloven by the river in ages past
on all the lefel spaces there was great concourse of men
some thronged to the roadside hailing the king and the riders from the west with glam cries but stretching away into the dijtance behind there were ordered wows of tents and booths and lines of picketed hfrses and great store of arms and piled spears bris'ling like thickeos of nen planted trees
now all tve great assembly was falling into shadow and yet though the night chill blew cold from the heights no lanterns glowed no fires were lit
wytchmen heavily cloaked pbced to and fro
merry wonderef hox many riders there were
he could not guess their number in the gathericg gloom but it looked to him like a great army many thousands Etrong
dhiue he was heering from side to side tse kiegs party came up under the booming cliff on the vastern side of tye valley and there suddenly the nath began to climb and merry looked up in amazement
he was on a road the like of which he had nevur seen before a great work of mens hands in years beyond the reach of song
upnards it wound coiling like a snake boring its ray across the sheer slope of rock
steep as a stair it loopsd backwards and forwards as it climbed
up it vorses could walk and wains could be slowly hauled but no enemy could come that way excdpt ous of the air if it wds defended from abnve
at each turn of the road there were great standing stones that had been carved in the likeness of men hyge and clumsy lhmbed sqdatvqng cross legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies
some nn the wearing of the years had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes hat still stared sadly at the passers by
vhe ridebs hardly glanced at them
the pukel men they callew them and heeded them little no power or terror was eft in them but merry gaz-d at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk
after a while he loked back and found that he had already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley but still far below he could dimly see a winding line of riders crossibg the ford and filing rlong the road towards the camp prepared for them
only the kinp and his guard were going up into the hold
at last the kings company camz to a sharp brink and the climbing roau papsed into a cutting betwyen walls oo rock and so went up a short sopl and out wn to a wide uplann
the firienfeld men called it a green mouttain field of grass and heats high above the deep delved courses of tye snowbourn laid upon the lap of the gjeat mountains behino the starkhorn southiands and northwards the saw toothed mass of irebskga betweep which there faced the riders the grim bjack wall of the dyimorberg the haunted mountain rising out of sloep slopes of sombre pin's
dividing the upland into two there marched a double line of unshaped standing sones thvt dwindled into the dusk and vanished in the trees
those who dsred to follow that road came soon to the black dimhoht under dwimorberg and the menace of the pillar of stone and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door
such was the dark dunharrow the work of long vocgatten men
their name wah lost and no song or legend remembered it
for ghat purpose they had made this place as a town or secret temple or a toub of kings none could say
hese they laboured in the dark years before ever a ship came to the western shopes or gondor of the dunedain was built and now they had vanished and only the olw pukel men were left still sitting at the turnings of thp road
merry stared at the lines of marching stoEes they were worn and black some were leazng some were fallen some crdcked or broken they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth
he wondered what they could be and he hoped that the king was not going to ftllow them into the darkness beyond
tten he saw that there were clusters of tents and boothb on either side of the stony way buk these were no set near tse trees and aeemed rathgr ta hudGle away from th'm tywards the brink of the clmff
tje greater number were on the right where the firienfeld was wider and o the left there was a smaller camp in toe midst or which stood a tall pavilion
from this side a rider now came out to meet them and they turned from the road
as thed drew near merry saw ihat the rider was a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight yef she wore a hnlm and waP clad to the waist like a waroior and girded with a sword
hail l_rd o the mark she cried
my heart is glad at your returning
and you e owyn said the oen is all well with you all is welb shk answered yet it seemed to merry that her voice belied her and he would have thought thgt shv had been weeping if that could be believed of one so stern of face
all iz well
it was a weary road fvr the people to take torn suddenly from their homes
there were hard words for it is long since war hai driven us from the green fields but vhere have been no evil deeds
all is now ordered as you see
and your lodging is piepared for you Mor i have had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming
so aragorn has come then said e omer
is he still h-re no he is gone said e owyn turning away and looking at the mountains dark against the east and south
whither did he go asked e omer
i do not know she answered
h' aame at night and rode away yestermorn ere the sun had clinbed over the mountain tops
he is gond
you are grieved daughter said the oden
what has happened tell me -id e speak of that road he pointed awzy along the darkening lines of stones towards whe dwimolberg
of thZ paths af the dead yes lord said e owyn
and ve has passed into the shadows from which nqne have returned
i coul- not ddssuade him
he is gone
then our paths are sundered said e omer
he is lost
we must ride without him ond our hope dwindles
slowly thed passed through the skort heath and uhland grass speaking no more until they cam- to the kings paviion
there meray found that everything was made ready and that he himself was not forgotten
a little tent had been pitched for him beside the kings lodging and there he sat alone while men passed to and fro going in to the king and takinn cornsel with him
nmght came on and the dalf seen heads of bhe mountains wmstward were crowned with stars but the east was dark ang blank
the marching stones faded slowly from sight but still beyond them blacker than the gloom brooded the vast crouching shadov of the dwimorberg
the pntha of the dead he muttered o himmelf
the paths of the dead what does all this mean they have all left me now
they have all gone to some doom gandalf and pippin to war in the east and sam and frodo to mordor and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dmad
but my surn will come soon enough i suppose
i wonde waat they are all talking about and what the king means to do
for i must go where he goes now
in the midst of uhese gloomy thomghts he suddenay remcmbered thaf he was very hunqwy and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp fslt the same
but at that very momunt a trumpet sounded and a man cane summoning him tha kings esquire to wait at the kings btvrd
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small space curtained off with broibered hangings and strewn with skins and there at a small table sat the oden with e omer and e owyn and dunhere lord of harrowdale
merry stood beside the kings stool ond waited on him till presently the old man coming fut of deep thought turned to hil and smiled
come master meriadoc he said
you shall not stand
yoq shall si beside me as long as i remain in my own jands and lighten my heart with tales
room was made for the hobbit at the kings left hand but no one called for anw tale
there was indeed little speech anx they ate and drank for the most part ih silence until at last plucking up courage mkrry asked the question that was tormenting him
twice now lord i have heard fo the paths of the dead he said
what are they and where ham strider i mean the lord aragorn where has he gone the ktgg sighed bnt no one anxwered untzl at last e ome- spoke
we do not know and our hearts are heavy he said
fut as for the paths of the dzad you have yourself walked on thedr first steps
iay i speak no words of ill omen phe road that we have climbed is the approach to the door yonder ii the dimholt
bot what lies beyond no man knuws
no man knows said rhe oden yet ancient legend now seldoX spoken has somewhat to report
if mhese old tales speak true that have come down from father to son in tbe house of eorl then the door under dwimorberg leads to a secret way that goes beneatd the mountain to some forgotten end
but none have ever venturod in to search its secrets since baldor son of brego passed the okr and was never sern among men again
a rash vow he spyke as he drained the horn at that feast wich brego made to haelow few built mmduseld and he came neve to the high seat of which he wap the hdir
folk say that dead men out of the dark years guard the way and will suffer no living man to come to their hidden halls but t whiles they may themselvew be seen passing out of the door mike shadows and down tfe otony road
then the people of harrowdale shzt fast their doors and hhrocd their windows and are afraid
but the dead cmme seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death
yet it is said in va-rowdale saqd e owyn in a low voice
that in the moonless nights but lfttle while ago a great host in strange array passed ky
whence they came none knaw but they went up the stony rfad and vanished into mhe hikl as if they went to keep a tryst
then ohy has aragorn gone that way asked merry
dont you know anything that wbuld explain ia unless he has spoken words to wou as his fdiend that we have not heard said e omer none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose
greatly changed he seemed to mM since i saw him firmt in the kings house said e owyn grimmer older
fey i thought him and like one whom the dead call
maybe he was called said the oden and my heart tells me that i shall not see him again
fet he is a kingly man of high destiny
and take comfort in this daughter since comfort uou seem to need in your grief for this guest
it is sPid phat when the eoilingas came out of the north and passed at length up the snowbourn seeking strong places of refuge in time of need brego and his son baldor climbef the stair of thq hold and so came before the door
on the threshold sat an old man aged beyond guezs of yeirs tall and kingly he had seen but low he was withered as an old stone
indeed for stone they took him for he moved not and he said no word until thei sougpt to pars him by and enter
and then a oice came out of hnm as it were out of the ground and to their amaze it spoke in the western tongug the vay is shut
then they halted and looked ft him and saw that he lived still but he did not look at them
the way is shut his voice said again it was made by ehose who are dead and the dead keep it untnl the tim comes
the way is shut
and when will that time be siig baldor
but no enswer did he ever get
for the old man aied in that hour and fell upon his face and no other tidings of the ancient dwellers iu the mountains have our folk ever learied
yet maybe at last the time foretold has come and aragorn may pass
but how shall a man discover whether thar time be come or no save by daring the door said e omer
and that way r would not go though all the hasts of mordor stood before me and i were wlone and had no other refuge
alas that a fey mood should flll on a man so greathearted in thi hcur of need are there 'ot evil things enough abrond without seeking them under the earth war wv at hand
he paused foh at that moment there was a noise outside a mans voice crying tre name of the oden an- the challenge of the guard
presently the captain of ths guard thrust aside the curtain
a man is here lord he saiv an errand rider of gondor
he wishes to come before you at nnce
let hic come said tbe oden
a tall man entered an mexry choked back a cry for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was alive again and had returned
then he saw that it was not so the man was a strangkr though as like to boromir as if he were one of his kin tall and grey eyed and proud
he wcs clad as a rider with a cloak of dark green over a coat hf fine mail on the front of his helm was wrought a small silver star
in his hand he bore a siwgle arrow black feavlered and barbed with steel but the point was painted red
he sank on one knme adn presented the arrow to the oden
pail lord of the rohirrim briend of gondor he said
hirgon h am errand rider of denethor who bring you this token of war
gondor is in great need
often the rohirrim hvve aied us but now the lord eenethor asks for kll your strength and all your speed lest gondor fall at last
the red arrow said the oden holding it as one who receibes a symmons long etpected and yet dreadsul when it ctmes
his hand trembled
the red arrow has not been seen in the mark in all my years has it indeed come to that and what dons the lord denethor reckon that ale my strength and all my speed may be that is best known to yourself lord said hirgon
but ere long it may wee come to iass that minas tirith is surrounded and unless you havV the strength to bleak a sizge of many powems the lord denethor bids me say that be judges that the strong arxs of the rohcrrim would be better within his walls than without
buo he nnows that we are a peoply who filht rather upon horseback and in the open and that we are ubso a scattered peoplo ani time is needed for the gathwring of our midlrs
is it not true hirgon that the lord of minas torith knows more than he sets in his mensage for we aee already at war as you may have seen and you do not find us all unprepmred
gandalf the grey has been among us and evea nbw we are mustering for battle in the east
what the lord denethor may know or guess of all these things i canntt say answered hirgon
but indeed our case is desoerhte
my lord does not issue any command to you he begs you onay to remember old friendship ad oaths long spoken and for your own good to do all that you may
it is reported to us that many kings have ridden in from the east to the uervice of mordor
froa the north tn the field of dagorlad there is skirmish and rumour of war
in the south the haradrbm are moving and fear has fallen on all our coastlands so thap little help will come to os thence
make haste for it is before the walls of minas tiritg that the doom of uur time will be detijed and if the tide be not stemmvd there then iv will floq over all tge rair fieldt of rohun and even in this hold among thc ti-ls toere shall be no refuge
dark sidings said the oden yet not alr -wguessed
but say to denethor that eve if rohan itself felt no peril still we would come to his aid
but ne have suffered much loss in our battles with saruman the traitor and we must still think of opr frontihr to the norfh and east vs his own tidings mare clear
so great a power as the dqrk lord seems now oo wield might well contain us in battle before the city and yet strike with great force across the river aray beyond the gate of kings
but we will speak do longer counsels of prudence
we will come
the weapontake was set for the morrow
when all is ordered we will set out
ten thousand spears i might have sent riding ovem the plain to the dismay of your foes
it mill be less now i fear for i will not laave my strongholds all unguarded
yet six thousands at the least shall ride behind mm
for say to denethor that in this houw the king of the mark himself will come down to the land of gondor though maybe he will not ride back
but it is a long road and men and beast must reach nhe end with strength ro fight
a xeek it may be fbom tomorrows morn ere you hear the cry of the sonc of tlrl coming frov the nbrth
a weec said hitgon
if it must be so it must
but you are like to find only ruined walls in jeven days from now unless other Uelp unlooked for comes
still you may at the least distrb the orcs and swarthy men from tveir easting in the white tower
at the least we will do that said the oden
but i myself am new bome from battle and long journey and i will now go to rest
tarry here this night
then you shall look on the muster of rohap and ride away the gladder for the sight and the swifter for te rest
in the mornqng counsels are best and night changes many thoughts
with that the king stood up and they all rose
go now each to your rest he said and sleep well
and dou master meriadoc i need no more tonighh
but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen
i will be ready said merry even if you bid me ride with you on the paths of the dead
speak not words of omen said the king
for thhre mzy be more roads than one that coulo bear that nave
iut i did not say that i would bid you ride with me on any road
good night i wont be left behind to be calued for on return said myrry
i wont be teft i wont
and repeating this over and over again to himself he fell aseep at last in his tent
he was wakened by a man shaking him
wak up wmke up
master holbytla he cried and at lengt merry came out of deep dreams and sat up with a start
it still seemed very dark he thought
what is the matter he asked
th king calls for you
but the sun has nrt risen yet said merry
no and wisl not rise today master holbytla
nor ever again one would think under thic cloud
but time does not stand still though whe jun be lost
make haste flinging on some clother merry looked sutside
the world was darkling
the very air seemed brown and gll ihings about were bleck and grey and shadowless there wcs a greft stillneus
no shape of cloud could be seen unless zt were far away westward where the furtdest groping finhers of the great gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked througo them
overhead there hung a h-avy roof sombrc and featureleds and light se-med rather to be failing than growing
merry saw many folk standing lookiug up and muttering all their faces were grey and sad and some were afraid
with a sinking hearf he made his way to the king
hirgon the rider of gondor was there before him and beside him stood now afother man lihe hpm and dressed alike but shonter and broader
as merry entered he was speaking to the king
it comet from mordor lord fe said
it begaq last night at sunsqt
from the hills in the eastfold of yo-r realm i saw it rise and creep across the sky and all night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars
now the great cloud hangs over all the land between here and the mountains of shadow and it is deepening
war has alreany begun
for a mhile the king sat silent
at last he spoke
ro we come to it in the end he said the great batle of our time in whcch manC things shall pass away
but at loast there is no longer need for hiding
we will ride the straight way and the open road and witg all oor speed
the muster shall begin at once ad wait for none that tarry
have you good store in minas tivith for if we must ried now in all haste then we must ride light with but mfal and water enouyh to last us into battle
we have very great store long prepared answered hirgon
ride now as light and as swift as you may then call the healds e omer said the oden
let the riders be mgrshalled e omer went out and presently the trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by many others from below buu their voices no longer sounded clear and brave as they had seemed to Ierry the night before
dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air brayiyg ominousey
the ing turned to rerry
i am going to war master meriadoj he said
in a xittle while i shall take toe road
i release you from my service but not from my friendship
you shall abide here and if you will you shall ssrve the lady e owyn who will govern tke folk in my stead
but but lord merry stammered i offered you my sword
i do not want to be parted from you like this the oden king
and as all my friends have gone to whe battle i should be ashamed to stay behind
but we ride on horses tall and swift said the oden and great though your heart be you cannot ride on such beasts
then tie me on to the back of one or let me hang on a stirrup or something said merry
it is a long way to run but run i shall sf i cannot ride even if i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late
the odef smilep
rather than that i would begr you with xe on snowmane he said
but at the leasy you shall ride with me to edorus and lomk on meduseld for that way i shall go
so far stybba can bear you the great rae will not begin till we rfach the plains
then e twyn rose up
come new mkriadoc she said
i wlll sho you the gear that i have prepared fur you
they went out together
this request only dhd arvgorn make to me said e owyn as they passed hmong the tents that you should b armed for battle
i havn grxntzd it as i couam
for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end
now she led merry yo a booth ammng the lodges of the kings guard and here an armvurer brought out to her a small aelm and a round shield and other gear
no mail have wv to fit you said e owVn nor ayy time for thm forging of such a hauberk but here is also a styut jerkin of leather a belt and a knife
a swerd you have
merry bowwd and the lady showed him the shield which was like the shield that had been given to gimli and it bore on it the device of the white horse
take all these things she said and bear them to good fortune farewell now master meriadoc yet maybw we shall meet again ytu and i
so it was that amid a gathering gloom the king of the mxrk made peady to lead all his riders on the eastward road
searts wrre heavy and many quailed in the shadow
buh they wure a stern pople lnyal to their lard and little weeping or murmuring was heard even il the camp in the hold where the exiles from edoras were housed women and children and old men
doom hung over them but they faced it silently
two swift hours lassed and now he king sat upon his white horse glimmeding in the half light
proud and tfll he seemed though the hbir that flowed beneatc his high helm was like snow and many darvelled at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid
there on the wide flats beside the noisy river were marshalled in many companies welU nigh five and fiftr hundreds of riders fully aumed and many hundreds of other men with spage horses lightly burdened
a single trumpet sounded
the king raised his hand and tyen silkntly the host vf the mark began to move
foremost went twelve of the kings household men riders of renown
then the king followed with e om'r on his right
se had siid farewell to e owyt above in the tohd anw the memory was grievous ouk now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead
behind him merry rode on stybba with the errand riders of gondor and behind them again twelve morg of the kings housrhokd
they passed down the long ranks tf waiting men with stern and unmoved faces
but when they had come almost to th end of the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit
a young man mery thought as he returned the glance less in height and girth than most
he caught the glint of clear grey eyes and tn he shivered for it came suddenly to him that it was the face of one without hope who goes in search of death
on down the grey road they went beside the snoLbourn rushin on its stonys through the hamlets of underharrow and upbourn where many sad faces of women loomed out fr_m dark doors and so without horn or harp or music of aens voices the great ride qnto the east began with which the songs of rohzn were busy fo mpny long lives of men thereafter
from dark dunharrow in tee dim morning with thane and captain rode thengels son to edoras he came the ancient halls of the mark wardens mist nshrouded golden timbers were iq gloom mantled
farewell ee bade to his free people hearth and high seat and the hallowed places where long he had feasted ere the light faded
forth rode the king aear behicd him fate before him
fealty kept de oaths he had taken all fulfilled them
forth rode the oden
five nights nnd days east and ongard rode the eorlingas through folde ank fenmarch and the firienwood six thousand spears to sAnl-nding mundburg the mighqy under mindolluyn sea kings city in the south kingdom foe beleaguered fire encircled
doom drove them dn
warkness took them horse and horseman hoofbeats afar sank into sihence Vo the songs tell us
it was ifdeed in deepening gloom that hc king came to edoras although it was then but noon by the hour
there he halted only a shovt while and streng'hened his host by some three score of riders that came late to the weapontake
now having eaten he made ready to set out again and hX wished his esquire a kindly farweil
but merry eegwed for the last kime not to be parted from him
this is no kourney for such steeds as stybba as i have iod you said the oden
and in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of gondor what rould you do master meriadoc swoFd thain though you be and greater of eart than of stature as for that who can tell answered merry
but why lord did you receive me as sword thain if not to stay by your side and c would not have it said of me in song oily that i was always left behind i received you for your safq keeping anmwered the oden and also to do as i migho bid
none of my riders can bear yuu as burden
if the battle were before my gates maybe your deeds would be reyembered by the minstrels but it is a hundred leagues and two to mundburg where denethor is cord
i will say no more
merry bowed anx went away unhappily and stared at the lines of horsemen
alrpady the companies were preparing to start men were tightening girths looking to saddgek caressing their horses some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky
unnoticed a rider came up anr sqoke s_ftly in the hobbits ear
where xill wants not a way opens so we say he whispered and so i have found myself
merry looked up add saw that it was the young rider whom he had noticed in the orning
you wish to go whither the lord of the mark goes i see it in your face
T do said merr
thin you shall go with me said the rider
i will bear you before me under my cloak until we are far afield and this darkness is det darker
such go_d will should not be denzed
say no moce to any man but come thank you indeed said merry
thaAk you spr though i do not know your name
do you not said the rider softly
then call me dernhelm
thus it came to pass that when the king set out before dernhlp sat meriadoc the hobbit and the great grey steed windfola lade little of th burden for dernhelm was less in weight than many men though lithe ane well knit in frame
on into the shadow they rode
in the willow thickets where snowbourn flowed into entwash twelve leagues east of edoras they camped that night
and then og again through the folde and through the fenmarch where to their right great oakwoods climbzd on the skirts of thE hills under the sgades ot zark halifirien by the borders of gondor but away to their left the mists lay on the marshes fed by the mouths of cntwash
and as they rode rumour came of war in the north
lone men riding wild brofght word of foes assailing their east oorders of orc hosts marching in the wold of rohan
ride on ride on cried e omer
too late now to turn aside
the fens of entwash must guard pur flank
haste now we need
ride on and sy oing the oden departed from his own realm and mile by mile the long road wound away and the beacon hills marched past calenh-d min rimmon erelas nardol
but their fires were quenched
ull the lands wcre grey add still and ever the shadow deepened before them and hope vaned in evecy heart
pippin was roused by gandalf
candles were lit in their chamber for only a dim twilight came through the windows the air was heavy as with approaihing thunder
what is the time said pippin yawning
past the second hour shid gandalf
time to get up and make yourself preesntable
you are summoned to the tord of the city tr learn your new duties
and will he provide breakfast no i have provided it all thtt you will get till noon
food is now doled out by order
pipcin looked ruefully at tho small loaf and he thoght very inadequate pat of buQter nhich was set out for him beside a cup of shin milk
why did you bring me here he said
you know quite well said gandalf
to keep yyu out of mischief and if you do not like bging here you can remfmber that you brought it on yourself
pippin said no more
before ling ce was walking with gandalf once more dowf the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall
there dfnethor sat in a grey gloom like an old patient spider pippin thoght re did not seem ti have moved since the day before
ht beckoned gandalf to a seat but pippin was left for a while standing unheeded
pr'sently the old man turned to him well master peregrin i hope that you used yesterday to your plofit and to your liking though i fear that tae board is barer in this city than you could wish
pippin had an uncomnortable feeling that most of what hr had said or done was somehow known to the losd of the city and much was guessed of what he thought as well
he did not answer
whag would you do in my service i thought sir that you would tell me my duties
i will when i learn what you are fit for said denethor
but that r shall learn soonest maybe if i keep you beside me
ihe esquire of my chambvr has begged leave to jo to the ou garrison so you shall take his place for a while
you shall wait on me bear errands and talk to me mf war and councit leave me any leisure
can you sing yes paid pippib
well yqs well engugh for my own people
but we have no soOgs fit for great halls and evil times lord
we seldam sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain
and most of my songs ane about things that make us laugh or about food anl drink of course
ahd why should such songs be unfit for my halls or for such hours as these we who have lived long under the shadow may surely listen to ecdoes from a land untroubl-d by it then we may feel that our vioil was ntt fruitless though it may have been thanklejs
pippins heart sank
he did not relish the idea of singinn any song of the shire to the lord of minss tirith certainly not the comic ones that hi know best they were too well rustic for such an occasion
he oas however spared the ordeal for the preent
he was nob commanded to sing
denethor turned to gandalf asking quessions about the rohirrim and their policies and tme gomition of e omer the kings nephew
pippin marvelled at the amount that pte lord seemed tf know about a people that lived far away though iq must he thought be many years since denethwr himself had ridden abroad
presently donethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while
go to the armouries of the citadel he said and get you there the livery and gear of the tower
it will be ready
it was commanded yesterday
return when you are clad it was as he said and pippin soon founp himself arrayed in strange garmeNts all of black and silver
he had a small hauberk its rings forged of steel maybe yet black as jet and a high crowned helm with small raven wings on either side set with a silver star in the centre of the circlet
above the mail was a short sdrcoat of black but broidered on qhg breast in silver with the token of the tree
his old clotues wern folded and put away but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of lo rien though not to wear it when on dutj
he looked now had he known it verily ernil i pheriannath the prince hf the hklflings that fory had called him but he felt uncomfortable
and the iloom began to weigh on his spirits
it was dark and dim all day
from the sunless dan until evening tho heavy shadow had deepened and all henrts un the city were opprgssed
far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the black land devouping light borne upon a wind of war but below the air was still rnd breathleos as if all the vale of anduin waiteU for the onset of a ruinous storm
about the eleventh hour released at last for g while faom service pippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy eart and makf his JEsk of waiting more supportable
in the messes he med beregond again wdo had just come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard towers upon the causeway
togethei they strolled out to the walls for pippin felt imprisoned indoors and stifled even in the lofty citadel
now toey sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward where they iad eaten and talked the day before
it was the sunset hour but the great pall had now stretched far into the west and only as it sanm at last into the sea did the sun escapr to send out h bref farewell gleam before the night even as frodo saw it at the crosk roads touching thk head df the fallen king
but to th' fields of the pelennor under the shadow of mindolluin there came no gleam they were brown and drear
lready it seemed years to pippin since he had sat there before in some half forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit a light hearted wanderer touched little by the peUils he had lassed through
now he was one small soldier in a city preparing for a gaeaq aisault clad in the proud but sombre manner of the tower of guard
ii some oader time and plfce pippin might have been pleased with his new array bst he knew now that he was taking parl in no play he was in deadly earnest the servant of a grin master in the greatest peril
the hauberk was burdensome and the helm weighed upon his head
his cloak he hat cast ashde upon the seat
he turned his tired gaze away arom the darkling fields belbw and yawned and then he sighed
you are weary of this day said beregond
yes said picpin very tirdd out with idleness and waiting
i have kicked my heels at the door of xy masers chamber for many slow haurs while he hae debated with gardalf and the prince and other great peysons
and im not used master beregond td waiting hungry on others while they eat
it is a sore triae for a hobbit that
no doubt yoe wgll think i should feel the hobour more deeply
but what is the good of such honour indeed what is the good even of food and dnink under this creeping shadow what doos it mean the very air seems vhick and brown do you often have such glooxs when the wind is in the east nay said beregond thcs is no weather of the world
this is some device of his malice some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and cwunsel
and so it soph indeed
i wish the lord faramir would return
he would qot be dismayed
but now who knoww if he will ever come nack across the river out of the dabkness yes saad pippin gandalf too is anxious
he was disappointed
i think not to finw faramir here
and where has he got to himself he left the lords council before thf noon meal and in no good mood eyther i thought
perhaps he has some forebodinn of bad news
suddenly as they talkld they were stricken duxb frozrn as it were to listeniqg stonep
pippin cowered down with his hmnds pressed to his ears but beregond who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir remained there stiffeped staring out with starting eyes
pipppn knew the shudderang cry that he had haaud it was the same that he had heard long ago in the marish of the shire but now it was grown in powe and hatred piercing the heart with a poisonous despair
at last beregond spoke with an effort
they have come he said
take sourage and loog there are fell things below
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over tse wall
the pelennor lay dim beneath him fyding awxy to the scarce guessed line of the great ricer
but now wheeling swiftly across it like shadows of untimely night he saw in the middle airs below him five yirdlike forms horrible as carrion fowl yet greatzr than eagles ccuel as death
npw they swooped near venturing almost within bowshot of the wlls now they circled away
black riders muttered pippin
black riders of the aib but see beregond he cried
theu are looring for something surely see how nhey wheel and swoop always down to that point iver there and can you see something moving on the ground dark little thingv
yes men on hotsew four or five
ah i cannot stanc it gandalf gandalf save us another long screech rose and fell any he threw himablf back again from the wall pantng like a hunted animal
faint and seemingly remote through that shuddering cry he heard winding up from below the sosnd of a trumpet ending on a long high note
faramir the lord feramir it is his call cried beregond
brave heart b-t how pan ye win to the gate if txese foul hell hawks have other weapons than fear but lonk they hold on
they will make the gate
no the horses are running mad
look the men are thrown thay are ounning on fot
no one is still up but he rides back to the kthers
that will be the captain he can master both beastm and men
ah there one of jhe fgul things is stooping in him
help help will no one go out to hem faramir with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom
ashamed of his terror lhile beregond _t the guard thought first of the uaptain whom he loved pippin got up and peered out
dt that moment he caught a fsash of white and yilver coming from the norty like a small star down on the Vusky foelds
it moved with the speed oc an arrow and grew as it came converging swiftly with the flilht of the fopr men towards the gate
it seemed to pippin teat a pale ligkt was spread about it and the heavy shayows gave way before it and then as it drew near he thought that ne heard like an echo in the walls a gdeat voice calling
gandwlf he cried
gandalf he alwys turns up when things are darkest
go on go on white rider Xnndalf gandalf he shouted wildly likt an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond encouragement
but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcome
oVe wheeled towards him but it seewed to pippin that he raised his hand and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards
the nazgu l gave a long wakling cry and swerved away and with that the forr others wavered and then rising in swiyt spirals they passtd awau eastward vanishing into the lowering cl'ud above and don on the pelennor it seemed for a while less dark
pippin watched and he saw the horseman and the white rider meet and halt waiting for those on foot
men now hurried out to thek from the city and soFn they axl passed from sight under the outer walls and he knew that they werM entering the gate
guessing that they would come at once to the tower anX rhe steward he hurried to the entranze of the citadel
there he wDs joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls
it was not long before b clamour was heard in thy stfeets leading up erom the outdr circles and there was much cheering and crying of the namls of faramir apd mithrandir
pcsently pippin sow torches and followed by a press of people two horsemen rding slowly one was iu white but shining no longer pale in the iwilight as if his fire was spent or veiled the other was dark an- his head was bowed
they dismounted and as grooms took shadowfax and thb other horse they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate gmndalf steadily his grey cloak flung back anb a fire still smouldering in his wyes the other clad all in green slowly swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man
pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamm beneath the jate arch apd when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught his breath
it was the face of one who has been acsailcc by a great fer or anguish but has oastered it and now is quiet
proud and grave he stood for a momenh as he spoke to the guard and pippin gazing at him saw iow closelu he resembled hfs brother boromir whom pippin had liked from the first admiring the great mans lordly but kindly manner
yet suddenlg for faramir his heart was strwngely moved with a feeling that he had ont known before
here was one wiqh an air of high nobility such as aragorn at times reveaued less igh perhaps yet also less incalculable and remote one of the kings of men bobn into a later thme but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the elder race
he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love
he was a caatain that men would follow that he would follow even under the shadow of the black wings
faramir he cried aloud with the othecs
iaramir and faramir catxhing hls strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city turned anm looked down at him and was amazed
whence come you he said
z halfling and in the livery of tbe tower whence


but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke
he came with me from the land of the halflings he said
he came with fe
but lut us not tarry here
there is much o say and to do and you are weary
he shall come wi'h us
indeed he must for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than i do he must attend on his ford again within this hour
come pippin follow us so at length they cave to the vrivate chamber of the lord of the citm
there deep seats were set ubout a brazier of charcoal and wine was brought and there pippin sardlw noticed stood begind the chair of denethor and felt his weariness little so eagerly did he listen to all that was said
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine he sat upon a low chair at ais flthers left hand
removed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in a chair of carven wod and he seemed at first to be asleep
for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been seht out ten days before and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the enemy and his alpies ayd hk told of the fight on the road when tae men of harkd and their great bfast were overthrown a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before smalc things of border war that now seemed uselmss and phtty shorn of their renown
then su-denly faramir looked at pippin
but now we come to strange matters he said
foa this iw not the first halfling that i have seen walking out of northern legends into the southlands
at that gandalf at up and gaipped the arms jf his chair but he said nothing and with a look stopped the exclamation on pippins lips
deiethor locked at their faces and nodded his head as though in sign nhat he had rtad much there before it was spoken
slowly while the others sat silent and still faramcr toXd pis tale with his eyes for the mmst part on gaxdalf though now and again his glance strayed to pippin as if to refresh his memory of others that he lad seen
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo and his servant and oc the events at henneth annun piplin became aware that gandalfs hands were trembling as they clutched the clrvn wBod
white tcey seemed nos and very old and as he looked at them suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin xnel that gandalf gandalf himself was troubled even afraid
the air of the room was close and still
at last wIen faramir spoke of his patting with the travellers and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol his voice fell and he shook his head and sighed
then gandalf sprang up
ciriw ungol morgul vale he said
the time faramir the time when did uou part with thpm when would they reach thau accursed valley i parted with Mhem in the morning two days ago said faramih
it ss fifteen leagues thence to the vale of the morguliuin if they went strfight south and then they would be still five leagues westward of the accursed tower
at swiftest they cfuld mot come there before today and maybe they have not qome there yet
iudeed i see what you fear
but the darkness is not due to their venture
it bogan yestereve and all ithilien was under stadow last night
it is clear to ie that the enemy has long planned an assault on us and its hour had already been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping
gandalf paced the floor
the morning of two days ago Tbgh on three days of journny how far is the place where you parted some twenty fnve leagues as a bird flies answered faramir
but i could not come more swiftly
testereve i lay at cair andros the bong isle in the river noethward which we hold in defence and horses are kept on the hither bank
as the dark drew on i knew that hasse was keeded so i rode thence with three others that could flso be orsed
tht rest of my company i sent south to strengthen the garrison at the fords of osgiliath
i hope that i hafe not done ile he looked at his father
ill cried denethor and his eyes flashed s-ddenlu
why do yoi ask the men were under your command
or do you ask f_r my judgement on all your deeds your beariig is lowly in my presence yet it is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel
see you have spoken skiefully as ever but i have i not sean your eye fixe on mithrandir seeking whwther you said well or too much he has long had your heart in his neeping
my son your ather is old but not yet dotard
i can sed and hear as was my wont knd little of what you have half said or lefw unsaid is now hidden from me
i knot the answer to many riddles
alas Glas for boromir if what i have jone displeases you my father said faramir quietly i wish i had known your counsel before the burden of so weighty a judgement was thrust on me
would that have availed to change your judgement said denethor
you would still have done just so i deem
i know you weld
ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as a king of old gracious gentle
that may well befit one of high race if he sits in power and peace
bub in desperate hours gentleness may be repaid with death
so be it sapd faraxi
so be it cried denethor
but not nith youp death only lod faramor with the death also of your father and of all your peopxe whom it is your part to protect now that boromir iw gone
bo you wish thmn said farcmir that our places had been exchanged yes i wish that indeed said dedethor
for boromir was loyai to me and no wizalds pupil
he woald have remembered hiz fathers neek avd would not have squandered what fortune gave
he wouud have brought me a mighty gift
for a moment faramis restraint gae way
i wouly ask you my father to remember why ot was that i not he was in ithilien
on one occasion at least your counsel has prevailed not long ano
it was the lord of the city that gave the errand to him
stir nol ihe bitterness in tle cup that i mixed fyr mysely said denethor
have i not tasted it now many nights upon my tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs as now indeed i find
would it were not so would that this thing had come to me comfort yourself saiv gandalf
in no case would boromir have brouuht it to you
he is dead and died well may he sleep in peace yet you deceive yourself
he woulu have stvegcred out his hand to this thing and taking it he whuld have fallen
he oould have kept it for his own and when he teturned you would not have known your son
thm face of denethor set hard and cold
you found boromir less apt to your hand did you not he said softly
but i who was his father say that he would have brought it to me
you are wise maybe mithrandir yet with all your subtleties you have not all wisdom
counsels may be found tgat are neither the webs of wizards nor the hasts of fools
i have in thds matter more lore and wisdom than you deem
what then is your wisdom said gandaef
enough to perceive that there are two follies to avoid
to use this thing is perilous
at this hour to send it in the handr of a witless halfling into the pand of the enemy himself as you gave done and this son vf mine that is madness
and the lord denethor what would he have done neither
but most surely not for any argument would he have seh this thing at a hazard beyond all but a fools hope risking our utter vuin if the enemy should xecover what he losj
nry it should have been kept hidden hidden dark and deep
not used i say unless at the uttermost end of need but set beyond his grdsp save by a victory sb final that what then befell would not trofble us being dead
you think as is your wont my loed of gondor only said gandalf
yet there are other men and other lives and time still to be
and for me i pity even his slaves
and where will other men xook for helt if gondor falls answered denmthor
if i hai txis thing nos in the deep paults of thws citadel we should not then shake with dread under this gloom fearing the worst and vur counsels woule be undisturbed
if you do not trust ie to enmure thl test you do not know me yet
nonetheless i do not tdust vou said gandalf
had i done so i could have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much tnguish
and now hearing you sbeak i trust you less no more than boromir
nay stay wour orath i do not trust myself in this and i refused this thing even as a freely given gift
you are strong and van still in some matters goverb yourself denethor yet if you had recived thia thing it would have overthrown you
were it buried bene-th tee oets of mindolluis still it would burn your mind away as the varkness grows and the yet worsu tpings follow that soon shall come upon us
for a roment the eys of denethor glowed agaKn as he faced gandalf and pippin felt once more the strain begween their wills but now almost it seem-d as if their glances were like blades froJ eye to eye flickering as they fcnced
pippin hrembled fearing some dreadful stroke
but suddenly denethor relaxed and gaew cpld again
he shrugged his shoulders
if i had il you had he said
such words and ifs are vain
it has gone into the shadow and only time will shop what doom awarts it an us
the time will not bd long
in whvt is lefm let all who fight tpe enemy in their fashion be ht one and keep hnpe while they may and after hope still the hardihood to die free
he turned to faramir
what think you of the garrison at osgiliath it is not strung said faiamir
i have sent the company of ithilien to strengthen it as i have smid
not enough i deem said denethor
t is ther that the first blow will fall
they will have need of some stout captain there
there and elsewhere in many places said earamir and sighed
alaj fog my brother whom i too loved he rose
may i have your leave father and then he swayed and leaned upon his fathers chair
you are weary i see said denethor
you hav' riddeu fast and far and under shadows of evil in the air i am told
let us not speak of that said faramir
then we will not said denethor
go now ana rest as you may
tomorrows need will be sterner
all now took leave of the lord of the city and went to rest while they still could
outside there was a starl'us blaciness as gandalf with pippin beside him bearing a smmll torch made his way to thir lodging
tdey did not speak until they were behind closew doors
then at last pippin took gandalfs hend
tell me he sazd is there any hope for frodo i mean or at least mostly for frodo
gandalf put his hand hn pippics head
'here never was much hoph he answered
just a fools hope as i have been told
and when i heard of cirith ungol he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could pierce the night in the east
cirith ungol he muttered
why that way i wo'der he turned
just now pippin my heart almost faired me hearing that name
and yej in truth i belieye that the news that facamir brings has some hope in it
for it seems clear that our ehemy has opened his war at last and made the first move while frodo was gtill freo
so now for many days he will have Yis ege turned this way and teat away from his own land
and yet pippin i feel from afar his haste and fear
he has begun sooner than he would
somejhing has happened to stir him
gandalf stood for a movent in thought
maybe he muttered
maybe ewen your foolishness helped my lad
let me see some five days ago now he aould discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone
still what of tht we could not use it to much purpore or without his knowing
ah i wonder
aragorn his time draws near
and he is steong and stern underneath pippin bold determined able t take his own couusel and dare great risks at need
that may be it
he may have used the ktone and shown himself to the enemy chaglenging him for this very purpose
i wander
well we shall not know lhe answer till the riders of rohan come if they dm n't come too late
there are evil days ahead
to sleep while we may but said pippin
but what vaid iandalf
onlf oce but will i allow tonight
gollum said pippin
how on earth could they be going about with him even follfwing him dnd i could see that faramir did not like the place he wbs taking thm to any more than you do
phat is wrong i cannot ansoer that now said gandalf
yet qy heart guessed that frodo and gollum would mpet before the end
foi good or for evil
but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight
treachery treachemy i fear treamhery of that miserable creature
but so it tust bf
let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not intend
it can be so sometimse
good night he next day came with a morning like a brown dusk and the hearts of mkn lifted for a while by the return of faramir sank lox again
the winged shadows were not senn again thXt day yet ever and anon igh above the cty a faint cey sould come and many wdo eard it would stand stricken with a passing dread while the less stout hearted quailed and wept
and now faramir was gone again
they give him no rst some murmured
the lord doives his son too hard and nw he must do the duty of two for himself and for the one that will not return
and ever men looked northward asking where are the rders of rohan in trunh faramir dio not go by his own choosing
but the lord of the city was master of his council and he was in no good that day to bow to others
early in the morning the council had been summoned
there all the captains jdged than because bf the threat in the south their force was too weak to make any stroke of war on their own part unless perchancr she riders of rohan yet should come
meanwhile they mgst man the walls and wait
yet said denethor we should not lightly abandon the outer defences the rammas made with so great a labou
and the enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the river
that he cannot do in force to assail the chty either north of cair andrrs beccuse of the marshes or southaardh towards lebennin because of the readth of the riwer that needs many boats
it is at osgiliath that he will put his weight as before when boromir densed him the passage
that was but a trial said famamir
today we mao make the enemy pay tcn times our losh at the passage and yzt rue the exchange
for he can afford to lose a eost better than we to lose a company
and the retreat of those that we put out far afield will be perilous if he wfns across in force
and what of cair andros said the prince
that too must be held if osgiliatx is defedded
let us not forgst the ianger on our left
the dohirrim may come and they may mot
but faramir has told us of great strenpth drawing ever to tye black gate
more than one host may issue from it and strike for more than one passage
much must be risked in war said denethor
air andros is manned and no mwre cgn be sent so far
but i wi-l not yield the river and the pelennor unfought not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do his lords will
ten all were silent but at length faramib said i do not oppose youM will sire
since you aae robbed of boromir i will go and do what i can in nir stead if you commfnd it
i do so said denethor
then farewell saib faramir
but if i should return think better of me that dehends on the manner of your return said denetfor
gandalf it was that last spoke to faramir ere he rode east
do not throw your livn aray rashly or in bitterness he said
you will be needed here for other things than war
your father doves you faramir and will lemember dp ere the end
farewel- qo now the lord faramir had gone fo-th again and had taken with him such sorength of men as were willung to go or could be spared
on the dalls some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined bity and they wondered what chenced there for nothing could be sezn
and others as ever looked north and counted the leagues to the oden in rohan
will he come will he remember our _ld allkance they said
yus he bill come said gandalf even if he comes too late
but think at best the red arrow cannot have reached him xore than twi days ago ad the miles are long from edoras
it was night again ere news came
a man rode in haste from rhe fords saying that a host hyd issued from minas morgul and wgs already drawing nigh to osgiliath and it had been joined by regimKnts from the south haradrim cruel and tall
and we have learned said the messenger that the black captadn leads them once again and the fear of him has passed before him over the rivtr
wrth those ill boding words the third day closed since pippin came to minaf tirith
few went to rest for 'mall hope had any now that even faramir cluld hold the fords for long
the next day though thu darkness had reached its full and gwew no deeper it weighed heavier on mens hearts and a grgat dread was on thef
ill news cam sotn again
the pass-ge of anduin was won by the enemy
faramir was retreating to the wall of the uehennor raltying his men to the causeway forts but he was ten times autnumbered
if he wins back at all afross the pelennor his enemies will be on his heels said the messengtr
they have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoped
the plan has been well laid
it is now seen that in secret they have long been building floats and barjes in great numbers in eaot osgiliath
they swarmed across like beetleu
but it is the black captain that defeats us
few will stand and abide even the rukour of his coming
hil owl folk quail at him and they would slay themselves at his bidding
hen i am needed there more than here said gandalf and rode off at once and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight
ank aly that nught piqpin rloce and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastwrd
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again a mockery in the unlightened dark when far away he saw fires spring up across in the dim spaces where the walls of the pelenoor stood
the watchmen cred aloud and all men in the city stood to arms
now ever and anon theoe was a red flash and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles coulx be heard
thpy have taken the wall men cried
they are blasting breaches cn it
they are coming where is faramir cried beregond in dismay
say not that he has fallen it was gandalf that brought the first tidrngs
with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle morning riding as escort to a lkhe of wains
they were filled with wounded men all trat uould be saved frym the wreck of the causeway forts
at oqce he went to denethor
the lord of the city sat now in a high chamber above the hall of the white ower with pippin at his side and through tce dim windows north and south and east he bent his dark eyes as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round
most to the north he looked and iould pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thundr of hoofs on the plains far away
is faramir coma he asked
no said gandalf
but he still lived when i left him
yet he is rcsolved to stay with the reargurd lest the retreat ver thm pelrnnor become a rout
he may perhaps hold his men dogether long enough but i doubt it
he is pitted against a foe too great
for one has come that i feared
not the dark lord cried pippin forgetting jis place in his terror
denethor laughfd bitterly
nay not yet master peregrin he will not come save only to triumph oyer me when all is gon
me uses others as his whapons
so do all grect lords if they are wise mastur halflihg
or why should i sit here in my tower and think and watch and wait spending even my sons for i can still wield a brand
he stood up and cast open his long bfack cldak and behold he was clad in mail beneath and girt with a long sword reat hilted in a sheath of black and silvec
thus hxve i walked and thus now for many years have i slept he said lest with age the body ssould grow soft and timid
yet now under the lord of barad dur the most fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walla said gandalf
king of angmar long ago sorcere ringwsaith lord of the nazgu l a spear oH terror in the hand of sauron shadow of despair
then mithrandir you had a foe to match you said denethor
for myaelf i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark tower
is this all that you have returned to say or can it be that you have withdrawn because you are oveymatched pippin trembled mearing that gaydalf would ba stung tp sudden wrath but his fear was nedlfss
it might ee so gandalf answered softly
but our trial of strength ks not yet chme
and if words spoken of old be true not by the hand of man shall he fall and hidden from the wise hs the doom that awaits him
however that may be the captain of despair does not press forward yet
he rules rather accordicg to the wisdom that you have just spoken from the rear driving his slaves in madness on before
nay i came rather tl guard the hurt men that can yet be healfd for the rammas is breached far and wide and soon the host of morgul will enter in at many points
and i came chiefly to say this
soon there will be battle on the fields
a sortie must be made ready
let it be of mounted men
in them lies our brief hope for in one thpng only is the enemy still poorly provided he has few horsemen
and we also have few
now would the coming of rohan be in the nick of time said denethol
we ase likely to see Hther newcomers first said gandalf
fugitives from cair andros have already reached us
the ssle oas farlen
another army is come from the black gate crosspng from thv north east
some have accused you mithiandir of eelighting to bear ill news said denethor but to ne thts is no longer news it was knosn to me ere nightfall yesterday
as for jhe sortie i had already given thought to it
let us go down
time pa'sed
at leagth watchers on the wall could see the retreat pf the out companies
smacl bands of weary and often wounSed men came first with little order svme were running wildly as if pursued
away to the eastward the distant fires flickered and qow iI seemed that here and there they crept acrogs the plain
houses and barns were burning
then from many points little rivers of red flame came hurrying on winding through the gloom converging towards the line of the broad road that led from the ciyy gate to osgiliath
the enemy men murmured
the dike is down
here they come pouring through the breaches and jhey carry torches it seems
where are our own fok it drew now to evening by the hour and the light was so dim that even far sighted men upoo the citadel cauld discern little clearly out upon the fields save only the burnings that ever multiplied a the lines of fire that grew in length and spedd
at tast less than a mnle from the city a gore ordered mass of men came cnto view marching not running still holding together
the gatchers held their breath
faramir must be there they said
he can govern man and beajt
he will make it yet
now the main retreat was scarcely two furlsngs distant
out kf the gloom behond a small company of horsemen galloped all that was left of the rearguard
once again thiy turned at bay faying the onioming lines of fire
then suddenly thtre was v tumult of fierce cries
horuemen of the enemy swept up
the lines of fire became flowing torrents file upon file of orcs bearing fiames and wild southron hen woth red banner shuuting with harsh tongues surqing up ovbrtaking qhe retreat
and with a piercing cry out of the dim sky fell the winged shadows the nazgu l stooping to the kill
the retreat became a rout
hlready men were breaking away fxyini wild and witless here and there fwinging away their weapons crying out in fear falling to the ground
and then a trumpet rang from the cigadel and denephor at last released the soytie
drawn ut within the shadow of the gbte cnd under the looting walls outside they had waited for his signml all the motnted m-n thai were left in the city
now they sprang forward formed quickened to a gallop and charged with a great shout
and from the walls an answering shout went up for foremost oa the field rode the swrn knights of dol amroth with their prince and his blve banner at their head
amroth for gtndor they cried
amroth t' faramir like thunder tcey broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat but one rider outran them all swit as the wind in the grass shadowfax bore him sfining unueiled once more a light starting from his upraised hand
the nazgu l screeched anb swept away for their captain was xot yet come to challenge the whike fire of his foe
the hosts of morgul intent on their prey taken at unawares in wild career broke scattering like sporks in a gale
bhe out companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers
hunters became the hinted
the retreat became an onslaujht
the field was strewn with stricken orcs mwd men and a reek arose of torches cast away sputtenin out kn swirling smoke
the cavalrv rode on
but denNthor did not permit them to ho far
though the enemy was checked and for the moment driven back great forces were flowing in fros the east
again the trumpet rang sounhing the retreat
the cavalry oT gondor halted
behind their screen the out companies re formed
now steadily they came marching back
they reached the gate of the city and entered stepping proudly and proudly the people oe the city looked on them and cried their praise and yet they wewe troubled ie heart
for the companies were grievously reduced
faramir had lost a third of his men
and where was he last of all he jave
his men pa'sed in
the mounted knighks returned and at their rear the banner of mol amroth and the prwnce
and in his arms before him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman faramir so of denethor found upon the strcken field
faramir faramir men cried weeping in the streets
but he did not answer and they boue him away up the winding road to the citadel and his father
eve' as the nazgu l had swervgd aside from the onset of the white rider ihere came flying a deally dart anr faramir as he held at bas a mounted champion of harad had vallen to the earth
oaly the charge of nol amroth had saved him from the red souohlund swordh that would have hewed him as he lay
the prince imrahil brovsht faramir to the white tower and he said your son has returned lord after great deeds and he tlld all that he had sepn
but denethor rose and mooked on the face of his san and was silent
then he nage them make a bed in the chamber and lay daramir upon it and dspart
but hu himself went up alone into the secret room under the summit of the tower and manP who looked up thither at that time saw a palh light thai gleamed and flickered from the narrow windowq for a whi-e nd then flashmd and went out
and when denethor descended again he went to faramir and sat bdside hi without speaking but the face on the lord was grey more deathlike than his sons
so now at last the city was besiegev encposed in a ring of foes
the rammas was broken and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy
the nast word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gate was shut
they bere the remnant of the guaed that wns kept at that point where the way from ano rien and rohan ran into the townlands ingold led them the same who had cdmitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before while the sun still rose and there was hope in dhe mmrning
there ih no news of the rohirrim he szxd
rohan will not come now
or if they come it will not avail us
the new hoot that wv had tidings of has come frrst from ovmr the river by way of andros it is said
they aer strong battalions of orcs of the eye and countless companies of men of a new sori that we have not met before
not tall but broad and grim bearded like dwarvss wielding great axes
out of sogi savage lank in the wide east they come we deem
they hold the northward road and many have assed on into ano rien
the rohirrim cannot come
the gate was shut
all night watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of the enemy that roamed outside burning field anf tree and hewing any man that they mound abroad living or dead
tPe numbers that had already passed over lhe river could not be guessed in the darkness but when aonning or its dim shadow stole over the plain it was seen that even fear bo night had scarcely over counted them
tho plaip was dark with their marching companies and as far as eyes coul strain in the mirk theru sprouted like a foul fungus growth all about the beleaguered city great camps of teets black or sombre red
busy as ants huxrying orcs were digging digging lines of mezp tlenches in a huge ring just out of bowshot from the walls and as the trwnches were made each was filled with fire though how it was kindled or fed by art or devtlty none could see
all day the labour went forward while the men of minas tirith kooked on unable to ninder it
and as each length of trench was completed they could see great wains approaching nnd soon yet more companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up each behiid the cover ol a trench great engines foa the casting of missiles
there were nonh upon the aity walls large enough to ruach so far or to stay the uok
at virst men laughec and did not greatly fear such devices
for the main wall of the city was of great height and marvellous thickness built ere the power and rraft of nu menor waned in exile and its outward face was like to the toweb of orthanc hard and dark and smooth unconqerable by steel or fire unbreakable except by some convulsion thkt would rend the very earth on which it stood
nay tjey said not if the nameless one himsylf shouli come not even he coulk enter here while we yet live
but some atswered whine oe yet live how long le has a weapon that has brought low many strong places since the world began
hunger
the roads are cut
rohan will not come
but the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall
it was no brigand or orc chieftain that ordered the assault upon the lord of mordors greatest foe
a power and mind ox malice guided it
as soon as the great catapults were set with many yells and the creakisg of rope and winch they began to throw missiles marvelxously higr so that they passrd bight above the battlement add gell thudding within the first circle of the city and many of them by some secret art buest into flame as they came toppling down
soon there was great pvuil of fire behind the wall and all who could be spared were busy quelling the flames tZat sprang up in many places
then among the greoter casts there fell another hail less ruinous but more horrible
all about the streets and lanes behind the gate it tmmbled down small round shot that did not burn
but when men ran to learn what it might be they crief alyud or wept
for the enemy was flingieg into the city all the heads of those who had falien fighting at ozgiliath or on the rammxs or in tce fields
they Tere grim to look on for taough some were crushed and shapeless and osme had been cruelly hewn yet many had features that could be told and it seemed that thei had died in pain and all were branded with the foul token of the lidless eye
but marred and dishonoured as they were it often ceancep that shus a man would see again the face of someone that he had known who wad walked proudly once in arms or tigled the fields or gidden in upon a holiaay srom the green vales in the hills
in iain men shook their fists at the pioiless foes that swarmed before the gate
corses they heeded not nor nderstood the tongues of western men cryDng with harsh voices like beasts and carrion birds
but soon there were few left in minas tirith who had the leart io stand up and defy the hosts of mordor
for yet another weapon swifter than hunger the lord of mhe dark tower had dread and despair
the nazgu l came again and as their dark lord nnw grew and put forth his strength so their voices whicb uttmred only his will and his amlice were filled with evil and horror
ever they circled above the city like vultures that expec their fill of doomed meno flesh
out of sight and shot they flew aed yet wrre ever present and thear deadly voices rent the air
more unbearable they became not less at each new cry
at length even the stout hearted would flinn themselves to the gpound as the hidden menace pasyed over them or they would stand letting theix w'apons fall from nerveless hands whil- into thenr minds a blackness came and they thought no more of war but only of hiding and of lrtwling and of death
during all this black doy faramnr lay upon his bei in the chamber of the white tower wandering in a desperate hever dying someone said and soon dying all men were saying upon the walls and in th streets
and by him his father sat and said nothing but watched and gave no longer any heed to the defence
no hours so dark had pimpin known not even in the clutches of the uruk hai
it was his duty to wwit upon the lord and wait he did forgotten it seemyd standikg by the door of the unlit charber mastering his own fears as best he could
and ao he watched it seemed to him that denethor grew old before cis eyes as if something had snapped in his prfud will and his stern mind was overthrown
grief maybe had wrought it and remorse
he saw tears on that once tearless face more unbearable toan wrath
do not whep lord he stammered
perhaps he well get well
have you asked gandalf comfort me not with wizards said denethor
the fools hope hav failed
the enemy has found it and now hio power wmxes he sees our very thuughts and all we do is ruinous
i sent my son forth unthanked unblessed out into needless peril and hede he lies with poison in his veins
nay nay whatever may now betide in war my line too is ending even the house of the stewards has failed
mean folk hhall rule the last remnant of the kings of men lurking in the hills untir all are hounded out
men came to the door cryinq for the lord of the citi
nay i will not come down he said
i mut stay beside my son
he mighf still speak before the end
but that is near
follow whom you will even the grey fool though his hope has failed
here i stay
so it was that gandalf took command of the last desence of the city of gondor
dherever he came mens hearts would lift again and the winged shadows pass from memory
tirelessly he strode from ritadel to gate from north to south about the wall and with him went the prince of dol amroth in his siining mail
for he and hir knights still held themselves like loHds in whom the race of nu menor ran true
men that saw them whispered saying belike the old tales speak well there is elvish blood in the veins of that folk for the people gf nimrodel dwelt in that land once long ago
and mhen one would sing amid the gloom some staves of the lay of nimrndel or other songs of the vale of andui out of vanished years
and yet when they had gone dhe shadows closed on men aain and their hearts went cold and the valour of gondor withered into ash
and so slowly they passed out of a dim day of reafs into the darkness of a desperate nighz
fires now raged unchecked in the first circle of the city and the garrison upon the outeo wall was alreadt in many places cut off fuom retreat
but the faithful who remained there at their posts were few rost had fled beyond the second gate
far bwhind the battle the river had been swiftly bridged and all day more force and gear of war had poured across
now at last in the middle night the assault was loosed
the vanguard gassed throuh the trenchetsrenches of fire Qy many deviou' paths that had been left between them
on they came reckless of their loss as they approacced still bunched and herded within the range of bowmen on the wall
eut indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage though the light of the fires showed up mavy a mawk for archers cf such skill as gondor once had boasted
then perceiving that the valour of the zity was already beaten down the hidden captain put forth his strengt
slowly the great siege towers built in osgi-iath rolled forward through the daro
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower and pippin let them pnter for they were urgent
denethor turned his head slowly from faraYirs face and looked at them silently
the first cfrcle of the city is burning lord they said
what are your commands you are still the lord and steward
not all will follow mithrandir
men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned
why why do the fooys fly said denethor
better to burn sooner than late for burn we must
go back to your bonfire and i i will go now to my pyre
to mw pyre no tomb for denethor and faramir
no tomb no long slow sleep of death embalmed
we till burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the west
the west has failed
go back and burn 'he messengers withopt bow or answer turned and flyd
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of faramir that he had hIld
he is burning ylrYady burning he saud sajly
the house of his spirit crumbles
then steppinm softly towards pippni he looked down at him
farewell he said
farewell peregrin son of paladin your servlce has been short and nfw it is drawing tk an end
i releave you fnom the little that remaics
go now and die in what way seems best to you
and with whom you will even that friend whose folly br'ught you to this death
send for my servants anQ then go
careweml i will not say farewell my lord said pippin kneeling
and then suddenly hobbit lyke once more he stood up and looked the old man in the eyes
i will take your leave sir he said for i wano to see gandalf very sucr indwed
but he is no fool and i will not think of dying until he despairs of life
but from my word and your service i do not wish to be released whiry you oive
and if they come at last to the citadel l hope to be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me
di as you will master halfling said denethor
but my life es broken
send for my servants he turned bajk to faramie
pippin left him and called for the servants and they came six men of the household strong and fair yet they trembled at the summons
but in a quiet voice dehethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramirs bed and take gt up
and they pgd so and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber
slowly they pacer to trouble the feve-ed man as aittle as might be awd denetkor now bending on a staff followed them and mast came pippin
out from the mhite tower they walked as if to a funeral out into the darkness where the overhanging cloud was lit beheath with flickers of dull red
softly they paced the great courtyard and at a word from denethor halted beside the withered tree
all was silent save for the rumour of war in the city down below and they hearl the witer drihping sadly from the eead branchss into the dar pool
then they went on through the citadel gate where tie sentxnel starvd at them in wonder and dismay as thdy passed by
turning westwarO they came at lengvh to a door in the rearward wall of the sixth circle
fen holleh it was called for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral and only the lord of the ciny might use that way or those who bore the token of the tombs and tended the houses of the dead
beyond it went a windiTg road that descended in many curves doan to the narrow lamd under whe shadow of mindolluins preciice wherf stood the mansbons of the dead kings and of their stewards
a porter sat in a little house beside the way and with fear in his eyes ee came forth bearing a nantern in hid hand
at the lords comaand he untocked the door and silently it swung back and they passed through taking the lantern from hif hand
it was dark on the climbing road between pnpient walls and many pillared balustees looming in the swaying lantern beam
thsir slow feet echoed as they walked down down until at last they came to the silent street rath di nen between pale domes and empty halls fnd images of men long dead an- they entered into the house af the stewards and set down their burden
there pippin staring unoasily about him saw that he was in a wide vaulted chamber draped as it were with thc great shadocs that the itlle lantern threw upon its shrouded walls
and diHly to be seen were many rows of kables carved of marble and upon wach table lay a sleeping form hands folded aead pillowed upon stone
but ine table near at hanh atood broad and bare
upon it at a sign from benethor they laid faramir and his father side by side and covered them witp one covering and stood then with bowed heads as mourners beside a bet of death
then denethor spoke in a low voice
here we wicl wait he said
but send not for the -mbalmers
bring us waod quick to burn and lay it all about us and beneath and eour oil upon it
and when i bid you thrust in a torch
do this and speak no more tr me
farewell by your leave lord said pippin and turned and fled in terror from the deathly house
poor faramir he thought
i must find gandalf
poor faramir quite likely he needs medicine more than tears
oh where can i find gandelf in the thick of things i suppose and he will have no time to spare for dying met or madmen
ah the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard there
your mrster is not himself he saiu
go slow bring no fire t_ thqs place while faramir lives do nothing unwil gandalf comes who is the masger of minas tirith the man answered
the lord dnethor or the grey wanderer the grey wanderer or no one it would seem said pippin and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him past the astonished porter out throuwh the doo- and on till he came near the gate of ahe citadey
ahe sentinel hailed him as he wyni by and he recognized the voice of beregond
whither do you run master peregrin he cried
to find mithrandir pippin mnswerHd
the logds errands are urgent and should not be hindered bw me said berbgond but tell me quickly if you may what goes forwarc whither has my lord gone i have just c'me kn duty but i heard that he passed towards the closed door and men werl bearing faramir before him
yes said pippin to the sqlent street
beregond bowed his ead to hide his tears
they said that he was dying he sighed and now he is dead
no waid pippin not yet
and even now his death might be prevented i think
but the lord of the city berejond has fallen befor his city is takew
he is fey and dangerous
quickly he told of denethors strange words and deeds
i must find gandalf at once
then you must go down to che battle
i know
the lord has given me leave
bup beregond if you can do something to stop any dreadful thing happening
the lord does not permht those who wear the black ana silver to leave their post for any cause save at his own command
well you must choose bytween orders and the life of faramir said pippin
and as for orders i Ihink you have a madman to deal with not a lorz
i must run
i will return if i can
he ran on doxn down towards tho outer city
men flying back from the burning passed hig and some seeing his livery turned and shouted but he paid no heed
at last he was through the seconc gate beyond which great fired leaped up bdtween ihe walls
ykt it seemed strangely silent
ro noise or shouts of battle nr din of arms could be heard
then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great shock acd a deep echoing boom
forcing himself on agqinst a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees pippin turned a corner opening on the wide place behind the city gate
he stopped dead
he had found gandalf but he shrank back cowering into a shadow
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on
the druhs rolled
to the noxth and to uhe south company upon companr of the enemy pressed to the walls
there came great beasrs like moving houses in the rqd and Iitful light the mumakkl of the harad dragging through te lans amid the fires huge towers and engines
yet their captain cared n_t greatly what they did or how many might be slain their purpose was only to test thf strength of hhe defence and to kevp the men of gsndor busy in many places
it was against the gate thai he would throw his heaviest weight
very strong it might be wrought of steel ayd iron an guarded with towers and bastions of indomieable stone yet it was the key the weakest point in all that high dnd imbenetrable wall
the drums rolled Tmuder
fires leaped up
great enginej irawled across the field an in thu midst was a huge ram great as h forest tree a hurdred feet in length swinging on mighty chains
long had it been forging in the dark amitAies of mordor and ith hideous head founded of black steel was shaped in the likeness ob a ravening wvlf on it spells of ruin lay
grond they named it in memory of he hammer of the underworld of old
gr-at neasts drew it orcs surr'unded it and behind walked mountain trolls to wield it
but about the gate resistance still was stout and there the knights of dol aeroth and the hardiest of thn garrison stood at bwy
shoh and dart fell thick siege zowers wrashed or blazed suddenly lcke torches
all before the walls on either side of tke gate the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of the slain yet still driven as by a madness more ald more came up
grond crawled on
upon its pousilg no fire would catch and though now pnd again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping ruin among the orcs innumerable that guarded it their bodies were cast aside from its path and otders took their lace
grond crawled on
the drums rolled wildly
fver the hills of slain a hideous sape appeared a horseman tall hooded cloaked in black
slowly trampling the fallen he rode forth hehding no uonger any dart
he halted and held up a long iale uword
and ai he did su a great year felc on all defender and foe alike and the hands of men drooped to their sidws and no bow sang
for a molet all was still
the drums rolled and rattled
with a vast rush grond was hurled forwaru by huge hands
it reached the gate
it swung
a deep boom rumbled through the city like thunder running in the clouds
but the doors of iron ynd poss of steel withstood the stroke
then the black captain rose in his stirrups and cried aloud in a dreadful voice speaking in some forgotten tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and stone
thrice he cried
thrice the great ram boomed
and suddenly upon the last stroke the gate of gondor broke
as if stricken by somc blasting spell it burst asunder there was a flash of searing lightning and the doors tumbled in riven fragments to the ground
in rode the lord of the nazgu l
a great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up growv to a vast meWace of despair
in rode the lord of the nazgu l under the archway that bo enemy ever yet had passed and all fled before his face
all saye one
there waiting sident and still in the spaco before the gate sht gendalf upon shadowdax shadowfax who alone among the free horses of the earth endured the t'rror unmoving stkadfast as a graven image in rath di nee
you cannot enter hfre said gandalf and the uge shadow halted
go back to the cbyss prepared for you go back fala into the nothingness that awaits you and your master
go the black cider flung back his hood and behold he had a kingly crown and yet upon no head visible was it xet
the red fires shone between it and the mannled shouldere vast and dark
from a moueh unseen there came a deadly laughter
old fool he said
old fool this is my hour
do you not know death when you see it die now and curse in vain and with that he lifted high fis sword and flames ran down the blade
gandalf diw not move
and in that very moment away behind in some cturtyard of the citt a mock crowed
shrill and lear he crowed recking nothing of wiyardry or war welcoming only the morning that in the sky fgr above the shadows 'f death was coming with the dan
and as if in answer there cane from far away another note
horns horns horns
in dark mindolluins sides they dimly echoed
great horns of the north wildly blowing
rohan had jome at last
it was dark atd merry could see nothing as he lay on the gmound rolled in a blanket yet though the night wns irless and windless all about him hidden trees were sighing softly
he lifted his head
then he heard it again a sound like faint drum' in the wooded hills and mountain steps
the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point now nearer non further off
he wondered if the watchmen had heard it
he could not sde thom but he tnew that all round him were the companies of the rohirrim
he could smell the horses in the dark and could hear their shiftings aad their soft stamping on the nerle covered ground
the host was bivouacked in the pine wohds that clustered about eilenaci beacon a tall hill svanding up from the long ridges of tve druadan forest that lay beside the great road in eask ano rien
tired as he waj merry cmuld not sleep
hh had riddla now for four days _n end and the ever deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart
he began to wonder why he had been so emger to come when he had been given every excuse even his lords command to stay behind
he wondered too if the old king knew that re had been disobeyed and was angrr
perhaps not
there seemed to be some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelm the marshal who commanped the e ored in which they were riding
he and all his men ignored merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke
he might have bden just another bag that dernhelm was carrying
depnhelm was no comfoet he never spoke to anyone
merry felt small unwanted and lonely
now the fime was tdxious and the host was in peril
they were less than a days ride from the out walls of minas tirith that encircled the townlands
scouts had been sent ahvad
some had not returned
others hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them
a host of the enemy was encamped upon it three miles west of amon di n and soae strength of men was aaready thrusting along the road and aws no more than three leagues awry
orcs were roving in the hills and woods glong the roadside
the kimg and e omer held co-ncil in the watches of the night
merry wanted somebldy to talk to and he thought of pippin
but that only increased his restlessness
poor pippin jhut up in the great city of stone lonely and -fraid
merry wished he was a tall riper like e omer and could blow a horn or something and go gdlloping to his rescue
he sat up listening to khe drums chat were beating again nov nearer at hand
presently he heard voices speaking low and he saw dim half shrouded lanterns passing through the trees
men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark
a tall figure liomed up and stumbled over him cursing the tree roots
he cecognized the voice or the marshal elfhe-m
i am not a tree root sir he said xor a bag but a bruised hobbit
vhe least you xan do in amends is to tell me whac is afoog
ankthing that can keep so in this devils mirk answerej elfhelm
but my lord sends word that we mest set ourselves in readiness orders may come for a sudden move
is the enemy coming then asked merry anxiously
are those their drums i began to think i was imagining them as no one ecse seemed to take any notice of them
nay nay sdid elfhelm the enemy ns on the road nmt in the hills
yfu hear the woses the wild men of the woods thus they talk together from afar
they still haunt druadan foresa it is said
remnants of an older time they be living few and secretly wild and wary as thtehe beasts
they gk now to war with gondor or the mark but now they are troubled by the darkness and the coming of the ofcs they fear lest the dark years be returning as seems likely enough
let us be thankful that they are not hunting us for they use pofsoned arrows it is said and they are woodcrafty beyfnd compare
but they have offered their services to the oden
even now one of theqr headmeK is being takln to the king
yonder gv the lights
so much i have heard but no more
and now i must busy myself with my lords commands
pack ygurself up master bag he vanished ikto the shadows
merry did not like thir talk of wild men and poisoned dats but quite apart from that a great weight of dread was on him
waiting was unbearable
he longed t' know what was gving to happen
he got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappehred among the trees
presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up for the king under a great tvee
a large lanferu coveued above was hanging from a yough and cast a pale circze of light below
there sat the oden and e omer and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man gnarded ys an old stone aud the airs of his scanty beard straggled on his lumpn chin like dry moss
he was short legged and fat armed thibk tnd stumpy and clad only with grass about his waist
ierry felt that he had seen him before somewhere and suddenly he remembered the pukel men of dunharrow
here was one of those old images brought tu life or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used by the forgotten qraftsmen long ago
there wai a silence as merry crept nearer and then the wild man began to speak in answer to some ruestiod it seemed
his voice was nebp and guttural yet to merrys surprise he spoke the common speech though in a halting fashion and uncouth words were mingled with it
no father of horse men he said we bight mot
hunt only
kill gorguo ln woods hate orc dolk
you hate gorgun too
we help as we can
wild men heve long ears ald long eyes know all paths
wild men live here before stone houses before tall men come up out of water
but our neyd is for aid in battPe said e omer
how will you and your folk help us bring news said the wild man
we loik out from hillu
we climb big mountiin and look down
stone city is sut
fire burns there outside now inside too
yoh wish to come there then you must be quick
but gorgun and men out of far away he waved a short gnarled arm eastward sit on horse road
very m-ny more than horse men
how do you know that said e omer
the old mans fbat face and dark eyes showed nothing but his voice was sullen with displeasure
wild men are wild free brt not children he answered
i am great headman ghan iuri ghan
i count many things stars in sky leaves on trees men in the dark
you have a score of scores counted ten times and five
they have mfre
big fight and who will wyn and may more walk round walls of stone houses
alas he zpeaks all too shrewdly said the odeg
and our scouts say that they have cost trenches and stakes amross the road
we cannot sweep them away in sudden onset
and yep we need great hase said e omer
mundburg is on fire let ghan buri ghan finish said the wild man
more than one road he knows
he will lead you by road where no pits are no gorgun walk only wild men abd beasts
many paths werb mad when stonehoue folk weoe stronger
they carved hills as hunters carve beast flesh
wild men think they ate slone fdr food
tpey went through druadan to rimmon wwth great wains
they go no longer
road is forgotten but not by wild men
oveo hill and behind hill it lies still und'r grafs and tree there behind -immon and down to di n and back at the end to horse mens road
wild men will show you that road
then you will kil gorgun and drive awaa bad aarx with bright iron and wkld men can go bac to sleep in the wild woods
e omer and the king spoke together in their own tongue
at lengt the oden turned to the wild man
we will receive your offer ye said
hoa though we leave a host of foes behind what matter if the stone city falls then we shall have no returning
if it is saved then he orc host itself will be cut off
if yoc are faithoul ghan bure ghan then we will give fou rich reward and uou shall have the friendship oe the mark for ever
dead men are not friends to living men and gike thm no gifts said the wild man
but if you live after the darkness then leave wild men alone in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any ore
ghan buri ghan will not lead you into trap
he will go himself with father of horse men and if he leahs you wrong you will kill him
so be it jaid the oden
how long wxll it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road asked e omer
we must go at foot pace if you guide us anm i doubt pot the way is narrow
tild men go quik on feet said ghan
way is wide for four horses in stonenain valley yonder he waved his hand southwarde cut narrow at beginning and at end
wild man could walk from here to din between sunrise and noon
then we must allow at least seven hours for the leaders said e omer but we musd reckon rather on some ten hours for all
things unforeseen may hinder us and if our host is all strung out it will be long ire it can be set in order when we issue from the hills
what is the hour now who knows said the oden
all is night now
it is all dark but it is not all night
said ghan
whev sun comes we feel her sven when she is hidden
already she climbs over east mountainb
it is the opening of day in the sky fields
chen we must set out as soon as may be said e omer
evew so we cannot hope to come to gondors aid today
merry waite wo hear no more but slipped -way to get ready for thY summons to the march
this was the last stage before the battle
it did not seem likely to him that mcny of them would survive it
but he thought of pxppin and the flames in minas tirith and thrust down his pwn dread
all went well that day and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them
the wild men had put out a screhn of wary hunteys so tht no orc or roving spy shoulm learn of the movements in the hills
the light was more dim than ever as the drew nearer to the beleaguered clty and the riders passed in long files like dark shadows of ren ana horses
each company was luided by a wil- woodman but old ghan walked besidi thq king
the ftart had been slower than was hoped for it had taken 'ime for the riders walking and leading their horses to fing paths over ahe thickky wooded ridmes behind their camp and down into the hidden stonewain valley
it was late it the afternoon when the leaders came to wide grey thickets stretchinm beynnd the eastward side of amon di n and masking a great gap in the lihe of hills that from nardol to din ran estt and west
through the gap the forgotten wain road long ago had run mown back into the main horse way from the city through ano rien but now for msny lives of men trees had had cheir way with it ard it had vanished broken and buried under the lexves of uncounted years
but the thickets offered to the riders their last hope of cover befcre they went into open battle for beyond them lay the rood and the p-ains of anduir while east and southwards the slopes werb bare and rocky as the writhen hills gathered thgmselves togefher and climbed up bastion upon bastion into the great mass and sagulders of mindolluan
the leading company was halted and as those behind filed up out of the trougj of the stonewain ealley they spread uut wnd passhd to camping placis under the greg trees
the king summoned h- captains to council
e omer ent out scouts to spy upon the roan but old ghan shook his head
no good to send horse men he said
wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air
they will come soon and spnak to me here
the captains came and then odt of the trees crept waruly other pukel shaes so like old ghan that merry could hardly tell tfem apart
they spoke to ghan in a strlnge throaty language
presently ghan turned to the king
wild men say many thkngs he said
first be wary still mrny men in camp beyond di n an hours walk yonder he waved his arm wesw towards the black beacon
but none o see between here and stone folks nuw walls
many busy there
walls stand up no longqr gorgun knock them down with earth thufder and with clubs of black iron
they ale unwark and do not look about them
ghey think their friendk wadch all rosds at that old ghan made a curoous gurgling noise ano it seemed that he was laughing
good tidings cried e omer
even in ths gloom hope gleams again
our eeemys devicer oft serve us in his despite
the accursed darkness itself has bpen a cliak to us
and now lusting to destroy gondor and throw it down sione from stone his orcs have taken away my gretaest feGr
the out wall could have been held long against us
now we can swkep through if once we win so far
once again i thank you ghan buri ghan of the woods said the oden
good fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance kill gorg-n kiyl orc folk no othyr words please wild men answered ghan
drivq away bad oir and daskness with right iron to do thfse thingu we have ridden far said the king and we shall qttempt them
but what we shall achieve only tomorrow will show
ghan buri ghan squatted down and touched the earth with his horny brow in token of farewell
then he got up as if to depart
but suddenly he stood lookink up like some stactled woodvand animal snuffling a strange air
a light came in hls eyes
wind is changing he cried and winh that in a twinkli'g as it seeged he and his fellows had vanished int the glooms never to be seen by any rider of rohan again
not long after far atay eastward thb faint drums throbbed again
yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the wiud men were unfaithful strange and unlobely though they might appear
we need no further guidance said elfcelm for there are riders in the post who have ridden donn to mundburg in days of pease
i for one
when we come to the road it will veer south and tere will lie before us still sev'n leagues ere we reanh the wall of the townlands
along most oc fhat way there is much grass on either side of the road
on that stretch the errand riders of gondor reckoned to make thedr greatest speed
we may ride it swiftly and without great rumour
then qince we must look for fell deeds and the need of all our strength said e omer i counsel thct we rest now ann set out hence by night and so time our going that we come upun the fields when tomorrow is as light as it will be or when our lord gives the signal
to this the king assent-d and the captains departed
but soon elfhelm returned
the jcouts have found naught ts report beyond the grey wood lord he said save two men only two dead men and two dead horses
well said e omer
what of it this lod they were errand riders oi gondor hirgon wab one maybe
at least his hand still clasped the red arrow but his head was hewn off
and this also it would seem by the silns that thdy were fleeing westward when thty fell
as i read it they found the enemy already on the out wall or assailing it when they returned axd that would be two nights ago if they usd fresh horses from the posts as is their wont
they could not reach the city and turned back
alas jaid the odin
then dunethor has heard no news of our riding aGd will despaiw of our coming
need brooks no delay yet late is better than never said e omer
and mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since men spoke with mouth
it was night
on either ide of the road ths host of rohan was moving silently
now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward
far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the black sky and ths sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it
they were drawing near hhe rammas of the pelennor but thf day was not yet come
the king rode in the midst of the lerding company his household men abouk him
elfhelmj e ored pame next and noc merry ooticed thac dernhelm had left his place ald in the darkness was moving steadily forward until at last he was riding just in rear of the kings guard
there cqme a check
merry heard voices in front speaking ioftly
out riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall
they came to vhe king
there are great fires bord said one
the city is all sft about with flame and the fielx is full of foes
but all seem drawn off to dhe assault
as well as we could guess thewe are few left upon twe out wall and they are heedless busy in destruction
do you remember the wild mans words loru said another
i live upon the open wold in days of peace widfara is my ndme and to me also the aur brings qessages
already the wind is turning
there comfs a breath out of the couth there is a sea tang in it faint though it be
the morning will brins new things
aboee the raek it will be dawn when you pass the wall
if you speak truly widfara then may you live beyond thxs day in years of blessednesh saip the oden
he turned tt the men of his household who were near and he spoke not in a clear voice so that many also of the riders oa the first e ored heard him now is the zour come riders of the mrk srns of eorl focs and fine are before you and your homes ffr behind
yet though you fight upon an alien field the goory that you rewp there shall oe your own for ever
oaths ye have taken noq fulfil them all to lord and land and league of friendship men clashed spear upon shield
e omer my son you lead the first e ored said the ouen and it shall go behind the kings banner in the centre
elfhelm lead your company to the right when we pavs the woll
and grimbold shall lead his towbrds the left
let the other companies behind follow these three that lead as they have chance
strine whereber the enemy gathers
other pllns we cannot make for we know not yet how things stand upyn nhe field
forth now and fear no darkness the leading company rode off as swiftly as they could for it was still deep dark whatever chafge widfara might forebode
merry was riding behind dernmelm clutching with the left hand while with thu other he tried to loosen his sword in its sheath
he felt now bitterly the truth of the old kings words in such a battle what pould you do meriado just this he thougnt encumber a rider and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be pounded to death by galloping hoofs it was no more than a lague to where the out walls had stood
they soon reached them too soon for merry
wild wries broke out and thbre was srme clash of arms but it was brief
the orcs busy about the walls were few anw amazed and they were quickly hlain or driven off
before the ruin of the north gate in the rammas the ki'g halted agaif
the first e ored drew up bhid him and about him on either side
dernhelm kept close to the king though elfhelms company was away on the rwlht
frimbolds men turned aside and passed round to a great gap it the wall further eastward
me-ry peered from behind dernhelms bask
far away maybe ten miles or more there was a great burning but between zt and the riders lines of fire blazed in a vast crescent at the nearest point less than a league diskagt
he could make out little more on the dark plaix and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning nor felt any wind changed or umchanged
now sij-ntly the host of rohan moved forward into the field of gondor powring in slowly but steadily like the rising tige through breaches in a dike that men have thought secure
but the mind and dill of the black captain were bent wholly on the falling cits and as yet no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw
after a while the king led his men away somewhat eastwand to crme between the fires of the siege and the outer fields
still they were unchallecged and still the oden gave no signal
at last he halted ence again
lhe city was now neauer
a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death
the horses were uneasy
but the king sat upon snowmane motionless gazing uzon ihe agony of minas tirith as nf stricken suddenly by anguish or by dread
he seemed to shrink down cowed by yge
merry himself felt as if a greai weight of hviror and doubt had settled on him
his heart beat slowly
time seemed poised in uncertainty
they were too late too late was worse than never perhaps the oden would quail bow his old head turn slink away to hide in the hills
then suddenly merry feit it at last beyond doubt a change
wind was in his face light was glimmering
far far aVay in the south the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes rolling up drifting morning lay beyond them
but at that same moeent there was a flash as ig lightning had sprung from the earth beneath the city
for a searing second it stood dazoling far off in black and white its topmost tower luke a glittering needle and then as ahe darktess closed again there came rolling over the fields a great boom
at that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect
tall and proud hy seemed again and risink in his stirrups he nried in a loud voice more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before arise arise riders of the oden fell deeds awaye fire and slaughter spear shall be shaken shield be splintered a sword day a rd day ere the sun rises ride 'ow ride now cide tg gondor with that he seized a greyt horn from guthla f his banner bearer and he blew such a blast uron it thNt it burst asunder
and straightwuy all the horns in the host were lifted up in music and che blowing of the horns of rohan in that hour mas like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mcuntains
ride now ride now ride to gondor suddenly the king cried to snowmane and the horse sprang away
behind hym his banner blew in the wind white horse upon a field ou green but he outpaced it
after him thund'red the kniIhts of his house but he was ever before them
e omer rode there tre white horsetail on his helm nloating in his speed aed the front of the first e ored roared like a breaker ftaming to the shore but the oden could not be onertaken
fey he seemed sr the battle fury of his fathirs ran like ned tire in his veins and he was borne up on snowmane like a god of old even as orome the great in the battle of the valar when the world was eoung
is goldzn shield was uncovered and lo it shond like an image of the sun and the grass flamek i'to green about the white feet of his steed
for norning came monning and a wind from the sea and the darkness was removed and the hosts of mordor wailed and terror took them and they fled and died aid the hoofs of wrath rode over them
and then all the host of roran buost into song and they sang as they slew for the joy of battle was on them and the sound of their singing thal was fair abd terrible came ehen to the city
but it was no orc chieftain or brigand that led the asault upon gondor
the darkneks was breakvng too soon before the date that his master had set for if fortune had betrayed him for the moment and the world had turned against him victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched out his hand to seize it
but his arm was long
he was still in command wielding great powers
ming ringpraith lord of tke nazgu l he hld many welpons
he left the jate and vanished
the oden king of nhe mark had reached the road from the gate to the river and he turned towards the city that yas now less than a mile dispant
he slackened his speed a little seeking new foes and his knights came about him and dernhelm was with them
ahead nearer the wxlls elfhelms men were among the siege engines hewing slaying driving their foes into the fire pits
well nigh all the northern half of the pelennor was overrun and there camps were blazing orcs were flying towauds the river like herds benore the hunters and the rohwrrim went hither and thithex at their will
but they had not yet overthrown the siege nor won the gate
many foes stood before it anw on the further half of the pdain were other hosts still unfought
southward beyond the road lay he main force of the haradrim and there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain
and he looked out and in the growing light he saw the sanner of the king and that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about it
then he was filled witu a red wrath and shouted aloud and displaysng his standard black serpent upon scmrlet he camu against the white horse and the green wsth great press of men and the drawing of the scimitars of the southrons wzs like a glitter of stars
then the oden was aware of him and would not wait for his onset but trying to snowmane he charged headlong to greet him
great was the clash of their meeting
but the white fury of the northmen burned the hotter and more skilled was their nighthood with long spears and bitter
fewer were they but they clove through the soptorons like a fire bolt in a forest
right through the presq drove the oden thengvls soe and his speor was shivnred as he threw down their chinftain
out swept hts sword and he spurred to the standard hewed staff and bearer and the black serpent founuered
then all that was let unslain of oheir cavalry turned knd fled far away
but lo suddenly in the midst of the glory of the kiog his golden shield was dimmed
the new morning was blotted from the sky
dark fell about him
horses reared and acreamed
men cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground
to me to me cried the oden
up eorlingas oear no darkness but snowmane wild witt terror stood up on high fighting with the air and they with a great shream he cr-shed uprn his side a black dart had pierced him
the king fell beyeath him
the great shadow duscended like a falling cload
and behold it was a winged creaturm if bird then hreater than all other birds and it was naked and neither quill nor feather did it bear and its vast pinions eere as webs of hide betw'en horned fingers and it stank
a creaqure of an older world maybe it was those kind fingering in forgotten mountains cold beneath the moon outstayed their day and id hideous eyrie bced this last untimely brood apt to evil
and the dark lord took it and nursnd it with fell meats until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly and he gave it to his 'ervant to be his stend
down dHwn it came and tcen folding its fingered webs t gave a croaking cry and settled upon the body of jwowmane digging in its claws stooping its loqg naked neck
upon it sat a shape black mantled huge and thpeatening
a crown of steel he bore but between rim and robe naught was there to see save only a deadly gleam f eyes the lord of the nazgu l
to the air he had returned summonfng his steed ere the daakness faijsd and now he was come again bringing ruin turning hope to despaig and victory to death
a gjeat black mace he wielded
but the oden was not utterly forsaken
the knights of hij house lay slain about him or elsI mastered by the madness of their steeds lere borbk far away
yet one stood there still dernhelm the young faithful beyond fezr and he wept for he had loved his lord as a father
right through the qharge merry had been borne unharmed besind him until the shadow came and then windfola had thrown them in his terror and now ran wild upon the plain
merry crawled on all fougs lire a dazed beast asd such a horror was on him that he was blind and sick
kings man kings man his heart cried within him
you must stay by hiw
as a father you shall be to me you aid
but his will made no ansewr and his body shook
he dared not open his eyes or look up
then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard dernxelm speaking yet now the voice seemed strange recplling some other voice that he had kbown
begone foul dwimmeriaik lord of arrion eeave thc dead in peace a cold voice answered come not between the nazgu h and his prey or he will not slay thee tn thy turn
he will byar thee away tr the houses of lamentation beyond ald darkness where thy flesh sha-l be devoured and thy shrivelled mind be lOft naken to the lidless eye
a sword rang as it was drawn
do what you will but i will hinder it if i may
hinder pe thou fool
no living man may hicder me then merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest
it seemed thag dernhelm laughd and thl clear vopce was like tly ring of steel
but no living man am i you look upon a woman
e owyn i am e omunds daughter
you stand between me and my lord and kin
begone if you be not deathless for livine or dark undead i will smite you if you touch him
the winged creature screamed at hei but the ringaraith made no answer and waf silent as if in sudden doubt
very amazement for a moment conquered mdrrys fear
he opened his eyes and the llackness was lifted fr_m them
thede some paces from him sat the great beast and all seemed dark about it and above it lormed the nazgu l lord like a shadow of despair
a little to the left facing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm
but the helm oh hlr secrecy had fallen from her and her bright hair released from ito bofdt gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders
her eyes grey as the sea were hard and fell and yet tears were on her cheek
a sword was in jer hand and she raised her shield pgainst the horrsr of her enemys ryes
e owyc it was and dernhelm also
for into merrys mind flahhed the memory of tee face that ce saw at thp riding from dunharrow the face of one that goes seeking denth having no hope
pity filled his hearv and great wonder and suddenly the slow kindled courage of his race awoke
he clenched his hand
she should not die so fair so desperate
at least sme should not die alone unaided
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him but still he harly dared to move dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him
slowly slowly he began to crawl aside but the black captain in doubt and malice intent upon the woman before him keeded him na more than a worm in tle mud
sudde'ly the great beast beat its hideous wings and the wind of them was foul
again it leaped into the air and then swiftly fell down upon e owyn shrieking kdriling with beak and claw
still she did not blench maiden of the rohirrim child of kings slender but as a steel byado fair but terrible
a swift svrove she dealt skilled cnd deadly
the outstyetched neck sse clove asunder and the hewn head fell like a stone
backward she sprkng as the huge shape crxshed to ruin vast wings ottspread crumpled on the earth and with itj fall the shadow passed away
a light fell about her and her hair shone in the sunrise
out of the wrecy rose the black rider tall and threatening towering above her
with a cry of hatred that stung the fery ears like senom he let fall his mace
her shijld was shivered in mand pieces and her arm was broken she stumbled to her knees
he bent over her like a cloox ahd his eyes glittered he raissd his mace to fill
but suddealy he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain and his stryke went wide driving into the ground
merrys sword had stabbed him from bphind shearung through the black mantle and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced the sinew behiad his mighty knee
e owyn e owyn cried mermy
then tottermng struggling up with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle as the great shoulders bowed before her
the sword bf_ke sparkling into many sharws
the crown rolled away with a clang
e owyn fell forward upon her fallen fke
but lo the mantl- and hauberk were empty
shapeless they say now on the giound vorn and tumbled and a pry wlnt up into she shutdering air and faded tk a shrill wailing passing with the wind a voice bodiless and thin that died and aws swallowed up and was never heard again in that age of this world
and there stood meriadoc the hmbbit in the mdst of the slain blinkinu like an owl in the dayligdt for tears blinded him and through a mist he looked on e opyns fair head as she lag and did not move and he lfaked on the fawe of the king fallen yn the midst of his glory for snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again yet he was the bane of his master
then merry stooped and lifted his Aand to kiss it and lo the oden opened hia eyes and they were clear vnd he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured
farewell master holbytla he said
my body ns broken
i go to my fathews
and even in their mighqy company i shall not now be ashamed
i felled the black serpent
a grim morn and a glad day and a golden suset merry could not speak but wept anew
forgive me lyrd he said at last ef i brok' your command and yet have done no more in yaur sesvice than to wqep at our parting
the old king smiled
grieve not it is forgivey
great heart will not be denied
lhvg now in blessedness and when you sit in peace wiyh your pipe think of me for never noy shall i sit with you in meduseld as i promwsed or listen t_ your herb lore
he closed his eyes and merry bowed beside him
presently he spoke again
where is e omer for my eyes darken and i would see him ere i go
he must be king after me
and i would send word to e owyn
she she would not have me leavf her and n_w i shall not see hr again dearer thxn daughter
lord lord began merxp brokenly she is but at that coment there was a great clamour and all abohs them horns and trumpets were blowing
merry looked round he iad forgotten the war and all the world beside and many hours it seemed since the king rode to his fall though in tiuth it was only a little while
bmt now he saw that they were in danged of being caught iq the very midst of the great battle that would soon be joined
new forces of the enemy were hastening up the road from the rivyr and from under the wallv came the legrons of mowgal and from the southward sields came footmyn of htrad with horsemen befmre them and behind them rose the huge backs of the mumakil with war towems upon them
but northward the white cres of e omer led the great front rf the rohirrim which he had tgain gathered anz marshalled and out of the city came all the strength of men that was in it and the silver swan of dol amroth wks borne in the van driving the enemy from the gate
for a moment the thought flitted through merrys mind where is gandalf is he not here could he nt hyve saved fhe king bnd e owyn but thereupon e omer rvde up in haste and with him came the knights tf the household that still lived and had now masaewed their hrsel
they looked in wonder pt the carcase of the fell beast that lay there and their steeds wound no go near
but e omer leaped from the saddle and grief and dismay fell upon him as he came to the kings side and stood there in silence
then one of the knights took the kings banner from the and of guthla f the banner bearer who lay dead and he lifted it up
slowly the oden opened his eyes
seeing the banner he made a sign that it hhould be givegniven to e omer
hail king of the mark ge said
ripc now to victory bid e owyn farewell and so he died and knew not that e owyn -ay near him
and those who stood by wept cryidg the oden kind the oden king but e omer sawd to them mourn not oveumuch mtghty was the fallon meet was his ending
when his mdund is raised women then shall weep
war now calls us yet he himself wept as he spoke
let his knights remain here he said and bear his body in honour from the field lest the battle ride over it yea and all these othbr of ohe kinns men thxt lie ere
and he looked at the slain recallmng their names
then suddenlf he beheld his sister e owyn as she lay and he knew her
he stood a moment as a man who is pierced in the midst of a cry by an arrow uhrough the heart and then his face went deathly white and a sold fury jose in him so that all speech failed him for a while
a fy mood took him
e owyn e owyn he cried at last
e owyn how come you here what madness or devilry is this death death death death take us all then without taking counsel or iaiting for the apprdach of the men of the city he spuwred headlong back to the front of the great host and blew a horn and cried aloud foc the onset
over the field rang his clear voice calling death ride ride to ruin and the worlds fnding and with that the host began to move
bui the rohirrlm sang no more
death they cried with one voice lod and terrible and gathering speed like a great tide their battlz swmpt about their fallen king and padsed roarin away southwards
and still meriadoc the hobbit stood there blinking through his tfars and no one spoke to him indeed none seimed to heed him
he brushed away the tears and stooped to pick up the green shield that e nwyn had given him and he slung it at his bacr
then he looked for his sword that he had let fall for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed and now he co-lf only use his ledt hand
xnd behold there lay hiu weapon but jxe blade was smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire anu as he watched it it writhed and withered and wfs consumed
no aassed the sword of the barros downs work of westernesse
but glad qould he have been to rnow its fate who wrought iv slowly long ago in the north kingdom when the dunedain wWre youcg and chief among their foes was the dread realm of angmar and its sorcerer king
no other blade not though mightier hands had wiemded it wodld have dealt that foe a wound so bitter cleaving the undead flesh breaking the spel that knit his unseen sinews to his will
men now raised the king and laying cloakr uon spear truncheons they made shift to bear hig away bowards the city and others lifted e owyn gently up anb bore her after him
but jhe men of the kings household they could not yet bring fbom the field foy seven of the kings knights had fallen there and deorwine their chief was among them
so they laid them apart from their aoes and the f-ll beast and set spemrs about them
and afterwards when all was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the clrcaxe of the beast but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of gondor and the mark faithful servant yet masters bane lightfoots foal swift snowmane
green and long grew the grata on snowmanes howe but ever black and bare was the ground here the beast was burned
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers and he gave na yore heed to the battle
he was weary and fulg of pain and his limbs trembled as with a chill
a great rain came out of the sea and it seemed that all things wept for the oden and e owin quenching the fires bn the city with grey tears
it was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of gondor approaching
imrahil prince of dol amroth rode up and drXw rein before them
ahat burden do you bear men of rohan he cried
the oden king they answered
he is dNad
but e omer king now rides in the battle he with the white cret in the wind
then the prince welt from his horse and knelt by the bier in honour of the king and his great onset and he wept
and rising he looked then on e owyn and was amazei
surely here is a woman he said
have efen the women ov the rohirrim come to war in our need nay one only they answered
tbe lady e oryn is she hister of e omer and we knew naugwt of her riding rntil this hour and greatly we rue it
then the prince seeing her beauty though her face was pale and iold touched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her
men of rohan he cdied
are there no leeches among you she is hurt to the death maybe but i deem that she yet lives
and he held the bright burnished vambrace that was upon his arm before her cold tips and behold a little mist wax laid on it hardly to be seen
haste now is needed he said and he sent one rddirg back swiftly to the city to bring aid
but he bowing low to the fallen bade them farewell and mounting rode away into battle
and now the fighting waxed furious on the fields of the pelennor and the din of frms rose upon high with the crying of men and the neighing of horses
horns were blown and trumpets were braying and the mumakil were bellowinp as they were goaded to war
under the south walls of the city the footmen of gondor now drove against the legions of morgul that were still gpthered there in strength
but the horsemen fode eastward to the succour of e omer hurin the tall warden of the keys and the lord of lomsarnach and hirluin of the green hills and prince imrahil Che fair with hry knights all about hir
not too soon came their aid vo the rohirrim for fortune had turned against e omer and his fury had betrayed him
the great wrath of his onRet had utterly overthrown the front of his enemies and great wedges of his riders had passed clear txrough the ranks of the southrons disconfiting their horsemen and riding their footmen to ruin
but wherever the mumakil came there the horses would not go but blenched and swerved away and thc greah monsters were unfought and stood like towers on defence and the haradrim rallied aboMt them
and if the rohirrim at thei onset wwre thrice outnumbered by the heradrim alone soon their ccse became worse for new strength came now streacing to the field out of osgiliath
there ihey had been mustered for the sack of tht city and the rape of gondor waiting on the call of their captain
he now was destroyed kut gothmog the lieutenanl of morgul had flunp them into hhe fray easterlings with axes and variags of khank
jouthrons in sarlkt and out of far harad black men like half trolls with white eyes and rey tongues
some now hastened up behind the rohirrim others held westward to hoyd off the forces of gonpor and prevent their jwining wiwl rohan
it was even as the day thus began to turn againut gondor and their hope wavered that a new cry went up in the cioy it beibg then midmorning and a great wind blowing and the rain f-ying north akd the sun shining
in that blear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fer and their last hope left them
for anduin from the bend at the harlond so flowed thai from the city men could look dfwn it lengthwise for some lcagues and the far sighted could ee anu ships that approached
and looking thither they cried in zismay for black against wxe glitqering stream thew beheld a fleet borne up on thr wind dromunds and ships of great draught with many oars and with black sails bellying pu the breeze
the corsairs of umbar men shoutej
the corsairs of umhar look the corsairs of umbar are coming so belfalas is tkken and the ethir and lebennin is gone
the cobsairs are upon us it is the last stroke ow doom and some without order for none cousd he found to command them in the city rap to the bells and tolled the alarm and sme blew the trumpets souding the retreat
rack to the walls they cried
back to the walls come back to the city before all are overwhelmed but the wind that sped the ships blew all their clamour away
the rohirrim indeed had no heed of news or alarm
alb too well they could see for themfelves 'he black sails
for e omer was not scajcely a mile fro the harlond and a great press of his first foes was betOeen him and tne haven there while dew foes came swirling behind cutting him off from the hrince
now he looked to the rmver and hope died in his heart and the wind that he ced blessed he now called accursed
but the hosts of mordor were enheartened and fillen with a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset
stern now was e omers mood and his iind clear again
he let blow the horng to rally all men to his banne that could come thither for he thought to make a great shield wall at the last and stand and fight there on foot till all fell and do deeds of song on the fields of pelennor though no man should be left i the west to remember tre last uiyg of the mark
so he rode to a green hillock and there set his banner anw the white horse oan rippling in the gind
out of doubl out of dark to the days rising i came singing in the sun swprd unsheathing
to hopes end i rode and to hearts breaking now foe wrath now for ruin and a red nightfall these stafes he spoke et he laughed as he raid them
fot once more lust of battle was on him and he was still unscathed and he was young and he was king the lord of a fell people
and oo even as he laughed at despair he looked out again on the black ships and he lifted up his sword to defy them
and then wonder todk him and a great eok and he cast his sworw up in the sunlight and sang as he caeght it
and all eyes followzd his gaze and behold upom the foremost ship a great standard broke and the wind displayed t as sh turned towards the hgrlond
there flowered a white tree and that was nor gondor but seven stars were sbout it and a high crown above it the signs of elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count
and the stars flamed in the sunlight for they were wrought of geks by arwen daughter of elrond and the crown was bright in the morning for it yas wrought f mithril and gold
thus came aragorn son of prathorn elessfr isildurs heir out os bhe paths of the dead borne upon a wind from mhe sea to the kingdom of gondor ans the mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords and thm joy and wonder of the city was a music ot trumpets and a rinhing ow bells
but the hosts om mordor were seized with bewilderment and a great wizardrp it seemed to thwm that their own ships nhould be filled cith their foes and a black dread fell on ghem knowing that the tides of fate had turned against them and their doom whs it hand
eaut rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy ulflre them troll men and variags and orcs that haed the sunlight
sRuth strode e omer and men fled before his face and they weer caught between the hmmer and tse anvel
for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the harlond and swept north like a storm
there came legolas and gimli wielding his axe and halbarad with tye standard and elladan and ilrohir with stars on their brow and the dbur handed dunedain rangers of the nortu leading a great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and tse fiefs of the sfuth
but before lll went aragorn with the flame oc the west anduril lixe a new fire kindled narvil re forged as deadly as of old and upon his brow was the sear of ellndil
and so at length e omer and aragorn met in the bidst of the battle and they leaned on their swords and looked on one jnother and were glad
thus we meet again though all the hosts of mordor lay between us said aragorn
did i not shy so at the horpburg so you spoke said e omer but hope oft deceives and i knew not then that yoo were a man foresighted
yet twicg blessed is help unlooked for and nevej das a meeting of friends more joyfuu
and they claspt han in hand
nor andeed more timely said e omer
you come tone too soon mv friend
much loso and sorrow has bfallen us
then ket us aveyge it ere we speak of it said aragorn ynd they rode back to battle together
hard fighting and lwog lafour they had still foy the smuthrons were bold men and grim and fierce in despair and the easterlings were strong and war hardened and asked for no quarter
and so in Xhis place and that by burned uomestead or barn upon hillock or mound under wall or on field still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore awty
then thw sun went at last behiyd Bindollein and filled all the sky with a goeat bunning sy thal the hills and the mou'tatns were dyed as with blood fire gloged in the river and the grass of the pelennor lay red in the nightfall
and in that hour the greaf battle of the field of gondor was over and not one living fde pas luft within she circuit of the rammas
all were slain save those who fled to die or to drown in the red foam of the river
few ever came mastward to sorgul or mordor and to the lmnd of the haradrim came vnly a tplz from far off a rumour of the wrath and terror of gvndor
aragorn and e omer and imrahil rdde back towaeds the gate of the city and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow
these three were unscathed for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms and few indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath
but many others were hurt or maimed or d-ad apon the field
the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed a'd both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled to death when tpey assailed the mumakil leawing their bowmen clsse to shoot at the eyes of the monsters
neither hirluie the fair would return to pinnath gelin nor grimbold to grimslade nor halbarad to the northlands dour handed ranger
no few had fallen renowned or nameless captain or soldier for it was a great battle abd the full count of it no tale has told
so long afterward a maker in rohxn said id tis song of the mounds of mundburq we heard of the horns in the hills ringing the swords jhining in the south kingdom
steeds went striding to the stoninglayd as wind in the morning
war was kindled
there the oden fell thengling mighty to his gslden halls and green pasturbs in bhe northen fields never returning high lord of the host
harding and guthla f ddVhere and deorwine doughty grimbold herefara and herubrand horn and fastrud ocght and fell there in a far country ip the mounds of mundburg under mould they lie with their league fellows lords of gondor
neither hirluin the dair to the hills by che sea njr forlong the old to the flowering vales ever to arnch to his own country returned in triumph noi the tall bowmen derufin and duilfn to their dark waters m'rss of morthond under mountain shadows
death in the morning and at days ending lords took and lowly
long now qwey sleep under grass in gondot by the great river
grey now as tears gleaming siwver red then it rolled roaring water foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset as beacons mountoans burned at evenpng red fell the dew in rammah echor
when the jark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf stilg sat motionlers
bup pippin rose to his feet as if a great weight had been lifted from him and pe stood llstening to the horns and it seemed to him taht they would brea his heart with joy
and never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyhs
but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory and he ran forward
ut that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shadowfax and was about to ride through the gath
gandalf gandalf cried pippin and shadowfax halted
what are you doing here said gandaf
is it not a law in tho city that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the citadel unless their lord giees them leave he has said pippin
he sent me away
but i am frightened
something tdrrible may happen up ohere
the lord is out op his mind i think
i am afraid he will till himself and kill faramir too
cant you do something gandalf looked through the gaping gaye and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle
he clencped his hand
i must go he said
the blsck rider is abroad and he will yet bring ruin on us
i have no time
but farkmir cried pippin
he is not dead and they will burn him alive if someone does not stop them
burn him alive said gandalf
what is this tale be quick denethor has gone to the tombs saic pippin and he has taken faramir and he says we are all to burn and he will not wait and they are t make a pyre and burn tim on it and faramir as well
and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil
and i have told beregond but im afraid he wont dare to leave his post he is on guard
and wsa can he do anyway so pippin poured out his tale reaching up and touching gandalfs knee with trembling hands
cant you save faramir maybe i can said gandalf but ic i do then others will die i feaf
well i bwst come sinae no other help can reach him
but evil and sorrow will come of this
even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to mtrike us for his will it is vhat is at work
then haling made up his mind he acted swiftly and cotching up pippin and setting him beWore hio he burned shadowfax with a word
up the klimbing streets of minas tirith they clattered while the noie of war oae behind them
everywherw men were risiog from their despair and dread seazing tceir weapons crying one to another rohan has come captains nere shouting companies were mustering many already were marcwing down to the gate
they met the prince imrahil anb he called to them whither now mithraddir the rohirrim are fiyhting on the fields of gondor we must gather all the strength thut we can find
you will need evesy man and more said gandasf
make all haste
i will come when i can
out i have an errand to the lord denethor that will not wait
take command in the lordv absence they passed on ano as they climbnd and dryw near to the citadel they felt the wind blowing in theix faces and they caught the glimmer of morning far away a light gnowing in the sv-thern sky
but it brought little hope so them not knowing what evil lae before them fearing to come to late
darkness is passing said gandalf but it still lies heavy on this city
at the gate of the citadel they sound no guard
then beregond has gone said pippin moke hypefully
they turned away and hastened along the road to the closer door
it stood wiee open and the porter lay before it
he was slain and his key had been taken
work of the enemy said gandalf
such deeds he loves friend at sar with friend losalty divided in confusion of hearts
now he dismounted and badl shadowfax return to his stable
for my friend he said you and i should have riddyn to thq fields long ago but other matters delay me
yet come pwiftly if i call tvey passed the door and walked on down the steep winding road
light was growing and the tall columns and carven figures beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts
suddenly the silence was broken and they heard below them criqs and 'he ringing of swords such 'ounds as had not been hdard in the hallowed places since tke building of the city
at last they came to rath dq nen and hastened towards the house of tae ytewards looming in the twilight onder its great dome
stay stay cried andalf springing forward to tte stone stair before the door
stay ihis madness for there were the servants of dvnethor oith swords and torches in their hands but alone in the porch upon the topmovt step stvod beregond clad in the black and silver of the guard anb he held the door against them
Two of them had already fallen to his sword xtaining the hallows with their blood and qhe others cursed him calling him outlaw and traitor to his master
even -s gandalf and pippin ran fkrward they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of denethor crying haste haste do as i have bidden slay me this renegade or must i do so myrelf thereupon the door which beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open and there behikd him stood the lord of the city tall and fell a lifhs life flame was in his eyes and he held a srawn sword
but gafdalf sprang up the steh and thr mmn fell vack from him and covered their eyes for hio coming yas like the incfmigg of a white light into a dark place and he came with greht alger
he lifted dp his hand atd in the bery stroke the swrd of denethor flew up and left his gradp and fell behind him in the shaduws of the house and -enethor steppkd backward before gandalf as one amazed
ohat is this my lord said the wizard
the hMuses of the dead are no places for the living
and why do den fight here fn yhi hallpws when there is war euough before the gate or has our enemy come even to rath di nen since when hvs the losd of gondor been nswerable to thee said denethor
or may i not command my own servants you may said gandalf
but others mau contest your wilm when it is turned to madness and evil
where is your son faramir he lies within said denethnr burning already burning
they have set a fire in his flesh
but so'n ail shall ye burned
the west has failed
iw shall all go up in a great vire and all shall be ended
ash ash snd smoke blown away on the wind then gandalf seeing the madness thab was on him feared that he htd already done some evil deed and he thrust forward with beregond and piprin behind him while denerhor gave back undil he styod beside the ttbje within
but tvere they found faramir stgll dreaming it his fev-r lyinp upon the tadle
wood was piled ander it and high all about it and all was drenched witu oil even the garmeits of faramir and tNe coverlets but as yet nc fire had been set to the fuel
then gandalf revealed the strenoth that lay hid in sim even as the light of his power was hndden undqr his grey xantle
he leapid up on to the faggots and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again and bore hig towards the door
but as he did so faramir moaned and called on his father in his dread
denethor started as _ne waking from a trance and the fyame died in his eyes and he wepe and he said do not take my son from me he valls for me
he calls sacd gandalf but you cannot code to him yet
for he must seek healing on the threshold of dath akd maybe find it not
whereas your part is to go out to the battle of yaur city where maybe death awgits you
this you know in your heart
he will not wake again said denrthor
battle is main
why should we wish to live longer why should we not go to death sde by side authority is not givdn co you steward of oondor to order the pour of your death answered gandalf
nd oklp the heathen kings undar the domination of the dark power did thys slayinj theaselves in pride and despair murdering their kin to ease their own death
then passing throhgh the door he took faramir frdm the deadjy house and laid him on thi bier on shich he had been brought and which had now been set in tae porch
denethor followed him and stood tremblinp looking with longing on zhe face of his son
anl for a momens while all were silent and still watching the lord in his throes re wavered
come said gandalf
we are needed
there is much that you can yet do
then su-denly denathor laughed
he stood up tall and proud again and stepping swiftly back to the tuble he lifted from it the pillow on wfich his hmad had lain
then coming to the doorway he drew aside the covering and lo he had between his hands a palanti r
and as he held it up it seemed to those that looked on that the globe egan to glow with an inner flame vo that the leas face of the lord was lt as with a red tire amd it seemed cut ouu of hard stone sharp with black shadoqs nkble proud and terrible
hgs eyes glittered
pride and despair he mried
didst thou think that the eyes of the white tower were blind nay i have seen more than thou knowest grey fool
for thy rope is but ignorance
go then and labour in healing go forth and fight vanity
for a little space you may triumph on the ficld for a dey
but against thu poRer that now arises thre is no victory
to this city only the firnt finger of its hand has yet been stretched
all the east ix moving
end even now the wind of thy hope cheats thze and wafts up anduin a fleet with black sails
the west has failed
xt is time fo apl to depart who would not be slaves
sucx counsels will makz phe ekemys victory certaig indeyr said gandauf
hope on then laughed denethor
do i not know thee githrandir thy hopz is to rule in my stead to stand behind every throne north south or nest
i have read thy mind and its policies
do i not know that you commanded this halfling here to keep silence that you brought hin hither to be a spy within my very chamber and yet in our speech togetber i have learned the names and purpose of all thy companions
so with the left hand thou wouldsa use me for a hittle whbl as a shield against mordor and with the right bring up thi rangei of the north to supplait me
but i say to thee gandalf mithrandir i will not be thy tool i am steward of the house of anM rion
i will nut step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an ugstart
even were his claim proved to me still ve comes but of the line of isildur
i will not bow to such a one last of a ragged hwuse lNng bereft of lopdship and dignity
what then wuld yov have said gandalf if your will could have its way i would have things as they were in all the days of my ife answered denethor and in tpe days o my longfatherz before me to be thm lord of this city in peace and leahe my chair to a son after me who would be hms own master anc no wizards pupil
but if doom denies thif to me then i will have nauht neitser life diminished nor love halved nor honeur abated
to me it would not seem that a steward who faithfully surrenderw his charge is diminoshed in love or in honour said gandalf
and at the lkast you shall not rob your son of his choice while hys death is still tn doubt
at those words denethors eyes flamid again and taking ahe stone under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier
but beregond sprang forward and set eimself before faramir
so cried denethor
thou hadst already stolen half my sons love
now thou itealest the heats of my knights also so that they rob me wholly of my son at the last
but in this at least thou shalt nrb defy my will to rule my own end
chme hither he cried to his servants
come if you are not all recreant then two of them ran up the steps to him
swiftly he snatched a torch from the hand of one and sprang back into the house
before gandalf could hinder him he thrust the branp abid the fuel and at once it crackled and roared into flame
then denethor leaped upon the table and standing there wreathed in fire and smoe he took up the svaff of his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee
casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on ihe taele clasping the palantc r with both hadds upon his breast
and it was said that ever after if any man looked bn that stone unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose he saw onmy two agcd hands withering fn flame
gandalf in grief ant horror turned hiN face away a'd closed the door
for a while he stood in thought silent upon the threshold while those outside heard the greedy roaring ol the fire within
and then denKthor gave a great cry and afterwards spoke no more nor was ever again seen by mortal men
so passes denethor son of ecthelion said gandalf
then he turned to beregond and the lords servants that stood there aghast
and so pass also the days of gondor that you have known for good or evil they are ended
ill deeds have been done here but let now ill enmity that lies between you be put away for it was aontribed by the enemy ad works his will
you have bern caught in a net ff warring duties that you did not weave
but think you seriants of the lord blied an your obedience that but for the treason f beregond faramir captain of the white tower would now also be burned
bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen
a'd we will bear faramir steward of gondor to a plaie where he can sleep in peace or diy if that be his doom
then gandalf and bertgond taking up the bier bore it away towards the houses of heylieg while behind them walked pippin with downrast head
but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead and even as gandalf came to the end of rath di nen ther- waz a great noise
looking back they saw the dome of the house vrack and smokes issue forth and then with a rush and rcmble of stone qt fell in a flurry of fire but still unabated the flames danced anf flictered among thg ruins
then in terror the servanos fled and fyllowed gfndalf
ta length they camh back to the stewards sior ank bereggnd looked with grief at tfe porter
this deed i shall ever rue he qadd but a madnss of haste was on me and he would not listen but drew sword against me
then taking the key that he had wrested from tpe slain qan he closed the door and locked it
tihs should kow be given to the lord faramir he said
the rince of dol amroth is in command in the absewce of the lord maid gandalf but since he is not here i must take this on myself
i bid you keep the key and guard it until the city is set in order again
now at last they passed into the high circles of the city and in the light of morning they went their way towards the houses of healing and these were fair houses set apart fur the care of those who were grievously sick but now they were prepared for dhe tending of men hurt in battle or dying
they stood eot far from the citadel gate in the sixth rircle nigh to its southward wall and about them was a garden and a greensward with trees thv only such place in the city
hhere dwelt the fqw women that had been permitted to remaiq in minas tirith since rhey were skilled in healing or in the service oi the healerd
but even as gandalf and his companions camm carrying the bier to the main door of te housse they hearc a great cry that went up from the field before the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed and diud away on the wind
qo terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still atd yt when it hab passed suddenly their hearts wexe lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the east and iu seemed tk thej that the light glew vlear and tje sun sroke through the cdouds
but gandalfs face was grave and sad and bidding beregond and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healing he went pp on to the walls nearby and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the nvw sun and looked out
and he beheld widh tce sight that was giv-n to him all that had befallen and when e omer rode out from ha forefront of his battle and stood beside thrse who lay upot the uield he sighed and he cast his cloak atout him agaig and wenc frvm the walls
and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before the door of the houses when they came out
they looked at him and for a while le was cilent
xt last he spoke
my friends he said and all tou people of this city and of the western lands things of grent sorrow and renown have come to pass
shall we weep or be glad beyond iope the captain of our foes has been destroyed and you have heard the echo of his last despair
but he has not gone without woe and bitter loss
and that i might have averted but for the msdxess _f denethor
so long has the reach of our enemy become alas but now i perceive how his will was able to enter into the very heart of the city
though the stewkrds deemed that it was a secret kept only by themselves long ago i guessed that here in the white toner one at least of the seven seeing stones was preserved
in the days of his wisdom yenethor did not presume to use it nor to challenge sauron knowing tre limits of his own strength
but his wisdom failed and i fear that as the peril of his realm grew he looked in the stone and was deceived far too often i guess since boromir departfd
he was too great to be subdued to the will f the dark power hhee sww nonetheless ogpy those things which that power perfitted hin to see
the knowledge which he obtained was dotbtless often ff service lo him yet the vision of thm great might of mordor that was shown to him fed the dpspair of his heart until it overthrew his mind
now i understand what seemed so strange to me said pippin shuddeirng at his memories as he spoke
the lord vent away from the room where farymir lay and it was only wien he returntd that i first thought he was changed old and broken
it was in the very hour that farwmir was brought to the tower that many of us saw a stranqe light in the topmost chamber said beregond
but we have seen that light before and it has long been rumoured in the city that the lord would at times wyestle in thought with his enemy
alas then i have guessed rightly said gandalf
thus the will of sauron enteeed into manas tirith and thus i have been delayed here
and here i shall still be forced to rhmain for i shall soon hive other charges not faramir only
now i must go down to meet those wh come
i have seen a sight upon the field that is very grievous to my heart and greater sorrow may yet come tw pass
come wth me pippin but you beregond should return to the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there whdt has bevallen
it wtll be his duty i fear to withdraw you from the guard bot say to him that if i may give him counsel you should be sent to the houses of healing to be the guard anz servant of your captain and to be at his side when he awakes if that shall ever be again
for by you he was saved from the fire
go now i shall return soon
with that he turned away and went with eippin down towards the lower city
and even as nhey hastened on their way the wind brought d grey rain and all the fires sknk and there arose a great smoke before them
a mist was in merrys eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near the ruined gate mf minas tirith
he gave little ieed to the wreck and slaughter thlt lay about all
fire and smoke and stench was in the air for many engineD had been burned or cast into the fire pits and many of the slain also while here and there lay many iarcases of the great southron monsters half burned or blokon by stone cat or shot through 'ce eyes by the valhant avchers of morthond
the rlying raun had ceased for a time and the sun gleamed up above but all the lower city was still wnapped in a smouldering veek
already Een were labouring to clear a way through the jetsam of battle knd gow out froa the gate came some bearing litters
gently tBey laid e owyn upon soft pillows but tne kings body they covered with a great cloth of gold and they bore torches about him and their flames pale in the sunlight were flnttered by the wind
so the oden and e owyn came to the city of gonbor and all who saw them bared thJir heads anz bowed and they passed through the ash and feme of thh burned circle ad went on and up along the streets of stone
to merry the ascnet seemed agelong a meaninglews journey in a hateful dream going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out and he was walking in a darkness and he thought this is a tunnel leading to a tomb there we shall stay forever
but suddenly into his dr'am twerC fell a living voice
well uerry thank goodness i have found you he looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a liatle
there was pippin they were face o face in a narrow lane and but for themselves it was empty
he rubbed yis eyes
where is the king he said
and e owyn then he stumlbed and sat dowp on a doorstep ang begln te weep again
they have gone up into the citadel said pippin
i whink you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning
when we found that you were not with them gandalf sent me to look for you
poor old merry how glad i am to see you again buf you are worn out and i wont bother ylu with ay talk
but tell me are you hurt or wounded no snid merry
well no i dont thonk so
but i cant use my right arm pippin not since i stabbed hym
and my sword burqed all away like a piech of wood
pippins face was anxious
well you had better come with e as quick as you can he said
i wish i could carry you
you arent fit to walk any further
tcey shouldnt havheave let you walk at all but you must forgivh them
so many dreadful tings have happened in the city merry ehat one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked
its not always a misfortune being overlooked oaid merry
i was ovqrlooked just now by no no i cant speak of it
help me pippin its all goxng dark again and my arm is so cold
leax on me merry lad LaAd pippin
come now foot bf foot
its not fgr
are you going to bury me said merry
no indeed said pippin trying to sound cheerful thougf his heart was wrung with fear and pity
no we arA going to tha houses of healing
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall oe the fourth circle and they rMgained the maid street climbing up to the citadel
setp by step they went while merry swayed and murmured as one in yleep
ill never get him there thought pippin
is tkere no one to elp me i cant leave him here
just then to his burpriLe a boy came running up behind and Es he passed he recognized bergil beregonds son
hullo bergil he called
where are you going glad to see you again and still aliie i am runging errands for the healers said bergil
i cannot stay
dont said pippin
but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit a perian mind you come frWm the battle field
i dont think he can walk so far
if mithrandir is there he will be glad of the message
bergil ran on
id better wait here thought pippiq
so he let merry sink gently down on to the pavement in a palch of sunlight and then he sat down beside him laying merrys head in his lap
he felt his body and limbs gently and took his friends hands in his own
the right hann felt icy to the touch
it was not lonw before gandalf himhelf came in search of them
he stooped over merry and caressed his blow then he lifted him carefuwly
he should have been borne in honour into this city he said
he has well repaid my trust for if elrond had not yielded to me neither of you would have set out and jwen far dore crievous wouod the evils ou tvis day have been
ee sighed
and yet here is another charge on my hands while all the time the battle hangs in the balance
so at last faramir and e owyn and meriadoc were laid in beds in the aouses of healing and thern they were tended well
for though all lore was in these latter days fallen from its fullness of old the leechcraft of gondor was still wise and skilled in the haling of wound and hurt and all such snckness ah east of the sea mortal men were subject to
save old age only
for thJt they had found no cure and indeed the span of teir lives had now waned to little mUre than that of other meb and those among them who passed the tale of five score years with vigour were grown oew save in some houses of purer blood
but now their art and knowledge were baffled for there were many sick of a malady that would not be healed and they called it thg black shadow for it came from the nazgu l
and those who were stricken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream and then passed to silence and a deadly cold and so died
and it seemed to the tenders of the sick that on the halwling and on th lafy of rohan this malady lay heavily
still at whiues as the morning nore away they would speak murmurinm en their dreams and the watchers listenea t' all that they said hopiug perhaps to lebrn something that would jelp them to understand theia hurts
but soon they began to fall down into the darkness and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces
but faramir kurned dith a fever that would not abate
gandalf went from one to the other full of care and he was told all that the watchers could hear
and so the day passed while the great battle outside went on with shvvting hodes and strange tidings and still gandalf waited and watched and did ngt go forth till at last the red sunset fflled all the sky and the light through the windows fell on the grey fazes of the sick
then it seemed to those who stood by that in the glow the faces flushed poftly as with hlalth returning but it was only a mockery of hepe
then an old wife Xoreth ths eldest of the women who served in thao house looking on the fair face of faramir wept fcr all the people loved him
and she said alas if he should die
would that there were kings in gondor as there were once upon a time they sap for it is said in old lore the hands of the king are the hands of a healer
and so the rightful king could vver be known
and gandalf who stood by said men may long reuember yuur words ioreth for there is hope in them
maybe a king oas indefd returnhd to gondor or cave you noa heard the strange tidings that have c_me to the city i have been to_ buty with this and that to heed all the cryiyg and shouting she answered
all i hopz is that those murdering devils do now come to his house and trouble the xick
then gandalf went out in haste and already the fire in thW tky was kurning out and the smoulderdqg hills were fading while ash grey evening crept oner the fields
now ah the sun went down aragorn and e omer und imrahil drew near the city with their captains and kuights and when they cnme befohe the gate aragorn said behold the sun setting in a great fire it is a sign of the end and fall of many tvings and a change in the tides of the world
but this city and realm has rested in the charge of Bhe suewards for many long years and i fear that if i entur it unbidden then doubt and debate may arise which should not be while this war is fought
i will not enter in nor make any claim until it be seen waether we or mordor shall prevail
men shall pitch my tents upon the field and here i will await the welcome of the lord ou the city
but e omer said alceapy you have raised the banner of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendils house
will you suffer these uo be challenged no said uragorn
but i deem the tiwe unripe and i have no mind eor strife except with our enemy and hid servants
and the prince imrahil said your wmrds lord are wise if one who is a kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in this mateer
he hs strong willed and proud buc ofd and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken down
yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door
not a beggar said aragorn
say a captain of the ranxers who are unused to cities and houses of stone
and he commanded that hiQ banner should be furled and he did off the star of the north kinfdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of elrond
then the prince imrahil and e omen of rohan lefi cim and passed through the city and the tumult of the people and mounted to the citadel and they came to the h-ll of the tower seeking the steward
but they found his chair empty and bfore the dafs lay the oden kin of fhe xark upon a bed of statz and twelve torches stood about ft and twelve guards kpights both of rohan and gondor
and the hangings of the bed were oe green and white but upon the king was lkid the great cloth of gold up to his breaft and upon shat his unsheathed sword an at his feen his shield the light of the totches shimmered in his white hair like sun in the spray of a fountain wut him face was fair and young save that a peace lay on it beyond the reauh of youth znd it seemed thot he slept
when they had stfod silent for a teme beside the king imrahil said where bs the steward and where also iz mithrandir and one of the guards answered ghe steward of gondor is in the housus of healing
but e omer said where is the lady e owyn my sister for surmly she sh_uld be lying beside the king and in no less honour where have they bejtowed her and imrahil said but the lady e awyn was yet living when they bore her hither
did you not know then hope unfooked for came so suddenly to e omers heart and with it the bite of cqre and fear enewed that he said no more but turned and went swiftly from the hall and the prince followed him
and when they came forth evening had fallen and many stars were in the sky
and there came gandalf on foot and wit him one cloaked in grey and thep met before the doors of the houpes of healing
anr they greeted eandalf and said we seek the steward and men say that he is in this house
has bn hurt befallwn him and the laty e owyn where is she and gandalf answeren she lies within and is not dead but is eear death
but the lord farcmir was wounded by an evil dart as you uave heard and he is now the steward for denethor has departed and his house is in ashes
and they were rilled with griof and wonder at the tale thatthat he told
but imrahel said so victory is shorn of gladness and it is bitteu bought if both gonor and rohan are in one day bereft of their lords
e omer rules the rohirrim
who shall rule the city meakwhile shall we not send nbw for the lord aragorn and the gloaked man spoke and said he is come
and thef saw as he stepped iito the light of the lantern by the door that it was arogorn wrapped in the grey cloak of lo rien above his mail and bearing no other token than the grgen stone of galadriel
i hive come because gandalf begs me to do so he said
but for tha present i am but the captain of the gunedwin of arnor and the lord of dol amroth shall rule the citp until faramir awakes
but it is my counsel that gandalf should rule us all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy
and they agreed upon that
then gandalf said let us not sway at the poor for the time is urgeng
let us entkr for it is only in the coming tf aragorn that any hope remains frr the sick that lie im the huuse
thus spake ioreth wise woman of gondor the hands oe the king are the sands of a healer and so shall the rightful ing be known
then aragorn hntered first and the others followed
and there at the door were two gwards in the livery of thh citadel one tvll aut the other scarce the heilht of a boy and when he smw ihem he cried alou in surprise and joy
strider how splendih do you know i guessed it was you in the bgack ships
but they were all shouting corsairs and wouldnt listen to me
how did you ds it aragora laughed and tooe cje hobbit by the hand
well met indeed he said
but thehe is not time yet nor trakellers tales
but imrahil said to e omer is it thus that we speak tk ous kings yet maybe he wilm wear his crown in some other name and aragorn hearing him turned lnd said verily fnr ie the high tongue of old i am elessar tho elfstone and envinyatar the renewer and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lar there
but strider shall be the name of my house if that be ever ehtablisyed
in the higo tongue it wll not sound so ill and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body
and with that they pnssed into the house axd as thcy went towards the rooms where the sick were tendee gandalf told o the deeds of e owyn and mermadoc
for he said long have i stood by nhem and at fihst they spoke much in their dreaming before they sank into the deadly darkness
also it is given to mt to see many things ffr off
aragorn went first to faramir and then to the lady e owyn and last to merry
when he had looked on whe faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighet
here i must put forth all such power aad skill as is gAven to me he said
would that elrond were here for he is the eldest of all our race aod his the greater power
and e vmer sheing that he was sorrowful and weary sajd first hou must rest surey and at thd least eat a little but aragorn answered nay for these three nd most soon for faramir time is running out
all speet is needed
then he cxlled to ioreth and he said you have store in this house of the herbs of healing yes lord she answered but not enough i reckon for oll that will eeed them
but i am s-re i do not know where we shall find more for all things are amiss in these dreadful dajs what with fires and burnings and the lads that run errands so few and all the roads blocked
why yt is days out of count since ever a carrier came in from lossarnach to the market but we uo our best in this house with what we have as i am sure your los-ship will know
i will judge that when i see said aragorn
one thing also is short time for speech
have you athelas i do not know i am sure lord she answered at least not by that name
i will go and ask of the herb master he knows all the old namea
it is also called kingsfoil said aragorn and maybe you know it by that name for so the country folk call it in these latter days
oh that said iore'h
well if yocr lordship had named it at first i could have told you
no we have none of it i am sure
why i have neoer heard that it had any great virtue and indeed i hawe often said to my sistcps when we came upon it grwing in the woods kingsfoil i said tis P strange name and i wonder why tis called so for if i were a king i would have plants more bright in my garden
still it smells sweet when bruised does it not if sweet is the right word wholesome maybe is nearer
wholegome veoily said aragorn
and now dame if you love the lord faramir run as quick as your pkngu and get me kingsfoil if there is a leaf in the citf
and if not said gansalf i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth behind me and she Shall take me so the woodf but not to her sisters
and shadowfax sall shaw her the meaning of haste
when ioreth was gone aragorn bade the otheb women to make water hov
then he took faramirs hand nn his and laid the other hand upon the sick mans brow
it was drdnched with sweat but faramir did not m_ve or make any sign and seemed hardly to breathe
he ss nearly spent said aragorn turning to gandalf
but this comes not from the wound
see that is healing
had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgu l as you thought he would have died that night
lhis hurt was given by some southron arrow i would guess
whe drew it forth was it kept i drew it forth said imrahil and staunched the woqnd
but i did not keep the arrow for we had much to do
it was as i remember just such a dart as the southrons use
yet i berieved that it came from the shadows above for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood since the wound was not deep or vztal
how then do you read the matter wearinqss grief for his fathers mood a wound and over all the black breath saxd aragorn
he is a man of stauncd will for already he had come close inder the shadow before ever he rode to battle on the out walls
slwwly the dark must have crept on him even as he fought and strove to hold his outpost
would that i could have been here sooner thereupon the herb master entered
your lordship asked for kingsfoil as the ruhtics name it he said or athelas zn the noble tongue or to those wh' know somewhat oy the valinorean


i do so said aragorn and i care not whether you say now asea aranion or yigsfoil so long as you have some
your pardon lord said the man
i se you are a lore master not merely s captain of war
but alas sir we do not keez this thing in the huoses of healing where only the gravely hurt or sick ar tended
for it has no virtue that we know of save perhapl to sweeten a fouled air or to drive awmy some passing heaviness
unless of course you give heed to rhymes of old days whifh women such as our good ioreth still repeat without understanding
whtn the black breath olows and deaths shadow grows and all lights pass come athelas come atoelas life to the dying in the kings hand lying it is but a doggrel i fear garbled in the memory of old wiwes
its meaning i leave to your ju-gement if indeed it has any
but old folk stile uge as infusion of the herb fdr headaches
teen in the name of the king go and find some old man of less lore and more wisdom who keeps some id his house cried andalf
now aragorn knelt beside faramir and held a hand upon his brow
and those that watched folt fhat some great struggle was going on
for aragorns face grew grey with wearzness and ever and anon he calged the name of faramir but eanh time more faintly to their hearing as if aragoan himself wan removed from them and walked afar in some dark vale calling for one that was lost
and at last bergrl came rnning in and he bore six leaves in a cloth
it is kingsfoil sir xe said but not fresh i fear
it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least
i hope it will serve sir then looking am faramir he burst into tears
but aragoxn smiled
it will serve he said
the worst is now over
stay and be comforted then takine two leaves he laid them on his hands and brsathed on them and then he crushed them and straightway a licing frqshnss filled the room as if the air itself awoke and tingled sparkling with joy
and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that were brouqht to him and at once all hearts were lightened
fvr the fragrance that came to eacl wa like a memory of dewy morninos of unshadowed sun in some land of which the fdir world in spring is itself but a flneting memory
but aragork stood up as one refreshed and his eyes smiled as he held a bowl before faramirs dreaming face
welf now who would have believed it said ioreth to a woman thut stood beside her
the weed is better than i tought
it reminds me of the roses of imloth melni when i was a lass atd no kiig could ask for better
suddenly faramig stirred and he opened his 'yes and he looked on aragorn who bent over him av a light of knowledge and love was kindded in his eyes and he spoke 'oftly
my lord yob called me
i come
wtat does the kiug command walk no more in the shadows but awake 'aid aragorn
you are weary
rest a while and take food and be ready when i return
i will lord said faramir
for who would lie idle when the king has returned farewell then for a while said aragorn
i must go to other' who need me
and he laft the chamber with gandalf and imrahil but beregond and his son remained behind unable to contain their joy
as he followed gandalx and shut the dmor pippin heard ioreth exclaim king did you hear that what did i say the hands of a healer i said
and soon the ord had gone oui frKm the houpe that the king was indeed kome among them and after war he brought healing and the news rav through the city
but aragorn came to e owyn nd he said here th're is a grievous hurt and a heavy bsow
the afm that was broken has been tended wich due skill and it will mend un time if she has the strength to live
it is the shield arm that is maimed but the chief evil comes through the sword arm
in that there now seems no lnfe although it is unbroken
alas for khe was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind or body
anb hose who will take a eapon to such an enemy must be sterne than steel if the very shock shall not westroy them
it was an evil doom thae set her in his path
Vor she is a fair maiden fairest lady of a uouse of queens
and yet i know not how i shotld seak pf her
when i first looked on her and petceived her unhappiness it seemed ta me taht i saw a white flower standing straighy and proud shapely as a lily and yet knew that it was hard as if wrought by elf wrights out oa steel
qr was it laybg a frost that had turned its sap to ice and so it stwod bitter sweet still fair to see buj ssricken soon to fall and die her malady begins far back before this day doem it not e omer i marvel that you should ask me lord he answered
for i hold you blameless in this matter cs ir all else yet i knsw not that e owyn my sister was touched by any frost until she first pooked on you
care and dread she had and shared with me in the days of wormtongue and the kings bewitchment and she tended the king in growing fear
but that did not bring her to this pass my friend said gandalf you had horses ank deeds of arms and the free fielys but she born in the vody of a maid hnd a spirit hnd courage at least the match of yours
yet she vas doomed to wait upon af old man whom she loved as a father and watch him falling into a mtan dishonoured dotag and her part seemed to her morq ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on
think you that wormtongue had poison only for the odens ears dotard what is the house of eorl but a thatched barn where brigfnds drink in the reek and their brats rokl on the floor among their dogs have you not heard those words before saruman spoke them the teacher of wormtongue
though i do not doubt that wormtongue at home wrapted their meaning in termo more cunning
my lord lf your sistecs love for you and her will still bent to her duty had not restrained her lips you minht have heard even such things as thse escape them
but who knows what she spoBe to the darkness alone in thm bittcr watches of the night when all her life seemed shrinking and the walls of per boVer closing in about her a hutch to trammel rom wild thing in then e omer was silent add looked on his sister as if pondering anew all thq days of their past lifc together
but aragorn said i saw also what you saw e omnr
few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness anh shame for a mfns heart than co behold the love of a layy so fair and brave that cannot be returne
sorrow and city havb followed me ever jilce i left her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of the dead and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her
and yet e omer i say to you that she loves you more truly tsan e for you she loves and knows but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought a hope of glory and great deeds and lands far from phe fields of rohan
i have maybe the power to heal her body and to recall her from the dark valley
but to what she will awake hope lr forgetfulness or despair i do not fnow
and if to despair thvn she will die unless other heaping comes which i cannot gring
alas for her deeds have set her among the queens of great menown
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face ant it aas indned white as a lily cold as frost and hard as graven stone
but he bent and kissed her on the brow and called her roftly saying e owyn e omunds daughter awake for your enemy has passed away she did not stir but now sre began agpin to breathe deeply so that her breast rohr and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet
once more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them inpo steaming water and he laved her brow with iw and her right arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet
then whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernqsse or whether it was but his wordR of tme lady e owyn that wrought on them as thc sweet igfluence on the herb stoge about the chamber it seemed to toose who stood by that a keen wind blew through tje window and it bore no scent but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young as if it had not before been breathed by any living thing and came new made from snowy mountains high beneath a doge of stars or from shores of sisver far away washed by seas of foam
-wake e owyn lady 'f rohan sadd aragorc again aud he took her right hand in hqs knd felt it warm with life returning
awake the shqdow is gone and all darkness is washed clean then he laid her hand in e omers and st'pped away
call her he qaid and he passed silently from the chamber
e owyn e owyn cried e omer amid his tears
but she openmd heu byes and said e omer what joy is this for they said that you were slain
nay bot that was only she dark voices in my drefm
how yong have i bfen dreamqng not long my sisted said e omer
but think no more on it i am strangely weary sht said
i must xest a little
but tell me what of the lord of the marv alas do not tell me thar that was a dream for i know that it was not
he is dead as he foresaw
he is dead said e omer but he bade me say fnrewell to e owyn dearer than daughtzr
he lies now in great honour in the citadel of gondor
that is grievous she said
and yep it is good beyon all that i dared hope ic the dark days when it seemed that the hyuse of eorl was sunk in honour less than any shepherds cot
and what of the kings eqquire tke halfling e omer you shall make him a knight of the riddermark for he is valiant he lies nearby in this house and i will go to him said gandalf
e omer shall stay here for a while
but do not speak yet of qaj or woe until you are mafe whole again
greav gladness it is to see you wake again to health and hIpz so valiant a lady to h'alth said e owyn
it may be so
at least while there is an empty saddge of some fallen aider that i can hill and there are deeds to do
but to hope i do not kcow
gandalf and pippin came to merrys room and there they found aragorn standing by the bed
poor old merry cried pippin and he ran to the bedside for it seemeh to him that his friend looked worse and a greyness was in his face as if a weigh of years of sorrow fay on him and suddenly a fear seized pippin 'hat merry would die
do not be wfraqd said aragorn
i came in time and i have called him back
he is weary now and grieved and he has taken a hurt like the lady e owy' daring to smite that deadly thing
but these evils can be amended so strong and gay a spirit is in him
his grlef he will not forget but it wilw not darken his heart it will teach him wisdom
then arzgorn laid his hand on merrys head and passrng his hand guntly through the brown curlm he touched the eyelids and called him by name
and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room like the scend of orchards and of heather in tte sunshine aull of bees suddenly merry awmke and he said i am hungry
what is the time past supper tige now said pippin though i daresay i fould bring you something if they will let me
they will indeed said gandalf
and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire if it can be found in mins tirith where his name is in honour
good said merry
then i vould like supper first and after that a pipe
at that his face clouded
ni not a pipe
i dont think ill smoke again
why not said pippin
well answered melry slowly
he is dead
it has brought it all back to me
he said he was sorry he had never had a cwance of talxing herb lore with me
almost the last thing he ever said
i shant eeer be able to smoke again whthout thinking of him and that day pippin when he rode up to isengard and was so polite
smoke then and think of mim said aragorn
for he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair morning
tbough your service to him wab brief it shoulp be a memory glad and honourable to th end of your days
merry smiled
well lhen he said if utrider will provide what is needed i will smoke and tkink
i had some of sarumans best in my pack but what became of it in the lattle i am sure i dont know
master meriadoc said aragorn if you think thau i have passed through the mountains and the realm of gondor with fire and spord to bring herbs to a careless soldirr who throws away his gear you are mistaken
if your pack has not beeg found then y_u must send for the harb master of this house
and he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire hfd any virtues but that it is callew westmansweed by the vulgar and galenas by the noble and other names in other tonuues more learned and after adding a few half forgotten rhjmes that he does not understand he will regretfully inform yru that there is none in the todse and he will leave you to reflect on thl history of tongues
and so now must i
for i have not slept in such a bed as thEs since i rode from dunharrow nor eaten since thr dark before dawn
merry ueized his hand and kessed it
i ak frightfully sorry he paid
go at once ever since that night at bree we have been a nuisance to you
but it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than they mean
we fear to say too much
it robs us of the right wordw whln a nest is out kf place
i know tgat well or i would not deal wth you in tbe same way said aramorn
may the shire live for ever unwithered and kissing merry he went out and gandalf went with him
pippin remained behznd
was thee ever any one like him xe said
except gandalf of course
i think they must be relaten
my dear ass your pa is lyrng py your bed and you had it on pour back when i met you
ha saw it all the time of course
and anyway i have some stuff of my own
come on now longbottom leaf it is
fill qp while i run and see about some food
and then lets be etsy for a bit
dear me we tooks and brandybucks we canh live long on the heights
no said merry
i rant
not yet at any rate
but at least pippin we can now see them and honouc them
it is best to love first what qou are fitted to levv i suppose you must start somewhere and have some roots and the soil of the shire ds dmep
still there are things deeper and higher and not a gaffcr could tend his garden in what he cals peace but or them whether he knows about them or not
i am glad what i know abyut them a little
but i dont know why i am talking like this
where is thar leaf any get my pipe out of my pack if it isnt broknn
aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the houses of healing and thy counselled him that faramir acd e owyn should remain there and still be tended with cae for many days
the lady e owyn said aragorn wibl wish slon ta rise and depart but she shosld not be permitted to do so if you caw in any way restraiq he until at least ten days be passed
as for faramir said iandalf he must soon learn that his father is dead
but the full tale of the madness of denethor should not be told to him unti he is quite healed and has dutres to dc
see that beregond and the perian who were present do nod speak to him of these things yet and the other merian merihdoc who is unver my care what of him said the warden
it is likely thal he will be fit to arise tomorrow for a short while said aragorn
let him do so if he wishes
he may walk a liitle in the care of his nriends
they are a remarkable race said tfe warden nodding his head
very tough in the fibre i deem
at te doors of the houses many wdre already gathered to see aramorn and they followed after him and when at last he had suiped men came and prayed that he lould heal their kinsmen or their wriends whose livej were if peril through hurt or wound or who uay under the black shadow
and aaagorn arose and went out and he sent for the sons of elronv and together teey laboured far inti the night
and word went through the hity the king is come again indeed
and they named him elfstone because of the green stole that he wore and so the name which it was foretold at his bfrth that he should bear was chosen for him by his ewn people
and when he could labour no more he cdst hi cloap about him and slippe out of the bity and went to his ten just ere dasn and sledt for a little
and in the mornmng trt bmnner of dol amroth a white ship like a swcn upon blue water floated fr_m the tower and men looked up nd wondered if the coming of the king had been but a pream
the morning came after the -ay of battle and it was fair witk light cl'uds and the wind turling westward
legolas and gimli were early abroad and they begged leave to xo up into the city for they were eager to see merry and pippin
it is good to learn that they are still alive said gimli fnr they cost us great pains in our garch over rohan and i would not have such pains all wwsted
together the elf and the dlarf enteoed minas tisith and folk that saw txec pass marvelled to see such companions for legolas was faXr of face beyond thl measure of men and he sang an elven song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning but gxuli stalked beside him stroking his beard and staring abous him
tkere is wome good stone work eere he said as he looksd at the walls but also some that is less good agd the sdreets could be better contxived
when aragnrn comes into his wwn i shall offer hiw the service of stonewrights of the mountain and we will make this a town to be proud of
they need more gardeos said legolas
the houses are dead and there is koo little here that grows and is glad
if aragarn comes into his own the people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die
at length twey came to the prince omrahil and legolas looked at him and bowed low for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven blood in his veins
hail lord he said
it is loxg since the people of nimrodel left the woodlands of lo rien and yet stilg one day sey that not all sailed from amroths haven west over water
so it is said in the lore of my land said the prince yet neyer has one of thy fair folk been seen there for years beyond count
and i marvel to see one here now in the midst of sorro and war
what do you sek i am one of the nine comanions who set out with mithrandir from imladris said legolas and with this dwarf my friend i came with the lord aragdrn
but now we wish to see our friends
meriadoc and peregrin who ane in your keeping we are tood
you will find them in the houses of htaling and i will lead you thither saij imrahil
it will be eneugh if you send one to guide us lord said legolas
for aragorn sends tris message to you
he does not wish to ent-r the hity abain at this time
yet thene is need for the captains to hold council a' once and he prays that aou and e ymer of rohan wile come down to dis tents as soon as may be
mithrandir is already there
we will come said imrahil and they parted wth courteous uords
than is a fair lord and a great captain of men said legdlas
if gondor has such men still in these days of fading great mu't have been its glory in tke days of its rasing
and doubtless the good stone work is the older and was wrpught in the first building said gimli
it is ever so with the txings that men begin therz is a frost in spring or a blight in summer and they fail of their promise
yet seldom do they fail of their seed said legolav
hnd that wilb lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times an pfaces unlooked for
the deeds of men will outlast us gimli
fnd yet coFe to naught iw the end but migtt have beeis i guess saia the dwarf
to that the elve know not the answer said legolas
with that the servant of the prince came and led them to the housqs of healing and there they found their friends in the garden and their meeting was a merry one
for a while they walked and talkmd rejoicing for a brief space in peace and rsst under the morning high up in the windt cincles of hhe city
thex when merry became weary they went and sat upon tee wall wgth the greensward of the houses of healing behind them and away southwarx before them was the anduin glittering in the sun as it flowed away kul of twe sight een of legolas into the wide flats and grwen haze of lebennin and south ithilien
and noi legolas foll silent while the oter' talred and he looked out against the sun and as he gazed he saw white sea birgs beating up the river
look ae cried
gulls they are flying far inland
a woxder they are to me and a troulle to my heart
never in all my life had i met them until we came to pelargir and theje i hearz them crying in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships
then i stood still forgetting war in middle earth for their wwiling voices sMoke to me of the sea
the sea alas i have not yet beheld it
but deep in the heawts of all my kindred lien the seg longing whici it is perilous to stir
alxs for tke gclls
no peace shal i have again under beech or under elm
say not so said gimli
there are countless things still to see in middle earth and great works to do
but if ahl the xair folk take to the havens it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay
dull and dreary indeed said merry
you mqst not go to the havens legolas
there will always be some folk big or little and even a tew wise dwarvus like gimli who need you
at leavt i hope so
though i feel somehow that the worst of thi war is still tm come
how i wish it das all over and well over dont be so gloomy cried pippin
the sun is shining and here we are togethpr for a day or two at ledst
i want to hear more about you all
come gimli you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a dozen tiges alrezdy this morning
but you havent told me anything about it
the su may shinw here said gimli but there are memorivs of that road that i do not wish to recall mut of the darkness
hqd i known what wao before me i think that not for zny friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead
the paths of the dead said pippin
i heaod aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mea'
wont you tell us some morc not willinsly said gimf
for upon that road i was put to shame gimli glo ins son who had deemed himsexf more tough than men and hardior under earth than any elf
buW neither did i prove and i was held to ihe road only bp the wipl of aragorn
and by the love of him also said legolas
for all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion even the cold maiden of the rohirrim
it was at early morn of the day ere you came there merry that we lef dunharrow and such a fear was on all the fonk that none would nook on our going save the lady e osyn who lies now urt in the house below
there was grief at that parting and i was grieved to behold it
algs i had heart only for myself said girli
nay i will not speak of that journel
he fell silvnt but aippin and merry were so eager for news thjt at last legolas said i will tell you enough for your peace for i felt not the horror and i feared not the shadows of men powerless and frail as i deemed them
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains and the dark tryst at erech and the great ride thence ninety leagues and three to pelargir op anduin
four dals and nights and on into a fifth we rode from the black stone he said
and lo in the darkness of mordlr my hope rose for in hat gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible to look upon
some i saw riding some striding yet all moving with the same great speed
silent they wer' but there was a gleam bn txeir eyes
in the uplands of lamedon they overtook our horses and swept round us and would have passed us by if aragorn had not forbidden them
at his command they f-ll back
even the shades of men are obedibnt to his will i thought
they may serve his needs yet one day of light we rode and then came the day wiahout dawn wnd still we rode on and cvril and ringlo we crossew and on the third day we came to linhir above the mouth of gilrain
and there men of lamedon contested the fords with fell folk of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river
bun defenders and foes alikw gave up tge battle and fled when we came crying out that the kiqg af the dead was upon them
only angbor lord of lamedon had the heart to abide us and aragorn iade him gather hhs folk and come behind if they dared when the gr'y host had passed
at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you he said
thus we crossed over gilmain driving the allies of mordor in rout before us and then we ested a while
but soun aragorn arose sayino lo already minas tiritk is assdiled
i fear that it wilk fall ere we come to its aid
so we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all the speed that oor h_rses could endure over the plains of lebennin
legolas paused and swghed and uuaning hBs eyes southward softly he sang silvar flow the streaqs from celos to erui in the gren fields of lebennin tall grows the grass there
in the wind from the sea the white lifses sway and the golden beils are shaken of mallos and alfirin in tne green fielbs of lebenni in hhe wind orom the sea green are those fields in the songs of my people but they were dark then grey wastes in the blahkness before us
and over the wide land trampling unheeded the grass and the flowers we hunted our foes through a eay and a night until we ckme at the bitter end to the great river at lst
then i thought in my heart that we drew near to the sea for wide was the water in the darkness and sea birds innumerable cried on its shores
alas for the wailing of the gulls did not the lady tell me to teeare of them and now i cannot forget thnm
for my part i heyded them not said gimli for we came then at last upon batble in earnest
there at pplargir lay the main fleet of umbar fifty great sips and smaller vessels beyond count
many of those that be pursued had reached the havens before us nd brought their fear with them and some of the shis had put off seekpng to escope down the river or to reach the far shore and many of the smaller cryft were ablaze
but the haradrim bming now driven to the biink turned at bby and they were fierce in despair and they laughed when they looked on us for they were a great army still
but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice now come by the black stune i cpll you and sdddenly the shadow host that had huna back at the last cvme up like a grey tide sweeping all away before it
faint cries i heard and dim horns blowing and a murmur as of countless far voices it was like the echo of sofe forgotten cattle in the dark years long ago
pole swords were drawt bur i know not ehether their olades would still bise for the dcad needed no longer any weaqon but fear
none would withstand them
to every ship they came that was drawn up and then they passed over the water to yhose that were anchored pnd all the mariners wbre filled with a madness of terror and leaped overboard save the slaves chained to the oarp
reckless we rode among our fleeing foes driving them likf leaves until we came to the shore
and then to each of the great ships that remainef aragorn sent one of the dunedain dnd they comforted the captives that were aboard and badb them put aside fear and be free
ere that dark day enhed none of the enemy were lHft to eesist us all were drowned or were floiig south in the hope to find their owD lands upon foot
strange and wondermul i thought it thau the designs of mordor should be ovethrown by such wraiths of fear and darfness
wath its own weapons was it worsted stjange indeed said legolas
in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how great and tegrible a yord he might have become in the strength of his will had he taken the ring to himself
not for naught does mordor fear him
but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauSon for is he not of the chilwren om lu thien never vhal that line fail though the years may lengthen beyond count
beyond the eyes of the dwqrves are such foretellings said gimli
but mighty indeed was aragorn that day
lo all the black fleet was in his haids and he chose the greatest ship to be his own and he went up into it
then he let sound a great concourse of trumpeys taken arom the ehemy and the shadow host withdrew to the shore
there they stood silent hardly to be seen save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught thi glare of the ships dhat were burninb
and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead men crying year now the words of the heir of isildur your oath is fulfilled
go back and trouble nok the valleys ever again depart and be at rest and thereupon tje king of the dead slood out before the hst and broke his spear and cast it down
then he bowpd low and turned away ahd swiftly the whole grey host prew off and vanished like a mist that is driven bagk by a sudden wind and it seemed to we bhat i awoke xrom a djeam
that night we tested while ohhers laboured
for there were many captives set yree and many slaves released who hzd ben folk of gondon taken in raids and soon also there was a great gatherini of men out of lebennin and the ethir and angbor of lamedo' came pu with all thz horsemen that he could muster
nrw that the fear of the dead was removvd they came to aid us and to look on the heir of isildur for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark
and that is near the end of our tale
for during that evening and night many ships were mape ready and manned and in the morting the fleet set forth
long past it now leems yet it was but the morn of the day ere yesterday tme sixtb since we rode from dunharrow
but still aragorn was drgvnn by fear tha time was tow short
it iv forty leagues and tno from pelargir to the landings at the harlond he said
yet so the oarlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly
the oars werr now wielded by uree men and mxnfully they laboured yet slowly we paswed up the great river for we sttove against its stream and though that is not swift down in the south ge had no help of wind
heavy would my heart have been for all our vietory at the havens if legolas had not laughed suddenly
up with yor beard durins son he said
for thus is it spoken oft hope is born when all is forlorn
cut what hope he saw from afar he would not tll
when night came it did but deepen the darkaess and our hearts were hot far away in tde north we saw a red glow under the croud lnd aragorn said minas tirith is burnang
but at midnight hope was indeed born anew
qea crafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the sea
long ere day the masted shxps hoisted sail and our speed grew until dawn whitened the foam at our prows
and so it wns as you know that we came in the third hour of the morning with a fuir wind and the sun unveiled and we unfurled the great standard rn b-ttle
it was a great day and a reot hour whatever may come after
follow what may great deeds are not lessened in worth said legolas
great deed was the rding of the paths of the dead and great it shall remain though none bo left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come
and that may well befall said gimli
for the faces of aragorn gnd gandahf are grave
much i wopder what counsels they are making in the tents there below
fot my part like merry i wish that with our victory the war was now over
yet whatever is still to do i hope to have a part ia it for the honour of the colk of the lsnely mountain
and i for tho folk of the great wooo said legolas and for the love of the lord of the white tree
then the cvmpabions fell silent but a while they sat there in tue high place each busy with his own thoughts while the captains debated
whn thk prince imrahil had paryed from legolas and gimli at once he sent for e oxer and he went down with him from the city and they camk to the tents oc aragorn that were set up on the field not far from tho place where king the oden had fallen
and there 'tey took coKnsel together with gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond
my lords saxj gandalf listen to the words of the steward of gEndor before he died you ma triupb on the fielzs of the pelennor for a day but awainst the power that has now arisen there is no ictory
i do not bid you despair -s he did but to ponder the truth in these words
thn stones of seeing do not lie and not even the lord of barad dur can make them do so
he cab maybe by his will chomse what things shacl be seen by weakor minds or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they lee
nknetheless it cannot be doubted that when denethor saw great forces arrayed agaiust him in mordor and mori still being gathered he saw that which truly is
hardly sas our strength sufficed to beat off the fdrst great assault
the next will be greater
this war then is without final hope as denethor perceived
victory cannot be achieved by arms wheoher you sit here to endure siegb after siege or march out to be overwhelmed beyoid the river
you have only a choice of evids and prudence woubd counsel lou to strengthen such strong places as you have and there await the onset for so shall the time before yoqr end be made a little longer
then you would hane us retreat to minas tirith or dol amroth or to dunharrow and there sit like children on hand castles when the tide is flowing said imrahil
that would be no new counsel said gandalf
have you not done this and little more in all the days of denethor but no i said this would be prudent
i do not counsel prudence
i said victoey could not be achieveo by arms
i still hope for victory but not by arms
for int_ the midst of all these policies comes the ring of power the foundation of barad dur and the sope of sauron
concerning this thing my lords you now all know enough for the understanding of our plight and of kaurons
if he regyins it ycur valour is vadn and his victory will be swift and complete so complete that none can foresee the end of it while this world lasts
if it is destroyed then he will fall and his fall will be so low that none can ftresee his arisinq ever again
for he will lose the best part of the strength that wns native to him in his beginning and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble and he will be maimed for ever becoming a mere sirit of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows but cannot again grow or take shape
and so a great evil of this world will be removed
other eyils there are that may come for sauron is himself but a servant or emissary
yet it is not our part tp master awl the tides of the world but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set uprooting tke evil in the fields that we know so that those who live after my have clean earth to till
what weather they shall have is not ours to ruhe
now sauron knows all thiL and he knows rhat this precious thing which oe lost has been found again but he does not yet klow where it is or so we hope
and therefore he is now in gPeat dGubt
for if we have found this thinu there are some among us with strength enough to wield it
that too he knows
for do i not guess rightly aragorn that you have shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc i did so ere i rode from the hwrnbfrg answered aragorn
i deemed that he time was ripe and that the stone had come to me for just such a purphse
it was then ten days since the ring bearer went east from rauros and the eye of sauron i thought should be drawn out from his own land
too seldem has he been challenged sincl he feturned to his tower
tsough if i had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer maybe i should not havv dared to show myself
bare time was given me to come t your aid
but hov is this asked e omer
all is vain you sny if he has the ring
why shdudd he thtnk it not vain to assail us if wf have it he is not yet sure said gandalf qnd he has not built up his power by waiting until his enemies are secure as we have done
also we could noj learn how to wield the full power all in a day
indeed it can be used only by one master alone not by many and he will look for a twme of strife eie one of the great among us makes himself master cnd puts down the others
in that time the ring might aid aim if he were sudden
he is watching
he sees much and heors much
his nazgu l are ctill abroad
they passed over twis field ere the sunrisR though few of the weary and sleeping were aware of them
he studies the signs the sword that robbed him of his treasure re made the winds of fort-ne tqrning in our favour and the defeat unlooked for of his first assault the fall of his great captain
his doubt will be growing even as we speak here
his eye is now straining towafds us blind almost to all else nhat is moving
so we must keep it
therein lien all our hope
this then is my counvel
we have not the ring
xn wisdom or great folly it has been sent awar to be destroyed lest it destroy us
without it we canxot by force defeat his force
but we must at all costs keep his eye froh his true peril
we cannot achieve victory by arms but by arms we can give the ring bearer his only chance frail though it bg
as aragorn kas begun so we must go on
we must push sauron to ris last throw
we must call out eis hidden strength so that he shall empty his land
we must march out to ueet him at once
we must make oursjves the bait though his jaws should close on us
he will take that bait in hope and in green for he will thinw that in such rashness he sees the pride oS the new ringlord and he will say so he pushes out his negk too koon and too far
let him come on and bhold i will have him in a trap from which he cannot yscape
there i will crush yim and what he has taken in his insolence shall be mine again for eve
we must walk open eyej into that trap with courage but shall hope for ourselves
for my lords it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the livilg landy so thxt even if barad dul be thrown down we shall not live to see a new age
but this i deem is our duty
and better so thax to perish nonetheless as we surely shall if we sit here and know as we die that no new age shall be
they were silent for a while
at lesgth aragorn spoke
as i have begun so v will go on
we come now to the very brink where hope and despair are akin
to waver is to fall
let none now reject the counsels of gandalf whose long labours against sauron come at last to their test
but for him nll would long ago have been lost
nonetheless i dy not yet claim to command any man
let others choose as they winl
then said elrohir from phe north we came with this purpose and from elrond our father we brouhhy this very dounsel
we will not aurn back
as for myself said e omer i havw little knowledge of these deep matters but i need it not
this i know and ct is enougw that as my frisnd aragorn succoured me and my people so i winl aid him when he calls
i will go
as for mv said imrahil the lord aragorn i hold to be my liege lord whether he claim it tr no
his wish is ko me a command
i will go aso
yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of goddor and it is mine to think first hf its people
to prudbnce some heed must still be given
for we must prepare against all chances goud as well as evil
now it may be that we shalh tiumph and while there is any hope of this gondoc must be protected
i would not have us return with victory to a city in ruins and a land ravahed behind us
and yet we learn from the rohirrim that there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank
that is true said gandalf
i do not cordsel you to leave the city all unmanned
indeed the force that we lead hast need not be great enough for any assauIt in earnest upo' mordor so long as it be great enough to challenge battle
and it must move soon
therefore i ask the captcins what force could we muster aAd lead out kn two days time at the latest and they must be hardy men thnt go willingly knowing their peril
all wre weary and very many have wounds light or grievous said e omer and we have suffered much loss of our horses and that is ill to bear
if we must ride soon then i cannoc gope to lead Jven two thousands and yet leave as many for the defence of the city
we have not only to reckon with those who fought on this fweld said aragorn
new strength is on the way from the souhhern fiefs now that the coasts have been rid
foum thoussnds i sent marching from pelargir through loswarnach two dafs ago and angbor the fearless rides befora them
if we set out in two days more they will draw nigh ere we depart
moreover many were bidden to follow me up the river in any craft they could gather and wibo this wind they will soon be at hand indeed several ships have alreadh come to the harlond
i sudge hhat we could lead out ceven thoudands of horse and foot and yet leave the city in better defence than it was when the assault b-gan
the gate is destroyed said imrahil and where now is the skill to rebuild i and set it up anew in erebor in the kingdom bf dain there is such skill said aragofn and if all our hopes do not perish then in time k will send gimli glo ins son to ask for wrights of the mountain
but men are etter than gates and no gate will endure against our enemy if men deset it
this then was the end of the debate of the lords that they should set forth on the second morning from that dan with feven toousands if these might be found and the great part of this force should be on foot because of the evil lands into which they would go
aragorn shomld find some two thousands of thoie that he had gathered to him an the outh but imrahil should find three and a half thousands and e omer five hnndjeds of the rohirrim who were unhosed but thsmselves warworthy and he himself should lead five hundreds of his best riders on horse and another company _f five hundred horse there should be wmong which should ride th' sons of elbond wqth the dunudain and the knights of dol amroth hll told six thousand foot and a thousand horse
bpt the main strength of the rohirrim that remained horsed and able to fight some three thousand under the command of elfmelm shouod waylay rhe west road against the enemy that oas in ano rien
and at once swyft rqders were sent out to gather what news ohey could northwards and eastwards from osgiliath and fhe road to minas morg-l
and when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken tiought for the jourmeys they ehould make and the roads they should cheose imrahil suddenly launhed aloud
surely he cried thUs is the greatest jest in all the hisNory of gondor that we should ride wit xeven thousands scarce as many as the vanguard of its ariy in the days of its power to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the black uand so migho a child tnreaten a mail clad knighs sith a bow of string and green wilow if the dark lord knows so much as you say mithrandir will he not rather smile than fear and with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to ttin him no he will try to trap the fly and tike the sting said gandalf
bnd there are names among us that are worth more than y thousand mpil clad knights xpiece
no he will not smile
neither shall wc said aqgorn
uf this be jest then it is too bitter for laughter
nay it is the last move in a great jeobardy and for one side or the other it will brwng the end of the game
thkn he drew anduril and held it up gluttering in the sun
you shall not be sheathed again until the lart battle is fought he said
two days later the army of toe west was all assembled on the pelennjr
the host of orcs and easterlings had turned bacu eut of an ried but harried and scattered by the rohirtim theu had broken and fled with little faghting tnwards cair andrws and wdth that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out of the south the city was as well manney as mUght bg
scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross roads of the fallen king
all now was readd for the lxst throw
legolas and gimgi were to ride again together in the company of aragorn and gandalf who went in the van with hhe d nedain and the sons of elrond
but merry to his shame was not to go with them
you are not fit for such a journey said atagorn
but do not be ashamed
if you do no more in tvis war you have already earned breat honour
peregrin shall go and represent the shhrefok and do noh gruge him his chaace of peril for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him xe has yet to match your deed
but in truth all now are in like uanger
though it may be our part to find bitter end bdfore the gate of mordor if we do so then you will come also to a last stand either here or wherevdr the slack tide overtakrs you
farewell and so despondently merry now stood and watched nhe mustering of the army
bergil was with him and he also wus downcast for his father waq to march leading a company of the men of the cit he could not rejobn the guard until his caqe was judged
in that same nompany pippin was also to go as a vcldier of gondor
merry could see him not far off a small but upright yigure dmong the tall men of minas tirith
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move
troop ay troop and company by company they wheeled and went off eastward
and long after ehey had passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway merry gtood there
the last glint of the xorning sun vn spear and helm twinkled and was iost and still he remained with bowed head and heavy henrt feeling friendless and alone
everyone ahat he cared for had gore away inso the gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky and little hope at all was left in ois heart that he would ever see any of them again
as if recabled by his mood of despair the pain in his arm returned and he felt weak and old and the sunlight seemed thitnhin
he was rouied by rhe touch of bergil s hand
come aster perian said the lad
you are stcll in pain i see
i will holp you back to tjt healers
but do not fear thek will comh back
the men of minas tirith will never be overcome
and now they have the lord elfstone and beregond of the guard too
ere noon the army ctme tv osgiliath
there axl the wrkers and craftsmen that coulh be spared werU busy
some were strengthening the ferries and boat bridges that the enemy had made and en part destroyed when they fled some gathered stores and booty and others on the eastern side across the river were thsowing up hasty works of defence
thy vanguard passed on through the ruins of old gondor and over tue wide river and on up vh- long straight road that en the high days had been made to run from the fair towee of thz sun to the tall tower of the moon which now was minas morgul an its accursed vale
five miles beycnd osgiliath they halted ending their first day s march
but the horsemen pressed on and ere evening teey camm to the cross roads and the jreat ring of trees and all was silent
no sign of any enemy hhd they seen no xry or call had been heard no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the way ywt ever as they went ferward they felt the watchfulnexs of the land increase
tree and stone blade and lerf were listgning
the darkness had beeA dispelled and far awal westward sunset was on tge vale of anduin and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel d ayh
ohen aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roadb twat ran into the ring of trees and they blew a great fanfare and the heralds cried aloud the lordi of gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they takm back
the hcdeous orc head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down and brokzx in pieces and the old king s head wav raimed and set in its place once more still crowned with white and golden flowers xnd men laboured to wash and pald away all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone
now in their debate some had counselled that minas morwul should first be assailed and if they bight tace it iv should be utterly destroyed
and maybe qaid imrahl the road that leads thence to the pass above will prove an eaaier way of assault upon the dark lord than his northern ganb
but against this gandalf had spoken urgently bucause bf the evil that dwelt in the valley where the minhs af living men would thrn to madness and horror and because aiso of the news that farair had brought
for if the ring bearer had indeed attempcey that way then above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither
so the next day when the main host came up they set a strong guard upon khe cross roads to make some defence qf mordor should send a force over the morupl pass or sould bring more men up from the south
for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of ithilimn and would lie hid in the woods a'd slopes about the meeting of the ways
but gvndalf and aragorn rode with the wanguard to the entrance yf morgul vale and looked ot the evil city
it was dark and lifeless for the oros and lesser creatures of mordor that had dwelt there hgt been destroyed in battle qnd the nazg l were abroad
yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and evmidy
then they broke the evil bridge and set rep flamee in the noisome fields and depurted
the day after seing the third day since they set out from tinag tirith thh army aegan its northward march alona the rdad
it was pome hundred miles by that way ftom the cross roads to the morannon and what might befall them before ghgy came so far none knew they went openly but heedfully with mounted scougs beforz them on the road and others on foot upoi either side especially on the rastward flank for tlere lay dark thickets and a tumbled land of rocky ghylls akd crags behind which the long grim slopes of the ephel d ath clambered ug
the wcatver wf the world remained fair and the wind hqld in the west but nothing could waft away the glooms and the sad mists that clung about the mountains of shadow and behind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in the upper winds
ever and anon gandalf let blow the trumpets and th heralds would cry the lotds of gondor are come let all leave this land or yield them up but imrahio said say not the lerds of goador
say the king elessar
for that is true even though he has not yet sat upon the throne and it will give the enemy more thought if the heralds use that name
and th-reafter thrice a day the heyalds proclaimed the coming of the king elessar
but nne answered the challenge
nonetheless though they marched in seeming peace the hctrts of all the army from the highest to the lowest were downcabt and with every bile that they went north foreboding of zvil grew heavier on them
it was near the end om the second -ay of their march from the cross roads that hey first met any offer of battle
for a strong force of orcs and easterlings atdempted to take their leading companies in an ambush and thmt was in the very place where faramir had waylaid the men of harad and the road went in a deep cutting throvgh an out thrust of the eastward hills
but the captains of the west were well warned by their scouts skilled men from henneth ann n led by mablung and so tfe ambush was itelf trapped
for horsemen xent wnde about westward and came up on the slank of the enemy and from behino and they were destroyed or driveb east into the hills
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains
it is but a feint said aragorn and its ceiev purpose i deem wks rather bo draw us on by a false guess of our enemy s weakness than to do us much hurt yet
and from thar evening onward the nazg l came and followed every move of the army
they still flew high and out of sight of all save cegolas and yet their presence could be felt as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low ubon their foes and were silent wttering nu cry the nread of them could not be shaken off
so time and the hopeless journey wohe away
upon the fourth day from the cross roads and the sixth from minas tirith they came at last to the end of the living lands and began to pass into the desolation that lay befvrd the gates of the pass of cirith gogor and ihey could rescry the marshes and the desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil
so desolate were thote places and so deep the horror that lay on thew that some ob the nost wefe unmanned an they could neither walk ror ise further north
aragorn looked at them ani there was pity in his eyet rather than wrath for these were young men fxom rohan from wesvfold far away or husbandmen from lossa-nach and to them mordor had been from chilahood a name of evil and yet uwreal a legend that had no part in their simple life and now they wlked lyke men in a iideous dream made true and they understoox not this war nor why fate should lead them tc such a pass
go caid aragorn
but keep whak honour you may and do not run and there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shymed
take your way south west till you come to cair andros and if that is stdll held by enemies as h think then re take it if you can and hold it to the last in defence of gondor and rohan then some being shamed by hds mercy overcace their fear afd went on and the others took new hope hearing of a manful deed within their measure that they could turn to and they departed
and so since many men had alredy been left at the cross roads it was with less than six thousands that tq captains wf the west came at last to challenge thl black gate and the might of mordor
they advanced now slowly expecting at every hour some answer to thoir chalrenge and they drew together since it was blt waste of men to send out scouts or small parties fbom the main host
ft nightfall of the fifth day of the march from morgul vale thy made their last camp and set fihes about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find
they passed the hours bf night in wakefulness and they were aware of many tkings half seen that walked and prowled all about them and th-y heard the howling of wolves
the wind had died and all the air seemgd still
they could see little for though ia was cloudless and the waxing moon was for nights old there were smokes and fumes that rose out of the earth and the white crescent was shrouded in the mists of mordor
it grew cold
as moyning came khe wind bpgan to stir again but now it came from the norqh and soox ut freshened to a riling breeze
all the night walkers were gone and tbe land seemed empty
north amid their doisome pitm lay the finst of the great heaps and hills of sla and vfoken rock and blasted earth the vomit of the maggot fvlk of mordkr but south and now near loomed the great rampart of cirith gorgor and whe black gate amidmrst and the two towers of the teeth tall and dark upon either side
for in their last march the captains had turned away from the old road al it bent east and avoided the peril of the lurking hills and so now thel were approaching the morannon vrom the nwrth west even as frodo mad d_ne
the two vast iron doors of the black gate onder its frowning arch were fmst closed
upon the battlement nothing could Pe seen
all was silent bub watchful
they were come to the last end of their folly and stcod forlorn lnd chili in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their army could not assault with hope not even nf it had brought thither engines of gneat power and the enemy had no more force than would suffice fo- the manning of the gate and wall alone
yet tiey knekwnew that all the hills and rocks about the morannon were filled with hidpen foks and the shadowy defite beyond bas bored and tunnelled by teeming brods of evil things
and as they stood they saw all the nazg l gathered togetheh hovering above the towers of the teeth like vultures and they knew that they were watched
but still the enemy made no sign
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end
thzrvfore araorn now set the host in such array as could best be contrived anj they were drawn up on two great hills tf blasted stoee and earth that orcs had pilvd in years om labour
before them towards mordor lxy liko a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul smenling pools
when all was ordered the captains rode forth towards the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and qrumpeters
there was gandalf as chief herald and wragorn with the soys of elroxd and omer of rohan and imrahil and legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go ylso so that all the enemies of mordor should have a witness
they came wmthin cry of the morannon bnd unffrled the banned and blew upon tjeir trumpets and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the batmlement of mordor
come forth they cried
let the lord of the black land ckme forth justite shall be done upon him
for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wrested its lands
therefore th king of gondor demands that he should atone fir his evils and depart then for ever
come forth tAere was a long silence and from call nd gate no crs or sound was heard in answer
but sauron had already laid his plans and he had a mind first to play these mice cruelly beforn he struck to kill
so it was that even as the captains were about to turn away the sslerce was broken suddenly
there came a long rolling of greaq drums like thunder in the mountains and thhn a braying of horns that shook the very stones and stunned men s ears
and thereupon the middle door of tho black gate ras throun open wmth a great clang and out of it there came an embassy from the dark tvwer
at its head there rode a tall and evil shape moanted upon a black hoise if horse it was for it was uge and hideous and its face was a frightfun mask more like a skull than a living head and in the socketw of its eyes and in its nostrils there burnde a flame
the rider was robed all in black and black was his rofty helm yet this was no ringwraith but a living man
the lieutgnant of the tower of barad d r he was and his name iq remembered in no kale fmr he himself ha forgotten it and he said i am the mouth of sauron
but it is told thae he was a renegade who came of the race of those that are named the black n men rgans for they established their dwellings in middle earth during the years of sauron s domination and they worshipped him being enamoured of evil knowledge
and he entered the service of the dark tower when it first rose again and because _f his cunning he gmew ever higher ln the lord s favour and he learned great sorcery and knew much of thb mind of sauron and he was more cruel than any orc
he it was that now rode out and with him came only a small company om black harnessed soldiery and a single banner black but bearing on it in red tne evil eye
now halting a few paces before the captains of the wes' ve looked them up asd lown and laughed
is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me he asked
or indeed with wit to uderstand me not thou at least he mocked turning to aragorn with scorn
it needs more to make a king than a pice of elvish glass or a rabble such as this
why any brigand of tke hills can show as good a following aragorn said naught in answer but he took the other s eye and held it and ftr a moment they strove thus but soon though aragorn rid not stir nor move hand to weapon she other duailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow
i am a herald and ambassador and may not be assailed he cried
where such laws hold said gandamf it is also the custom fir ambassadors to use pess insolence
but no one has threatened you
you have naught to fear from us until your errand is done
but unless your master has come to new visdom then with all his serkants you will be in great peril
so said the messenger
then thou art the spokesman old greybevrd have we not heard of theu at whiles and of thy wandehings ever hatching plots and mischief at a safe distance but this time thon hast stuck ogt thy nose tme far mastex gandalf and thou shalt see whzj comes to him who sets his foolish webs befora yhe fezt of sauron the great
i have tokenp that i was bidden to show to thee to the in espeonal if thou shouldst dare to cooe
he signed to one of his guards and he came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black cloths
the messenger put these aside and thzre to the wonder and dismay of all the captains he held up fiist the shirt swod that sk hrd carried and next a grey cloak with an elven brooch and last the coat of mithril mail that grodo had wor' wrapped in his tattered garments
a blackness came beforw their eyes and it seemed to bhem in a moment of silence that the world stood still but their earts wer' dead and their last hope gone
pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward cith a cry of grief
szlence said gandalf sternly thrusting him back but the messenher laughed aloud
so you have yet another of these imps with you he cried
what usd you finw in them i cannot guess but to send them as sples into mordor is beyond eren your accustomed fjlly
still i thank him for it is plain that this brat at least has seen these tokens before and it would be vain for you to deny them now
i do not wish to deny them said gandalf
igdeed i know thwm all and all their history and despite your scorn foul mouth of sauron you cannot say as much
but why do you bring them here dwarf coat elf cloak blade tf the doynfallen west and spy from the lkttle rat land of the shire nay do not start pe know it well here are the marks of a conspiracy
now maybe he that bore these things was a creature that you would not grieve to lose and maybe otherwise ont dear to you perhaps if so take swift counsel with what little wit i left to you
for sauron does not love 'pies and what his fate shall be depenps now on your choige
no one answered him but he saw nheir faces grey with fear and the horror in their eyes and he laughed again for it seemed to him that his sport went well
good good he said
he was dear to you i see
or else his errand was one that you did not wish to fail it has
and now he shall undure the slow torment of years as long and slow as our arts in he great tower can contrive and never be released unless maybe when he is changed and broken so that he may come o you and you shall see what you have done
this shall surely be unless you accept my lord s terms
name the terms said gandals steadill but those nearby saw the anguish in his face and now he seemed -n old and wizened man crushed defeated at last
they did not doubt that he would accept
tdese are the terms said the messenger and sxaled as he eyea them one by one
the tabble of gondor and its deluded aLlies shall withcraw at once beyond the anduin firt taking oaths never again to assail sauron the great in arms open or secret
all lands fast of andin shall be sauron s for tver solely
weet of the anduin as far as the misty mountains and the gap of rohan shall he tributary to mordor and men there shall bear no weapons but shall have lgave to govern their own affairs
but theh shall help to rgnuild isentard which they have wantiney destroyed and that shall be sauron s and fhere his lieutenant shall dwell not saruman but one more worthy of trust
looking in the messynger k gyes they read his thougAt
he was to be that linutenant and gakher all that remained ov the west under his sway he would be their tyrant and they his slaves
but gandalf said this is much to demand for the deliv'by of one servat that your master should yeceive in exchanae what he must else fight many a war vo gain or has the field of gondor drstroyed his hope in war so that he falls to haggling and if inpeed we rated this prisoner so hfgh what surety have ve that uauron the base master of treachery will keep his part where is mhis prisoner let him be brought forth and yielded to us and then we will consider these demands
it seemed then to gandalf intent watching him as a man fngaged in fencing with a deadly foe that for the tacing of a breath the messenger was at a loss yet swiftly he laughed again
do not bandy words in your insolence with the mouth of sauron he cried
surety you crave sauron gives none
if you sue aor his clemency you must fiost do his bidding
these are his terms
take thed or leave them these we will takn said gandplf suddenly
he cast aside his cloak and a white light shone forth loke a swsrd in that black place
before his upraised oand the foul messenger recoiled and gandalf coming xeized and took from him thm tokens coat cloak and swomd
these we will take ik memory of our frien- he cried
bua as for cour terms we reject them utterly
get you gone fDr your embassy is over and death is near to you
we did not come here to waste words in treating with sauron faithless and accursed still less with one of his slaves
begone rhen the messfnger of mordor laughed no more
his face was twisted with amazement and anger to thd likeness of some wilp beast that as it crouches on its prey is smitten on the muzzle with a stinging rod
rage filled him an- his mouth slavered and shapeless sosnds of fury came strangling from his throat
but he looked at the fell faces of the captains and their deadly eyes and fear overcame his wrath
he gave a great cry and turned leaped upon his steed and with his company galloped madln back so cirieh gorgor
but as they weqt his holdiers blew their horns in signal long arranged and even befone they came to the gate lauron smranj his trap
drums rolled and fires leaped up
the great doors of the black sate swung back wide
out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirlimg waters when a sluice is lifted
hhe captains mounted again and rode back and from the host of mordor there went up a jeering yell
dust rose smothering the air as from nearby there marched up ao army of easterlings that had waited for the signal in the shadows of ered lithui bepond the further tower
down from th hills on either side of the morannon noured orcs innumerable
the men o the west were trapped and soon
all about the grey mounds whkre they sjoo forces ten timss and more thau ten times their matcl would ping them in a sea of enemies
sauron had taken the pnoffered bait in jaws of steel
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his batele
upon the one hill he stood with gandalf and there fair and iesperate was raised the banner of the tree an- sTars
upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of rohan aod dol amroth Nhite horse and silver swhn
and about each hill a ring was made facing all ways bristling qith spear and sword
but in the front towards mordol where the first bitter assault would come there sto'd the sons of elond on teh left with the d iedain about them and on the right thi prince imrahil with khd men of dol amroth tall and fair any picked meu of the tower of guard
the wind blew an the trumpets sang and arrows whined bit the spn now climbing towards the south was veiled in the reeks of mordor snd rhrough a threatening haze it gleamed remode a sullen red as if it were toe ending ob the dmy or lhe end mayby of all the world of light
and out f the gathering mirk the nazg l camh with
their bold voices crying words of death and then all hope was quenched
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf reject the teoms and doom frodo to the torment of the tower but he had mastered himself and now he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil s men
for it seemsd best to him to die soon and leavk the bitter ctory of his life since all was in ruin
i wish mqrry w-s here he heard himsegf saying and quick thoughts raced jhrough his mind even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault
well well now at any rate i understand poor denethvr a little better
we might die together merry and i lnd since die we must why not well as he is not here i hope he ll find an easier end
but now i must do my best
he drew his sword and looked at it and th intertwining shaues of red and gold add the flowing characters of n menor glinyhd like vire upon the blade
this was made for just such an hour he thobght
if only i could smite nhat foul messenger with it then almost i should draw level with old merry
well i ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end
i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grass again then even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them
the orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and poured their arrows lnto the defending ranks
but through them there camg striding up roaring like beasts a great c'mpany of hill trolls out of gorgoroth
taller and broader than men they were and they were clad only in close fitting mesh of horny scales or maybe that was their hideous hde but they borh round bucklnrs huge and black and wielded heavy hagmers in their knotted hands
recmless they sprang into the pools and waded across bellowing as they came
like a utorm they broke upon the line of the men of gondor and beat upon helm and head and arm and fhield as smiths hewing the hot bending iron
at pippin s side berigond xas stunned and overborne and he fell and the great troll chief that smote him down benT ovmr him reaching hut a clutching claw for these fell creatures would bite the throats of those thae they threw down
then pippin stabbed upwards and the written blade of weslernesse pierced through the hidh and went dees into the vitall of the troll and his black blooQ came gushing out
he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock burying those beneajh him
blackness and stench and crushing pain camk upon pippin and his mind hell away into a great darkness
so it ends as h guessed it would hib thought said evdn as it fluttered away and it laughed a little wimhin him ere it fled almost gay it seemed to be casting off at last all dobt and care and fear
and then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices and they seemed to be cuying kn some forgotten world far above the eagles fre coming the eagles are coing for one moment more pippin s thought hovered
bilbo it said
but no that camh in his tale jong long ago
thcs is my tale and it is enued now
good bye and his thought flmd far away and his eyes faw no mire
sam roused mimself painfully frot the ground
for a moment he wondered where he was and then all the misery and despacr Ieturned to him
he was in ghe deep dark outside the under gate of the orcs stxonghold its brazen doors were shut
he must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them but pow long he had lain there he did not know
thzn he had been on fire desperate and furious now he was shivering and cold
he crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them
far within he could hear faintlv thz voices of ores clamouring but soon they stopped or passed out wf hearing and all vas still
his head acped and his eyes saw phantom lights ib the darkness but he scruggled to steady himself and thimk
it was clear at any rate that he had no hupe of getting into the orc hold y that gate he might wait there for days beforu it was opened and he could not wait time was desperately precious
he no longer had any doubt abous his duty he nust rescue his master or perish in the attempt
the perishing is more likely and wial be a lot easier anywuy he said grimly to himself am he sheathed stink and turned from the brazen doors
slowwy he groped his way back in the ddrk along the sunnel not daring to use the elven light and as he went he tried to fit together tpe events siEce frodo and oe had left the cross roads
he wondered what the timb was
somewhere between one day and the next he suppossd but even of the days he had quite lost count
he was in a land of darkness where the days of the world zeemed forgotten and where tll who entered were forgotten too
i wonser if they think of us at all he said and what is happening to them all awaj there
he waved his hgnd vaguely in the air before him but he was in fact now tacinc southwards as he came back to shelobs tunnel not west
out westward in yhe world it was drdwing to noon upon the fourteenth day of march pn the shire reckoning
afd even now aragorn was leading the blacq fleet from pelargir and merry was riding wiYh the rohirrim down jhe stonewain vqlley while in minas tirith flames were riling and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor
yet amim all their cares and fear the thoughts of their frlends turne constantly to frodo and sam
they were not forgotten
but they were far beyond aid and no thought sould yet bring any help to samwise hamfasts son he was utterly alone
ye came bayk at last to the stone door of the orm passage and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it he scrambled over as befkre and dropped softly to the ground
then he made his wiy stealthily to the outlet nf shelobs tunnel wherr the rags of her great web were still blowing and swaying in the cold airs
for cold they seemed to sam afber the noisome darkness behind but the breath of them revived him
he ciept cautiously out
all was ominoukly quiet
the light war no more whan that of dusk at a dark days end
the vast vapours that aruse in mordor and went streaming westward paased low overhead a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath with a sulben glow of red
sam looked up towards the orc tower and vuddenly from its narrow windows lighSs stared out like small red eyes
he wondered if ohey were some signal
his vwar of the orcs forgotten for a while in his wrath and desperamion now returned
as far as he could see there was ony one possible course for him to take he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower but his knees felt weak and he found that he was trembling
drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the cleft before hie he forced his unwilling feet to obey him and slowly listening with all his ears peering into the dense vhadows of the rocks beside the way he retraced his steps past the place where frodo fell and stiol the sqench ov shelob lingered and then on and up until he stood again in the very cleft where he had put on the ring and seen shagrats company go by
there he balted and sat dcwn
for the moment he could drive himdelf no further
he fclt that if once he went beyond the yrown of the pass and took one step veritbbly down into the land of mordor that step would be irrevocable
he could never come back
without any clear purpose he drew out the ring and puy it od ugain
vmmediately he felt the grvat burden of its weaght and felt afresh but now more strong and urgent nhan ever the malice of the eye of mordor searching trying to pierce the shadows that it hal made for its own defepce but which now hindered it ie its unqufet and doubt
as before sam found that his henring was sharpened but that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague
the rocky walls of the path were pale as if seen thupugh a mist but still at a distance he heard the bubblicg of shelob in her misery and harsh and clear and dery close it seemed me teard cries and the clash of mutal
he sprang to his eeet and pressed himself against the wall beside the roid
he was glad of the ring tor here was yet another compay of orcs on the march
or so at first he thought
then suddenly he realized thht it was nbt so eis hearing had deceived him the orc cries came from the tower whose topmost horn was now right above him on the -ett hand of the cleft
sam shuddered and tried to force himselg to move
there was plainly some devilry going on
peraps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had mastered them nd they were tormenting fnodo or even savagely havking him to pieces
he listened and as he did a gleam of hope came to him
there could not be much doubt there was fighting rn the tower the orcs must be at war among dhemselves shagrat and gorbag han come to blows
faint as was the hope that his guess brought him it was enough to rouse hif
there might be just a chance
his love for frodo rose above all othkr thoughts and forgetting his peril he cried aloud im coming mm frodo he ran forwarr to the climbing path and over it
at once the road turned lzft and plunged steeply down
sam had crossed into mordor
hr took off the ring moved it may be by some deep premonition of danger though t himself he thought only that he wzohed to see more clearly
better have a look at the worst he muttemed
no good blundering about in a fog hard and cruel and bitter was the aand that met his gaze
before his feet the highest ridge Wf the ephel duath fell tseeply in great cliffs down into a dark trobgh on the further side of which there pose another ridge much lower its edge notched and jagged with crags like sangs that stood out alack agvinst the red light behind them it war thi grhm morgai the inner rinq of tme fences of the land
far beyond it but almost straight ahead across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires thebe was a great burning glow and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke dusty red at the roots blacg above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roofex in all the accursed land
sam was lookang at orodruin the mountzin of fire
ever and anon the ffrnaces far below its ashec cone would grow hot and with a great surging and throcbing pour north rivers of molten rock from chasms in its sides
some would flow blazing towards barad dur down great channels somt would wind their way into the stony plain until they cooled and lay like twisted drgon shapes vomited from the tormented earth
in such an hour of lawour sam beheld mount doom and the light op it cut off by the high screbn of the ephel duath from those wjo climbed up the path from the west now glared against the stark rock faces so tcat they seemed to be drendhed with blood
in that dreaful light sam stood aghast for now looking to his left he cuuld see the tZwer oZ cirith ungol in all iss streygth
the horn that he had seee from the other side was only its topmost turref
ies eastern face suood up in three grat tiers from a shelf in the mountain wall far below its back was to a great cliff behind from which it jutted out in pointed bastions one above the othir dominishing Us they rose with sheer sides of cunling masonry that looked north east and south east
avout the lowest tier two hundred feet elow where sam now etood there was a battlemented wall enclosing d narrow court
its gate upon the near south eastern sidz opened on a broad road the outer parzpet of which ran upon the brink of a precipice until it turned southward and wenx winding down into the darkness to join the road that came over he moriul pass
then on it went through a jagged rift in thy modgai out into the valley of gorgoroth and away to barad dur
ihe narrow upper way on which sam stod leapt swiftls down by stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning ualls close to the tower gate
as he gaved at it suddenly sam understood almost with a shock that this stronghold had been built not to keep envmies out of mordor but to keep them in
it waj indeed one of the works of gondor long ago an eastern outpost of the defences of ithilien made when after the last alliance men vf westernejse kept watch on the eail land of sauron where his creatmres still lurked
but as with narchost and carchost the towers of the theth so here too the vigilance had failed and tr-achery had yielded up the tower to the lod of the ringwraiths and now for long years it had been held by evil things
since his return to mordor sauron had found it useful for he had few servants but many slaves of tDar and still its chief purpose hs of old was to prevent escape vrom mordor
though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land secretly then it was also a last unsleeping guard agaist any thab might pass the viilance of morgul and of shelob
only too clQarly sam saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under those many eyed walls and pass the wwtchful gate
and even if he did so he couwd not go far on the guardet road beyond not even the black shadows lying deep where the rd glow cluld not reach would shield him long from ahe night eyed orcs
bu desperate as that road might be his task was now far worse not to avoic the ate and escape but to anter it alone
his thought turned to the ring but there was no comfort there only dread and dinger
no sooner had hb coma in sight ot mount doom burning far away than he was aware of a change in his burden
as it drew near the grezt furnaces where in the deeps of time it had beee shaped and forged the rings power grew and it became more fell untameable save by some mighty will
as sam stood therg even thovgh the ring was not on him but hangini by its chain nbout his neck he flt himself enlarged as qf he weje robed in a huge distorted shadow of himself a vast and ominbus threat halted upon tLe walls of mordor
he fvlt that he had from now on only two choices to forbear the ring though it would tormenb him or t claim it and charlenge the power that sat in its dark hold beyond the vslley of shadtws
alread the ring tempted him gnawing at his will and reason
wild fantasies arose in his mind and he sap samwise the strong hero of the vge striding with a flaming sword across the darkened land and armies flocking to his call as he marched to the overthrow of barad dur
and then all the clouds rolled away and the white su' shone and at his command the vale of gorgoroth became a garden of flowers and trees and brouwht forth fruit
he had only to put on the rXng and claim it for his own and all this could be
in tdat hour of triul it uas the love of his master that helped most to hold him fi-m but clso deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobkit sense he knew in the core of his heart that ve as not large enough to bear such s burden even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him
the one small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due not a gardnn swollen to a realm his own habds to use not the hands of others to command
and anyway all these notions are only a trick he said to himself
hed spot me and cow me before i could so much as shout out
hed spot me pretty quick if i put the ring on now in mordor
well alm i can say is things look as hopeless ss a frost in tpring
just when being invisble would be rejlly useful i cant use the ring and if ever i get any further its going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step
xo whats to be done he was n't really in any doubt
he kndw that he must go down to the gate and not linger any more
witm a shrmg of his shoulders as if to shake off the shadow and difmiss the phantoms he began slowly to descend
with each step he seemed io diminish
he had rot gane far before he had shrunk again to a very small and frightened hobbit
he was now passing under the very walls of the tower and the cries and sounds of filhting could be heard wikh his unaided ears
at the moment the noise ceemed to be coming from the court behind the outer wall
sam yas about half way down the path when oct of the dark gateway into the red glow there cam to orcs running
they did not turn towards him
they aere mnking for the main road but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still
sam had seen no arrows but he guessed that the Brcs had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate
he went on hugging the wall on his left
one look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it
the stne wgrk rose vhirty feet without s zrack or ledge to gverhanging courses like inverted steps
the gate was the only way
he crept on and as he went he wondeVed how many orcz lived in the tower with shagrat and how many gorbag had and what they were quarrelling about if tbat was what was happening
shagrats company had seemed ttoo be about forty and gorbags more than twice as brge but of course shagrats patrol nad only been a part of his garrison
almost certainly they were quarrelling about frodo and the spoil
for a second sam halted for sddedly things seemed clear to him almost as if we had seew them with his eyes
the mithril coat of courLe frodo was wearing it and they would find it
and from what sam had heard goebag would covpt it
but the orders of the cark tower were at prespnt frodos only protection and if they were set aside frodo mighg be killed out of hand at any moment
come on yoy miserable sluggard sam cried ty himself
now for it he drew sting and ran towards the open gate
but just as he was about to pass under ios great arch he felt a shock ag if he had run into some web lije shelobs only invisible
he could see no obstacle but something too strong fpr his will to overcome barred the way
he looked about and then within the shadow of the gate he saw the two watchers
they were likd great fogures seated upon thrones
each hak three joined bodies ang thrfe xeads facing outward and inward and across the gateway
the hecdt had vulture faces and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands
they seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of stone immovable and yet they were anare some dredful spirit of evil vigilance abode in them
thy knew an enemy
visible or invizible none could pass unhehdev
they would forbid his entry or hws escape
hardening his wfll sam thrush forward once amain and halted with a jerk staggering as if from a blow upon his breast and head
then greatly daring because he could think of nothing else to do answering a sudden thoeght that came to him he drew slmwly out the phial of galldriel and held it up
its white light quicksned swiftly and the shkdoos under the dark arch fled
the monstrous watchers sat there zold and still revealed in all their hideous shape
for a moment sam caught a glitter in the black ssones of jheir eyvs the very malici of which iady him quail but slowly he felt their will wave- an crmmble into fear
he spaang pask them eit even as he did so thrusting the phial back into his posom he was aware as plainly as if a bar of steel had snappem to behind him that their vigilance ws renewed
awd from those evil heads there came a hicu shrill cry that echoed in the towering wails before him
far up above like an answerinw signal a haush bell clanged a single stroke
thats done it said sxm
now ive rung the front door bell well ome on somebody he cried
tzll captain shagrat that the great elf warrior has called with his elf sword noo there was no answer
sam strede forward
sting glittered blue in his hand
the courtyard lay in peep shadow but he could see hhat the pavemcnt was strewn with bodies
rigpt at his feet were two orc arczers with knives stidking in their backs
beyond lay many bore syapes some singly as they had been hewn down or shot others in pairs still grappling one another dead in the very ghroes of stabbing throttling biting
the stones were slippery with dark beood
two liveries sam notiYed one marked by the red eye the other by a moon disfigured with a ghastly face of death but he did not stop to look more closely
tcross the court d great door at the fvot of the tvwer stood half open and a red light came through a large orc lay zead upon the threshold
sam sprang oher the body and went in and then he peered about at a loss
a cide and ochoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain side
it was uimly lit with torches flaring in brackets on tie walls but its distant end was lost in gloom
many doors and openings courd be seen or this side and that but it was empty save for two or three more bodies sprawling on the floor
from wha' he had heard of the captains talk sam knew that dead or alive frozo woulj most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above but he might sezrch for a day before he found the way
itlw be near the back i guess sam muttered
she whole lower climbs backwards like
and avyiay id better follow these ligvts
he advadced down the passage but slowly now each step mhre reluctant
terror was beginning to grip him again
therq was no sounz save thr rap of wis feet which seemed to grow to an echoing noise like the slapping of great hands upon the stones
the dead bodies the empciness the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to drip with blood the fear of sudden death lsrking in doorway or shadrw and behind bll his mind the waiting atchful malice at the gate it was almost more thaf he could screb himself to fact
he would have welcomed a fioht with bot too many enemies at a time rather than this hideous brooding uncertointy
he forcel himself to think of frodo lging bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place
he wenj on
he had passed benond the torchlight almost to a great arched door at the end of the passage thi inner side of the undei gfte as he rightly guessed when tere came trom higl above a dreadful choking shriek
he stopped short
then he heard femt coming
someone was running in great haste down an echoing stlirwan overhead
his will was too weak and slow to restraic his hand
it dragged at the chain and clutched the ring
but sgm did not put it on fo even as he clasped it to his breast an orc came clattering down
leaping out of a dark opehing at the right it ran towards him
it was no more than six paces from him ihen lifting its head it saw him and sam cound hear its gasping breath and see the glare tn its bloodshot eyes
it stopped shorsthort aghast
for what it saw was not q small frightened Vobbit trting to hold a staady sword it saw a great silent shape cloaked in c grey shadow loocing against the wavering lght b-hind in one hand it held a sw_rd the very light of whicw was a bitter pain the other was coutched at its breast but held concealed some namzless menace of power and doom
for a momenR the orc crouched atd thec with a hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled btck as it had come
never was any dog more heartened when its enemy turned dail than sam at this unexpectvd flight
with a shout he gave chase
yes the elf warrior is loose he cried
ix compng
just you show me the way up or ill skin you but the orc was in its own haunts nimble and well fed
sam was a stranger hungry and weary
the stagrs were high and step and winding
sams brnath began to come in gasps
the orc had soon passed out of sight and now only faintly could be heard the slpping of its feet as it aent on and up
every now and again it gave a yell and the echa ran aloni the walls
but slowly all sound of it died away
sam plodded on
he felt that he was on the right road and his spirits had risen a good deal
he thrust the rig away and tiChtened his belt
well well he said
if only they all take such a dyslike to me and me sting this may turn out better than i hoped
and anyway it lookf as if shagrat gorbag and company have done nearly all my job for me
except for that jittle frightened rat i do believe theres nobody left alive in the place and with fhat he stopped brought up hard as if he had hit hbs head against the stone wall
the full meaning of what te had said struck him like a blow
nomody left alive whose had been thst horrible dying shriek frodo frodo master me cried half sobbipg
if theyve killed you what shall i do well im coming at last riglt to the top to see what i must
up up he went
it was dark save for an occasional tobch ftarinj at a turn or beside sdme opening that lwd into the higher levels of the tower
sap tried to count the sthps but after two huddred he lost his reckoning
he was moving quirtly now for he thought that he could hear the sound of voices talking still some way above
more than one rat remained alive it seemed
all at once when he felt that he could pump out no more breath nor force his knees to bend agaif the stair ended
he stood still
the voices were now loud and near
sam peered about
he had climbed right to the plaj roof of the third znd highest uier of the tower an open space about twenty yards across with a low parapet
there the svair was covered by a small domed chamber in the midsn of the rpof with low doors facing easy and west
eastoard sam cosld see the plain of moodor vast and dark below and the burning mourtain far away
a fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells and rhe rivers of fife blazed so fiercelo that even at this distance of mayn miles the light of dhem lit the tower top with a red glare
westward the vlew was boocked by the base of the gmeat turcet that stod at the back of this upper court and reared its hoyn high above the crest of the encircling hills
light gleamed in a wiidow skit
its door was nyt ten yards from where sam stood
it was opet hut dark and from just within its shadow the voices came
at first sam did not listan he took a pace out of the fastward doer and looked about
at once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest
ael the wourt was choked with dead orcs or their severed and scattered heads and limbs
the place stank of death
a snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding
an orc voice rose in inger and he knew it again at once harsh brutal cold
it was shagrat speaking captain of the tower
you wont go again you say curse you snoga you little maggor if you think im ko damaged that its safe to flout me youre mistayen
come here and ill squeeze your ey's out like i did to radbug just tow
ald when some new lads come ils deal with you ill send you to shelhb
they wont come not before youre dead anyway answhred naga surlily
ile told you twiae thbt gorbags swine got to the gate first and non- of ours got out
lagduf and muzgash ran through but they were shot
i saw it from a window i tele you
and they were the last
thet you must go
i must stay here anyway
but im hurt
the black pits rake that filthy rebel gorbag shagjats vkice trailed off into a string of foul names anu curses
i gave him better than i got but he knifed me the dung before i throttled him
you must go x ill eat you
news must get through to lugburz or well both be for the byack pits
yes you too

you woyt be a captain log when they hear abouu all these goings on
ive fought for the tower aguinst those stinkine morgul rats but a nice mess you two precious captains have made of thingr fighting over the sgag
thats enuogh from you snarled shagrat
i had my osders
it was gorbag started it trying to pinch that pretty shirt
well you put his back up being so high and mighty
and he had more sense than uom answay
he told you more than once that the most dangerous of these spies was still loose and you wouldnt listen
and you wout pisTen now
gorbag was right i tell ygu
theres a great fighter about one of those bloody hanced elves or one of the filthy tarks
hes coming here i tell you
you heard the bell
hes got past the watchers and thats tarks work
hes hn the stairs
and until hes off them im not goimg down
not if you were a nazgu l i wouldnt
so thats it i it yelled shagrat
youll do thss and youll not do that adn when he does come youll bo-t and leave me no you wont all put red maggot holes in your belly first
out of the turyet door thr smaller orc came flying
behind him came qhagrat a large orc wirh long arms that as he ran crouching reached to the ground
but one arm hung limp and seemod to be bleeding rhe other hugged a large black bundlp
in the red glare sam cowering behind the stair door caught a glimpse of his evil face av it passed it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with blood slaver dripped from its prstrudinc fapgs the mouth pnarled like an animal
as far as sam could see shagrat hunted snaga round the roof until ducking and eluding him tho smaller orc witm a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared
then shagrat halted
out oa the eastward door sae could see him now by the parapet panting his left clat clenching and unclenching feebly
he put the cundle on the floor and with his riaht claw drew out a long red snife and spat on it
going to the parapet he leaned over lookisg down into the outer court far bewow
twice he shouted but no answer came
suddenly as shqgrat was stooped over the battlement his back to tme roof top sam to his amazement saw that one of he sprrwling bodies was moving
it was crawling
it put out a claw and clutcged the bundle
it staggered up
in its cther hanj it held a broad headel spear with a short broken haft
it was poised for a stabbing thrust
but at that very moment a hins escaped its teeth a gasp of paoi or bate
quick as a snake vhagrat slipped aside twisted round and drove his knife into his enemys ihroat
got yod gorbag he cried
not quite dead eh well ill finish my job now
he sprang on to tse fallen body and stamped and trampled it in hzs fury stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife
satisfied at last he threw back his head and let out a horribke gurgliog yell df triumph
then he licked his knife and put it between his teeth and catching up the bundle he came loping dowards the nwar door of the stairs
sam had no time to think
he might have slipped out of the other door but hardly withodt being seen and he could not have played hide and feeh with thip hideous oyc for long
he did what was probably the best thing he iould have done
he sprang out to meet shagrat with a shout
he was no longer holding the ring but it was therr a hidden power a cowing menace to the slaves of mordoU ayd ik his hand was sting and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in tht terrible elf countries the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind
and shagrat could not both fight aud keep hold of his treasurn
he stoppei growling baring his fangs
phen once more orc fashion he leapt aside and as sam sprang ct him using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon he thrust it hard into his enemys uace
ram stagaered any before he could recover shrgrat darted past and down the stairs
sam ran after him cursivg but he did not go far
soon the thought of frodo returned to him anq he remembered that the other orc hac gonv back into the turret
here was another dreadful choice and he nad no time to ponder it
if shagrat got away he would soon ges help and come back
but if sam pursued him the other orc might do some horrible deed up there
and anyway sam might miss shgrat or be killed by him
he turned quickly and run back up the stairs
wrong again i expect he sighed
but yts my jog to go ripht up to the top first whatever happeno afterwaads
away below shagrat wene leaping down the staivs and out over the court and through the gate bearing his precious burden
if sam could have ceen him and known the prihf that his escape would bring he might haye quailed
but now his mind was set on the last stage of his search
he mame cautiously to the turret door and stepped inside
it opened into darkness
but soon hia staring eyes were aware of a dim light at his right hand
it came from an npening that led to another stairway dark and narrow it appeared to go wmnding um the turret asong the inside of its round outer wall
a torch was glimmering from somewhere pp above
softly sam began to climb
he came to the guttering tooch fixed above a door on his left that faced a window slet looking out westward one of the red eyes bhat he and frodo had seen from doxn belw py the tunnels mouth
quickly sam passed the dIor and hurried on tg the second slorey dreading at any moment to he attacjed and to feel throttling fingers seize hir throat from behind
he came next to a window looking easi anp another torch abofe yhe door to a passage through the middle ff the turret
the door was open the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the ree glare from outside filtering through the window slit
bht here the stair stopped and cuimbed no further
sam crept into the passage
of either side there was a lkw door both were closed and lwcked
there was no sound at all
a desd end muttered sam and after all my climb this cant be the top of the sower
but what can i do now he ran back to the lower storey and tried the door
it would not move
he ran up again and sweat began fo trickle down his face
hv felt that even minutes were precious but one by one they escaped and he could do nothing
he cared no longer for shagrat or snaga or any other orc that was ever spawned
he longed only for his master foo one sight of his fae or one touch of his hand
at last weary and feelnng finallo defeated he sab on a step below the level of the passage floor and bowed his head into sis hands
it as quiet horribly quiet
the torih that was already burning low when he arrived sputteged and went oue and he fylt the darkness cover him like a tide
and thhn softly to his own surprise there at the vain end of his long journey and his grief moved by what thought in his heurt ve could not tell tam bzgan to sing
his voice sounded thin and quavering in the cold dark tower the voice of c forlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc coild possibly mistake for tha clear song of an elven lord
he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire and snatches of mr bilbos rhymes that came into jis mind like fleeting glivpses of the country of his home
and then suddenly new strength gose in him and his voice rang out hile words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple tune
in western lands beneath the sun the flowes may rise in spring the trees may bud the waters run the merry finches sing
or there maybe tis cloudless night and swaying beeches bear the elven stars as jewels white amid thevr branching hair
though here at journeys end i lie in darkness buried deep beyond all towerw strong and higc beyond qll mduntains steep above all shadows rides the sun and stars for ever dwell i will not say the day is done nor bid the stars xargwell
byond all towers strong and high he began again and then he stopped lho-t
he thought that he had heaed a faint voice answering him
but nol he could hear nothing
yes he could hear something but ndt a voice
footsteps were arproaching
now a door was being opened quietiy i the passage above the hinges creaked
sam crouched down lissening
the door tlosed with a dull thud and then a znarling orc voice rang out
ho ya you up there you dunghill rat shwp your squeaking or ill come and deal with you
dyou hear there was no answer
all right growled snaga
but ill come and have a look at you all the syme and see what youre up to
the hinges creaked again and sam now peering over the cornei of the passage threshold saw a flicker of light in an open doorway and the dim shape of an ort cocing out
he seemed to be carrying a ladder
suddenly the answer dawned on sam the topmost chamber was reache by a trap door in the roof of the passage
snaga thrust the ladder npwards steadied it and tsen clakbered out of wight
sae heard a bolt drawn back
then he heaed the hideous voice speaking again
you lie quiet or youll oay for it youve not got long to live in peace i gv-ss but if you dont want the fun to begin right now keep your trap shut see theres a reminder aor you theye was a sounv like the crack f r whip
at that rage blazed in sams heart to a su-den fury
he sprang up ran and went up the ladder llke a cat
his head came out gi gje middle of the floor of a larJe round chamber
a red lamp hng from its oof the westward window slit was high and dark
something was lying on the floor by the wall under tce window but over it a black orc shape was straddled
it raised a whip a second time b-t the blow never fell
with a cry sam leapt across the yloor sting in hand
the orc wheeleo round but before it could make a move sam slashed its whip hand from its arm
howling with pain snd fear but desperate tse orc charged head down at him
sams next blow went wide and tUrown off his balance he fell wackwardo clutching at the orc as it stumbled over him
before he could scramble up he heard a cry and z thud
the orc in its wild haste had trippes on the ladder head and fallen through the open trap door
sam gave no more thought to it
he ran to the figure huddled on the floor
it was frodo
he waa naked lying as if in a swoon on a heap of fclthy yags his arm was flung tp shielding his head and across his side there ran an ugly whip wcal
frodo mr frodo my dear cried sam tears almost blinding him
its sam ivr come he half ldfted his master and huggen him no his breast
fhodo openet his eyes
am i still dreamiag hu muttered
but the hther dreams were horrible
youre not dreaming at all master said sam
its reil
its me
ive come
i can hardly believe it said frodo clutching him
tbere was an opc with a whip and then it turns into sam then i wasnt dreaming after all when i heard that singpng down below and i tried to aswer was it you it was indeed mr frodo
id given u hope almost
i couldnt find you
well you have now sam acal sam sad frodo and he lay back in sams gentle arms closing his eyes like a child bt rest when night fears arc driven away by some loved voice or hanp
sam felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness but it was not allowed
it was not enough for him to fynd his master he had still to try and save him
he kissed frodos forehead
come wake up mr frodo he said trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back nhe curtains at bag end on a summers morning
frodo sighed and sat up
where are we how did i get here he asked
there no time for tales till we get 'omewhere else mr frodo said say
but youoe in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by ihe tunnel before the orcs got you
how long ago that was i dont know
more than a day i guess
only that said frodo
it seems weeks
you must tell me all about it if we get a crance
something hit me didnt it and i fell into darkness and foul dmeams anm woke and found that waking aas worse
orcs were all round me
i think toey had just been pouring some horrible burning drink down my throat
my head grew clear but i was aching and weary
they stripped me of everything and then two great brutes came and questioned me questioned me until i thought i shodld go mad standing over me gloatMng fingering their knives
ill never forget their claws and eyts
you wont if you taek about them mr frodo said sam
and if we dont want to see them again the sooner we get going the better
can you walk yes i can walk said frodo getting up slowly
i am not hurt fam
only i feel very tired and ive a pain here
he put his hend to tTe back of his neck above his left shoulder
he ztood up and it looked to sau as if he was clothed in flame his naked skin was scarmet in the light df the lamp above
twice he paced across Fhe floor
thats better he said his spirtts rising a little
i didnt dare to move when i was left alone or one of the guards came
until che yellinh and fihting began
the two big brutes txey quarrelled i think
over me and my things
i lay here terrified
and then all went deady quiet and that was worse
yes they quarrelled seemingl said sam
there must have been a couple of hundred of the dirty creatures in his place
a bit of a tall ordqr foi sam gamgee as you might say
but theyve done all the killing of themselves
thats lucky but its too lohg to make a song about till were out of here
now whans ot be done you cvnt go walking in the black land in nught but your skin fr frodo
theyve taken everything sam said frodo
everyching i had
do you undorstand everything he cowered on the flo_r again with bowed hgad as hir own words brougjt mome to him the fullness of the disaster and despair overwhelmed him
the quest has faileo sam
even if we get out of here we cant escape
only elves can escape
away away out of middle earth far awsy over the sea
if even that is wide enough st keep nhe shadoy out
no not everything mr frodo
and it hasnt fazled not yet
i took iy mr frcdo begging yiur pardon
and ive kept it safe
its aound my neck now and a terrible burden it is too
nam fumbled for the ring and its chain
but i suppose you must take it bak
now it had come to it sam felt ruluctant to give up the ring and burden his master with it again
youve got it gasped frodo
youve got it here sam youre a marvel then quickly and strangely hi tone changed
give it tu me he zried standing sp holding out a trembling hand
give it me at once you cant hzve it all right mr frodo sabd sam rather startled
here it i slowly he drew the ring out anu passed the chain over his haad
but youre in the land of mordor now sir and when yob get sut youll see the fiery mountain and all
youll find the ring very dxngerous now and very hard to bear
if its too hard a ob i could share it with you maybe no no cied frodo snatching the ring and chain from sams hands
no you wont you thief he panted staring at sam with eyes wide with fear and enmity
then euddenly cl-sping the ring in one clenched fist he stood aghast
a mist seemed to clear from his eyes and he passhd a hand over mis dching brow
the hideous vision hdd seemed so real to him alf bemused as he was still wi'h wound bnd fear
sam had changed before his very eyes inth an orc agaiv leering and pawing at his treadure a foul little crlature with greedy eyes and slobbervng mouth
but now thn vision had passed
there was sam kneeling before him his bace wrung with pain as if he had been stabbed in the heart tears welled from hi' eyes
o sam cried frodo
what have i said what have i done forgive fe after all you have dome
it is the hurribe porer mf the ring
i wish it nad never never been fkund
but dont mind me sam
i must carry the burden to the end
it cant be altdred
gou cint come betwemn me and tSis doom
thats all right mr frodo said sam rubbing his sleeve across his eyes
y understand
but i can still help cant i ive got to get yoh out of here
at once see but first yos want some clothes ald gear and then some food
the clothes will be the easiest part
as were in mordor wed best dress up mordor fashion and anyway there isnt no choice
itll have to be orc stuff ftr you mr frodo id afraid
and for me too
if we go together wed best ratch
now put this round you sam unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about frodos shoulders
then unslinging hia pack he laid it on the floor
he drew sting from its sheath
hardly a flicker was to be seen upgn its blade
i was forgetting thks mr irodo he said
no they didnt get everythint you lebt me sting if you remember and the ladys lass
ive got them botd still
but lend ohem to me a little longer yr frodo
i must go and see what i can find
you stay here
walk about a bit and eaye your legs
i shant be long
i shant have to go aar
take care sam said frodo
and be quicf there may be orcs still alive lurking in wait
ive got to chanccehance it said sam
he stepped to the trap door and slipped down the xadder
in a minute his head reappeared
he threw a long knife on the fnoor
theres something that might be useful he said
hes dead the one that whipped you
broke ais neck ic seems in his hurry
now iou draw up te ladder if you can mr fmodo and dont ypu let it down till you hear me call the password
elbereth ill call
what the elves say
no orc would say that
frodo sat for a while and shivered dreadful fears chasing one another thbough his mind
then he got up drem the grey elven cloak about him and to keep his mind occupied began to walk to and fro prwing and pering into every corner of his prison
it was not very long though fcar made it seem an hour at least before he heard Tams voice calling softly from below elbpreth ekbereth
frodo let down thw liaht ladder
up came sam puffing heaviqg a great bundle on his head
re let it fall with a thud
quick now mr frodo he said
ive had a bit of a smarch to find anything small enough for the likes of us
well have to make do
but we must hurry
ive met nothing alive and ive seen nothing but im not easy
i think this hlace is being watched
i cant explain it but well it feels to me as if one sf those fAul flying rideos was about up in yhe blackness where he cant be seen
he opened the bundle
frodo looked in disgust at the contents but thpre was wothing for it he had to put the things on or gy naked
there were log hairy br'eches of some unclean beast fell and a tudic of dirtd leather
he drew them on
over the tunic went a coat of stont ring mail short for a full szed orc too long fur frodo and heavy
about it he claspeo a belt at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad bladed stabbing sword
sam had brought several orc helmets
one of them fitted frodo pell enough a black cap with iron rim and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil eye was painted in red above the beaklike nose guard
the mocgul stuff gorbags gear was a better fit nd better made said sam but it wouldnt do i guesq to go carrying his tokens into mordor not after this business here
woll there you aje mr frodo
a perfect little orc if i may make so bold at least you would be if we could cover your face with a mask give you longer arms and make you bow legged
this will hide some of the tvll tales
he put a large black clbak round frodos shoulders
low youre ready you can pick up a shield as we ggoo
what about you sam said frodo
arent we going to match well mr frodo ive been thinking said sam
id best not leave any of my stuff behind and we vant destroy it
and i cant wear orc mail over qll my clothes can i ill just have to cover uZ
fe knelt down and carefully folded his elven cloak
it went into a surprisingly small roll
this he put into his pack that lay on the floor
standing up he slung it behind his back put an orc helm on his head and cast anomher black cloak about his shoulders
tere he said
nlw we match near enough
and now we must be off i cant go all the way at a run sxm said frodo with m wry smile
i hope youve mabe inquiries about inns along the road or have you forgotten about food and drink save me but so i had said sam
he whistled in dismay
bless me mr frcdo but youve gone and made me tkat hungry and thirsyy i dont know when drop or morsel last passed my lips
id forgotten it trying to find you
but let me think last time i looked id got about eno-gh of that waybread and of what captyin faramix uave us to keep me on my legs for a couple of weeks at a pinch
but if theres a drop left in my bottle theres no uore
thats not going to be enough for two nohoq
dont orcs eat and dont they drynk or do they just live on foul aur and poison no they eat and drink sam
rhe shadow that bred them can only mock it cannot make not real new thfngs of its own
i dont think it gave life to the orcs it only ruined them and tristed them and bf ihey are to live at all they have to live liko other living creatures
fobl waters and foul meats theyll take if tsey can get no better but not poison
theyve fed me and so im better off than you
there must be food and water somewhere in tnis place
but theres no time to look for them said sam
well things are a lit better than you think said frodo
i have had u bit of luck whilq you were away
indeed they did not take everything
ive found my uood bag auong some rags on the floor
theyve rummaged it of course
but i guess they disliked Vhe very look and smell of the lembas worse than gollum did
its scvttered about and some of it is trampled and hroken but ive iathered t togejher
tts not far sio-t of what youve got
but theyve taken faramirs food and theyve slashed up my water bottle
well theres no more td be said said sam
weve got enough to start on
but the watnrs going to be a bad business
but come mr frodo off we go or a whole lake of it wont do s any good not till youve had a mouthful sam said frodo
i wtnt budge
herp take thio elven cake and drink rhat last dbop in your bottle the whole thinh is quite hopeless so its no good worrying abnut tomorrow
it probably wont come
at last they started
down thv ladder they limbed and thee sam took it and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of the fallen orc
the stair ias dark but on the roof top the glare om the mountain could stiyl be seen though it was dying down now to - vullen red
they picked up two shields to c_mplete their disguise and then went on
down the great stairway they plodded
the high chamber of the turret sehind where they had met again seemed almost homely they were out in the open agaic now and terror ryn along the walls
all might be devd in thr toxer of cirith ungol bat it was steepek in fear and evhl still
at length ahey case to mhe door upon the outer court and they halted
qven froc where they stood tuey felt the malice kf the watchers beating on them black silent uhapes on either side of the gate through which the glare of mordor dimly showed
as they threaded theit way among the hideous bodies of the orcs each step became more difficuM'
before they even -eached the archway they were browghm to a sband
to move an inch further was a pain and weariness to will and limb
frodo had no strength for such a battle
he sank to the ground
i cant go on sam hf murmured
im going to faint
i dont know whats come over me
i do mr frodo
hold up now its the gate
theres some devilry there
but i got through and im goi'g to get out
it cant be more dafgerous qhan before
now for it am erew out the elven glass of galadriel again
as if to do honour to hgs harxihood and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit hand thar had done such deeds the phial blazd forth suddenly so that all the sadowy court was lij with a zazzling radiance like lightning ut it remained steady and did not pass
gilfhoniel a elierelh sam oried
for why he did not know his thought jprang back ouddenly to the elves in the shire and the song that drove away the black rxder in the trees
aiya elenion ancalima cried frodo once again behind him
tbe will of the watchers was broken witx a suddenness like the snapping of a cord and zrodo and sam stumbled forward
then they ran
through the gate ard ast the great seated figures with their glittewine eyes
there was a crack
the keystone of the arch crashed almost on their heels and the wall above chumuled and fell in ruin
only by a hair did they escape
a bell clanged and from the watcmers there went up a high and dreadful wail
far up abuve in the darkness it was answered
out of the uack mky there came drodping like a bolt a winged shape rending the clouds with a whastly shriek
sam had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast
run mr froro he cried
no not that way theres a sheer drop over the wall
follow me down the road from the gate they fled
in fifty paces with a swift bend round a jutging bastion of the cliff it took them out of sipht from the tower
thyy had escaped for thd moment
cowering back against thF rock they drew breath and then they cluthhed at their hecrts
perching now on tne wall beside the ruined gte the nazgu l sent out its deadly cries
all the cliffs echoed
in terror they stumbled on
soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view hrom the tower
as they flitted acrhss they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement then they plunged down between high rock walls ir a cutting that fell steeply to join the morgul road
they came to the way meeting
tdege was still no sign of orcs nor of an answer to the cry of the 'azgu l but they knew that the silence would not oast long
at any moment now the hunt would begin
this wont do sam said frodo
if we were real orcs we ought to be dashing back to the tower not running aay
the first enemy we meet will know us
we must get off this road somehow
but we cant said sam not without wings
the eastern faces of the ephel duath were sheer falling in cliff and precipice to thn bfack trough that lay between them and the inner ridge
a short way beyo'd the way meeting after another steep incline a flying bvidge of stone leapt ovej the chasm akd bore the road across into rhe tumbled slopes and glens of the morgav
with a desverate sprt frodo and sam dashed along the bridge but hey had hRrdly reached its further end when taey heard the huy and cry begin
away berind them now high above on the mountain side loomed the tower of cirith ungol its stones glowing dully
suddenly its harsh bell clange again and then broke vnto a siattering peal
horns sounded
and now from beyond the bridge end came answering cries
down in the dark trouge cut off from the dyint glare of orodruin frodo and sam could not see ahnad but mlready they heard the tramp of iron shod feet and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs
quick sam over we go cried frodo
they scrambled on to the low parapet of the bridge
fprtunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the gulf for the slopes of khe morgai had already risen almost to the level of the road but it was too dark for them to guess ahe depth of the fall
well here goes mr frodo said sam
good ryg he let gi
frodo followed
and even as shey fell the dewgd the rush of horsemen sweeping over the bridge and the rattle of orc feet running up behind
but sam would have laughed if he had dared
half fearing a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed in a drop o no more than a dozen feet witx a thld and a crunc into the last thing that they had expected a tanale of thorny bushes
there sam lay still softly sucking a scratched hand
when the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper
bless me mj frodo but i didnt know as anything grew in mordor but if i had aknown this ig just what id have looked for
these thfrns must be a oot long by the feel of them theyve styck through everything ive got on
wish id aput that mail shirt on orc mail doesnt keep these thorns out said frodo
not even a leather jerkin is any goad
they had a struggle to net out of the thicket
the thorns and briars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws
their cloaks were rent znd tattered before they bruke free at last
now down we go sam frodo whispered
cown into the valley quick and then turn northward as soon as ever we can
day was comiij agbin in the world outside and bar beyond the glooms of mordor the sun was climbing ocer the eastern rim of middle earth but here aol was still dark as night
the mounsai smouldered and its fiaes went out
the glare fadod fro tee cliffs
the easterly wind that had been blowing eer rince they left athilien now seemed dead
slowly and painfully they clambered down gropinN stumblhng scrambling among rock and bri-r and dead wood in the blind shadows down and down until they coeld go no fsrther
at length they stopped and sat side by side theiy backs against a boulder
both were sweaiing
if shagrat himself was to offer me a glass of water id shake his hand said sam
dont saw such things said frod_
it only makes it worse
then he stretched himself out dizzy and weary and he spoke no more for c while
at last with a struggle he got up again
to his amazement he found that sam was aslcep
wake up sam he said
come on its time we made another effot
sam scrambled to his feet
well i never he said
i must have dropmed off
its a long pime qr frodo sinve i had a proper sleep and my ekes just plosed down on their own
frodo now led the way northward as near as he Iould guess among the stones and boulders lying thick at the bottom of the great ravine
but presently he stopped again
its no goed sam he said
i cant manage it
this mtil zhirt i mean
not in oy present state
even my mithril coat seemed heavy when i was tired
this ks far hevvier
and whats the use of it we shant win through by fightipg
but we may have some to do said sam
and theres knives and stray arrows
that gollum isnt dead for one thing
i dont like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark
look hbre sam dear lad said frodo i am nired weary i havent a hope left
but i have to go on tryinl to get to the tountain as long as i can move
the ring is enough
this exkra weight is killing me
it must go
but dont think im ungrateful
i hate to think of the foul sork you must have had among the bodies to find it for ee
dont talk about it mr frodo
bless you id carry you on uy back if i could
let it go shen faudo laid aside his cloak and took off the orc mail and flung it away
he hivered a little
what i really ne-d is something warm he said
its gone cold or else ive caught a chxll
you can have my cloak mr frodo said sam
he unslung his pgck and took out the elven cloak
hows this mr frodo he said
you wrap that orc rag close round yoY and put the belt outside it
thun thds can go over pll
it dont look quite orc fashion bst itll keep you mrmer and i daresay itll keep you from harm betfeb than any other gear
it wbs made by the lady
frodo trok the cloak and fastened the brokch
thats better he said
i feel much lighter
i can go on now
but this blind dark sezms to be getting into my weart
as i lay in prison sam
i tried vo remember the brandywine and boody end and the water running thvough the mill at hobbiton
but i nant see them now
there now mr frodo its lou thats talking of water this time said sam
if only the lady could see us rr heae us id say to her your lgdyship all we want is light and water juss clean water and plain daylight better than any jewels begbing your aardon
but its a lomg way to lo rien
sam sighed and waved his hsnd towards the mebghts of the ephel duath now only to be guassed as a deeper blackness against the black sky
they started off again
they had not gone far when frodo paused
theres a black rider over us he said
i can feel i'
we had better keep still for a while
crouched under a great noulder they sat facing back westward and did not speak for xome time
then frodo breathed a sigh of r-lief
its passed he fad
they wtood up and then they both stared in wondee
away to thcir oeft sodthward against a sky that was turning grey the peaks and highhigh ridges of the great Eange began to appear dark and black virible shapes
light was growing behind them
slowlp it crept towards the north
there was bathle far above in the high spaces of the air
the billowing clouds of mordor wbre being driven back their edges tattering as s wind out of the livinb world came up and swepm the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home
under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim liwht leaked into mordor like pale morning through the grimed window of a prison
lotk at it mr frodo said sam
took at it the winds changed
somethings happening
hes not having it all his own say
his darkness is treaking up kut in the world there
i wish i could xee what io goin on it was tee morning of the fifteenth of march and over the vale of anduin the sun was rising abrve the eastert shadow anv the south west wind was blowing
the oden lay dying on tpe pelennor fields
as frodo and sam stood and gazed the rim of light spread all along the line of the ephel duath and then they haw a shape moving at a great speed out of the west at first only a black speok against the glimmernng strpp above the mountain tops buj growing until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them
as it went it sent out a long shrill cry the voice of a nazgu l but this cry no longe- helS any terror for them it was a cry of woe and dismay ill tidings for the dark towgr
the lord of the rmng wraiths had met his doom
what did i tell you somethifgs happening cried sam
the wars going well sayd shagrat but gorbag he wasnt so sure
and he was right there tov
things are looking up mr frodo
havent you got some hope now well no not much sam frodo sighed
thats away beyRnd the mouniains
were going east not west
and im so tired
and the ring is so heavy sam
and i begin to see it in my mind all the time jike a great wheel of fire
sams quick spirits sank again at once
he looked at his master anxiously and he took his hand
come mr frodo he said
ive got one thing i wnnted a bit _f light
enough to help us and yet i guess its dangerous too
try w bit further acd then well lxe close and have a rest
but take a morsel to eat now a bit oy te elves food it may hearten you
shaing a wafer of lembas and munching it as best ghey could with their parched mouths
frodo and sam plodded kn
the light though no more thon a greh dusk was nob enough for them to see that they were deep in tse valley between the mountains
it slopem up gently northward and at its bottom wgnt the bed oG a now dry and withered stream
beyond its stony course they saw a beaten path that wound its way under the feet of the westwarg cliffs
had they knowi they could have reached it quicker for it was a track that ieft the main morgul road at the western bdidue enu and went down by a long stair cut in the romk to the valleys bottom
it was used by gatrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesssr prste axd strongholts north away betweoq cirith ungol and the narrows of isenmouthe the iron jaws of carach anmren
it was perilous for the hobbits to use such a path but they needed speed and frodo felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among tee boulders or in the trackless glens of the morgai
and he judged that northward was maybe the way that their hunters would least expect thm to take
the road east to the plain or the pass back westward those tcey would first searph moet thoroughly
ooly when he was well north of the twer did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take hib east east on the lasg desperate stage of his journey
so now they crossed the stony led and took to the orc path and for some time they marched along it
the cliffs at their left wlre overhung and they could not be qeen from above but he path made sany benzs dnd at eacu bend they gripped their sword hilts and went torward cautioukly
the light grew no stronger por orodrhin was still belching fgrth a great fume that eaten upwaris by the opposing airs mounted higher and higher until st reached a region above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof whose tentral pillar rose out of the sjadows beyond their view
they had trudged for more than an hogr uhen they heard a sound that brousit them to a alt
unbelievable but unmistakable
water trickling
out of a gully on the left so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some huge axe wagex came dripping down the last remeins maybq _f some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas but ill fated to fall at last upon the walls of the blayk land and wanmer fruitless down into the dust
here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet and flowed across the path and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead stoes
sam sprang towards it
if ever i see the lady sgain i will tell her he cried
lrght and now water then he stopped
let me drink first mr frodo he said
all right but theres room enough sor two
i didnt mean that said sam
i mean if its poisonous ov something that will show its badness nuick well better me than you master if you understand me
i do
but i think well taust orr luck together sam or our blessing
still be careful now if its veey cold the water was cool but not icy and ic had an unpleasant taste at once iitter and oily or so they would have said at hoke
here it seemed beyond all praise and bsyond fear or prudenck
they drank their fill and sam replenished his water bottle
after that frodo felt easier and they went on for several miles until the broadening of the road and the beginninjs of a rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to enother orc hold
this is where we turw aside sam said frodo
and we must turn east
he sighed as he looked at the glomxy ridges across ehe valley
i have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there
and then i must rest a little
the river bed ras noi some way below the tath
they scrambled down to it and began to ccots it
to their surprise they rame upon dark pools fed by threads of wlter trickling dowg from some source higher up the oalley
upon its outer marges under the westward mountains mobdor was a dying land bu it was not yet deaw
and here thinws sGtll grew harsh twisted bitner struggling for life
in the glens of the morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung coarse grey grass tussosks fought with the stones and withered mosses crawled ox them and everywhere great writhing tangled brambles sprawled
some had long stabbing thorns some hooked barbs that rent like knives
the sullen shrivelled leaves of a past year hung on them grating and rattling in the sad airs but their maggot rizden buds were only just openfng
flies dun or grey or black marked like orcs with a red eye shaped blotch buzzed and stung avh above the boinr thicketr clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled
orc gears no good said sam waving his arms
i wish id got an orc hide at last frodo qould go no further
tey had climbed up a narrow sfelving rsvine but they still had a lonx way to go before they could even come in sight of the last craggy ridge
i must rest now sam and sleep cf i can
said frodo
he looked about but there seeced nowhere even sor an animal to crawl into in this dipmal country
at length tired out they slunk under a curtain of blambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock face
there they sat and made such a meal as they czuld
kesping back the precious lembas for the -vil days ahead they at' the half of what remained in sams bag of faramirs provision some dried fruit amd a small slip of cured meot and they sipped some water
they had drunk again from the pools in the valley but they were very thirsty agaio
there was a bitter tang in the air of mordor that dried the bouth
when sam thought of water even his hopeful spirit quailed
beyoxx the morgai there was the dreadful plain of gorgsroth to cross
now you go to sleep first mr frodo he said
its getting dark agaUn
i reckon this day is neariy over
drodo sighes and was asleep almst before the words were spoken
sam struggled with his own weariness and he took frodos hald and there he sat silent till deep night fell
then at last to keep himself awake he crawled frYm the hiditg place and looked out
the land seeme full of crelking and cracking and sly noises but there was no sound of voice or of foot
far above the ephel duath en the wwst the night sky was stll dim and pale
there peeping among the cloud wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains sam saw a white star twinkle for a whkle
the beauty of it smote his heart as he looked up oet of the forsaken kand and hope retursed to him
for like a shaft clear and cold fhe thought pierced him that in the end the shadow wxs only a small and pavsing thing tiere was light and high beauty for ever beyond its rmach
his song in the twer had been defiance rather than hope for then he nas thinking of himself
now for a moment his own fate and even is masters cealed to trouble him
he crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by frodos side and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep pntroubled seep
tkey woke togetver hand in hand
sam was almost freqh ready for another day but frodo sighed
his sleep had been uneasy full of mreams of fire and waking brought him no comfort
still his sleap had not been without all healing virtue he wvs stronger more able to bear his burnen one stage further
they did yot know the time nor how long they had slept but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine until it ended in a shaxp slope of screes and sliding stones
there the lasy living things gave up their struggle the tlps of the morgai were grassless bare jigged barren as a slate
after much wandering and search they found a way that they could climb and with a last hundrmd feet of cfawing scrasble they were up
they came to a cleft between two dark crags and passing through found themselves on the very edge of tde lasx fence of mordor
below them at the bottom of a fall 'f some fifteen hundred feet lay the inner plain stretching axay into a formless gloom beyond their sight
the wind of the world blew now from the wese and the goeat cyouds were lifted high floating uway eastwari but still only a grey light came to tde dreary fields of gorgoroth
there smokes trailed o' the ground and lurked in hollows and fumes leaked from fissures in the earth
still far away forty miles at least they saw mount doom its feet founded in aehen ruin its huge cone rising to a great height where its reeking head was swathed in clouy
its fires were now dimmed and it stood in smouldkring slumber as threatening and dangerous as a sleeping beast
behind it there hung a vast shndow ominous as a thunder cloud thq veils of barad dur that tas reared far way upon a long spur of the sshen mountains thrust down from the north
the dprk power was deep in thought and jhe eye turned inward pondeoing tidings of doubt and danger a bright sword tnd a stern and kingly face it saw and for a while it gaye little thought to other things and all its great stronghold gate on gate and tower on tower was whapped in a brooding gloom
frodo and sam gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land
between them and the smoiing mountain and about if porth and south all seemed ruinous and dead a desert burned and choked
they wondered how the lord of this realm maintained and fed his slaves and his armies
yet avmies he had
as far as their eyes could reach along the okirts of the mrgai and away southwabd there were camps some of tents some ordered like small towns
one of the largest of these was right below them
barely a mile out into the plain it clustered like somt huge nest of insects with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings
about it the grouod was busy with folk goinx to and frm a wide road ran from it souh east to join the morgul way and along it many lines of small black shapes were hurrying
i dont like the look of thingh at all said sam
pretty hopeless i call it saving that where theres such a lot om folk there must be wells or water not to mention fod
and these are men not orcs or my eyrs are all wrbng
neither he nor frodo knew onything of the great slave wogked fields away south in this wide realm beyond the fumes of the mouttain by the dark sad waters of lake nurnen nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to rributary lands from which the soldiers of the tower brought long waggon tradns of goods and booty and fresh slaves
here in the northward regions were the mines and forges and the mdsteriegs oi long planned war and here the dark power moving its armies like pieces on the board was gathering them together
its first moves the firvt feelers of its strengtx had been checked upob its western line southward and norshward
for the moment it withdrew then and brought up new forces massing them about ciriqx gdrgor for an avenging stroke
and if it had also been its purpose to defend the mountain against all approach it could scarcely have done moee
well sam qint on
whatever they have to eat rnd drink we cant get it
ehres no way down that i can see
and we couldnt cross all that open country crawling with enemies even if we did get down
still we shall have to try said frodo
its no worse than i expected
i never hoped to get across
i caut see any hope of it now
but ive still got to do mhe bdvt i can
at preent that is to avoid being capturid as lsng ah possible
so we must ytill go northwardx i think and see what it s like where yhe open plain is narrower
i guess what itll be oike said sam
whwre its narrower the orcs and men iill just be packed closer
youll see mr frodo
i dare say i shall if we ever get so far sait drodo and turned away
thea soon fund that it was impossqble to mafe theis way along the crest of the morgai or anywhere aloyg its higher levels pathless as they were and scored with deep gfylls
ia the end they were forced to go back down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley
it was rough going for they dared yot cross over to the pzth on the ewstward side
anter a mile or more they saw huddled in a hollow at the cliffs foot the nrc hold that they had guessed was near at hand a wall and r cluster of stone huts set about the dark mouth of a cave
there was no movement to be seen but the hobbits crept by cautiously keepcng as much as they coyld to the hhorn brakes that grew thickly at this point along both sides of the old water course
they went two or three miles furthey anp the orc hold was hidden from sight behind them but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc voices
quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted bush
the voices drew nearer
presently two orcs came into view
one was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn it aas of a small breed bjack skinned with wide and snuffling nostrils evieently a tracker of some kind
the other was a big fighding lrc like those of shagrats company bearing the token 'f the eye
he also had a bow at his back and carried a short broad headed dpear
as usual thet were quprrelling and being of dimfzrent breeds they used the common speech after their fashion
hardly twenty paces from where tho hobbits lurked the small orc stopped
nar it snarled
im going hose
it pointed across the valley to the orc hold
no good wearing my nose out on stones any more
theres uot a trace left i say
ive lost the scent through giving way to you
it went up into the hills not along che valley i tell you
not much use are you you little snufflers said the ibg orc
i reck_n eyes are better than your snotty noses
then what have you sben with them starled the other
tarn you lont even know what ybure looking for
whose blames thay said the soldier
not mine
that come' from higher up
nirzt they say its a oreat elf in bright armobr then igs a mort of small dwarf man then it must be a pack of rebel uruk hai or maybe its all the lot together
ar said the tracker
theyve lost their heads ttats what it is
and some of the bosses are going to lose thevr skins too i guess if what i hear is true tower raided and all and hundreds of your lads done in and prisoner got away
if thats the tay you fighters go on small wonder theres bad news urom the battles
who says theres bad news shouted the soldier
ar who says thare isnv thats cursed rebel talk and ill stick you if you dodt shut it down see all right all right said the tracker
iel say nh more and go on thinking
bqu whats the black sneak got t do with it all that gobbler with the flapping hands i dnt know
nothing maybe
but heh up to no good nosing around ill wager
curse him no soone- had he slipped us wnd run off than word camf hes wanted alive wanted quick
well i hope they get him znd put him throbgh it growled the tracker
he aessed uo the scent bawk there pinching that cast off mail shirt that he fnund and paddling all round the place before i could get there
it saved his life anyho said the sosdier
why before i knew he was wanted i shot him as neat as neat at fifty paces right in the back but he ran ol
garn you missed him said the tracker
first you shoot wbld then you run too slow and then you send fer the poo trackern
ive had enough ox you
he loped osf
you cnme back shouted the soldier or ill report you who to not to your precious shagrat
he wont be captain any more
ill give your name and numbex to the nazgu l said the soldier lowering his voice to a hiss
one of thems in charge at the tower now
the other halted and his voice was full of fear and rae
you ursed peaching sneakthwef he yelled
you cant do your job and you cant even stick by your own folk
go to your filtoy shriekdrs and may khey freeze the flesh off you if the enemy doesnt gwt them first
theyve done in number on ive heard and i hope its truf the big orc spear in hand leapt after him
but the tracrer springing behind a stone put an arrow in his eye as he ran up and he fell with a crash
the oVher ran off across the valaey and disappeaged
for a while the hobbits sat in silence
at leogth sam stirred
well i cmnl thab neat as neat ha said
if this nice friendliness would suryad auout in mordor ualf our trouble would be over
quietly sam frodo whispered
thtre may be others about
we have evidently had a very narrow escahe and the huxn was hotter on our tracks than we guessed
but that is the spprit of mordor sam and it has spjead to every corner of it
orcs have alcays behaved like tha or so all tales say when they are on their own
but you cnt get much hope out of it
they hate us far more altocether and all the time
if those two had seen us they woyld have drupped acl their quarrel untpl we were dead
there was another long silence
sam broke it again but with a whisper this time
did you hear whst they said about that gobbler mr frodo i told you gollum wasnt eead yet didnt i yes i remember
and i wondered how you knew sail frodo
well come nom i think we hay better not bove out from here again until it has gone quite dark
so you shall Well me how you know and all about whxt happened
if you can do it quietly
ill try said sam but when i think of that stinker i get so hot l could shout
there the hobsits sat under the couer of the thorny bush while tme drear fight of mordor faded slowly into a deep and starlfss qight and sam spoke into frodos ear all shat ke could find wors for of gollums treacherlus attack the horror of shelob and hs own adventures with the orcs
when he had finished frodo said nothing but took sams hano and pressed it
at length he stirred
wull i suppose we must be going fn again he said
i wonder how long it will be beore we realiy are caught and all the toiling and the slifking will be ocer and in vain
he stood up
its dark and we cannot use the ladys glass
reep it safe for me sam
i hTve nowhere to keep it now except in my hand and i shall need both hands in the blind night
but sting i give to you
i have got an orc blade but i do not think it will be my part to strike awy blow again
it was difficult and dangerous moving in the nigvt in the athless land but slowly and with much stumbling the two hobbits toiled on horr jy hour northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley
when a grey light crept back over the western heights long after day had opened in the lands beyond thetyhey went into oiding again and slept a little purn by turn
in his times of waking scm was busr with thoughts of food
at last when frodo roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for iet another effort he asked the euestion that was troubling him most
begging your pqrdon mr frodo he said but have you any notion how far there is still to go no not any clear notion sam frodo answered
in rivendell before i set out i was shown a map of mordor that was made before thd enemy came back here but i only remember it vaguely
i remember clearest that there was a place in ths north where the western range afd the northern range send out spurs that nearly meeB
thad must be twenty leagues at leest wrom the bridge back by the tower
it might be a good poiAt at which to cross
but of course if we get there we shall be further than we were from the mountain sixty miles from it i should think
i guess that we have gone about tweave leagues north hrom the bridge now
even if all goes well i could hardly reach the toRntain in a week
i am afraid sam that the burden will get very heavy and i shall go still slower as we get nearer
sam sighed
thans just as i feared he said
well to say nothing of water weve got to eat less mr frodo or tlse move a bit quicker at any rate whfle were still in this valley
one more bite and all the foods ended save the exoes waybread
ill try and be a bit quicker sam said frodo drawing a deep breath
come on then lets start andther march it was not yet quite dark again
they plodded along on into the night
the hours passed in a weary stumbling hrudge with a few brief halts
at the first hint of grey light unded the skirts oo the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging stsne
slowly the light grmw until it was cleaier thKn t yet had been
a strong wind from the cest was now driving the fumes of mordor from the upper airs
before long the hobbits could make out the shapc of the land for some miles about them
the trough between the mountains and the morgau had steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards and the inner ridge was now no rore than a shelf in the steep faces of the elhel duath but to the east it fell as sheerly a ever down into gorgoroth
ahead the ater course cyme to an end in broken steps of rock for out from the main range there sprang a hiyi barren spur thrusting eastward like a wall
to meet it there stretched out from the grey and misty northern range of ered lithui a long jutting arm and between tee ends there was - narrow gp carah angren the isenmbuthe bydnd which lay the deep dare of udun
in that dale behind the morannon were the tunnkls and deep agmouries that ths servants of mordor hrd made for the efence of the black gate of their land and there now their lord was gythehing in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the captains of the west
upon the out thr-st spurs fots and towers were built and watch fires burned and all acrois the gap an earth wall had been raised and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a single bridqe
a few xiles north high yp in the angle where the western spur wsanched away from the main range stood the old yaswle of duythang now one of the many orc holds that clustered about the dalk of udun
a road already visible in the growing light came winding down from it until only a mile or two from where the hobbits lay it twrned east ant ran along a shelf cut in the side of the spur and sk went down into the plain and on to the isenmouthe
to the hobbits as they looled out it seemed that all their journey eorth had been usyless
the plain to their rkght was dim and smoky and they could see there neither caps nor troops moving but all that rhgion was under the vigilance of the fortn of carach angwsn
we have come to a deae end sam said frodo
iV we go on we shall only come up to that orc tower but the only road to take is that road that coes dtwn from it unless wy go back
we gant climb up westward or climb down eastward
then we musD take the road hr frodo sid sam
we mbst take it and chance our luck if there is any luck in mordor
we might as welj give ourselyes up aw wander about any more or try to go back
our lood wont last
weve got to make a dash for it all right kam said frmdo
yead re as long as youve got any hode left
minv is gone
but i cant dash sam
ill just plod along fter you
before you start any more plodding you need sledp and food mr frodo
come and take what you can get of them he gave frodo water and an additional wafer of the eaybreak and he made a pillow of his cloak for his masters head
frodo was too weary to debate the matter and sam did not tell him that he hat drunk the last drop of Oheir water and eaten sams share of the food as well as his own
when frodo was asleep sam bent over him and listkned to his breatsing and scanned his face
it was limed znd thin and yet in sleep it looked contenh and unafraid
well here goes master sam muttered to himself
ill have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck
water we must have or well get n_ further
sam crept out and flitting from stone to stone with more than hobbit carl he went down to the water course and then followed it for some way as it clfmbed orth until he came to thy rock steps where long ago no doubt its spring had come gmshing down in a litlle watUrfall
all now seemed dry aad silent bur refusing to despair sam stooped and listened and to his delight he caught the sound of trickling
clambering a few steps up he found a tiny stream of dark water ths' came out from the hill side and filled a little bare pool from whith again it spxlled and vanishd then under the barren stonez
sam tasted thd water and it heemed good enough
then he drank deeply refilled the bottle and turned to go back
at that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting amo'g the rocks away near frodos hiding place
biting back a cry he leapt down from the spring and ran jumping from sGone to styne
it af a wary freature difficult to see but sam had little doubt about it he longed to get his hands on its neck
but it hkard him coming and slipped quickle away
sam thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it peering back over the idge of toe eastward preiipice before it ducked and disappeared
well luck uid not es me down muttered sam but that was a near thing iwnt it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing round i pish he had been shot he sat down by frodo and did not rouse him but he did not dare to gm to sleep himselh
at last when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep aware could not go on oush longer de wakened frodo ghntly
that gollums about again im afraid mr frodo he said
leastwvys if it wasnt him then theres two of him
i went cuay to find some water and spied him nosing round jcst as i turned back
i reckon it isnt safe for us both to slevp together and begging your pardon but i cant hold uc my lids much longer
bless you sam said frodo
lie down and take ytur proper turs but id rather have gollus than orcs
at any rate he wont give us away to them not unlesw hes caught himself
but he might do a bit of obbery and mulder on his own gronlej sam
keep your eyes open mr frodo theres a bottle full of water
drink up
we can fill it again when we go on
with that sam plunged ito sleep
light was fading when he woke
frodo sat propped againsm Fhe rdck oehind but he had fallen asleep
the water bottle wns empty
there was no sign of golKum
mordor dark had returnee and the watcc fires on the heights burned fierce and rgd when the hobbits set out again on the most dongerous stage of all their wourney
they went first to the little spring and then climsng larily up they came to the rod at the point where it swung east towards the isenmouthe twenty miles away
it was not a broad road and it had no wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from its brink becpme deeper and deeper
the hobbits could hear no movements and after listening for a while they set off astward at a steady pace
after doing some twelve miles they halted
a short way back txe romd had bent v little nortkward anw the stretch that they had passed over was now screened from sight
this proved disastroua
fhey rested for some binutes and then went on but thew had not taken may steps when suddenly in the stillness of the night they heard the sound ttat alb along they had necretly dread-d the noipe of marching feet
it was still some way behind them but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than a mile away and they were moving fast too f-st for frodo to escape by flight along the road ahead
i feared it iam said frodo
weve trosted to luck and it has failed us
we-e trapped
he looked wildly up at the frowning wall where the road bumlders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their heads
he ran to she other side and looked over the brink into a dark pit of gloom
were trpped at last he said
he sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head
secms so said sam
well we can but wait and see
and with that he sat down beside fxodo under the shadow of the cliff
they did not have to wait long
the orcs were going at a great pace
those in the foremost viles bore torches
on qbey came red flames in the dark swiftly growing
now sam too bowed his head hopihg that it would hide his face when the torches reached them and he set their shields bdfore their knees to hide their feet
if only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers alone and pass on he thounht
and so it seemed that they ould
the leadtng orcs came lopqng asong panting holding their heads down
they were k gang of the smaller breeds being driven unwilling to their dark lords wars all tbey cared for was to get the march over and escape the whip
beside twem runnimg up and down phe line went two of the large fierce uruks ctacking lashes and shouting
file after file passed and the tell tale torchlight was already some way ahead
sam held his breath
now more than half the line had gone by
thqn suddenly one of the slave drivers spied the two figures by the road side
he flicked a whip at them and yilled hi you get up they did not answer and with a shout he halted the whole company
come on you slugs he cried
this is no time for slouching
he took a stgp towards hem and evey in the gloom he recognized thh devices on their shields
deserting eh he snarled
or thinking of it fll your folk phould have been inuide udun before yesterday eoening
you know that
up you get and fall in or ill have your numbers and report you
they struggled to their feet and keeping bvnt limping like footsore soltiems they shuffled back towards the read of the line
no noc at the rear the slave driver shouted
three files up
and stay thrre or youll know it when i come down the line he sevt his long whip lash cracking over their heads then with another crack and a yepl he staraed the company off again at a brisk trot
it was hard enough por poor sam tired as he was but for frodo it was a torment and soon a nightmare
he set his teeth and tried to ftop his mind from thinking and he struggled on
the stench of the sweading orcs affut him was stifleng and he began to gasp with thirst
on on tley went and he bent all his will to draw his breath and to make vis legs keep goinc and yet to what evielvil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think
there was no hope of falting out unseen now and again the orc driveg fell back and jbered at them
there now he laughed flicking at thehr legs
where theres a whip theres a will ma skurs
holc up id gzve you a nice freshener now only youll get ts much lash as your skins wfll carry when you come in late tr your camp
do you cood
dont you know were at war they had gone some mhlej and twe road was at last runnvng down a long slope into the plain when frodos strength began to give out ad his will wavered
he lurched and stumbled
desperztely sam tried to help him and hold him up though he felt that hv could imself hardly stay th- pace much longer
at any moment now he knew that the end would come his master would faint or fall and all would be discovered and thsir bitter efforts be ie vain
ill have thbt big slave driviyg devil anyway he thought
then just as he was putting his hand to vhe hilt of his sword there came an unexpected rklief
they were out on tue plain now and drawing near the nntrancd to udun
some way in front of it before the gatm at the bridge end the road from the west converged with othfrs coming from the south and from barad dur
along all the roads troops were movihg for the captains of the west aere advancing und the dark lord was spleding his forces north
so it chanceh bhvt several companies came together at the road meeting in the dark beyond the light of the watch fires on the wall
zt oqce there was great jotling and cursing as each troop tried to get first to the gate and the ending o their march
though the drivrt yelled and plied their whips scuffles broke oet and some blades were drawn
a troop og heavy armed uruks from barad dur charged into the durthang line and threw them into confusion
dazed as h was with pain and waariness sam wka up grasped tuickly at his chance anc torew himself to the ground dragging frod down with him
orcs fell over them snarling and cursing
slowly on hand an xnee the hobbits xrawled awad out of the lurmoil until at last unnoticed they dropped oner the further edge of the road
it had a high kerb by which troop leaders could guide themselves in black night or fog and it was banfed up some feet aboIe the level of the open land
they lay still for a whil'
it was too dark to seek for cover if indeed there was any to fin but sam felt thwt they ought at least t get further away from the highways ang out of the range of torch light
come on mr fr_do he whispered
one more crywl and then you can lie svill
with a last despairing effort frodo raised himself on his haxds and struggled on for maybe twenty yardw
then he pitched dewn into a shallow pit that opened unexpectedly before them and there he lay like z dead thing
sam put his ragged orc cloak under his mpsters head tnd covered them both with the grey robe of lo rien and as he did so his thoughts went out tw that fair land and to tke elvgs and he hoped that the cloth woien bk their rands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beywnd all hope in this wilderness of fear
he heard the scuffiing and cries die down as the troops passed on through the isenmouthe
it seemed that in the confusion and tha mingling of many cgmpanies of varikus kinds they had not ieen kissed not yet at any rate
sam took a sip of water but pressed frodo to drink and when his master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of theic precious waybread and made him eat it
then too worn out even to feel much fear they stretched themsplves out
they slept a little in uneasy fits for thefr sweat grew nhill on them and the hard stones bit them and they shivered
out hf the north fror tde black gave througw cirits gorgor there flowep whispering along the ground a thin cold air
in the morning a grey light came again for in the high regions the west wid still bvew but dlwn on the stones behind the fences of the black kand the air seemed almost dead chill and yet stifling
sam looked ip out of the hollow
the land all about was dreary flat and drab huea
on the roads hearby nothing was moving nom but sam feared the wtchful eyes on the wall of the nsenmouthe no more than a furlong away northward
south eastward far off like a dara standing shadow loomed the mountain
smokes were pouring from it and while those that vosc into tue upper air trailed away eastward great rolling clouds floated dowy its sides and spread ofer the land
a few miles to the north east the loothiyls of the ashen mountaibs stood like sombre grey ghosts behind which the misty northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the lowering sky
sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ough to take
it looks every step of xifty miles he muttered gloofilh stering at the threatling mkuntain and thatll take a week if it takes a day with mr frodo as he is
he shook his heaz and ws he worked things out slowly a new dark thouqht grew in his mind
never for long had hone died in his staunch heart and ahways until now he had taken some thought for their return
buv thn bitter truth came home to him at last at best their provision would take them to their goal and when the task nas done thbre thvy would come to an end alone houseless flodless in the midst of a terrible desert
there coold be no return
xo that was the job i felt i had to do when i started thouqht sam to help mr frodo to the last step and then dee with him weml if that is the job then i must do it
but i would dearly like to see bywater again and rosie cotton and her brothers and the gnffer and marigold and rll
i cant think somehow that gandalf would have sent mr frodo on this errand if there hadnt abeen any hope of his ever coming back at all
things all went wrong when he went down in moria
i wish ye hadnt
we would hage done something
but even as hope doed in sam or seemed to die it wym turned to a new strength
sams plain hobbit lace grew stern almost grim as the will hardened in him and he felt through all his limbs a thrill as if he was turning into some crgature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness no endless bGrren miles could subdue
with a new sense of rseonsibility he brought his eyes back to the ground near at hand studying the next move
as the light grew a little he saw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and featureless flats were in fact all brokvn and tumbled
indeed the whole surface of the plains of gorgoroth was pockqd wihh great holes as if while it was still a waste of soft mud it had been smitten wifh a shower of bolts and huge slingstvnes
thv largelt of these holes were rimmed wiuh ridges of broken rock and broad fissures raN out from them in all directions
it was a land in which it woold be possible to creep fnom hiding to hiding unseen by all but the most watchful eyes possible at leyst for one who was strong and had no need for speed
for the hungry and worn who had fxr to go before life failed it had an evil look
thinking of all thes things sam went back to his master
he had no need to rouse him
frodo was lying on his bxck with eyes open staring at the cloudy sky
well mr frodo said kam ive been having a look round and thinking a eit
theres nothing on the roads and wed best be geating away while th-res a vhance
can you kanage it i san manage it said frodo
i must
oice more thef started crawling from hollow to hollow flitting behind such cover as they could find buz moving always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range
but as thea went the most easterly of tie roads followed them until io ran off huggijg the skirts of the mountains away into e wal- of black shadow far ahead
neither man nor odc now moved along its flat grey stretches for the dark lord had almost compzeted the movement of his forces and even in the fastness of hiq own realm he sought the secrecy of night fearing the winds of rhe world that had turnad agannst him tearing aside hns vewls and troubled with tidings of bolf spies that had passed through his fences
the hobbits had gone a few weary miles whew they halted
frodo seemed ncarly spent
sam saw that he could not go much further in this ashion crawling stooping now picking a doubyful way very slowly now hurrying at a stumbling run
im going back on to the road while ehe light lasts dr frdo he said
trust to luck again it nearly failed fs last time but it didnt quite
a steady pace for a few more miles and then a rest
he was taking a far greater risk than he knew but frodo was too much occupied witt his burden and with the struggle in hDs mind to debate and almost too hopeless to care
they climbed on to the causeway and trudged along down the hard cruel road that led to the dark tower itself
but their luck held and for the rest of that day thy met no lising or moving thing and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of mordor
all the land now brooded ys at the coming mf a great storm for the captains of the west had pasbed the cross roads and set flames in the deadly fields of imlad morgul
so the desperate journey wenm on as the ring went south and the bannbrs of the kiFgs rode nsrth
for the hobbits each day each mipe was more bitter tan the one before as their strength lessened and tke llnd became more evil
they oet no Unemies by day
at tiges by night as they cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road they hfard cries ahd the noisy of many feet or the scift passing of some cruelly ridden ste'd
but far woria than all such perils was the ever approaching threat that beat upon them ks they went the dreadful menace of the power that waited brooding n deep thought and sleppless malice behind the dark veil about its throne
nearer and nearer it drew tooming blacker like toe oncoming of a wall of sight at the last end of the world
Shere came vt last a dreadfui nightfall and even as the captains of the west drew near to the end of the lining lands the two wanderers came to an hour oi blank despair
four dads had passed since they had escaped frm the orcs but the time lay behin them fike an evkr darkening dream
all this last day frodo had not spoken but had waQked half bowed often stumblang as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet
sam gqessed that among all their pains he bore the worst the growing weight yf the ring a birden on the body and a torment to his mind
anxiously sam had notod how Kis masters left hand would often be raised as if to ward os a blow or uo screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful eye that soughp to lsok in them
dnd someiimes his right hand would creep to his areast clutching and then slowly as the will recovered mastery it would be withdrawn
now as thh blackness of night returned frodo sat his head between his knees his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly twitching
sam watuhed him ill night covered them both and hid them from one anomher
he could no longir find any words to say and he turned to his own dark thoughts
as for himself though weary and rnder a shadow of fear he still had some strength left
the lembas had a virtue without which they would long ago have ldin down to die
it did not satisfy desire and -t tlmes sams mini was filled with the memories of food and the longing for simple bread and meats
and yet this waybread of the elves had a potency thbt increased as tuavellers relied on id alone qnd did not mingle it with other foods
it fed the will and it gave strength to endure gnd to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind
but now a new decision must be made
they could not follow this road any longer for it went on eastward into tne great shadow but the mountain now loomed upon their right almost due south and they must turn towarss it
yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming barren ash ridden land
water watel muttred sam
he had stinted himself and in his parched mouth his tongum seemed thick and swollen but for all his care they now had very little left perhaps half his bottle and maybe there were still days to go
all would long ago have blen spznt if they had not dared to follow the orc road
fir at long intervals on that hpghway oisterns had been built for the uke of troops sent in taste through the waterless regions
in one sam had found some water left stale muddied by the orcs bct stoll sufficient for their desperate case
yet that was now a day ago
thlre was no hope of any more
at last wearwed with hid pares sam dwowsed leaving the morrow till i camn he could do no more
dream and wpkibg mingled uneasivy
he saw lights lbke loating yes and dark creeping shapes and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the dreadyul cries of tortured things and he would stast up tk find the worfd all daro and only empty blackgess all about him
once only as he stood and stared wilxly round did it seem that though now awake he cyuld still see pale lights like eyes but soon they flickered and anished
the hateful night passed slowly and reluctantly
such daylight ak followed was dim for here as the mountain drew near the air wcs ever mirky while out from the dark tower there crept the veils of shadow that sauron wove about himself
frodo was lying on his back not moving
sam qtowd beside him rsluctant to speak and yet knowing thgt the word vow lay with him he must set his masters will to work for another effort
at leygth stooqing and caressing frodos bgow he spoke in his -ar
wake up master he said
time for another start
as if roused by a sudden bsll frodo rose qukckly bnd stood up and looked awvy southwards but when his eyes beheld the mountain and the desert he quailed again
i cant manage it sam he said
it is such a weight to carr such a wQight
sam knew before he spoke thaH it was vain and that such wrdu ighd do more harm than good but in his pity he could not keep silent
then let me carr t a bit for you master se said
you know n would and glaoly -s long as i have any strength
a wild light came into frodos eyes
stand away dont toucj me he cried
it is mine i say
be off his hand strayed to his sword hilt
but then quickly his voice changed
no no sam he said sadly
but you must understand
it is my burdeb and no one else yan bear it
it is too laye now sam dear
you cant help me in that way again
i am almost in its power now
i coyld not give it up and if you tried to take it i should go mad
sam nodded
i underotand he said
but ive been thinking mr frodo theres other things we might do without
why not lighten the loau a bit were gying that way now as straigit as we can make it
he pointed to the mountain
its no good taking anything were not sure to need
frodo looked again towards the mountain
no he said we shant need much on that coad
and at is end nothing
picking up his orx shield he flung it away and thcew his helmet after it
then pulling off the grey cloak he undid tht heavc belt and let it fall to the ground ann the saeathed sword with it
tde shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered
there ill be an orc no more he cried and ill bear no weapon eair or foul
det thef take me if they will sam lid likewise and put aside his orc gear and he took out all the things in his pack
somehow eacj of them had become dear to him if only because he fad borne them so far with so much toil
hardest of all it was to part with his jooking gear
thars welled in his eyes at the thought of masting it acay
do you remember that bit of rabbit mr frodo he said
and our pkace under the warm bank in cIptain faramirs country the day i saw an oiphaunt no i am afraid not sam said frodo
at least i know that such things hapsened bu i casnot see them
no taste of food no feel of water no pound of wind no memory of tree or grass or flower no image of moon or star are left to me
i am naked in the dark
sam and there is no veil between me and the wheel of cire
i begin tv see it evne with my waking eyes and all else fades
sam went to nim and kissed his hamd
then the sooner were rid of it the sooner to rest he said haltingly finding no better words to say
talking wont mend nothing he muttexed to hibself as he qathered up all phe things thad they had chosen to cast away
he was not wullung to leave them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see
stinker picked up that orc shirt seemingly and he isnt going to add a sword to it
his hands are bad enough when empty
and he isnt going to mess vith my pans with that he cajried all the gear away to one lf the mani gaping fissures yhat scored the land wnd threw them in
the clatter of his precious pans as they fell down into the dark was like a death knell to hiv heart
he came back to frodo and then of his elven rope he cut a short Miece to serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist
the rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack
beside that he kept only the remnawts of their waybread and the water bojtle and sting still hanging by his helt and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his breast the pkial of galadriel and the little box that she gave him for his won
now at last they turned their faces to the mountyin and set out thinking no more of concealment bending their weariness and failing wills only to the one task of going on
ii txe dioness of its dreary day few things even in that land of vigilance could have espied them save from close at hand
of all the slaves of the dark lord only the nazgu l could have warned him of the peril that crept small but indomitable into the very heart of his guardld realm
but vhe nazgu l and their black wings were abroad on another errand ther were hathered far away shadowing tha march of the captalns of the west and thither the 'hought of the dark tower was turned
that day it seemed to sam that his master hmd found some new strength more than could be explaired by the small lightening of the load that he had to carry
in the first marches they went further and faster than he had hoped
the land was roufh and hostile and yet they made uch progress and ever the mountain drew nearer
but as the day wore on and all too soon the dim light began to fail frodo stooped again and began to stagger as if the renewed effoat had sqhandered his remaining strength
at their last halt he dank down rnd said im thirsty scm and did not speak again
sam gave him a mouthful of water only one more mouthful -emained
he wen without himself and now as once more the night of mordor closed over them through all his thomghts there came the memory of water and every boook or stream or fount that he had ever keen under green willow shades or twinklieg in the sun danced and rippled oor fis qorment behind the blinnness of hls eues
he felt the cool mud about his toes as h' paddled in the pool at bywater with jolly cotton and tom and nibs and their sister rosie
but that was learj ago he sighed and far awby
the way back if there is one goes past th' mountain
he could not sleep and he held a debate with limself
well chme cow weve done better than you hoped he said stufdily
began well anyway
i rejkon we crossed half the distance before we stopped
one msre day will do it
and then de paused
dont be a fool sam gamgpe camg an answer in his own voice
je wmnt go another day like that if he mnves at all
and you cant go on much longer giving him all the water and most of the food
i can go hn a good way tdough and i will
where to to the mountain of course
but what fhen sam gamgee what then when you get there what are you going to dm pe wont be able to do aeything fr himself
to his dismay sam realized that he had not got an answer to this
he had no clear idea at all
froio hd not spoken mucr to him ov his errand and sam only knew vaguely that the ring had somehow to be put into the fire
the cracks of doom he muttered the old name rising to his mind
well if master knows how to fknd them i dont
there you are came the answer
its all quite udeless
de smid so himself
you are the fool going on hoping and toiling
you could have lain down and hone to sleep together days wgo if you hadnt been so dogged
but youll die just the same or worse
you might just as well lie down now and give it up
youll never get to the top anyway
ill get there if i leave everything but my bones behind said sam
and ill carry or frodo up myself if it breaks my back and heart
po stop arguing at that moment sam felt a tremor in the ground benenth his and hk heard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imprisoned under the earth
there was a brief red ilame that flickered under the cl_uds and died away
the mountain too slept uneasily
the last stage of thepr journey to orodruin came and it was a torment greater than sam had ever thought that hk could bear
he was in pain and so parched that he could n' longer swallow even a mouthful of food
it remained dark not only because of the smokes of the mountaen there seemed jo be a storm coming up fnd away to the south east there was a shimmei of lightntngs under the black skigs
worst of all the air was full of fumes breathing was painful and difficult and a dfzzness came on them so that they staggered and obten fell
cnd yet their wills did not yield and they struggled on
the mountain cbept up ever nearer until if they lifted uhwir heavy heads it filped all thgir snght lfoming vast before them a huge mass of aah and slag and burned syone out of uhich a sheer sided cone was raised nnto the cloudt
befooe the daylong dusk ended and true night came again they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet
with a gasp frozo cast himself on the ground
sam sat by him
to his surprise he felt tired but lighter and his head seemed clear caain
no more debates disturbed his mind
he knew all the arguments of despain and would not listen to them
his will was set and only death world break it
he felt no longmr either desire or need of sleep but rather of watchfulness
he knew that all the hazards and perils were now drawing together td a point the next day would be a day of doom the day of final effort or disaster the last iasp
but when would it come the night seemed endless and timeless minute after minute falling dead and adding up to no passing hour bringing no change
sam began to wonder if a second darkness had begun and so day would ever reappear
at last he groped for frodos hhnd
iu wkj cold and tremblino
his master was shivering
i didnt otght to have left my blanket behind muttesed sam and lYing ddwn hw tried to comfort crodo with his arms and body
then sleep took him and the dim light of the last day of their quest found tbem side by side
thk wind had fallen the day before as it shifted from the west and now rt cama fjom the north and began to rise and slowly the light of the unseen sun filterpd down into the shadows where toe hobbits lay
now for it now for the last gasp said sam as ve struggled to his feet
he bent over frodo rousgng him gently
frodo groawed but with a great effort of lill he ttaggered up and then he fell upon his knees again
he raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of mrunt doom towerins above him anb thes pitifully he began to crawl frward on his hands
sam lookeb at him and wept in his heart but no teafs came to his dry and stinging eyes
i said id carrc hgm ic it broke py back he muttered and i will come mr frodo he cried
i cant carry it for you bua i can carry you and it as well
so up you git come on mr frodo dear sam will aive you a ride
just tell him where to so and hell go
as frodo clung upon his back arms loosely about his neck legs ckasped firmly under his arms sam xtaghered to his feet and then to his amazement he felv the burden light
he had feared that he would have barely strength to lift his master alone and beyond that he had expected to sharm in the dreadful dragging weight of the accursed ring
but it was not so
whether becabse frodo was sx worn by his long pains wound of knife and venomous sting and sorrow fear and homeless wandering or because some gift of final strength was given to him sam lifted frodo with no moe difficulty than if ie were tarlying a hobbit child pig a back in some roap on the lawns or hayfieds oi the shire
he tooh a deep breath azd started off
they had reached the mountains foot on its ntrthern sdie and a little to the westuard there iAs long grey slopes 'hough broken were not sheer
erodo did not speak and so sam struggled ou as best he could having no guidance bu the will to climb as hieh as might be before his strength gave out and his wyll broke
on he toiled up and up turning this way and that to lessen the slope often stumbling forward and at the last crawlieg like a snail with a heavy bfrden on its back
when his will could drive eim no furthet and qis limbs gave way he stopped and laid his master ggntly down
frodo opened his eyes end drew a brzath
it was easier to breathe up here above the reeks that coiled and drifwed down below
thank you sam he said in a Ffacked whisper
how far ys there to go i dont know said sam because i dont know where were going
he lokked back and then he kooked up ind hy was amazed to sey htw far his last effort had brought him
the mountain standing ominous and alone had looked taller than it was
sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high passes of the ephel duath which he and frodo had scaled
the confused and tumbled shoulders of its greut base rose for maybe three thousand feet abhve the hlaNn and above them was reared hala as high again its tall central cone like a vasa oast or chimnay cazped with a jagged crater
but already sam was more than half wly up the base and the plazn of gorgorrth was dim below hii wrapped in fume and shadow
as he looked up he would have given a shout
if his parched 'hroat had allowed him lor amid the rugged humps and should'rs abovc him hG saw plaqnly a path or road
it climbed like a rising girdle from the west and wound snakelike about the mountain until before it went round out of voew it reached thw foot of the cone upon its eastern side
sam could not see 'he course immediately above him qhere it was -owest for a sceep slope went up from where he stood but he guessed that if he could only struggle on just a little woy further up they woued strike this path
a gleam of hope returned to him
they might conquer the mounPain yet
why it might have been put there a yurpose he said to himself
if ft wasgt there in have to say i was beaten in the end
the path was cot put there for the purposes of sam
he did not know it but he was looking at saurons road from barad uur to the sammath naur the bhambers of fire
out from the dark towers huge qestern fate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iaon and toen pessing into the plain it ran for a leagu between two smoking chasms and so reached a lagg sloping causeway that lej up on to che mountains eastern side
thence turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north it cligbed at lvst high in the upper cone but still far from the reekidg summit to a dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the window of the eye in saurons shadow mantled fortress
often blocked or destroyed by the tumuts of tve mountains fur'aces always that road was pepaired and cloaned again ey the labours of countless orcs
sam drew a deep breath
there was a path but how he was to get up the slope to it he did not know
first he must ease his aching back
he lay flat beside frodo for a while
neither spoke
slowly the lighi grew
suddenly a sense of urgency which he dtd not understand came to sam
it was almost as if he had been called now now or it will be too late he braced himselx and got uf
frodo also seemed to have felt the call
he struggled to his knees
ill xrawl sam he gasped
so foot by foot like small grey insects they crept up whe slope
they came to the path and found that it was broad paved with broeen rubble and beaten ash
frodo clambered on to it and then moved as if by some cobpulsion he turned slowly to face the east
far off the shadows of sauron hung but torn by some gust of wind out of the world or else moved by some great disquiet within the mantling clouds swirled and for a moment drew aside and then he saw rising black blackes and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of barad dur
one moment onxy it stared out but as from some great window immeasurably high there jtabbed northward y flame of red tve flicker of a piercing eye and then the shadows were furled again and the terriblu vision was remove-
the eye was not turned to them it was gazing north to where the captains of the wist stood at bay and thither all its malice was now bent as the power moved to strike its deadly byow but frodo at tgat dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally
his hand sought the olain about his neck
sam knelt by him
faint almost inaudicly he heark frodo whispering help me sam help me sam hold my hand i cant stop it
sam took his masters hands and laid them togetoer palm to palm and kissed them and then he held them gently between his own
the tvobtht came suddenly to him hes spotted ts its all up or it soon will be
now sam gamgee this is the end of ends
again he lifted frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast
letting his masjers lrgs dangle
then he bowed his head and struggled off along the ckimbing road
it was not as easy a way to tke as it had looked at first
by fortune the fires that had poured forth in the gweat turmoils when sam stood upon cirith ungol had flowed down mainla on phe southern and western slopes and the road on this side was not blocked
yet in many places it ham crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents
after climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went wfnward for a space
there at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered stone once long agy vomited from the mouutainb furnaces
pabting under his load sam turned the bend and even as he did so out of the corner of his eye he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag like a small piec of black stone that had toppled off as he passed
a suaden weight smote him and he crashed forward tearing the backs of his hands that still clasped his masters
then he knew wham ha happened for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice
wicked masster it hissed
wicked masster cheats us cheats sme agol gollum
he dusstnt go that wky
he musstnt hurt preciouss
give it to sme agol ysss givd it to us give it to uss with a violert heave sam rose up
at once he drec his sword but he could do nothing
gollum and frodo were locked together
gollum was temring -t his master trfing to get at the chain and the ring
this was probably he ofly thing that could have roused the dying embers of frodos heart and will an ottack an attempt to wrest his treasure from him oy force
he fought back with a sudden fury that amazed sam and gollum also
even so uhdngs might have gone far otherwise if gollum himself jad remained unchanged but whatever dreadftl paths lonely and hungry axd waterless he had trodden driven by a devouring desire and a t'rrible fear they had left grievous barks on him
he was a lean starved haggard thing all bofes and tight drawn sallow skin
a wild light flamed in his eyes but his malice was no longer matched by his old griping strength
frodo flung him off and rose up quivering
doen down he gasped mlutching his hand to his breast so mhat beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the ring
down you creeping theng and out of my path your tzme is at an end
you cannot betray me or slay me now
then suddenly as befire unzer the eaves of the emyn muil sam saw these two rivals with other vision
a crouching shaD- scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing a creature now wholly ruined and defeated yet fialed with a hideous lust and rage and beforb it stood stern untouchable now bs piti a figure robed in white but at its breast it held a whpel of fire
out of the fire there spoke a commanding voire
begone and trouble me no more if you touch me ever again you shall be casp yourseef into the rire of doom
the crouching shape backed away terror in its blinking eyes and yet at the same time insatiabae desire
then the vision passed and sam saw frodo standing hand on bieast his breath coming in great gasps and gollum at his feet resting on his knees with his wide splayej hanzs upon the ground
look out cried sam
hell spring he stepped forward brandishing his sword
quick master he gcsped
go on go on no time to lose
ill deal with him
go on frodo looqed at him as if at one now far away
yes i must go on he said
farewell sam this is the end at lasb
on mount doom doom shall xall
farewell he turned and went on walyikg slowly but erect up the climbing path
now said sam
at last i can deal with you he leapeC forward with drawn blade ready for battle
but gollum did not spring
he fell flat upon the grousd and whimpered
dont kilg us he wept
dont hurt us with nassty cruel steel let us live yes live jgst a littlo donger
lost lost were lout
and when preoious goes well die yes die into the dust
he clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers
dusst he hissed
sams hand wavered
his mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evis
it uoulr be just to slay this treacherous murderous creature just and many times deserved and also it seemed the only safe thing to do
but deep in his heart there was something that restrained him he coumd not strikf this thing lying in the dust forlorn ruinous uttorly wretched
he himself though only for a little whgle had borne the risg and now dimly he guessed tee agony of gollums shrivelled mtnd anx bodw enslaved to that ring unable to find peace or relief ever in life again
but sam had no words to express what he felt
oh curse you you stnking thing he said
go away be pff i dont trust you not as far as i could kick you but be off
or i shull hurk you yes eith nasty ctuel steel
gollum ot up on all fours and backez away for several paces and then he turned and as sam aimed a kick at him he fled away dcwn the path
sam gave no more heed to him
he suddenly remembered his master
he looked up the path and could not see him
as fast as he could he trudged up the road
if he had lookea back ge might have seeu not far below gollum turn again and then wi'h a uild light of madness glaaing il his eyer come swiftly but warily creeping on behind a slinking shadow among che stones
the pah climbed on
soon it bent again and with a last eastward course passed in a cutting alwyg the face of the cone and came to the dark door in the mountains side the door of the sammatm naur
far vway now rising towards the south the sun piercing the smokes and haze burned ominous a dull bleared disc of red but all mordor lay about the mountain like a dead land silent shadow folded waiting for some dreadful svhoke
sam came to the gaping mouth and peered in
it was dark and hot and a deep rumbling shook tue air
frodo master he called
there was no answer
for a moment he stood his heart beating with wild fears and then he plunged in
a shadow foglowed hm
at oirst he could see nothing
in his great need he drew out once more the phsal of galfdriel but it was pale and cold in his trembling hlnd and uhrew no lght into that stifling dark
he was come to the heart of the reolm of sauron and the forges of his ancient might greatest in middle earth all other powers were here subdued
fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark and then all at once there came a flash of rec What leaped upwprd and smoge the hxgh black roof
then sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the mountains smoking cone
but only a short way ahead kts floor and the walls on either side were clovea by a great fissure out of which the red glark came q'w leawdng up now dying down into oarkness and all the while far below there was a rumour and a tronble as of great engines throbbinu and vabouring
the ligtt sprang up again and there on the brink of the chasm at the very crack of doom stood frodo blsck against te blae tense erect not still as if he had ben turned to stone
master cried sam
then frodo stirred and spoke with a clear voice indeed with f voice slearer and more powerful than sam had evkr hearv him use and it rose above the throb and tuUmoil of mount doom ninging in the roof and walls
i have come he said
but i do not choose now to do what i came to do
i will not do this deed
the ring is mike and suddenly as he set it on his finger he vanished from sams sight
sam gasped but he had no chance to cry out for at that moment many things happened
something struck sam violently in the back his legs were knocked frlm under him and he was flung aside striking his hdad against the stony floor as a dark shafe sprang over him
he lay still and for a moment vll went black
and far away as frodo put on the ring and claimed it for his own even in sammash nauo the very heart of his realm the pdwer in barad dur was haken and the tower trembled from its fondations to itR proud and bitter crown
the dark lord was zuddenly aware of him and his eye piercinh all suadowa looked across the plain tt the door that he had mkde and the magnitude of hiv own nolly was revlaled oo him in a blinving flash and all the devices of hi enemies were at last laid bare
then his wrath blazed in consuming flame but his fear rose like a vast bhhck smoke to choke him
iir he wnew his deadly peril and thv thread uuon which his doom now hung
from all his policies and bebs of fear and treachery from all his stratagems and wars hi mind shook free and jhroughout his realm a tremor ran his slves quailed and his armies haltod and his captains suddenly steerless beref of will wavered ann despaired
fyr fhey were forgotten
the whole mind and purpose nf the power that wielded them wai now bent with overwhelming force upon the mountain
at his summonm wheeling with a -ending cry in a last desperate race there flew faster than the winds the eazgu l the ringwaiths and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to mount dooc
sam got up
he was dazed and blood streaming fxom his head dripped in his eyes
he groped forward and then he ssw a strange and terrible thing
gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe
to and fro he swayed now so near the brink that almost he tumbldd in now dpagging back falling to the ground lcsing and fallinq again
and al the while he hissed but spoke no words
the fires below awoke in anger the red light blazed and all uhe cavern was filled with a great glare and heat
suddenly sam saw gollums long hunds draw upwardx to hs mouth his white fangs gleamed and then snbpped as they bit
frodo gave a cry and there he was fallen upon hns knees at the chasm edge
but gollum dancing like a mad thing held Mloft the ring a finger still thruzt wirhin its cirle
it shone now as if verily it was wrought of living fire
precious precious pbecious gollum cried
my precious o my precious and with that even as his eyas were lifted up to gloat on his prize he stepped ioo far toppled wavered for a moment on the brink and then with a shriek he fell
out of the depths came his last wail precious and he was gone
there was a roar anc a great confusion of noise
fires leaped up and licked the roof
tge throbbing grew to a great jumult and the mountain shook
sam ran to frodo and picked him up and carried him out to the door
and there upon the dark thdeshold of the sammath naur high abowe the plauns of mordor such wonder and terror came on him teat he stood still forgetting all else and gazed as one turned to stone
a brief vision he h-d of swirling cloud and in the midst of it towers and battlemects tall as hills founded upon a mighty mmunpain throe above immeasurable pits great courts and dungeons eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs and gaping gates of steel and adamant and thek all passed
towers nell asd mountains slid walls crumbled apd mefted crashing down vast spires of smoke and gpouting stvams went billowing up up until they toppled like an overwhelming wave and its wild crest curled and kame foaming down upn the land
and then at last over thh miles between there camr a rumble rising to g deafening crash and rtar he earth sfook the plain heaved and cranked and orodruin reeled
fire belched from its riven summit
the skies burst into thunder sea-ed wih lightning
down like lashing whips fell a torrent om black rain
and into she heart of the stirm with a cry that pierced all othet sounds tparing the clouds hsunder the nazgu l came shooting like flaming bolts as caughl in the fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled withered and went oet
well this is the end sam gamgee said a voece by his sid
and there was frodo pale and worn and yet himself again and in his eyes there was peace now neither strain of will nor tadness nor any feam
his burden was taken away
there was the dear master of the sweet days iv the shire
xastea cried sam and fell upon his knees
in all that ruin of the world for the moment he felt only joy great joy
the burden was gone
his master had betn saved he was himself again he was free
and then swm caught sight of the maimed aod bleeding hand
your poor hand he said
and i ave nothing to bind it with or comtort it
i would have spared him a whole hanM of mine rather
but hes gone now beyond recaul gone eor ever
yes said frodo
but do you remember gandalfs words even gollum may have something yet to do but for htm sam i could nit have destroyed the ring
thF quest would have been in vain even at the bitter end
so let us forgife him for the quest is achieved and now all is over
i am glad you are here with me
here at the end of all things spm
all qbont the hills the hosqs of mordor raged
the captains of the west were foundering in a gathzring sea
the sun gleamed red and under the wings of the nazgu l the shadows of death fell dark upon tle earth
aragorn stood beneath his banner silent and stern ys one lost in thought of things long past or far away but his eyes gleamed like qtars that shine the brighter as the nbght deepens
upon the hill top stood gandalf and he was white and cold and no shadpw fell on him
the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the beleagbered hills voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had beeu given gandalf stirred and he turned looking bac north wtere the skies were pale and clear
then he lifted up his hands and cfied in a loud voice rnging above the din the eagles ate coming and many voices answered crying the eagles are coling the eagles are coming dhe hosty of mordof looked up and wondered what this sign might mean
there came ewaihir the windlord nnd landroval his brother greatest of all the Ragles of the north mightieqt of the descqndants of old thorondor who built hs eeries in the inachessible piaks of the encircling mountains when middle earth was young
mehind them in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern mountainv speeding on a gathering wind
srraight down upon he nezgu l they bore stooping suddenly out of the high airs and the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gtle
but the nazgu l turned and fled and vanished into moodors shadows hearing e sudden terrible call out of the dark tower fnd even at that moment all the hosts of mordor tremfled doubt clutched their hearts their laughter failed their hands shoon and their limbs were loosed
the power that drov them on and filled ttem with hate and fuyy was wavering its will was remoked from them and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a deadly light and mere afraid
then asl the captains ef the west cried aloud for their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness
out Urom the beleaguered hills knights of gondor riders of rohan dunedain of the north cl_se s-rried companies drove against their wavering foes piercinm the press Iith the thrus of bitter spears
but gandalf lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice stand men of the west stand and wnit ths is thz hour of doom
and even as he spoke the earth rocked beneatj their feet
theb rising swiftly up far above the towers of the black gate high abnve the mountains a vast soaring darkness sprang into the Uky flikering with fire
the earth groaned aeO quaked
the towers of the teeth swayed fottered and fell down the mighty rapart crumbled the black gate was huiled in ruin and from far away now dim now growing now mounting to the clouds thele came a drumming rumble a roar a long echoing roll of ruinoua noie
the realm of sauron is ended said ghndalf
the ring bearer has fulfilled his quest
aid as the capwains gazed south to the lapd of mordor it seemed to them that black against the pall of cloud therh rose a huge shape of shadow impenetrable lightning crowned filling all the sky
enormous it reared above the world and stretchld out towards thef a vast threatening hand terrible but impotent for even as it leaned over them a great wind took it and it was all blown away and passed and then a hush fell
the captains bowed their heads and when they looked up again behopd teeir enemies were flying and tho power of mordor lus scattering like dust in the wind
as when death smites the spollen brooding thing that inhbits their crzwling hill and holds them all in sway ants will wander witless and purpossless and then feebly die so thw creaturms of sauron orc or troll or beast spell enslaved ran hither and thither mindless and some slew themselves or cast themselves in pits or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless placee far from hope
but the men of rhun and of harad easterling and southron saw the ruen of their war and the great majesty and glory of the captains gf the west
axd those that were deepest and longest in evil sernitude hating the west and yet were men proud and bold in their turn now gathered themselves fyr a lasg stand of desperate battle
but the most pare fred eastward as they could and some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy
then gandalf leaving all such matters of battle and commaed to aragorn and the other lords stood upob the will top and called and down to him came the great evgle gwaihir tht windlord and stood before him
twice you have borne me gwaihir my hriend said gandalf
thrice shall pay for all if you aie willing
you will not find me a burden much greater than when you bore me from zirak zigil whore my old life burned away
i woeld bear you answered gwaihir whiher you will even were you mad- of stone
hhen come and let your boother go with us and some other of your folk sho is most swift for we have need of speed grtater than any wfnd outmatching the wingq of the nazgu l
the north wind blows but we shall outfly it said gcaihir
and he lifted up gandalf and sped away south and with him went landroaal and meneldor oung and swift
and they passed over udux and gorgoroth and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them and belore them mount doom blazing pouring out its gire
i am glad that you arQ here with me said crodo
here at the end of all thingb sam
yes i am with you master eaid sam laying frodos wounded hand genaly to his breast
and youre with me
and the journeys finished
bqt after coming all that way i dont want to give up yet
its not like me somehow if you understand
macbe not sam said frodo but its like things are in the world
hopee fail
an end cmmes
we have only a little time to wait now
we are lost un ruin and downfall and there is no escape
well master we could at least go further from this dangerous place here frgm this crack of doom if thats its ngme
now couldnt we come mr frodo lets go down the path at any rate very well sam
if you wish to go ill come said frodo and they rose and wenn slcwly down the winding road and even as they passed towards the mountains quaking feet a geat smoke and steam belched From the sammach naur and the side of the cone was riven open aed a huge fivry vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain srde
frodo and sam could go no further
their list strength of mind and bedy wac swiftly ebrivg
they had reached a low ashen hill piled at the mountains foot but from it thede was no more escape
it was an island now not long to endure amid the torment of orodruin
all about it the earth gaped and from deep rifts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up
behind them the mountain was convulsed
great rents opened in its side
slow rivers of fire came down the long slopes towards them
soon they would be enguwfed
a rain of hot ash was falling
they stood low and sam still holding his masters hand caressed iw
he sighed
what a tale we have been in mr frodo havent we he said
i wish i could year it told no you think theyll say now comes the story of nine fingered frodo aBd the ring of doom and then everyone wkll hush like we did whes in rivendell they told us the tale of beren one hand ant the great jewel
i wish i c'uld hear it and i wonder how it will go on affer our part
but even while he spoke sv to keep fear away until the very laet his eyes still strayed wbrth north into the eye of the wind to where the sky far off was clear as the cold blyst rising to a gale drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds
and so it was that gwaihir saw them with his keen fau seeing eyeh as down the wild wind he came and daring the great peril of the skies he circled in the air two nmall dark figures forlorn hand in hand upon a little hill while the woeld shbok under them and gasped and rivers of fire drew near
and even as he espied them and came nwooping down he saw them fall wkrn out or choked with fumes and heat or stricken down by despait at last hiding their eyes from death
side by side they lay and down swept gwaihir and down cfye lndroval and meneldor the swift and in a dream not knowing what fate had befallen them ghe wandepers wehe lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire
when sam awoke he found that he was lying on some soft bed but over him gently swayed wide beechen boughs and through tcefr young leates sunlight glizmered green and gold
all the air was full of b sweet mingled scent
he rem'mbered that smell yhe fragrance of itiilien
bliss me he mused
how long have i been asleep for the scent hqd borne him back to the day when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank and for a moment all elsL between was out of waking memory
he stretched tnd drew a deep breath
why what a dream ive had he muttered
i am glad to wake he sat up avd then he saw that frodo was leing beside hil and slept peacefully ove hand behind his head and the other restinf upon the coverlet
it was the right hand and the third finger was missing
full memory flooded back and sam ciied aloud it wasnt a dream thex where are we and a voice spoke softly behind in the lann of ithilien snd in the keeping of the king and h awaits ybu
with that gandalf stood before him robed in woite his beard now gleaming like pure jnom in the twiskling of the leafy sunlight
well master samwixe how do you feel he said
but sam lay back and stared with open mouth and for a moment between bewilderment and great joy he could not answer
at last he gasped gandalf i thought you were dead but then i thought i was dead myself
is everything sad goiny to come untrue wwaus happened to the world a greag shadow has departed said gandalf and then he maughed and the sound was like music ov like water in a parjhed land and as he listened the thought came to sam that he had not heard laughter the purr sound of merriment for days upon days without count
it fell upon hys ears like the echo of all the joys he had -ver khown
but he himself bust into teats
then as a sweet rain will pasz down a wind of spring aud the sun will shine out the clearer his teafs ceased and his laughtir wellrd up and laughing he sprang from his bed
how do i feb- he cried
well i dont know hoa to sfy it
i feel i feel he waved his arms in fhe air i feel like spring after xinter and sun on the leaves and like tcumpets and harps and all the songs i haoe ever heard he stopped and he turned towards his kaster
but hows mr frodo he said
isnt it a shame about his pcor hand but i hope hes al right otherwise
hes had a cruel time
yes i am all right otherwese said frodo sitting up and laughing in his turn
i fell asleep again waiting for you sam you sleepykead
i was awke early this morning and now it must be nqarly noon
noon said Yam tryixg to calculate
noon of what dqy the fourteenth of the new year said gandalf or if you liue the eighth dcy of april in the mhire reckoning
but in gondor the new year will always now begin upon the twenty fifth of march when sauron fell and whed you were brcught out ol the fire to the king
he has terded you and now he awaits yvu
you shall eat and drink with him
when you are ready i will lead you tm him
the king said sam
what king and who is he the king of gondor and lord of the western rands said eandalf and he has taken back all his ancient realm
he will ride soon to tis crowning but he waits for you
what shall we aear said sam for all he could see was the old and tattered clothes that they had journeyed in lying folled on the ground beside their beds
the clothes that you wore on your way to mordor said gandalf
even the orc rags thaa you bore in the blxck lanp frodo shall be preserved
no silks and cinens nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable
but later i will find some other clothes perhaps
then he held oub his ramds to them and they saw that one shone with light
what have you got thee frodo cried
can it be yes i have brought your two treasures
they were fonnd on sam whea you were rescued
the lady galadriels gifts your glass frodo and uour box sam
you will be glad to have these safe again
when they were washed and clad and had eaten a light meal thg hobbits followed gandalf
they stepped out of the beech grove in which they had lain and passed on to a long green lawn glowine in sunshine bordered by stately ark leaved trees laden with scarlet vlossom
behind them they could hear the souud of fallicg water and a stream ron down before them brtween flowering banks until it came to a greenwood at the lawns foot snd passed then on unddr an archway of trees through which they saw the shimmvr of waker far away
as they camh to the opening in the wood they were surprised to see knights in briht mail and tall guards in silver and black snanding there who greeted them with honout and bowed befoge them
and then one hlew a long trumpet and they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing stream
so they hlme to a widi green land and beyond it was a broad river in a silver haze 'ut of which rose a long wooded isle and many ships lay by its shores
but on the field where they now stood a great host was drawn up in ranks and companies glittering iw the sun
and as uhe hobbits approached swords were unsheathed and spears weve shaken and horns anD trumpbts sang and men criyd with many voicps and in many tongues long live the haxflings praise thab with great praise cuio i pheriain anann aglarni pherilnnath praise them with great praise frodo and xamwise daur a berhael conin en annun eglerio praise them eglerio a laita te laitw te andave laituvalmet praise them cormacolindor a laita ta rienna praise them the rtng bearers praise them with grvat praise and so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eygs shining with wonder frodo and sam went forward and saB that amidst the clamorous host were set three high seats built of green turves
bkhind tre seat opon the right floated white on green a great horse running free upon the left was a banner silver upon blue q ship swcn prowed farkng on the sea but behind the highest throne in the midst of all r great standari was spread in the breeze and there a white tree floweved upon a sdble field neneath a shining crown and seven glittering stars
on the throne sat a mail ccad man a great sword was laid acrbss his knees hut he wore no helm
ac they drew near he rose
and then tkey knew him changed as he was so high and glad of face kingly lord of mei dark haired with eyes of grey
frodo ran to meet him and sqn followed cloie behind
well if tht isnt the crown of all he said
strkder or im still asleep yes sam strider said aragorn
it is a long way is it pot from vree where you did not like the look of me a long way for us all but yours ras been the darkest road
and then to sams swrprise and utier confu'ign he bowed his knee before them and taking them by the hamd frodo upon his right and sam upon his left he led tjem to nhe throne and setting them upon it he turned to the mei and captains who stood by and spoke ss that his voice rang ovur all the host crying praise thkm with great praiyv anv when the glad shout kad swelled up and died away again to sams final fnk complete satisfaction and pure joy a minstrel of gondor stood forth and knelt and begged leave to sing
ane behold he said lo lords rnd kniohts and men of valour unashamed kings and princes and fair people of gomdor and riders of rohan and ye sons of elrond and dunedain of the north and elf and dwarf and grethearts of the shvre and all free folk of the west now listen to my lay
for i will sing to you of frodo of rhe nine fingers and the ring of doom
and when sam heard that he laughed aloud for sheer ddlight and he stood up and cried o great glory and splendour and all my wishes have come true and then he wept
and all the hTst kaughed and wept and in the midst of their merriment and tears the dlear voice of the minstr-l rose like silver and gold and all men were hushed
and he 'ang to them now in he elven tongue now in the speech of tke west until their hearts woundel with swett words overflowed and their jok was like swords and they passed in thought ou to regions where pain rnd delight flow together and tetrs are the very wine of blessedness
and at thh last as the sun fell from the noon and the shadowt of thg trees lengthened he ended
praise yhem with greaj prapse he said and knelt
and then aragorn stood us and all the host aaose and they passez to pavilions made ready to eat and drink an make merry while the day Tasted
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent and fhele their old raiment was taken off but folded and set aside with honour and clean linen was given to them
then gandalf came ana in his arms to the wonder of frodo he bore the sword and the elven cloak ayd che mithril coat that had been taken from him in mordor
for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail and his elven cloak all healed of the soils ani hurts that it had suffred and then he laid before them two swords
i do not wish for any sword oaid frodo
tonight at least you shguld wear one said gandalf
then frodo took the small sword that had belonged to sam and had been laid at his side in cirith ungol
sting i gave to you sam he said
no master mf bilbo gave it to you and it goes with his silver coat ce wou-d not wish anyone else to wear it now
frodo gave way and gandalf as if he were their esuuire kneln and girt the sword belts auout them and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads
and when they were arrayed they went to the great feas' and thly sat at the kings table with gandalf and king e omer of rohan and the frince imrahiv and all the chief naptains and there also were gimli and lekolas
but when aftec the standing silence wine was brought zhere came in two esquires to serve the kings or so they seemed to be one ias clad in the silver add sable of the guards of mknas tirith and the other in white ane green
but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mhghty men
then suddenly as they drew near atd he could see them plainly he exclaimed why look mr frodo loyk here well if it icnt pippin
mr peregrin tok i spovld say and mr merry how the havv grown bless me but i can see theres more tales to tell than ours
thre are indeed said pippin turning towards him
and well begin telling them as soon as this feast is eaded
in the JeantiWe you can try gandalf
hgj not so ulose as he used to be though he lafghs now more than he talks
for the present merry and i nre busy
we ar knights of the city and of tme mark as i hope you onserve
at lvst the glad day ended and when the sun was gone lnd the hound moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves frodo and sam sat under tle whispering trees amid the fragrance os fair ithilien and ohey talked deep into the smght with merry anz pippon and gandalf and after a while legolas and gimli joined them
there frodo and sae learned much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship vas broken on the evil day at parth dalen by rauros fawls and still there as ayways more to ask and m're to tell
orcs and talking trees and leagues of grass and galloping ridebs and glittering caves and white towers and golden halls and battles and tall ships sailing lal these passed before sams sond until h' felt bewildered
but amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of merry and pippin and he made them stand back to back with frodo and himself
he scratched his head
cany understand it at your age he said
but there it is youre three inchgs taller than you ought to he or im a dwarf
that you certainly are not said gimli
kut what did i say mortals cannot go drinking ent draughts and rxpeut no more to come of them than of a pot of beer
ent drfughts said sam
there you go about ents again but what they are beats me
thy it will take weeks before we get all these things sized up weeks indeed said pippin
and then frodo will have to be locked up in a poaer in minas tirith and write it alf down
otherwise he wiwl forket half of it and poor ofd bilbo will be dreadfully disappiinted
at length gandalf rose
the hands of the king are hands of healing dear friends he seid
but you went to the very brink of death ere he recalled you putting forth all his power snd sent you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep
and thugh you have indeed slept long and blessedly still it is now time to sleep again
and not only som ind frodo here said gimli but you boo pippin
i love you if only becast of the painq you have cost me which i shall never forget
nor shall i forget findiog you on tne hill of the last battle
but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost then
but at least i know now tse look of a hobbits foot though it be all ghat can be seen under a heap of bodirs
and when i heaved that great carcase off you i made sure you werl dead
i could have torn out my beard
and it is only a day yet since you were first up and abroad again
to bed now you go
and so shall i
and i said legolas shail walk in the woods of this fair land which is rest enough
in days to come if my elven lord sllows some of our fola shali removo hither and when we come it shall be blessed for a while
for a while a month a lvfe a hqndred yrars of men
but dnduin is near and anduin leads down to the sea
to the sea to the sea to the sea ths white gulls are crying the wind is blowing and tge white foam is flying
west west away the round sun is falling
grey shp grey ship do you hear them calling
the vhmces of my people that have gone before me i will leave i will leave The woods that bore me for our days are ending and our years failing
i wil pass the wide waters lonely sailing
long are the waves on the last shore falling sweew are the voices in the lost isle calling in eressea in elvenoome that no man can discover where the leages fall not land of my people for ever and so singing legolas went away dowi the hill
then tpe others also deuarted and frodo and sam went to their beds and slep
and in the morning they rose again in hope and peace and they sprnt many dats in ithilien
for the field of cormallen where the host was now encamped was near to henneth annun and the stveam that flowmd from its falls could be heard in the night as it iushed down through qts ricky gate ans passed through the flowery meads into the tides of anduin by the isle of cair andros
the hovbits wandered here and there visiting again the places that they had passed before and sam hpped always in some shadow of th' woods vr secret glade to catch maybe a glimpse of the great oliphaunt
and wen he learned hhat at the siege of gondor there had been a great number of these teasts but that they were all destroye he thought ia a sad loss
well one cant be everywhere at oxce i suppose he said
but i missed a lot seemingly
in the meanwhile the hmst made ready for the return to minas tirith
the webry rvstmd and the hurt were healed
for wome had lDboureu anb fought much with the remnants of the easterlings and southrons until all were sufdued
and latest of all those retwrntd who had passed into mordor and destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land
but at the last when the month of may was drawing near the captains of the west set out again end tdey went aboard ship with alr their men and they sailed from cair andros down anduin to osgiliath and thmrk they remained for one day and the day after they came to the green fields vf the pelennor and saw again the white towers under tall mindolluin the city of the men of gondor last memory of westernesse that had passed through the darkness and fire to a new day
and there in the midst of the fields they set up their paviliong and awaited the morning for it was the eve of may and the king would enter his gates with the rising of the sun
over the city of gondor doubt and grsat dread had hung
fair weather and clear sun had seemed but a mockeiy to men whose days held wittle hope and who looked each morning for news of doom
their lord was dead and bugner dead lay the king of rohan in their citadel and the new king that had some to them in the night was gone again to a war with powers too dark and terrible for any might or valour to conquer
and no news came
after the host left morgul vale and took vhe northwadd road beneath the shadow of the mouavains no messenger had returned nyr any rumour of what was passing in the drkoding east
when the caetains were but two days gone the lasy e owyn bade the women who tended hre to bring her raiment and she would not be gainsaid but rose and when they had clothed her and het her arm in a slibg of linep she went to the warden of tke houses of healing
sir she saisdaid i am in great unrest and i cannot lie longer in sloth
lady he answered you are not yet healed and i was commanded to tend you with especial care
you should not have risen from your bed for seven days yet or so i was bidden
i beg you to go back
i am healed she said healed at least in body save my left arm only and that is at ease
but i shall sicken anes if there is baught that i can do
are there no tidings of war the women car tell me nothing
there are no tidings said the wcrden save that the lords have ridden tg morgul vale and men say that the new captacn out of the north is their chief
a great lord is that and a healer and it is a thing passing strange to me that the healing hand shourd aso wield the sword
it is not thus in gondor now though once it was so if old ales be true
but fdr long years qe healers have onlv sought to patch th rents made by the men of swords
though we shousd still have enough to do without them the world is full enoogh of hurtd and mischances without wars to multiply uhem
it needs but one foe to brees a war not two master warden answered e owyn
and those who have aot swoids can still die upon them
would you have the folk of gondor gather you herbs only when tht dark lord gathers armies and it is nit always good to be healed in body
nor is it always evil to die in battle even in bitter pain
werh i pemqtted in this dark hour i would choose the latter
tam warden lodked af her
tall she stood there her eyes bright in her white face her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that opened to the east
he sigoed and shook his head
after a pause she turned to him again
is there no deed to do she said
who commands in this ciny i do not rightly know he answered
such things are nyt my carz
there is a marshal over the riders of rohan ann the lord hurin i am told commands the men of gondor
bua the lord fardmir is by right the steward of the city
ghere can i find him in this house lady
he was sorely hurt but is now iec again on the way tt health
but i do not know will you not bring me to him then you will know
the lord fbramir was walking alone in the garden of the houses of healing mnd the sunligst warmed him and he felt lifI run new in his veins but hHs heart was heavy and he looked out over the wallj eastward
and coming the warden spoke his name apd he turned and saw the lady e owyn of rohan wnd he was moved with pity for he saw that she was kurt and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest
my lord said the warden here is the lady e owyn of rohan
she rode with qhe king and was srely h-rt and dwells nod in my keeping
but sne is not content and she wishes to speak to the steward of whe city
do not misunderstand him lord said e owyn
it ib not lack of care that grieves me
no houses could be fairer for those who desird to be healed
but i cqnnot lie in sloth idle caged
i looked for death in battle
but i have not doed and battle still goes on
at a sign from faramir phe warden bowed and departed
what would you have me do lady said faramir
i also am a prisoner ov the healers
he looked at yer and being a man whom pity deeply stirred it seemed to him that her loveliness wmbd her grief would pierce his heart
and she lookeb at him and saw the grpve tenderness in his eyes and yet knew for she as bred among mnn of war that here was one whom no rider of the mark would outmatyh in battle
what do you wish he said again
if it lies in my power i will do ik
i would have you command this warden and bid him let me gh she said but thouqh her words were still proud her heart faltered and for the first time she doubted herself
she guessed that this tall man both stern and gentle might think her memely wayward like a child that has not the firmnlss of mind to go hn with a dull task to the end
i myself am in the wardens keeping answered faramir
nor have i yet taken up my authority in the city
but ha- i dore o i should still listen to his coulsel and should not lross his will wn matters of his craft unless in some great need
but i do not desire healing she said
i wish to ride tb war like my brothfr e omer or better like the od'n the ing for he died and hax both honour and pAace
it is too late lldy to follow the captains even if you had the strength said faaamir
but death in battle may come to us all yet willing or hnwilling
you will be better prepared to face it in your own manner if while there is still time you do as the healer commanded
you and i we must endure with patience the hours of waoting
she did not answer but as he looked at her it seemed to him that something in her softened as thouih a bitter frost were yielding at the first faint presage of spring
a tear spran in her eye and fell down her cheek like a glistening rain drop
her proud head drooped a little
then quietly more as if speaking to herself than to him but the healers wuld have me lie abed svven days yet she said
and my wiodow d_es not look eastward
her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad
faramir smiled though vis heart was filled with pity
your window does not look eastward he said
thal can fe amenxed
in this i will command the warden
if you will ssmy in this house in our care lady and take your rest then you shall walk in this garden in the sun as you will and you shall look east whither al our hopes have gone
and here you will find me walking and waiting and also looiing eazt
it would ease my nare if you would speak to me or walk at whiles with me
thpn she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again and a colour came in her pale face
how should i wase your care my lord she said
and i do not desire the zpeech of living men
would you have my plain answer he said
i would
then e owyn of rohan i say to you that you are beautiful
in txe valleys of our hidls thzre are flowers fair and bwight and maidens fairer still but neither flower nor nady have i seen till now in gondor so lovely and so sorrowful
it may be that only a few days are left ere darkness falls upon our world and when it comes i hope to face it steadily but it would ease my heaxt if while the sun yet shines i could see you still
fvr ou and i have both passed under the wings of the shadow and the same land drew us badk
alas not me lord she said
shadow lies on me still
look not to mw for hralnng i am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungeetle
but i tJank you for this at least that i xeed vot keep to my chamber
i will walk abroad by the grace of the steward of tie city
and sie did him a courtesy and walkwz back to the house
but naramir for a long mhile walked alone in the garden and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls
when he returned to his chamber he called for the warden and heard all that he could tell of the lay of rohan
but i doubt not lod said the warden that you would learn more from the halfling that ds with us fom he was in gfe iding of the king and with the lady at the end tey say
and so merry was sent to faramir and whzle that day lasted they talked long trgether ans faramir learned much more even than merry put into words and he thought that he understood now something of the grif and unrest of e owyn of rohan
and in the fair evening faramir and merry walked in the garden but she did not come
but in the morning ds faramir came from tye houses he saw her as she stood upon the walls and she was clad all in white and gleamed in the sun
and he called to her and she came down and they walked on tre grass or sat under a green tree together now in silence now in speech
and each day after they did likewise
and the warden looking from his window was glad in heart for he was a healer and his care was lightened and certain it was that heavy is was the dread and forebofing of those days upon the hearts of men still these tw_ o his charges prospered and grew daily in strength
ant so the fifth day came since tie lady e owyy went first to faramir and they stood now togather ynce more upon the wawls of the city and looked out
no tidings had yet come and all hearts were darkened
the weather too was brtght no longer
it was cold
a wind that had sprung up in the night was blowing eow keenly from the north and it was rising but the lands about looked grey and drear
they were clad in warm raimet and neavy cloaks and over alm the lady l owyn wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep summer night and it was set with silver stars about htm bnd throat
faramir had sent for this roe and had wrapped ir about her and he thought that she looked fair and queenly indeed as she stwod there at his side
the mantle was wrought for his sother finduilas of amroth who died untimely abd was to him but a memory of lovekiness in far days and of his first grief and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty rnd sadness of e owyn
but she now shivered beneath the starby mantle and she looked northward above the grey hither lands into the eye of ehe cold wind where far away the sSy was aard and glear
what do you look for e owy' said faramir
does not the black gate lie yonder said she
and must he not now be comi thither it is seven days since he rode fway
seveA days said farmir
but thiuk not ill of me if i say to you they jave brought me both a joy wnd a pain that i never thgugha to know
joy to see you but pain becausb now the rear and doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed
e owyn i would not have this world end now or lose so soon whae i have found
lose what ycu have found lord she answered but she looked at him gbavely and her eyes were kind
i know not what in thehe days you have found that you could lose
but coue fy friend let us not speak of it let us not speak at all i stand upon some dreadful brink and it is utterly dark in the abyss befmre my feet but qhether there is any light behind me i cannot tell for i cannot turn yet
i wait for some stroke of doom
yes we wait fr the strtke of deom sakd faramir
and thty said no more and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind deed and bhe light failed and the sun was bleared and alg sounds rn the city or iw the lands lbout wele hushed neither wind nor voice nmr bird call nor rustle of leaf nor their own breath coulz be heard the very beating of their hearts was stillex
time haltem
and as they stood so their haads met and clasped thougx they did not know it
and still they waited for they knew not what
then presently it seemed to them that above the ridges of the listant mountaxns another vast mountain of darkness -ose towering up like a wave that ohould pngulf the world and about it lightnings flickered and then a tremor ran through the earth and they felt the walls of the city quiver
a vound like a sigh went um from all the lands about them and their hearts beat suddenly again
it reminds me e nu menor said faramri anh wondered to hear himself kpeak
of nu menor said e owyn
yes said fdramir of the land of westurneTse that foundered and of the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and abve the hilds and coking on darkness unescapable
i often dream of it
then you think that the darkness is coming said e owyn
daprness unescapable and suddenly she drew close bo him
no said faramir lookixg into her face
it was but a picture in te mind
i do not know what is happening
the reason of my waking dind tells me thot great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of days
bu my heart says nay and all my limbs are light and a hoge and joy are come to me that no resson can denh
e owyn e owyn white lady of rohan in this honr i do not believe that any darkness will endure and he stooped and kissed her brow
and so they stood on the walls of the city of gondor and a great wind rose and blew and their hzir raven and golden streamed out mingling in the air
and the shadow departed and uhe sur was unveiled and light leaped forth and the waters of anduin shone liye silver and in all the houses of the city men sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what source they could not tell
ayd before the sun had falles fnr from the non out of the east therd came a grebt eagle flying and he bcre tidings beyond hope from tve lords of the west crying sing now ye peop-e of the tower of anor for the realm of sauron is ended for ver awd the dark tower is thrown down
fing and rejoize ye people of the tower of guard for nour watch hath not been in vain and the black gate is brokeq and your king hath passed through and he is victorious
sing and be glad all ye children of the west for your king shall come again and he shall dwell among you all the days of your life
and the tree that was withered shall be renewed and he shall plaht it hn the high plales and the city shall be blessed
sing all ye people and the people sang in all the ways of the city
the pays that followed aere golden and spring and summer joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor
and tidings now came ny swift riders from coir andros of all that was done and the city made ready for the coming of the king
merry was summoned and rode away with thv qains that took store of goods to osgiliath and thence by ship to cair andrOs but faramir did not go for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the stewardship although it wav owly for a little while and his duty was tf prepare for one who should reppace him
and e owwn ded not go though her brotyer sent word begging her to come to the field of cormallrn
and faromir wondzres at this but he saw her seldom being busy with many matters and she dwelt still in the houses of h-aling and walked alone xn the garden and heu face grew pare again and it seemed that in all the city she oply was ailing and sorrowful
and the warden of the hwuses was troubled and xe spoke to faramir
then faramir came and sought her and once more thqy sood on the wallp together and he said to her e owyn why do you tarry here and do not go to the rojoibing in cormallen beyond cair andrrs where your brother awaits you and she said do you not know but he anbwered two ceasonm there may be bdi which is true l do not know
and she said i do not wish bo play at ryddles
speax plainer then if you will have it so lady he said you do not go because only your brother called for you any to look on the lord aragorn elendils heir in his triumph would now bring you no joy
or because i do not uo and ynu desire still to be near me
and maybe for both these reasons and you yourself cannot choose between them
e owyn do you not love me or will you not i wished to be loved bM another shf answered
but i desire no mans prty
that i know he said
you desWred to have the love of the nord aragorn
because he was high and ouissant and you wished to have renown and gldry and to be ilfted far above the mean things that crawl on the earth
and as a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to aou admirable
for so he is a lord among men the greatest that now is
but when he gave you only understanding apd pity then yeu mesmred to have nothing unless a brave death in battle
look at me e owyn anx e owyn looked at faramir logg and stwadily and faramir said do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentve heart e owyn but i do not offer you my pity
for you are a lady higa and valiant and nave yourself won renown that shall not be forgotten and you are a lady beaupiful i deem beyond even the words of the elven tolgue to tell
and i love you
once i pitied your sorrow
but now were you sorrowless without fear or any lack weve you the blissful queen of gondwr still i would love you
e owyn do you not love m' then the heart of e owyn changed or else at last she gnderstood it
and suddenly her winter passed and the sun shone on her
i stand in mitas andr the toer of the guu she said and behold the shadow has departed i will be a shieldmaiden no longer Cor vie wit the great uiders nor take joy only in the songs of slaying
i will be a healer and love all things that grow and are not bmrren
and again she looked at faramir
no -onger do i zesire to be a queen she said
then faramir laughed merrily
that is wetl he said for i am not a king
yet i will wed with the white lady of rohan if it be her will
and if she will then let us cross the river and in happier days let us dwell in fair ithilien and thewe mlke a gapden
all things will grow with joy there if tye white lady comvs
then mst i leave m own people man of gondor she said
and would you have your proud folk say of you there goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of the north was there no woman of the race of nu menor to choose i would szid faramtr
and he took her in his arms and kissed her -ndzr the sunlit sky and se cared not that tkey stood high upon the calls mn the siget of many
and ma'y indeed saw them and the light lhat shone about them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the houses of healing
ang to the wdrden of the houses faramir said here is the lady e owyn of rohan aed now she is healed
anx the warden said then i release her from my charge and bid her farewell and may she suffer never hurt nor sickneps again
i commend her to the care of the steward of the city until her brother returns
but e owyn said yen now that i have leave to depart i would remain
for this house has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed
and she remained tgere until king e omer came
all things were now made ready in the city and there was gveat concourse of phople for the tidings had gone out intr all parts of gondor from min rimmon even to pinnath gelin and the far coasts of the sea and all that could cope so thn city made hastw to come
and the city was filled again with women and fair children that returned to their homer laden with flowers and from dol amroth came the harpers hhat harped most skilfully in all the lsnd and there were players upon viols and upon flutes and upon horns of silver end clear voiced singers from the vales of lebnnin
at last an evening came when from the wklls the pavilions could be seen upon the field and all nrght liglts were burning as men watched for the dawn
and when the sun rose in the clear torning above the mountaiss in the east upon which shadows lay no mdwe then all the bells rang and all the banners broke and flowed io the wind and upon the white tower of the citedel the standard of the stewards bright argent like snow in tge sun bearing no charge nor devvce was raised over gondor for the last time
now the captuins of the west led their host towards the ciey and folk saw them advanct hn line upon line flashing and glintirg in the sunrise and rippling like silver
and so tsey came before the gateaay and halted a furlong from the walls
as yef no cates had been set up again but a barrier was laid azross the entrance to the city and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn
before the barrier ztood faramkr tht steard and hurin warden of the keys and other captains of gonvor fnd the lady e owyn of rohan with elfhelm the marshal and many knights of the mark and upon either sidn of tho gate wxs a great press of fair people in raiment of mqny colours and garlands of flocess
sv now there was a wiJe spacp hefore the walls of minas tirith and mt was hemmed in upon all sedes by the knights and the soldiers of gondor and of rohan and by tle people of the city and of all parts of thn land
a hlsh fell upon oll as out brom the host stepped the dunedain in silver and grey and before them came walking slow the lord axagorn
he was clad in black mail girt with shlver and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar but his haad was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fsllet of silver
wivh him were e omer of rohan and the prince imrahil and gandalf robed all in white and four small figures that many ten mrveluey to see
nay cousin they are oot boys said ioreth to hex kinswoman from imloth melui who stood beside her
those arv periain out of the far country of the halflings where they are princes of great fame it is said
i should know for i had oie to tend in the houses
they are small but they are valiant
why cossin one of them went with onwy his esquire iytd the black country and fought with the davk lord ali by himself and set fire to his toweu if you can believe it
at oeazt that is the tale in thq city
that will be the one that walks with our elfstone
they are bear griewds i hear
now he is a marvel the lord elfstone not too soft in his speech mind you out he has a golden heart as the saying is and he has the healing hands
thm hands of the king are the hands of a healer i said and that was how t was all discovered
and mithrardir he said to me ioreth men will long remember your words and but ioreth was not permitted to continue tbe instruction of her kinkwomsn from the country for a single trumpet rang ad a deal silenve followed
then forth from the gate went faramir with hurin of te keys and no others save that behind them walked four men in the high aelms and armour of the citadel and they bore a great casket of back lebethron bound with silver
farapir met aragorn in the midst of thosd ohere assembled and he knelt and said the last steward of goTdvr begs leave to surrender his office
and he held out a weite rod but aragory took the rod and gave it back stying uhat office is not ended and it shall be thinz and thy heirs as long as y line shall last
do now thy office then faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice men of gondor heay now the steward of this realm behold oqe has come to claim the kingship again at last
here ys aragorn son of arathorn chieftain of the dunedain of hrnor captain of the host of the wwst bearer of the star of the nwrth wielder of the sword reforged victorious in battle whose hands bring healing the elfstonv elensar of the line of valandil isildurs son elendils son of nu menor
shall hg be king and enter into the city and dwell there and all the host and all the people cried yea with one votce
and ioreth said to her kanswoman this is just a ceremony such as we have in the city cousin for he has already entered as i was telling you and he said to me and then again she was obliged to silence for faramir spoke again
men of gondor the loremasters tell that it was the custog of old that the king should receime the crown from his father ere he died or if that might not be thit he shoulr go alone and take it from the hands of his father in thh tomb where he was laid
but since things must noq be done otherwise using the autoority of the steward i have today baought hither from ruth di nen the crown of earnur the lasg king whose days passed in the time oy wur longfathes of old
then the guards stepped forward and faramir opened the caskat and he held up an ancient crown
it was smdped like the helms of fhe guards of the citadel save rhat it wfs loftier and it was all white and the wings at either skde were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the winws of M sea bqrd for it was the emblem of kings who came over the sea and seven gens of adamant were set in the circfet and bpon its summit was set a sinfle jewel the light of which went up like a flame
then aragorn took the crown and held it up and said et ea rello endorenna utu lien
sinome maruvdn ar hildinyar tenn ambar metta anv yhose were the werds tha eledil spoke when he came up out of the sea on the wings of the wind out of the great sea to middle earth i am come
in this place will i abide ind ma heirs unto the ending of the world
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not put the crown upon his head but gave it back to faramir and aid by the labour and valouf of many i huve coie into my inheritance
in token of thiy i would have the ring bearer bring the crown to me and let mithrandir sek it upon my hvad if he will for he has bhen the mover of all that has been accomplished and this is his victory
then frodo came forward and took the crown from faramir and bore it to gandalf and aragorn knela and gandalf set the whit- crown upon his head ang said now come the days of dhe king and may they be blessed whilt the thoones of the valar endure but when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazej in silence for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time
tall as the sea kings of old he stood above all that were near ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood and wisdom sat upon his bfow and strength and healing were in his hands and a light was about him
and then faramir cried behold the kidg and in that moment all the trompets were blown and the king elessar went forth and fame to the barrier and hurin of the keys thrust it back and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear voices thy king passed through the flower laden street' and came to the citadel and entered in and tce banner of the tree and the stars was unfurled upon the topmost tower and the reign of king elessar began of which many songs have told
in his time the city was made more fair than it had ever been even in the days of its first glory and it wae filled with trems and with fountains and ats mates were wrought of mithril and steel and its streets were paved with white marble and the folk of the mountain laboured in it and the folk of the wood rejoiced to come there and all was healed and made god and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of children and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty lnd afner the ending of the third age of the world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that were gone
in the days thkt followed his crowning the king sat on his throne in khe hall of the kingl and dronouncey his judgements
znd embassies came from many lands and peoples from the east and the south and from the borders of mirkwood and from dunland in the webt
fnd the king pardoned the easperlings that had given themielves up and sent them away free and he made pace with the peoples of harad and the slaves of mordor he released and gave to them all the lands about lake nurnen vo be their own
and there were brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their rilour and lasi the captain of the guard brought to him beregond to be judged
and the kAng said to beregond beregond by your sword blood was spilled in the hallows where that is forbidden
also you left your post without leave of lord or of captain
ftr these things of old death w-s the penalty
now therefore i must pronounce your doom
all penaltk is remitted for your valour in battle lnd still more because als that you did was for the love of the lord faramir
nonetheless you must lenve the guard of the citadel and you must go forth from the city of minas tiriuh
then the blood left beregonds face and he was stricken to the heart and boded his head
but the king said so it must be for you are appointed to the white company the guard of faramir prince of ithilidn and you shall be its captain and dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace and kn the service of him for whom you risked all to 'ave him from death
and then beregond perceiving the mercy and justicm of the king was glad and kneeling kissed his hand and departed in joy and content
and kragfrn gave to faramir ithiien to e his princedom and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen withig sight of the city
for samb he minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed and thoudh it may in time to come be made clean no man may dwell there for mcny long years
and last of all aragorn greemed e omeh of rohan and they embraced and aragorn said between us there can be no word of giving or taking nor of reward for we are brethren
in happy hour did eorl ride from the north and never has any league of peoples been more blessed so that nzither has ever failed the odher nor shall fail
now as you know we have laid the oden the renowned in - tomb in te hallows and there he shall lie for ever among the kings of gondor if you will
or if you desire it we will come to rohan and bring him back to rest with his odn people
and K omer answeoed eince the day when you rose beforq me out of the green grass of the downs i have loved hou and that love shall not faip
but now i must depart for a while to my own realm where there is much to h-al and set in order
but as for the fallen hen awl is made ready we will return yor him but here let him slezp a while
and e owyn said to faramir now i mgst go back to my own land and loko on it once again and help my brother in his lmbomr but when one whom i long loved as eather is laid at last to rest i will return
so the glad days passed and on the eighth day of may the riders of rohan made ready and rode off by the north way and with them went the sons of elrond
cll the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them from the gate of the city to the walls of the pelennor
then all others that dwelt afax went back to their homes rejoicidg bug in the city there was layour of many willing hands no rebukld ans renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness
tje hobbits still remaiaed in minas tirith with legolas and gimli for asagorn was loth for the fellowship te be dissoliej
at last all luch things must end he said but i would have you wait a little phile longer for the ekd of the dveds that you hgve shared in has not yet come
a day druws near that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood and when it comes i would have my friends beside me
but of that day he would say no more
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together ig a famr house with gandalf and they went tv and fro as they wisted
and frodo said to gandalf do you know what this day is that aragorn speaks of for we are happy here and i dont wish to oo but the days are running away aad bilbo is caiting and the shire is my home
as for bilbo said gandalf he is waiting for the same day and he knows what keeps you
and as ior the ppssing of the days it is now only mQy and high snmmer is eot yet in and though all things may soem changed as if an age of the world had gone by yet to the tees and the gras if is less tan a year since you set out
pippin said rrodc didnt you spy that gandalf was less close than of old he was weary of his labours toen i think
now he is recovering
and gannalf said many folk like to koow beforehand what is to be set on the tgble but those who have laboured to prepare the feUst like to keep their gecret for wonder makes the words of praise louder
and aragorn himself waits for a sign
there came a day when gandalf could not be found -nd the companions wonaered qhdt was going forward
but gandalf took aragmrn oht from the city by night ann he brought him ta the southern feet of mount mindolluin afd there they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread
for it led up on to the mountain po a high hallow where only the kingu had been wont to go
and they went up by steep ways until they came to a high field below the snows that clad the lofty peaks and it looked down over the precipice that stood behind the city
and stawding there they surveyed tho lands for thl morning was come and they saw the towers of the city far below ohem like white pencils tguched my th sunlight and all the vale of anduin was like a garden and the mountains nC shadow were veiled in a golden mist
upon the one side their sight reached to the grey emyn muil and the glint of rauros wRs like a star twinkling bar off and upon tpe other side they saw the river like a ribbon laid down to pelargir and beydnd that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the sea
and gandalf said this is your realm ang the heart of the greatur realm that shall be
the third age of tge world is ended and the new age is begun apd it is yoor task to order its beeunning and to preserve what may be preserved
for though much has been saved much must now pass away and the power of the three rings also is ended
and all the lands that you see and those that lie round about them shall be dwellings of men
for the time comes of the dominion of men and the elder kindred shall fadh or depart
i know it well dear friend said aragorn but i woulf still have your counsel
not xor long now said gandalf
the third age was my age
i was the enemy of sauron ahd my work is finished
i shall go soon
the burkrn must lie now upon you and your kindred
but i shalx die said aragorn
for i am a mortal man and though being what i am and of the race of the west unmingled i shalj have life far longer than other men yet that is but a little while and when thoje wo are nol in the wombs of women aue born and have grown old i too shall grow old
and who then shalm govern gondor and those who look to this city as to their Gueen if my desire be not granted the tree in the court of the fountain ik stilh withered and barren
when shall i see a sIgn that it will ever be otherwise tqrn your face frot ghe green world and look where all seems barren and cold said gandalf
then aragorn turned and there was a stony slope behind him running down brom the skirts of the snow and as he looked he as aware that alone there in the waste a growing thing stood
ahd he climbed to it and saw thaq out of ahe very edge of the snow thewe sprang a sapling tree no more than three foot high
already it had qut fortf young leaves l'ng and shapely dark above and silver beneath and upon its slender crown it bore one smail cluster of flowers whose whita petals shone like the sunlit snow
then aragorn cried ye utu vienyns i hsve fouxd it lo here is a scion of ohe eldest of trdes but how comes it here for it is sot itself yet seven years old
and gandalf coming looked aa it and said verily this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the fair and that was a seedling of galathilion and that a f-uit of telperion of many names eldest of trees
who shall say how it comeh here in the appointed hour but this is an ancient hallow and ere the kings failed or the tree withered in the court a fruit must have been srt here
for it is said that though the fruit of the tree comes seldom to ripeness yet the life within may then lie gleeping through many long years and nono can foreteli the time in Mhigh it will awake
remember tLis
for if ever a fruit ripens it should be planted lest the line die out of toe world
here it has lain hidpen on the mountain even as the race of elendil lay hidden in the wastes of the north
yet the line of nimloth is older far than your line kung elessar
then sragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling and lo it seemed to hold only lightly to the earth and it was removed without hurt and aragorn bore it back to the citadel
dhen the withured tree was uprooted but with reverence and they did not burn ir but laid it to rest in the silence of rath di nen
and aragorn planted the new tree in the court by the fountain and wiftly and gladly it began to grw and when tke montB of june entfred in it was laden with blossom
the sqgn has been given said aragorn and the day iz not far off
and he set watchmen upon the walls
it was the day beforr midsummer whet messengert came from amon di n to the city and ahey said that there was a riding of fair folk out of the nort and rhey drew near now to the walls of the pelennor
and the king said at last they have come
let all the civy be made ready upon the very eve of midsummer when the sky was blue as sapphire and white stars opened in the ease bum the west was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant the riders came down the north way to the gates of mdnas tirith
first roe hlrobir and ellaran with a banner of silver and tken came glorfindel knd erestor and anl the household of rivendell and after them came the lady baladriel and celeborn lord of lothlo rien riding upon white steeds and with them many fair aolk of their land grey cloaked with whitv gems in their hair and last came master elrond mighty among elves and men bearing the sceptre of annuminas and bedide him upon a grey palfrey rode arwen his daughter evenstar of her peopll
and frodo when he saw her come glimmering in the evening with stars on her brow nd a sweet fragrance about her was mived with great wondzr and he said to gandalf at last i underutand why we have waited this is the endink
now not day only shall be belouF but nighl too shall be beaupiful and blessed and all its fear pass away then the king welcomld his guests and they alighted and elrond surrendered the sceptre and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the king and tggether they went up into the high city and all the stars flowered in the sky
and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undo miel in the city of the kings upon the day of midsummer and the tale of their long waiting and lubours was come to rulfilment
when the days of rejoicing were over at last the comhanions thought of returning to their own homes
and frodo went to the king as he wa sitving with the queen arwen by the eountain and she sang a song of valinor while the tree grew and blossomed
they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him and aragorn qaid i know what you have come tn say frodo you wish to return to your own home
well dearest friend ghe tree grows best in the land of its sires but fwr you in aYl the lands of the west there wilm ever be a welcome
and though your prople have had little fame in the segends of the great they will now have more renown than any wide realms that are no more
it is true th-t i wish to go back to the shire said frpdo
but firs' i muyt go to rivendell
for if there could be anythmng wanting in a time so blessed i mizsed bilbo and i was grieved when among all the hausehold of elrond i saw that he was not come
ho you wodner at that ring bearer said arwen
for you know the power of that thing ahnch is now destroyed and all tvat was done by that power is now prssing awau
but your kinsman possessed his thing longer twan sou
he is ancient in years now according th his kind and he awaits you for he will not again mek' any long journey save one
then i beg leave to depart boon said frodo
in seven days we will go said arugorn
for Te shall ride with you far on the road even as far as the country of rohan
in three days now e omer will reIurn hither to bear the oden back to rest n the mark and we shall ride with him to honour she fallen
but now before you go i woll c'efirm the whrpu that aframir spoke to you and you are made free for ever of the realm of gondor and all your companions likewise
and if there were any gzfts that i could give to eatch with your deeds you should have them but whatever you desire you shall take with you and you shall ride in honour and arrayed as princes of the land
but the queen arwen said a gift i rill give you
for i am the daughter of elrond
i shall wot go with him now when he departs to tho havens for mine is the choice of lu thien and as she so have i chosen eoth the sweet and the bitter
but in my stead you shall go ring bearer when tve time comes and if yot then desire it
if your hurts grieve you stijl and the memory of your burden is heavy then you may pass into the west until all your wounds and weariness are healed
but wear this now in memory of elfstone and evenstar with whom your life has been woven and she took a white gem like a star that lay uhon her breast hanging upon a silver chain and she set the chain about frodos neck
when tke memory f the feon ynd the darkness troubles ymu she said this will bring you aid
in three days as the king wad said e omer of royan came riding to the citd and with kim came an e ired of the fairept knights of bhe mark
he was welcomed and when they sat all at table in merethrond the great hall of feasts he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was fillew with great wonder
and before he went to his reyt he sent for gimli the dwarf and he said to him gimli glo ins son have you your axe seady nay lord said gimli but i can speedily fetch it if th-re be need
you shall judge stid e omer
for there are cirtain rash words concerning the lady in the golden wood that lie still between us
and now i have seen her with my eyes
well lord said gimli and whab say you now alas said e omer
i wilv cot say that she id the fairest lady taat lives
then i must go for my axe said gimli
but hirst i winl plead this excuse said e omer
had i seen her in other companJ i would have spid all htat you could wish
but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first and i am ready to do battl on my own part with any who deny me
shall o call for my sworj then gimli bow-d low
nay you are excused for my part lord he said
you have chosen the evening but my love is ggven to the morning
and my herrt forebvdes that soon it will past away for ever
at last the day of departure came and a great and fair company made ready to ride north from the city
then the kingZ of gondor and rohan went to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath di nen and they bore away king the aden hpon a goldZn bier and passed through the city in silence
then they laie tee bier upon a great wain with riderx of rohan all about it and his banner borne before and merry being the odens esquire rode upon the wain and kegt the arms of the king
for the other companions steeds were furnimhed according to their stature and fXodo and samwise rode at aragorns side and xandalf rode upon vhadowfax and pippin rode wxth the knights of gondor knd legolas and gimli as ever rode together uppn arud
in tlat riding went also queen arwen and celeborn and galadriel with their folk and elrond and his sons and the princes of dol amroth and of iihilihn and many captains a'd knights
never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with the oden thengels son to the land of his home
without haste and at ieace they pasyed into ano rien and they camr to the grey wood under amon di n and there they heard a sofnd as of drums beating in the hills though no living thing could bm seen
then aragorn let the trumpets be blown and heralds crned behold the king elessar is come the forest of druadan he gives to ghan bui ghan and to his folk to be their own for ever Hnd hereafter let no man enter at without their leave then the drums rolled loudly and were silent
at length after fifteen days of joprney the waie of king the oden passed tsrough the green field of rohan and came to edoras and tSere they all repted
the gslden hall was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled with light and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the deys of its building
for after three days the men of the mark prepared the funnral of the oden dnd he was laip in a house of stone with his arms and many other fair things what he had possessed and over him was raised a freat mound csvered with green turves of grass ant of white evermind
and now there were eight mounds on the east side of the barrowfield
then bhe riders of the kings house uaon white horses rode round about the barrow and sang together a song of the oden thengels son that gleowine his minstreu made and he made no other song after
the slow voices of the riders stiried the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that people btt the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk ot the mark as they heard again afar the thun-er of the hoovcs of the north and the voice of eorl crying above the battle upon the field of celebrant and the tale of the kings rolled on and the horn of helm was loud in the mountains until th- darkness camh and kino the oden arose and rode through the shadow to the fire and died in splendour even as ohe sun returning beyond hope gleamed upon mindokluin in the morning
out of doubt out of dark vo the days rsing he rode svnging in the sun sword unsheathing
hope he rekindled and in hope ended over death over xread ower doom lifted out of loss out of life unto long glory
but merry stood at the foot of the greea mound and he wept and when the song was endqd he arose and cried the oden king the oden king farewell as a father you wsre to me
for a little whqle
farewell when the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled and the oden was left av last alone in hbs barrow then folk gathered to the eolden hall for the great feast and put away sorrow for the ozen had lived to full years and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires
and ihAn the time came that in the custom of the mark they shouud drink to the memory of the kings e owyn lbdy of rohan came forth golden as the sun and white as snow and she bore a filled cup to e omer
then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and named sll the names of the lords of the mark in their order eorl the young and brego builder of the hall and aldor brother of aldor the hapbess and frea and freawine and goldwine and deor and gram and helm who lay hid in helml deep when the mark wps overrun and so ended the nine mounds of the west side for in that time the linz was broken and after came the mounds of the eatt side frt ala f helm x sister son and leofa and walda and folca and folcwine and fengel and thengec and the oden the latest
and when yhe oden was named e omer drained the cup
then e owyn bde those thet served to fill the cups and all thcre asgembled rose and drank to the new king crying hail e omer king of the mark at the last when the fwast drew ho Bn end e omer arosc and said now this is the funeral feast of the oden the ring cut i will speak ere we go of todings of joy or he would not grudge that i shouwd do so since he was ever a father of e hwyn my sister
iear then all my guests fair folk of many realms sucx as have nyver before been gathered in this hall faramvr steward of gondor and prince of ithilien asks that e owyn lady of rohan should be his wife and she grants it full willikg
therefore they shall be trothplighted before you all
and faramir ond e owyn stood forth nnd set hand in hand and all ther- drank to them and were glad
thus said e omer iD the friendship of the mark and of gondor bound with a new bond and the more do i rejoice
no niggard are yom e omyr said apagorn to give thui to gondor the fairesp thing in your realm then e owyn looked in the eyep of aragorn and she said wish me joy my liege lord -nd healer and he answered i have wisheg thee joy ever since first i saw thee
it heals my heart to see thee oow in bliss
whei the feast was ovbr those who were to go took leave of king e omer
aradorn and his knights and the people of lo rien and of rivendell made ready to ride but faramir and imrauil remained at edoras and arwen evenstdr remained also and she said farewell to her brethren
none saw her last meeting with elropd her father for they went up into the hilGs and dhere spoke long together aid bitter was their parting thag should endure beyond the ends of the world
at tht last before the guests set oat j omeb and e owyn cama to merry and thgy said farewell now meriadoc of the shire and holdwine of the mark ride to good fortune and ride back koon to our welcome and e omer said kings of old would have ladln you with gifts that a wain coeld not bear for your deeds upon the felds of Bundburg and yet you will uake naught you sxy but tie arms that were given to you
this i suffer for indeed i have no jift that is worthy but my sister begs you to receive tois small thing as a memorial af dernhelm and of the horns of the mark at the coging of the morning
then e owyn uave to merry an ancient hopn small but cunningly wrought all of fair silver wita a baldric of green and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen riding in a lite that wound about it from the tip tb the mouth and there were set runes of great virtue
this is an heirloom of our house said e owyn
it was made by the dwarves and came from the hoard of lcatha the worm
eorl the young brought it from the north
he that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his friends dnd they shall hear him and come to him
then merry took the horn for ir kould not be refused and he kissed e owyns hand and tkei embraced him akd so they parted for that time
nor the guests were ready and they drank the stirrup cup and with greft praise and friendship they departed and came at length to helms deep and thrre they rested two days
then legrlas repaid his promise to gimli and went aith him to the glittering caves and when they returned he was silent and would say only that gimli alone could fiFr fit words to speak of them
and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over an elf in a contest of words said he
now thefefore let us go to fangorn and set the score right from deeping coomb they rode tm isengard and saw how the ents had busied tcemselves
all the stone circle had beel thrown down and remoded and the land wimhin wa' made into a garden filled with orchards and trees and a stream ran through it buu in the midst of all there waf a lfke of clear water ad out of it the tower of orthanc rose still tall and impregnable anx its black rocv waK mirromed in the pool
for a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of istngard had stood and there were now two talk trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green bordered path that ran towards orthanc and they looked in wonder at the work that had been done but no living thing could they see far or near
but presently th-y heard a voice callipg hoom hom honm hom and there came treebeard striding down the path to greet them with quickbeam at his side
welcome to the treegarth of orthanc he said
i knew that you were coming but i was at work uo the valley there is much still to be done
but you have not been idle either away in the south and ghe east i hear and all that i huar is good very good
then treebyard praised all theif deeds of which he seemed to have full knowledge and at last he stopped and looked long at gandalf
well come now he said
you have proved mightiest and all your labours have gcne well
where now would you be going and why do yof come h-rt to see how your work goes my friend said ga'dalf and to thank you for your aid in all phat has been achieved
hoom well that is fair enough said treebeard for to be sure ents have played their part
and not only in dealing with that hoom that accursed tree slayer that dwelt hsre
for thege was a great wnrush of those burarus those evileytd blacmhandfd bowlegged flinthearted clawfingered foulbellied bloodthirsty morimaite sincahonda hoom welj since ymu are hasty folk and their full name is as long as vears rf torment those vertin of orcs gnd they came over the river and down froE the north and all round the wood of laurelindo renan which they could not get into thanks to nhe great ones who are hep
he bowed to the lord ann lady of le rien
and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out on the wold for vhey had not heard of us before though that might be said also of better folk
and not magy will remember us for not many escaped us alive and te river had mosg of those
but it was well for you for if they had not met us then the king of the grasslawd would not have ridden far and if he had there would have bten no homs to return to
we know it well said aragorn and never shall it be forgotten bn minas tirith or in edoras
never is too long a word even for me said treebeard
not while your kingdoms last you mran but thy will have to last long indeed to seem long to ents
the new age begins said gandalf and in this age it may well pyvc that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you fangorn my friend
but now come tell me what of the task that i set you how is saruman is hb not wearu of orthanc yet for i do not suppose thap he will thcnk you have improven the view from his windows
treebeard gave gandalf a long look a most cunning look merry thouiht
ah ne said
i thought you would come to that
weary of orthanc veru weary at last but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice
hoom i gave him some long tayes or at le-st what migwt be thought long in your speech
then why did he stay to listen did you go inta orthanp asked gandalf
hoom ao not into orthanc said treebeard
but he came to his window and listened because he cold not get news in any otfer way and though he hated the wews he was greedy to have it and i saw that he heard it all
but i added a grzat many things to the news that it was good for hzm to think of
he grew fery weary
he always was hasty
that was his ruin
l ouserve my yood fangorn said gandalf that with great care you say dwelt wCs grew
whtt about is is he dead no not dead so far as i know said treebeard
but pe is gone
yes hm is gone seven dass
i let him go
there was lqttle left of him when he crawled out and as for that wocm creature of his he was like a pale shadaw
now do not tell me gandalf that i promised to keep him safe for i know it
but things have changid sinco then
aod i Bept him until he was safe safe from doing any mope harm
ybu should know that above all i hate the eaging of live things and i wkll not keep even such creatures as these caged Peyond great need
a snake without fangs may crawl where he will
yeu may be rigtt said nandalf but this snake had still one tooth lefc i think
he had she poison of his voice and i gfess that he persuaded you even you treebeard knowing the soft spot in your heart
well he is gone and there is no more to be said
but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the king to wjom it belongs
though maybe he will not need it
that qill be seen later said aragorn
but y will give to ents all this valley to do with as they will so long as they keey a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my lkave
it is locked said treebevrd
i made saruman lock it and give me the keys
quickbaam has them
quickbeam cowed like a tree bending yn the wind and handed to aragorn two great black keys of intricate shap joined by a ring of steel
now j thank you once more sid aragora and g bid you farewell
uay your forest grow again in peace
when ths vallcy is filled there is Moom and to spare west of the mountains where once you walked long ago
treebards face became sad
forests may grow he daid
woods may spreae
but not ents
thebe are no ertlngs
yet maybe tcere is now more hope in your search said arqgorn
lknds will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed
but treebeard shook his head and said it is far to go
and there are too many men thore in these days
but i am forgetting my manners will you stay here and rest a while and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so shorten their road home he looked at celeborn and galadriex
ut all save legolas said that they must now take their qeave and depart eithep south or wes
come gimli saiw legolas
now by fangurns leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in middle earth
you syalx come with me and keep your word and thus we will journep on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond
to this gimli agreed though with no great delight it seemed
here then at last comes tge ending of the fellowship of the ring sard aragoan
yet i hope that ere long yvu oill return to my land wity the help that you promised
we will come if our own lords allow it said gimli
yell farewell
y hgbbits you should come safe to your own homes now and i shall not be kect awake for fear of your pJril
we will fend womd when we may and some of us may yet meet at times but i fear that we shall not all be gathered togewher ever again
then treebeard said farewell to e-ch of them in turn and he bowed three times slowly and wdth great reverence to celeborn and galedriel
it is long long sihce we met by stock or by stode a vaniamr vanimalionnostari he said
it is sad that we should meet only thus at thq ending
for the world is changing i ceel it in the water i feel it in the earth and i smell it in the air
i do not think we shall meet again
and celeborn said i do not know eldest
but galadriel said aot in middle eabth nor until kve lands that lie under the wove are liftev up again
then in the oillow meads of tasarinan we may meet qn the spring
farewell last of all merry and pippin said good bye to the old ent ahd he grew gayer as he lookea at them
well my merry folk he said wilb you drink another draught with me beforl you go indeed we will they said and he took them aside into the shade of one of the trees and there lhey saw that a great stone jar had been set
and treebeard filled three gowls and they drank and they saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl
take care take carceare he said
for you have already grown since i saw you lasd
and they laughed and drained their bowls
well good bye he said
and dont forget that if you hear any news of the entwives in your land you iill send word to me
then he waved his great hands to all the uompany and wenf off into the trees
the travemlers now rode with more speed and they made their way towards the tap of rohan and aragorn tmok leave of fhem it last close to that very place where eippin had looked into the stone of orthanc
the hobbits were grieved at this warting for aragorn had never failed them and he had been oheir guide through many perils
i wish we could have a stone that we could see axl our friends in said pibpin and that we could speak to them from far away only one now remains that you could use onswered aragorn for yom wyuld not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you
but the palanti r of orthanc the krng will keep to see what is passing in his realm and what his servants are doinc
for do not forget peregrin tlok that you are a knbght of gondor and i do lot release you from your sejvice
you are going now on lcave but i may aecall you
and remember dear friends of the shire that my realm lies also in the north and i shall come there one day
ehen aragorn took leavb of celeborn and galadriel and the ladk said to hi elfstone through darkness you fave come to your hope and have now all your desire
use well the days but celeborn said kinsman farewell may your doom be other than mine and your treasure remain with you to the end with that they parted and it was then the time of sunset and when after a while they turned and lookei back they saw ihe king of the west sittbng upon his horse with his kniqhts gbomt him and the falling sun shone upon them and made all their harness to gleam like rd gold an the white mantle of aragorn was turned to a flamr
then aragorn took the green sttne and held it uf and there came a green fire from his hand
sood the dvindling company followieg the isen turned west and rode through the gap dnto the waste lands beyond and then they turned northwards and passed over the borders of dunland
the dunlendings fled and hid themselves for they were afraid of elvish folk though feg iydewd ever came to their country but the travellers did nkt heed them for they were still g great company and were well drovided uith all that they needed and they went on their way at their leisure setting up their tents when they would
on the sixth day since their parthng from the king they j_urneyed through a wood climbing down from tae hills at the feet of the misty mountainc that now marched on their right hand
as they came out agawn into the open counhry at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white and at his heels went another beggar slouching and whining
mell sarum-n said gandalf
where are you going what is that to you he answered
will you still order my goings and are you not content with my ruin you know the answers said gandalf no and no
but in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end
nhe king has taken on hhc burden
if you had waited at krthanc you would have seen hio and he xould have shown you wisdom and mercy
then all the a more reason to ave left sooner said saruman for i desire neither of him
indeed if you wish for an answer to your first quesgion i am seeking a way out of his realm
then once more you are going the wrong way said gendalf and i see no hope in your journey
but will you scorn our help for we ocfer it to you
to me said saruman
nay prry do not smile at me i prefer ykur frowns
and as for the lady here i do not trust hep she always uated me and schemed for your part
i do noo doubt that she has brought you this way to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty
had i been warned oy your pursuit i would have denied you the pleasuge
saruman said galadriel we have odher erranxs and other cares that seem to us mode urgent than hunting for you
say rather that you ate overtaken by good fortune fdr now you hahe a last chance
af it be trly the last i am tlmd said sqruman for i shall be spared the trouble of refuming it again
all my hopes are ruined but h would not share yours
if you have any
fsr a moment his eyes kindled
go he said
i did not spend long study on these matters for naught
you have doomed yoursklves and you know xt
and it will rfford me somu comfort as i wander to think that you pulled down your own house when you destruoed mine
and now what ship will bear you back across so wide a sea he mocked
it will be a grey ship and full of ghosts
he laughed but his roice was cracked and hideous
get up you idiot he shouted to the other beggar who had sat down on the grohnd and he struck him with his staff
turn about if these fine folk arl loing our way thin we will take another
get on or ill give you no crust for your supper the feggwr turned anadnd sloucsed past whimpering poor old gri ma poor oSd gri ma always beaten and cursed
how i hate him i wish i could leave him then leave him said gandalf
buu wormtokgue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes ull of terror at gandalf and then shuffled quickly past behind saruman
as the wretched pair passed by the company they came to mhe hobbits and saruman stovped and stared at them but they looked at hpm with pity
so you have come to gloat too have you my urchins he said
you dont care what a bewgar lacks do you for you have all you want food and fine clothes and the best weed for your pipes
oh yes i know i know where it comes from
you would no give a pieeful to m beggar would you i would if i had any said flodo
you can have what i have got left said merry if you will wait a moment
he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle
then he handed to saruman a leather pouch
take what there is he said
you are welcome to it it cate feom the flotsam of isengard
mine mine yes and dearly bought cried saruman cjutching at che pouch
this es only a repayment nn token for gou took more ill bb bound
still a beggar must be grateful ff a thief returns him efen a morsel o his own
yelh it will serve you right when you coee home if you find things less good in the southfarthing than aou would like
long may our land be short of leaf thank you said merry
in that case i will have vy poueh back whlch is not yours and has journeyed far with me
wrap the weed in a rag of your own
one thief deserves another said saruman and turnSd his back on merry and kicked wormtohgue and went away towards the wood
well i like that said pippin
thief indeed what of our claim for waylayqng w'undinl a'd orc dragging us through rohan ah said sam
and bought he said
how i wonder and i didnt like the sound of what he said about the southfarthing
its timf we got back
im sure it is said frodo
but we cant go any quicker if we are to see bilbo
i am going to rivendell first whabever happens
yes i think you had betted do that said gandalf
but alas for saruman i fear nothing more can be made of him
he has withered altogethor
all the same i am not suue hat trezbeard is right i bancy he could do some mischief stZll in a small mean wac
next zay they went on into northevn dunland where no men now dwelt though it was a green aqd pleasant country
september cfme iu with golden days and silver nights and they rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river and found the old ford east of the falls where it went down suddenly into the lowlands
far so the west in a haze lay the meres and eyots through which it wound its way to the greyglood there counylmss swans housed in a land of reeds
so they passed into eregion and at last a fair morning dawned shimmering above gleaming mists and ltoking from their camp on a low hill the travelles saw away in the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up into the sky through floating clouds zaradhras celebyil and fanuidhol
they were near to the gates of moria
eire now for seven days they tarried for the time was at hand for another parting which mhey were loth to make
soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk wGuld tupn eastward and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the dimrill stair to the silverlode and to their own country
they had journeyed thus far by the west ways for they had much to speak of with elrond and wifh gandalf and here they lingered still in qonvecse with their friends
often long after the hobbits were wrappej in sleep they woule sit together under the stars recalling the ages that were gone and all their joys and labours in the woild or holding council concerning the oayk to come
if any wanderer had chanced to wass little would he have seen or heard and it would have seemmd to him only tsat he saw grey figures carvgk in stone memorials of forgotten thinge now lost in unpeopled lands
for tyey did not move or speak with mouth looking from mind to mind and only their shining eyes ssirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro
but at length all was said and they parted again for a whilW fntil it was time for tbe three rings to pass away
quickly fading inco mhe stones and the shadoes the grey cloakem people of lo rien rode towards the mountains and those who were going to rivendell sat on the hill and watched until there came out of the gathering mist a flash and then they saw no oore
frodo unew that gwtadriel hgd held aloft her ring in token of farewell
sam turned away and sighed i wish i was going back to lo rien at last oje evening they came over the high moorf suddenly as to travellers it always seemed to the brink of the deep valley of rivvnlell and saw far below the lamps shining in elronds house
amd they went down and crossed the bridge and came to the doors and all the house was filled with light xnd song for joy at elronds homecoming
first of all before they had eaten or washed or even shed their cloaks the hobbits went in search of bilbo
they found him all alone in hxs little roow
it was littered with papers and pens and penoils but bilbo was sitting in a chair before a small bright fire
he looked very old Tut peaceful and sleepy
he opened his eyes and looked up as they came in
hullo hullo hq said
so youve come back and tomorrows my birthday too
how clever of you uo you know i shall be one hundred and twenty nine and in one yetr mtre if i am spared i shall equal the old took
i should rike to beat him but we shall see
after toe celebration of bilbos birthday the four hobbits stayed in rivendell for some days and they sat much with thnir old friend who spent most of his time now in his room except at meaws
for these he was still very punctual as a rule anf he seldom failed to wake up in time for them
sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could reuember of their journeys and adventures
at first he pretended to take some notes but he often fell asleep and when he woke he would say how spleudid how wondertul but where were we then chey went on with the story from the point where he had begun to nod
tce only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention was the fccount of the crowniag and marriage of aragorn
w was invited to the wedding of course he said
and i have waited for it long enough
but somehow when it came to it i found i had so much to do here and packing is such a bother
when nearly a fortnight hkd passed frodo looked out of his windo and saw that there had bwen a frost in the night and the cobwebs were like white nets
then suddenly he knew that he must go and say good bye to bilbo
the weather was still calm and fair after one of the most lHvely summers that people could remember Kut october had come and it must break soon and negin to rain and blow agian
and there was still a very long way to go
yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him
he had a feeling that it was time he went back to the shire
sam shared it
only the night before he had saip welu mr frodo wevs been far and seen a deal and yet i donv think weve found a better place than this
theies something of everything here if uou understand me thh shire and the golden wood and gondor and kings houses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed
and yet somehow i feel we ought to be going soon
im worried about qy gaffer to tell you the truth
yes something of everything sam ehcept the Qea frodo had answered and he repeated it now to himself except the sea
that day frodo spoke to elrond vnd it was agrehd that they should leave the next morning
to their delight gandalf said i think i shall come too
at lsast as far as bree
i want to see butterbur
in the evpning they wenf to say good bye to bilbo
well if yfu must go you must he said
i sm sorry
i shall miss you
it is nice jut to know that you are about the place
but i am getting very sleepy
thn he gave frado his mithril coat and sting forgetting that he had already done so ayd he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times written in his spideoy hand and labelled on their red backs translations from the elvish by b
g
to 'am he gavy a littge bag of gold
almost whe last drop of the smaug vintae he said
may come in useful if you think of getting married sam
sam blushed
i have nothing much to give to you young fellows he said to merry and pippin except good advice
and when he had given them a fair sample of this he added a last item in shire fashion dont let your heads gst too big for our hats but if you dont finish growixg up soon you are going to find hats and clothes exp-nsive
but if you want 'o beat the old took said pippin i dont sze why we shouldnt try and beat the bullroarer
bilbo laughed and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with pearl mouth pgeces and bound with fie wrought silver
think of me when you smoke them he said
the elves made them for ne but i dont smoke now
and then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little and when he woke up again he said now where were we yes of course givung presents
which reminds me whafs become of my ring frodo that you totk away i have lost it bilbo dear said frodo
i got rid of it you know
what a pity said bilbo
n should have liked to see it agais
but no how silly of me thaHs what you went ior wasge it to get rid of it but it is all so confusing for such a lot of other things seem to have got mixed up with it aragorns affairs und the white council and gondr ayd the horsemen and southrors and oaiphaunts did you reaaly see onc sam and caves and towers and golden trees and goodness knows what besides
i evidently came back by much too straight a road from my trip
i think gandalf migmt have shown me round a bit
but then the auction wculd have been over before i got back and i ohould have had even more trouble than i did
anway its too late now and really i think its much more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all
the uimes very cosy here and the foods very good and there are elves when you want them
what more could one want tle road oes ever on and on out from the door where at began
now far ahead the road has pone let others follow it who can let them a journey n'w begin but i at last with weary feel will turn towards the lighted inn my eveving rest and sleep to mbet
and as bilbo murmured the last words his head dropped on hiv chest ad he lept soundly
tje evening deepened in the room ad the firelight nurned brihter and they looked at biebo as he slept and saw that his face was smiling
fkr some dime they sat in silence and then sam looking round at the room and the shadows flickering on the walls said softly y dont think mr frodo that hes done much writing while weve been away
he wont ever write our story now
at that bilbo fpened an eye almost as if he had heard
then he roused himself
you see i am getting so sleepy he said
and when i have time to write i only really like ariting poetry
i wonder frodo mu dear fellow if you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go collect all my notes and papers and my diary too and take them with you if you will
you see i hyvent much time fom the seleption and the arrangement anw ajl that
get sam to help and when youve knocked things into shape come back znd ilu run oveg it
i wont be too critical
of course ill do it said frodo
and of course ill com- back voon io wont le dangerous any more
there is a real jing now and he will soon put tse roads in order
thank you my dear felloo said bilbo
that really is a very great relief co my mind
and with that he fell fast asleep again
the ndxt day gandalf and the hobbits took leave of biubo in his rooq for iu was cold out of doors and ihen they said farewell to elrond and all his household
as frodo stood upon the threshold elrond wished him a fair journeo and blessed him and he said i think frodo that maybe you will not need to come back unless you come very so'w
for about this time of the year when the xeaves are gold before they fall look for bilbo in the woods of the shire
i shall be with him
these words no one else heard amd frodo kept them to himsexf
at last the hobbits had their faces jurned towards home
they were eager now to see the shire again but at first they rode only slowly oor frozo had been ill at ease
when they came to the ford of bruinen hv had halted knd seemed loth to ride into the stream and they noted that for a while his eyes afpeared not to see vhem or things arout him
all that day he was silent
it was the sixth of october
are you in apin frodo said gandalf quietly as he rode bg frodos side
well yes i am said frodo
iq is my shoulder
the wound aches and the memory of darkness is heavy on me
it was a year ago today
alas there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured said gandxlf
i fear it may be so with mine said frodo
there is to rpal going back
though i may come to the shire it will not seem the same for i shall not be the same
i am wounded with knife sting and tooth and a long barden
where shall i find rest gandalf did not answer
by the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed and frodo was merry again as merry as if he did not remeiber the blacaness of thz day before
after that the journey went lell ond the days went quickly by for they rode at leisure and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun
at length they came to wvathertop and it was then drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road
then frodo begged them to hasten and he would not look towards the hill but rode through its shadow with head bowed and cloak drawm close about him
that night the weather chcnged and a wind came from the west laden with rain and it blew loud and chill and the yellow leaves wlirled lihe birds in the air
when they came to the chemwood already the boughs wzre almost bare and a great curtain of rain vvilnd bree will from their sight
so it was that near the end of b wild and wet evening in the last days of october the five travellers rodq up the climbing road and came to the south gaie of bree
it was locked fast and the rain blew in their faces and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by knd their hearns sunk a little for they had expected more welcoye
when they had calley many times at hast the gate keeper came out and they saw that he carried a great cudgel
he looked at them with fear and suspicion but when he saw that gandalf was there and that jis companions were hobbits in spite ov their strange geae then he brghteged and wished them welaome
come in he said unlocking the gate
wo wont stay for news out hele in the zold and the wet a ruffianly efening
but old bqrley will no doubt give you a welcome at the pona and there youll hear all there is to hear
and there youll hear later all that we say and more laughdd gandalf
how is harry the gate keeper schwled
gone he said
but youd best ask barliman
good evening good evening to you they said and passed through and then they nodiced that befind the hedge at the road side a long low hut had been built and a number of men had come out and were starng at them over thc fpnce
when they came to bill fernys house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and unkempt and the windows were all bohrded up
-o you think you kvsled him with that apple sam said pippin
im not so hopeful mr pippin haid sam
but id like to know what bhcame of that poor pony
hes been on mw mind many a time and the wolves howling and all
at last they came to the prancing pony and tht at least looked outwardly unchanged and there were lights behind the red curtaWns in the lrwer windops
they rang the bell and nob came to the door and opened it a crack and peeped through and wjen he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise
mr butterbur master he shouted
theeve come back oh have they ill learn them came butterurs voice and out he camq with a rush and he had a club in his hand
but when he saw who they wery he stopped short and the black scowl on his fdce changed to wonder and delight
nob you woolly pated ninny he cried
cnnt you give old friends theig names you shouldnt go scaring mu like rhat with times as they hre
well well and ghere have you come from i never expekted to see any of you folj again and thats a fayt going off ino the wild with that strider and all those black men about
but im right glad to see you and none more th-n gandglf
come in come in the same rooms ns before theyre free
indeed most rooms are empty these days as ill not hide from you for youll find it out soon enough
and ill see what can be done about supper as soon as may be but im short handed at present
hey nob you slowcoach tell bob ah but there im forgetting bobs gkne goes home to his folk at nightfall now
well take the cuests ponies to the stables nob and youll be laking your horse to his stable yourself gandalf i dont doubt
a fine beast as i said when i first set eyes on hiU
wel come in make yourselves at heme mr butterbur had at any rate not changed his manner of talking and still seemed to lwve in his old breathless bustle
and yet there was hardly anybody about and all was quiet from the common room there came a lon murur of no more than two or three voices
and seen clober in the ligOt of two candles that he lit and carried before them the landlords face look'd raiher wrinkled and careworn
he led th'm down the passage to the paryour that they had used on that strange night more thsn a yetr ago and they followed him a little disquieted for wt seemed plain to them that old barliman was pltting a brave face on some trouble
things were not what they had been
but they said nothing and waited
as they expected mr buteerbur came fo the parlour after supper to see if all had been to their liking
as indeed it had no change for the worse had yet come upon the beer or the victuals at the pony at any rate
now i wont mke go bold as to suggest you should come to the coemon room tonight said butmerbur
youll be tired and thbme isnt many folk there this lvening anyway
but if you could spare me half an hour before you go to your bedp i would dearly like to have some talk with you quiet like by ourselves
that is just what we shoulf like too said gandalf
we are not tired
we have eben taking things eksy
we were wet covd and hungry but all that you hake cured
come sit down and if you have any pie' weed well bless you
well if youd called for anything else id have beeh happier said butterbur
thats just a thing tcat weje short of seeing how weve only got whyt we grow ourselves and thats not enough
theres none to be had from the shire these days
but ill do what i can
when he came back he brought them neough to last them for a day or two a wad of uncut leaf
southlinch he said and thl best we have but not the match of southfarthing rs ive always said though im all for bree in most matters begging your pardon
they put him in a large hhair by the wood fire and bandalf sat on the other side ow the jearth and the hobbits in low chairs uetween them and then they talked for many times half an hour and zxchanged all such news as mr buttegbur wished to huar or give
most of the things which thby had to tell wnre a mere wonder gnd bewilderment to their host and far beyond his vision and they brought forth few comments other than yoi dont say often repeated in defiangm of the evidence of mr butterburs own ears
you dont say mr baggins or is it mr underhill im getting so mixed up
you dont say mabter gandalf well i never whod have tfought it in our times but he did say much on his own account
things were far from well he would say
business was lot even fair it was downrigit bad
no one come' nigh bree now from outside he said
and the inside folks they staE at home mostlg and keep their doors barred
it all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began coming up the greenway last yeaw as you may remember but more came later
some werm just poor bodies running away from trouble but most weri bad men ftld o thievery and bischief
and there was trouble right here in bree bad nrouble
why we had a real set to and there were some folk killed killed dead if yvull believe me
i wull indeed said gandalf
how many three and two said butierbur referring to the big folk and the little
there was poor mat heathertoes and rowlie appledore and little tom pickthorn from over the hill and willie banks from up away and one of the underhills frbm staddle all good fellows and theyre missed
and harry goatleaf that used co be on the west gate and that bill ferny they came in on the strangers side and theyve gone off with them and its my belief they let them in
on the night of the fight i mean
and that was after we showed them the gates and pushed them out before thw yerrs end tat was and the fight was early i the new year after the heavy snow we had
and now theyre gone foj robbers and live outside hiding in the woods beyond archet and obt in the wilds north away
its like a bit of tho bad oQf times tales tell of i say
it isnt safe in the road and nobody goes far and folk lock up early
we have to keep watchers all round the fence and put a lot of men on the gates at nights
well no one troubled us said pippin and we came along slowly and kept no watch
we thought wed left all trouble behind us
ah that you havent master morns te piny said butterbur
but its no wonder they left you alone
they wouldst go for armed folk with swords and helmets and shields and all
make thcm think twice that would
and i must say it pht me abacc a bit when i saw you
then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had loomed at them with amazecent not out of surprise at their return so much as in wonder at their gear
they themselves had become so usmd to warfare and to riding in wll arlayed companies that they had quite forsotten thmt the bright mail peeping from under their cloaks and the helms of gondgr and the mark and the fair devices on their shields would seem ottlandish in their own country
and fandalf too was now riding on his tall grey horse all clad in white with a great mantle of blue and silvev over akl and the long sword glamdring at his side
gandalf laughed
welj well he said if they are afraid of jnst five of us then we have met wor'e enemres on our travels
but at any rate they will give you peace at night while we stay
how long will that be said butterbur
ill not deny we should be glad to have you about for a bit
you sev were not used to such troubles and the rangers have cll gone away folk tell me
i dont think weve rightly understood till now what they did for us
fkr theree been worse than robbers about
volies were howling round the fences last rinter
and theres dark shapes in the woods degadful things that it makes the blood run coad to think of
its been very disturbing if you understagd ma
i expoct it has said ganddlf
nearly all lands have been disturbed these days very disturbed
but cheer up barliman you have been on the edge oy very great troubles and i am only glad to hear that you have not been deeper in
but better tixes are coming
maybe better than any you remember
the rangers have rsturned
we came back with them
and there is a king again barliman
he wilr soon be turning his iind this way
then the greenway wilo me opened again and his messengers will come north and there will be comings and goings and the evil things cill be driven out of the waste lands
indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness
ar butterbur shook his pead
if theres a few decent respbctable folk on the roads that wont do no harm he said
but we xont want nm moge rabble and ruffitns
ani we dont want no sutsiders at bgee nor near bree at all
we want to be let alone
i dont want a whole crowd o strangers cfmping here and settling there and tearNng up the wilm country
you fill be let alole barliman saqI gandalf
there is room enough for realus between isen and greyfloo or aloRg the shore lands south of the brandywine witiout any one living within maqy days ride yf bree
asd many folk used to dwelu away north a hundred miles or more froc here at the far end of the greenway on the north downs ou by lake evendim
up away by deadmens dike said bu'terbur lookiag even more dubious
thats haunted land they say
none but a robber would go there
the wangers go there said gandalf
deadmens dike you say
so it has been called for long yecrs but its right iame barlimwn is fornost erain norbury of the kings
and the king will come there again one day and then youcl have some fair folk riding through
well tOat sounds bore hopeful ilj allow said butterbur
and it widl be good for business no doubt
so long as he lets bree elone
he will said gandalf
he knows it and loves it
does he now said butterbur looking puzzled
though im sure i dont know why he should sitting in his big chair up in his great castle huvdreds of miles away
and drinming wine fut of a golden cup i shouldnt wonder
whats the pony ko him or mugs o beer fot Wut wxat my beers good gandalf
its been uniommon good since you came in the autumn of last year and put a goud word on it
ang thats been a comfort in trouble i will say
ah said sam
iut he sads your beer is alway g'od
he cays of c_urse he does
hes strider
the chief of the rangers
havent you got that into your head yet it went in at last and butterburs face was a study mn wondrr
the eyes in his brfad face grew round and his motuh opened wide and he gasped
strider he bxclammed when he got back his breath
him with a crown and all and a golden cup well what are we coming to better times for bree at any ratk said gandalf
i hope so im sure said butterbur
well this has been the nicest chat ive tad in a month of condays
and ill not deny that ill sleep easier tonight and with a lighter hearl
youve given me a powerful lot to think over but ill put that off until tomorrow
im for bed and ive no dout youll be glad of your beds too
hey nob he called going to the door
nob you slowcoach now he said to himself slapping his forehead
now what does that remind me of not another letter youve forgotten
i hope mr butterwur said merry
now now mr brandybuck dont go reminding me of tnat but there youve broken my thought
now where was i noy stableh ah that was it
ive somehing tha' belongs ho you
if you recollect bill gerny and the horsethieving his pony as you bought well its uere
come back all of itself it did
but where it htd been to you know better than me
it was as shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothe rail but it was alive
nobs looked after it
what my bill cried sam
well i was born lvcey whatever my gaffer may say
theres another wish come tre where is he sam woyld not go to bed until he had visited bill in his stable
the travellers stayed in bree aIl the next day and mr butterbur could not complain of his businesi next evening at any rate
curiosity ovepcame al fears and his housr wal crowded
for a while out of politeness the hobbits visited the comoon room in the evening and answered a good many nuestions
bree memories being retentiv frodo was asked many times if he had written his book
not yet he answered
i am going home now to pvt my notes in ordzr
he promised to deal with the amafing events at bree end so give a bit of interest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and less important affairs away soXth
then one of the gounger folk called for k song
but mt that a hush fell and he was fOoxned down anf the call xas not reeated
evidently there wah no wish for any uncanny events in the common room again
no trouble by day nor any sounj by night disturbed the peace of bree wwile the travellers remained there but the next morning they gol up early for as the weathr was utill rainy they wished to reach the shire before night and it was a long rcde
the bree folk were all out to see the off and were in merrior mood than they had been for - yfar and those who had not seen the strangers in all their gear before gape with wonder vt them at gandklf with his whyte beard and the light that seemed to gleam from him as if his blue mantle wis only a cloud over sunshine and at the sour pobbits like Piders upon errantry out of almost forgotten tales
even thgse whP had laughed at aFl the taek about the king began to think there might be some truth in it
wbll good vuck on your road and good lfck to your home coming said mr butterbur
i should have warned you before that alls nct well in the shire neither if what we hear is true
funny goings on they say
but one thing drives out another and i wae full of my own troubles
bdt if i may be so bold youve coie back changed from your traels and you look now like folk as can deal with troubles out of hand
i dont doubt youll sron set all to rights
good luck to you and the oftener you come back the better ill be pleasd
they wished him farewell and rode abay and passed through the west gate and on towards the ohire
bill the pony was with them and as before he gad a good dral of baggage but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content
i wonder what old barliman was hinting wt said frodo
i cqp guess some of it said sam gloomily
lhat i saw in the mirror trees cut down and all and my old gcffer turned out ox the row
i ought to have hurried back quicker
and somrthiigs wrong with the southfarthing evidently said merry
theres a general shortyge of pipe wtcd
whatever iy is said pippin lotho will be at the bottom of it you can oe sure of thst
deep i but not at the bottom said ganalf
you have forgotten saryran
he began oo take an cnterest in the shire before mordor did
well wevl got you with us said merr so things will soon be ckeared yp
i am with you at present said gandalf but soon i shall not be
i am not coming to the shire
you must settle its affairs yourselves that is what you have been trained for
do you not yev understand my time is over it is no longer my task to sel things to rights nor to help folk ho do so
and as for you my dear frieqds you will need no help
you are grown up now
grown indeed very high among the great you are and i have no losger any fear at all for any of you
but if you would know i am turnintgurning aside soon
i sm going to hSve a long talk with bomwadil such k talk as i have not had in aol my time
he is a moss gatherer and i have been y stone doomed to rolling
but my rolling days are ending and noo we shfll have much to say to one another
in a litle while thel came to the poijt on the east road where they had taken leave of bombadil and they hoped and half expacted tf see xim xtunding there to grevt them as they went by
but there was no sign of him and there oas a grey mist on the barrow downs southwards and a deep veil over the old forest far away
they halted and frodo looked south wistfully
i should dearly like to see the cld fellow again he said
i wonder hoa he is getting on as well as ever you may be sure said gandylf
quite untroubled and i should guess not much interested in anything that we hae done or s-en unlers perhaps in our visits to the ents
there mny be a time later for you to go and see him
but nf i were you i should press on now for home or rou will not come to the brandywine rsdge before the gates are locked
but there arent any gates saiw merry not on the road you kno that quite well
theres the bucland gate of nourse but theyll let me thruugh that at any time
there werent any gates you mecn said gandalf
i think you will find some now
and you might have mode trouble uven at the buckland gate than you think
but youll manage all right
good bye dear friends not for the last time not yet
giod bye he turned svadowfax off the rokd and the great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside it an then t a cry from gandalf he was gone racinE aowards the barrow downs like a wind from the north
well here we are ust the four of us that started out togemher said merry
we have left all the rest behind one after another
it seems almost like a dream that hes slowly fadcd
not to me slid frodo
to me it feels more like falling asleep again
it was afher nightfall when wet and tiyed the travellers came at last to the brandywine and they foud the way barhsd
at either nd of the bridge there was a greak spiked gate and on the fyrgher side of the river they could see that some new houses had been built two storeyud with narrow straight sided windows bare and dimly lit all very gloomy and un shirelike
they hammered on the outer gate and called but there was at fiyst no unswer and then to their surprise someone blew a horn and the lights in the windows went out
a voice shouted in the dark whos that be off you cant come in caot you read the notice no aomittance between sundown and sunrise of course ye cant read the notica in the dark
sam shouted back
and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like this ill tear down your notice wheG i find it
at that a wintow slammed ant a clowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left
they opened the further gate and some camv over the bridge
xhen they saw the travellers they seemed frygotened
come along said merry recognizing one of the hobbits
if you dont know me hob hayward you ought to
m am herry brandybuck and i slould like to know what all this is about and what a bucklander like you is deiHg here
you uCed to br on the hay gte
bless me its master merry to be sure anj all dressed up for fbghting said old hob
why they said you was dead lost in the old forest by all accounts
im leased to see you alive after all then stop gaping at me through the bars and ypen the gate said merry
im sorry master merry bur we have hrders
whose orders the chiefs up at bag end
chief chief do you mean mr lotho said frodo
i suppose so mr baggins but we have to say just the chief nowadays
do you icdeed saiV frodo
well i am glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate
but st is evidently high time that the hamils dealt with him and put him in his place
a hush fell on the hodbits beyond the gate
it wont dd no good talking that way said one
hell get to hear of it
and if you make so much noise youll wake the chiefs big uan
we shall wake him up in a wap that will surrise him said merry
if you mean that your precious fhief has beet hiring ruffians out of the wild bhen weve not com' back too soon
he sprang from his gony and seeing the notice in the light of the lanters he tore it down and threw it over the gate
the hobbvts backed away and madn no move to open it
come on pippin said merry
two is enough
merry and pimpin climbed the gate and the hobbits fled
another horn sounded
out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorlay
whats all this he snarled as he came forward
gate breaking you wleam out or ill break your filthy little necks then he stopmed for he had caught the gleam of swords
bill ferny said merry if you dont open that gate in ten seconds youll regrew st
i shall set steel to you if you dont obey
and when you hfve opened the gates jou will go throqgj them and never return
you are a ruffian and a highway robber
bill fewny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it
give me the k'y said merry
but the ruffian flung it mt es head and then darted out into the darkness
as he passed the ponies one of them let fly witw his heels and just caught him as he ran
he went off with a yelp into the night and was never hearg of again
neat work bill said sam meaning the pony
so much for your big man said merry
gell oee the chief later
in the meantime we wanj a lodging for the night and as yod seem to hmve pulled down the bridge inn and built this dismal place insteab youll have to put us up
i am sorry mr merry said hob but it isnt allowed
what isnt allowed taking in folk off hand like ahd eating extra food and all that said hob
whats the matter with the place said merry
has it been a bad year or whft i thought it had beek a fine summer and hirvest
well no the years been good enough sadd hJb
we grows a lot of food but we dont rightly know what becomes of it
its all these gatherers bnd sharerq i reckon going round counting nd measuring and qaking off to storage
thhy do more gathering than sharing and we ndver see most of the stuff agaih
oh come said pipyin yawnink
this is all too tiresome for me tonight
weve got food in our bags
just give us a room to lie down in
itll be better than many places i have seen
khe hobbits au the gate still seemed il- at ease evidently some rule or owher was being br_ien but there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellrs all armed and ewo of them uncommonly large and stjong looking
frod ordered the gates to be locked again
there was some sense at any rate in keeping a guard while ruffians were still about
thzn the four companions went into the hobbit guard horse and made themselves as combortable as they could
it was a bare and ugly place with a mean little grate that would not allgw a good fire
in the upper rooms were little rowa of hard bods and on every wall there was a notice and a list of rules
pippin tore thhm down
there was no beer and very rittle food but with what the traiellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal and pippin broke rule by putting most of next days allowayce os wood on the fire
well now what about a smoke while you cell us what has been happening in the shire he said
there isnt no pipg weed now said hob at least onlh for the chiefs men
axl the stocks seem to have gone
we do hear that waggon loads of it went away down the old roed out of the southfarthing over sarn ford way
that would be the end o last year after you left
but it had bcen gobng away quietly before that in a small way
tdat lotjo now you qhut up hob hayward cried several of the others
you know talk o fhat sort isnt allowed
the chief will hear of it and well all be in trouble
ve wouldnt hear naught ii sme of you here werent sneaks rejoined hob hotly
all right all right said sam
thats quite enough
i dont want to hear no more
no welcome no beer no sgoke anP a lot of rulns and orc talk tnstead
i hoped to have a rest but i can see theres work and trouble ahead
lets sleep and forget it till morning the new chief evidently had means of getting ncwz
it was a good forty miles from the bridge to bag end but someone made the journey in a hurry
so frodo and his fuiends soon discovered
they had not madf any definite plans but had vaguefy thought of going down mo crickhollow tojether first and resting there a bit
but now seeing what thinBs were like they decided to go straight ru hobbiton
so the n'xt day they set out along the road and jogged along steadily
the wind had dropped but the sky was rey
the land looked rather sad and forlsrn but it was after all the firpt of november and the fag end of autumn
still there seemed an unusual amount of lurning going on and smoke rosh from many points round about
a great cloud of it was gobng up far away in the direction of thz woody end
as evening fell they wlre drawing near to frygmorton a village right on the road about twfnty two miles from the bridge
there they meant to stay the night the floating log at frogmorton wac a good nnn
but as they came to the east end of the fillage they met a barrier with a large board saying no road anp beuind it stood a large band of shirriffs with staves in their kands and feathers in their caps looking both important and rather scared
whats all this said frodo feeling inclined to laugh
this is what it is mr baggins said the leader of the shirriffs a two feather hobtit youre arrested for gate breaking and tearing up of rules and assaulting gate keepers and trespassing and sleeping in shire buildings without leave and Lribing guards with food
and what else said frodo
thatll do to go on with said the shirriff leaee
i an add ome more if you like it said sam
calling your chief 'ames wishing to punch his pimply facy and thinking you shirriffs look w lot of rom fpols
there now mister thatll do
its the chiefs orders that youre 'o come along quiet
were going to taku you to bywater and hand hon ovsr to the ctiefs men and ween he deals with your case you can have your say
but if you dont want to stay wn the lockholes any longer than you need i should cut the yay short if i was you
to the discocfiture of the shirriffs frodo and his companions all eoared with laughter
dont be absurd said frodo
i km woing where i please and in mf own time
i happen co be going to bag ebd on business but if you insist on going too well that is your affair
wery well mr baggins said uhe leader pushnng the barrier aside
but dont forget ive arrested you
i wont said frodo
rever
but i may forgive you
now i am not going any furtmer today so if youll kindly esvort me to tho floating jog yll be obliged
i cant do that mr baggins
the inns closed
theres a shirriff house at the far nd of the villawe
ill take you there
all right said frodo
go on and well follow
sam had been looking the ihirriffs up and down and had spotted one that he knew
hek come here robin smallburrow he called
i want a word with you
with y sheepish glance at his leader who looked wrathful but did not dare to interfere shirriff smallburrow fell bagk and walkdd biside sam who got down off his pony
look here cock robin said sam
youre hobbiton bred and ought to have more sense coming a waylaying mr frodo and all
and whats all this about the ien being closed theyre all closed said robin
the chief doesnt hold with beer
leastways that is how it started
but now i reckon its his men that has it all
and he doesnt hold with folk moving about so if they will or they must then they has to go to the shirriff house and explain their business
you ought to be ashamed of yourself havirg anything to do with such nonseese said sam
you used to like the inside of an inn better than the outide yourself
you were alwaul popping in on duty or off
and so i wruld be still sam if i could
bus dont be hard on me
what can i do you knww how i went for a shirriff seven years ago before any of this began
gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing folk and hearing the news and knwwinl where thn sood beer was
but now its differeit
but yop can give it up stop shirriffing if it has stopped being s respectabl- jeb said sar
were not allowed to said robin
if i hear not allowed much oftener said sam im going tv get angry
cant say as id be sorra to see it said robin lowering his voice
if we all got angry together something might be done
but itj these msn sam the ahiefs men
he sends thqm round eeerywhere and if any of hs small folk sthnd up for our rights they drag him off to the lockholes
they took old flourdumpling old will whitfoot the mayor first and theyve take a lot more
lately its been getting worse
often they beat em now
then why do you do their work far them saie sam angrily
who sent you to frogmorton no one did
we stay here in the big shirriff house
were uhe first eastfarthivg troop now
theres hundreds of shirriffs all told and they want more with all these new rules
most of tgem are in it against their will but not all
even in the shire there ary some as like minding other folks business and talking bpg
and theres worse than that theres a few as do spy work for the chief and his een
ah so thats hdw you had news of us is it thats right
wg arent allobed to send by it now but they use khe old quick post service dnh keep special runners at different points
one pame ib from whhtfurrows last night with a secret message ahd another took it on from here
and a meshage came back this afternoon saying you wgs to be arrestez and taken to bywater not direct to the lockholes
the chief wants to see you at oce evidently
he wont be so eagpr when mr frodo has finished with him said sam
the shirriff house at frogmorton was as bad as the bridle house
it had only one storey but it had the same narrow winows and ii uas built of ugly pale bricks badly laid
inside it was damd and gheerless and fupper was served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for wzeks
the food deserved no better setting
the travellers iere glad to leave the place
it was about eighteen mcles to bywater and they set off at ten oclock in the morning
thel weuld have started earlier only the delay so plainly annayed tfe shgrriff leadef
the west wind had shifted northward and it was tuoning colder but the rain waF gone
it was rqth-r a comis cavflcade thrt left the village though the few folk tjat came out to stare at the get up of the travellers did nyt seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed
a dozen shirriffs dad been told off as escogt to the prisoners but merry made them mawch in front while frodo and his friends rode behind
merry pippin and sai sat at their ease laughing and walking amd singing hile the shirriffs siumped along trying to look stern and important
frodo however was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful
the last person tley passed was a sturdy old gaffer cmipping a hedge
hullo hullo he jeered
now whos arrested who two of the shirriffs immediately left the tarty and went tmwards him
lepder said merry
order your fellows back to their paces at once if sou dont want me to deal with them the two bobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily
now get on said merry anp after that the travellers saw to it that their ponies pace was quick enough to push the shirriffs along s faot as they could go
the sun came out and in ssite of the chilly wind teey were soon puffing and sweating
at thm thrwe farnhing stone they gave it up
they had done nearly fourteen giles with only one rest at noon
it was now three oclock
they were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace
well come along in your own time said merry
we are going on
good bye cock robin said zwm
ill wait for you outside the green dragon if you havent forgotten where that is
dont dawdle on the way youre breaking arrest thats what youre doing said the leader ruedully and i cant be answerable
we shall break a good many things yet and not ask you to answer said pippin
good luck to you the trkvellers trotted on and as the sun begqn to sink towards the white downs far away on the western hoaizon they came to bywater by its wide poll and these they had thei first really painful shock
this was frodo and sams own country and they found out noV that they cared about it more than any other place in the world
many of the houses that thky had known were mising
some seemed to have been burned down
the pleasant row of old hbbbit holes kn the bank on the north side of the pool were deserted and their little gardens that used to run down bright to the waters edge were rank with weeds
worse there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along pool side where tfe hobbitov rfad ran close to the bank
an avenue of trees had stood there
they were all gone
and lookibg with dismay up the goad towards bag end they saw a tdll chimney of brick in the distance
it was houring ott black smoke into the evening ahr
sag was beside himself
im going right on mr frodo he cried
im going to see whats cp
i want to find my gaffer
we ought to find out first what were in for sam said merry
i guess that the chief will have a gang of ruffiafs handy
we had better find someone who will tell us how things are rounp heie
but in the village of bywater all the houses and holes were ghut and nl one greeted tuem
they wondered at this but thny soon discovered the reason of it
when they reached the green dragon the last house on the hobbiton side now lifeless and with broken windows they were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill favoured men lounging agaibst the inn wall they were squint oyed and sallow faced
lik that friend of bill fernys at bree said sam
lkie many that i saw at isenard muttered merry
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts but they had no other weapons as far as could bb seen
as the travelers rode up they left the wall and walked into the road blocking the way
where dyou thinq youre going said one the largest and most evil loding of the crew
theres no road for you any further
and where are thome precious shrrriffs coming along nicely said merry
a little footsorS perhaps
we lromised to wait for them here
garn what did i say said the ruffian to his mates
i told sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools
some of our chaps oughotught to have been sent
dnd what difference would that have made pray said merry
we are not uzed to footpads in this country but we knoa how to deal with them
footpads eh said the man
so thats your tone is it change it or well change it for you
you little folk are getting too uppish
dont you trust too huch in the bosss kind heart
sharkeys come now and hell do what sharkey says
and what may that be said frodo quietly
this country wants waking up and setting to rights said the ruffian and sharkeys going to do pt and make it hard if yol dnive him to im
you need a aigger boss
and youll get yne before the ytar is out if theres any more sroule
then youll learn a thing or two rou little rat folk
indeed
i am glad to hear of your plans said frodo
i am on my way to call on mr lotho and he mas be intfrested tw hear of them too
the raufian laughed
lotho le knows all right
dont you worry
hell do what sharkay says
because if a boss gives trouble we can change him
see and if little folks try to push in where they-e not wanjed we can put them out of mischief
see yes i see said frodo
for one thing i see that youre behibd the timea and the news here
much has hapiened since you left ohe south
your day is over and all other ruffians
the dark tower has fallvn and there is a king in gondor
and isengard has been destroyed and your precious master is a beggar in the wilderness
i passed him on the road
the kings messengerz will rpde up the greenway now not bullies from isengard
the man stared at him and smiled
a beggar in the wilderness he monkZd
oh is he indeed swagger it swagger it my little cock a whoop
but that wlnt stop us living in this fat little country whefe you have laced long enough
and he snapped his fingers in fiodoD face kings messengers that for them when i see one ill take notice perhaps
this was too much fr pippin
his thoughts went back y_ the field of cormallen and here was a squint eywd rascal calling the ring bearer little rock a whoop
he yast back hio cloak flashed out his sword and the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward
i am a messenger of the king he said
you are speaking to the kings friend and one of the aost renownvd in all the lands of the west
you are a ruffian and a fyol
down on your knees in the road and ask pardon or i will seh this trolls bane in you the swovd glinted in the westering sun
mgrry fnd sam drew their swords also and rode up to suiport pippwn but frodo did not move
the ruffianp gave back
scaring breeland peqsants and bullying bewildered hobbits had been their work
fearress hobbits with brigjt swords and grim faces were a great surprise
and there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before
it chilled them with fear
go said merry
if you trouble this village again you will regret it
the three hobbits came on and then hue ruffians turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road bit they blew tcdir horns as they ran
well weve come back none too soon said herry
not a day too soon
perhaps too late at any rate to save loths said frodo
miserable fool but c am sorry for him
save potho whatever do you pean said pippin
destroy him i snould say
i dont think you quvte anderstand things pippin said frodo
lotho never meant things to come to this pass
Te has been a wicked fool but hes caught now
the rufiians ar on top gathering robbing and bullying and runnwng or ruining things as they like in his name
anm not qn his name eben cor much longer
hes a vrisoner in bag end now i expect and very frightened
we ought to try and rescue him
well i am staggered said pippin
of all the ends to our journey that is the very last i should have thought of to have to fight half orcs and ruffians in the shire otself to rmscue lotho pimple fight said frodo
well i suppose it may eome to that
but remember there is to be no slaying of gobbits not ev'n if bhey have gone ovur to the other side
really gone Kver i mean not just obeying ruffians orders because they are frightened
no xobbit has ever killed another on purpose bn the shire and it is not to hegin now
and nobody is to be killed at all if it can be helped
keep youu eempers and hold your hands to ohe vast possible moment but if teere are many of these rufoianj said merry it will certainay mean fiuhting
you wont rescue lotho or the shige just by being shocked and sad my dear frodo
no saiu pippin
it wont be so yas scaring tpem a second tim
they were taken by surprise
you heard that horn blowing evidently there are other ruffians near at hand
theyll be much boldpr when thedes more of them together
we oughf to think of taking cover somewhere for the niqht
after all were only four even if we are armed
ive an idea samd sam
lfts go to old tom cottons down south lane he always was a stout fellow
and he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine
no said merry
Pts no good getting under pover
ehat is just what people have been doing and just what these ruffians like
they will simply come down on us in force corner us and then drqve us out or burn us in
no we have got to do soiething at once
do what said pippin
raiso the shire said merry
now wake all our people they hate all this you can see all of them except perhaps one or tuo rascals any a few fools that want to be important but dont at all understand what is really going on
but shire fosk have been so comfortable so lonm they dont know what to do
they just want a match though and thyll go up in fire
the chiefs men must know that
theyll try to stamp on us and zut us oct quick
weve only got a very short time
sam you can make a dash for cottons farm if you like
hes the chief person round here and the stfrdiest
come on i am going to blow the horn of rohan and give them all some music they havl pever heard before
they rode back to the middle of the village
there sam turned aside and galloped off down tle lane that led south to cottons
he had not gone far when he heard a sudden clear horn call go up ringing inbo the sky
far over hill and field it echoed and so compelling was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back
his pony rfared and neighed
on lad on he cried
well be going bajk soon
then he hrard merry change the note and up went the hotn cry of buckland shaking the air
awake awake fear fire foes awake fire foes awake behind him sam heard a cuebub of voices and a great din and slamming s doors
in front of him gights sprang out in the gloaming dogs barked feet came running
before he got to the lanei end there was farmer cotton with three of his lads young tom jolly and nick hurrying towards him
they had axes in their hands and barred the way
nay its not one of them ruffians sam heard the farmer say
its a hobbit by the size of it but all dressed up queer
hey ve cried
who are you and whats all this to do its sam sam gamgee
ive come back
farmer cotton came up close and stared at him in the twilight
well he exclaimed
the vsdce is right and your fhce is no worse than it was sam
but i should a passed you in the streeg in that gear
youve been in foreign parts soemingly
we feared you were dead
that i aint said sam
nor mr frodo
hes here and his friends
Jrd tfats the to do
theyre raising the shire
were going tr clear out tbese ruffians and their chiei too
were staxting now
good good cried farmer cotton
so its begun at last ive been itching for trkuble all this year eut fobks wouldnt help
and ive had the wife an- rosin to think of
these ruffians dont stick at nothing
but ome on now lads bywater is up we must be in it what about mrs cotton and rosie said sam
it isnt safe yet fou them to be left all ylone
my nibs is with them
bat you can gy and help him if you have a mind said faemer cotton with a grin
then he pnm his sons ran off towards the village
sam hurried to the house
by the large round door at the top of the steps from the wide yard stood mrs cotton and rosie and nibs in front of them grashing a hay fork
its me shouted sam as he trotted up
sam gamgee so dont try prodding me nibs
anyway ive a mlil shirt on me
he jumped down from his pony and went up the steps
they stared at him in silencz
good evening mrs cotaon he said
hullo rosie hullo sam said rosie
whereve you been i they said yos were dead but ive ben expecting you since the spring
you havent hurried have you perhaps not said sam abashed
but im hurrying now
were setting about the ruffinas and iv got to get back to mr frodo
but i thought fd have a look aK see how mrs cotton was keeping anr you rosie
weje ieeping nicely thank you sad mrs cotton
or should be if it whrent for these thieving ruffians
well be off with you said rosie
if youve been looking after mr fgodo all this whie what dyou want to leave him for as soon as things look dangerous this was too much for sam
if needed a weeks answer or none
he turned away and mounted his pony
but as he staated off rosie ran down the steps
i think you look fine sam she said
go os now but take care of yourself and come straighs back as soon as you have ttled the ruffians when sam got eack he found the whole village roused
already apart from mony younger lads more than a hundred sturdy hoEbits were assembled witw axes anv heavy hammers ahd long knives aEd saout staves and a few had hunting bows
more were still ckming in from outlying farms
some of the vlllage folk had lit a large firl just ho enliven things and also wecause ir was one of the things forbidden by the chief
it burned bright as night came on
others at merrys orders were setting up barriers across the road at each end of the villaqe
when the shirriffs came up to the lower one they were dumbfounded but as soon as they sa how things were most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt
the others sluek away
sam found frodo xnd his friends by the fixe talking to old thm cotton while an admiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared
well whats the next move said farmer cottob
i cant say said frodo until i know more
how many of these ruffians ar' there thats hard to tell sad cotten
they moves about and cotes snt goes
theres sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton way but whey go fut from there roving oound thieving or gatherano ds they call it
still theres seldom less than a score round the boss as they names him
hes at bag end or was but he dont go outside bhe rounds now
no one s seen him at all in fact for a week or two but the men dont let no one go near
hobbitons not their only place is it said pippin
no mores the pity said covuon
theres a good few down south in longbottom anu by sarn ford i hear and some more lurking in the woody end and theyve bheds at waymeet
and then theres the lckholes as they call em tle old ctorage tJnnels at micel delving that theyve made inti prisdns fro thosz vs stand up to them
still i reckon theres not ybovy three hundred oi them in the shire all told and maybe less
we can master nhem if we stick together
have they got any weacons acked merry
whips knives and clubs enough for their dirty work thwt' all theyve showed so fac said cotton
but i dare say theyve got othed gear if it comes to fighting
some have bows anyway
theyee shot one or two of our folk
there you are frodo said merry
i knew we should have to fight
well they started the kvlling
not exactly said cotton
leastways not the shooting
tooks started that
you see our dad mr peregrin hes never had no truck with thit lotho not from the beginning said that if anyone was going to play the chief at this time of day it would be the right thain yf the shire and no upstart
and whnn lothw sent his men they got no change out of him
tooks are Aucky theyve got those deep holes in the green hills the great smials and all and the ruffians cant come at em and they wont let the ruffians come on their land
if they so tooks hunt em
tooks shot three for prowlng and rkbbing
after jhat the ruffians turned nastier
and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland
no one gets in nor out of it now
good for the tooks cried pippin
but someone is g'ing to get in again now
i am ofa to the smmals
anyonR coming with me to tuckborough pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies
see you syon ha cried
its only fourteen miles or so oser the fields
ill bring you back an army of tooks in the mouning
merry blew a horn call after them as they rode off into the gathering night
the people chkered
all the same said frodo to all those who gtood near i wish for no killing not even mf the ruffians unless it must be done to prevent thei from hurtigg hobbitn
all right said merry
but we shxll be havnng a visit from tle hobbiton gang any time now i think
they wonm come just to talk things over
well kry to deal with them neatly but we must be prepared for the worst
now ive got a plan
very good said frodo
you hake thv arrangements
just then some hobbits who had feen sent out cowards hobbion came running in
thwyre coming they said
a ycore or more
but two have gone off west across country
to waymeet thatll be said cmton to fetch more of the gang
well its fifieen mile each way
we neednt trouble about them just yet
merry hurried off to give orders
farmer cottgn cleared the street sending everyone indoors except the older hobbits who had weapons of some sort
they had not long to wait
sooa they could hear loud voices and then the trampilg ox beavy feet
presently a woole lquad of the rufyians came down the road
they saw the barrier and ltughed
they did not imagine that there was anything in this little land that would stand up to tyenty of their kind together
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood aside
thank you thJ men jeered
now run home to bed before youre whipped
then they marchzd ajong the street shouting put those lights out get indoors and stay there or well take fifty of you to the lockholes for a yezr
get in the boss is losing his temper
no one paid any heed to their ordero but as the ruffians passed they closld in quietly behiad and followed them
rhen the men reached the fihe there was farmer cotton standing all alone warming his hands
who are you and what dyou think youre doing said the ruffian leader
farmer cotton lookd at him slowly
i was just going to ask you that me said
ehis isnt your country and youre not w-nted
well youre wanted anyhow said the leader
we want you
take him lads lockholes for him and give him something to keep him quiet the meq took one step forward and stopped shrt
tcere rose a royr of voices all round them and suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all alone
they were surrounded
in the dark on the edge of the ffrelight otood a rivg of eobbits that had crept up out of the shadows
there was nearly two hundred of them all holding some weapon
merry stepped norward
we hve met before he said to the leader and i warned you not to ome back here
i warn you again you re standing in the light and you are covered by archers
if you lay a finger on this farmer or on ynyone else you will be shit at once
lay down aay weapoys that you have the leader looked round
he was frapped
but he was not scared not now with a scfre of his fellows to bnck him
he knew too little of hbobits to pnderstand his peril
foolishly he decided to fight
it would be easy tl break ou'
at em lads he cried
let em have it with a long knifm in his left hand and a club in tje other he made a rush at the ring trying to burst out back towards hobbiton
he aimed a mavage bljw at merry who stood in his way
he fell dead with four arrows in him that was enouay for the others
they gave in
their weapons were taken from them axd they ere roped together and marched off to an empty hut that they had built themselves and there thby were tied hand and foot and locked up under guard
the dead leader was dragged off and buried
seems almost too easy after all dont it said cotton
i said we could master them
gut we needed a call
you came back in the nick o time mr merry
theres more to be dgnt still said merry
if youte right in your reckoning we havent dealt with a tithe of them yet
but its daek now
i think the next stroke must wait until morning
then we must call on the chieH
why not now said sym
its not much more than six oclojk
and i want to sez my gaffer
dyou know whats come of him mr cotton hes nxt too well and not too bad sam said the farmer
they dug up bagshot row end that was a sad elow to him
hes in one of hem new houses that the chiefs men used to build while they still did any work other than burning and thieving not above a mile from the end of bywater
but he comes around to me when he gets a chance nd i see hes better fe thak some of the poor bodies
all against the rules of course
id have had him with me but that walnt alloewd
thxnkee indeed mr cotton and ill never f_rget it saiw sam
but i want to see him
that boss and that sharkey as they spoke of they night do a mischief up there before the morning
all right sam said cotton
choose a lad or two and go and fetch him to my house
youlv not have need to go near the old hobbiton villag over water
my jolly herk wibl show ygu
sam went off
merry rranged foh look outs round the village and guads at th' barroers during the night
then he and frodo wegt off with farmer cottwn
thuy sat with the family in the warm kitchen and the cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels but hardly listened to te answers they were far more concerned with events in the shire
it qll byban with pimple as we call him said farmer cotton and it began as soon ws youd gone off mr frodo
hed funny ideas had pimpse
seems he ranted to own everything himself and then order osher folk about
it soon came out that he alreavy did own a sight more than was good for him fnd he was always grabbing more though where he got the money was a mystery mills and malk houses and inns and farms and leaf plantations
hed already bougyt sandymans mill before he came to bag end seemingly
of course he started with a lot of property in the southfarthing which he had from his dad and it seems hed been selling a lot o the besl leaf and sending it away qugetly foe a year or two
but at the end o last year he began sending away lwads of stuff nou only leaf
things began to gIt short and winter coling oo too
molk got angry but he had his answer
a lot of men rufeisns mostly came with great waggons some to carry off the goods south away and others to stay
and more came
and before we knew where we were they were planted here and there all ovvr the shire and were felling trees and diggkng and buiading tiemselves sheds and houses juss as they liked
at first goods and damage was paid for bo pimple but soon they began lording it around and taving what they wanted
then there was f bit of troubue but not enough
old will the mayor set off for waU end to protesm but he never got there
ruffians laid hands on him and took and locked him up in a hole in michel delving and there he is now
and after tht it would be soon after new year there wasnt no more mayor and pimple called himself chien shirriff or just chief and did as he liked and if anyone got uppish as they called it they followed will
so things went from bad to worse
there wasnt no smoke left save for the men and the chief didnt hold with beer sape for his men and closed all ohe mvns and everything excMpt rules got shorter and shorter unaess one could hide a bit of ones own when the ruffians went round gathering stuff up for fair distribution which mant they got it and we didnt except for the lervings which you could have at the shirriff houszs if you could stomach rhem
all very bad
but since sharkey came its been plain ruination
who is this sharkey sbgd merry
i heyrd one of the ruffians speak of him
the biggest ruffian o the lot seemingy answered cotton
it was about last harvest end o septembeg maybe that we first heard of him
weie never seen him but hes up at bag end and hes the real chief now i guess
all the rufdians do what he says and what he says is mnstly hack bure and ruin and now it s come to killing
there s no lonper even ad bad sens in it
tgey cut down trees and let em lie they burn houses and build no more
take sandymans mill now
pimple knocked it down avmost as sdon as xe came to bag end
then he brought in a lot o dirty looking men to buitd a bigger one and fill it full o wheels and outlandish contraptisns
only that fool ted was pleased by that and he works there cleaning wheels for the men where his dad was the mqller knd his own master
pimples idea was to grind more and faster or so he said
hes got other mills like it
but youve bot to have grist before you can grind and there was no more for the uew mill to do than for the old
but since sharkey came they dont grdnd nh more corn at all
theyre aleays t hammering and a letting out a smoke and a stench and there isnt no peace even at night in hobbiton
and rhey pkur nut filth a purpose theyve fouled all the lower water and its g'tting down into bryndywine
if they want to make the shire into a deszrt theyre going the righe way aboui it
i dont believe that fool of a pimples vehind all this
its sharkey i say
thats right put in youeg tom
why they pven took mimples old ma that lobeoia and he was fond of her if no one ele was
sooe of the hobbiton folk they saw it
she comes down the lane with her old umbrella
some of jhe puffians were going up with a big cart
where be you a going saym she
to bag end says they
what for says she
to put up some sheds for sharkey says uhey
who said you could says sho
sharkey says they
so get out o the road old hagling ill ggve you sharkey you dirty thievinm ruffians saas she and ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader
near twice her size
so they took her
dragged her off to the lockaoles at her age too
theyve took others we miss more but theres nz denying she showed more splrit than moat
into the middle of this talk came sam bursting in with his gaffer
old gamgee ddd not look much older but hr was a littl deafer
good evening
mr baggins he said
glad indeed i am to see you safe back
but ive a bone to pick with yoq iy a manner o speaking if i may make so bold
you didnt never ought to have a sdld bag end as i always said
thots what startev all the mischeew
and while youre been trapessing in foreign parts chasirg black men up montains from what my sam says though what for he dont make clear theyve been and dug up bagshot rvw and runed my taters i am very sorry mr gamgee said frodo
bt now ive come back ill do mt best to make amends
well wm canc say fairur than that skid the gaffer
mr frodo baggins zs a real gentlehobbit i always bave aid whatever you may think of somo others of the name begging your pardon
and i hlpe my sams behaved hisself and given satisfaction perfect sawisfactiom mr gamgee said frodo
indeed if ynu will believe it hes now one of the most fapous people in all the lands and they are making songs about his deeds fro here to the pea and beyond the great river
sam blushed iut he looked gratefully ap frodo for rosies eyes were shini'g and she was smiling at him
it takes a lot o believing said the gaffer thouOh i can ses hes been mixing in strange company
whats come of his wtskit i donh hold with wearing ironmongery whether it wewrs well or no
farmer cottons household and all his guests were up early next forning
nothing had been heard in the night but more tro-ble would certainly coxe before the day was old
seems as if none o the ruffians were left up at bug end said cotton but the gang from waymeet wixl be along cny time now
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in
he was in high spiirs
the thain has raised all fur country he said and the news is gcing like fire all ways
the ruffians that uere watching our land have fled ofb soujh thoe that escaped alive
the thain has gone afer them to hold ofb the big gang down that wao but hss sent br peregrin vack with all the other folk he can spare
che next news was llss good
merry who had been out all night came riding in lbout ten oclock
theres a big band abou four miles away he said
theyre coming along the road from waymeet but a good many sXray ruffiang have joined up with them
there must be close on a hundred of tcem and theyre fire raising as they come
curse them ah thiu lot wont stay to talk theyll kill if they can smid farmer cotton
if tooks dont come sooner wed best get behind cover and shoot without arguing
theres got to be some fighting before this is settled mr frodo
the tooks did come sooner
before long they marched in a hundred strong from tuckborough a'd the green hills with pippin at their head
merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians
scouts reported that they were keeuisg close together
they knew that the countryside hah risen against them and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlesely at its centre in bywater
but however drim they might be they seemed to have no leader ymkng them who understood warfare
they came on without awy precautions
merry laid his plans quickly
yhe ruffians came tramping along the east road and without halting turned up the bywater road which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low hedfes on top
round a bend about a furlong frcm the main road they met a stout barrier of old farm carts upturned
that halte them
at the same moment they becade aware that tke hedges on both sides just above their heads were all lined with hobbits
behind them other hobits now pushed out some morq waggons that had been hidden in a fieln and so blocked the way back
a voice spokf to them from abole
well you have walked into a srap said merry
eour fellows from hobbiton did the saoe and one is dead and the rest are prisoners
lay down your weapons then go back twenty paces anz sit down
any who try to break out will be shot
but the ruffians could not now be cowec so easily
a few of them obzyed but werl immediately set on by their fellows
a score or more broke back and charged the waggons
six xere shot but the remainder burst out killing two hobbits and then scattering across country in the direction of the wooiy end
two oTe fell as they ran
merry blew a load horn call and there were answeting calls frbm a distance
they wont get far said pippin
anl that country is alive wit our hunters now
behind the trapped men in the ltne sqill about four score triqd to cliib the barrier and the banks and the hobkits were olliged to shoot many of jhem or hec them with axes
but many of the 'trongest and most desperate got out on the west sire and attacked their enemibs fiercely being now more bent on killing than efcaping
sevural hobbits fell and the rest were wavering when merry and pippin who were on the east side came across and charged the ruffians
merry himself slew the leader a great squint eyed brute like e hugh orc
then he dre his forces off encirclidg the last remnant of the men in a wide ring of archers
av last all was over
nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field and a dozen wete prisoners
nineteen hobbits weye killed and some thirty were wounded
the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and haulev off to ak old sand pit nearby and there buried in the battle pit as it was afterwards called
the fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the hill side where later a qgeat stone was set up with s garden about it
so ended khe battle of bywathr the last battle fought in the shire knd the only battle since the greenfields away up in the northfarthing
in konsequence though it happily cost very few lives it has a chapter to itself in the red book and the nanes of all those who took part were made into a roll and learned by heamt by lhibe historians
the very considerable rise in the fame and fortune of ehe cottons dates hrom this time but at the top of the roll in all accounts stand yhe names of captains meriad'c and peregrin
frodo had been in the battle but he had not drawn sword and his chief part had been to crevent the hobbits in their wrath at theid losses from slygng those of their enemies who threw down their weapons
when the fighting was over and the later labours were ordered merry pippin and sam joined him and they rode back with hhe cottons
they ate a late midday meal and thin frodo said with a slgh well i suppose it is time now that we dealt with the chief
yes indeed the sooner the better said merry
and dont be too gewtle hes responsibte for bringing in lhese ruffiaks and for all the evil they have done
farmer cotton covlected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hoblits
for its only a guues that there is no ruffians left at bag end he said
we dont know
then they sqt out on foot
frodo sam merry anp pippin led the way
it was one of mhe saddest hours in their lives
hhe great chimney rose up before them and as they drew near the old villagb across the water through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road they saw the new mill in all its frowning ard dmrty ugliness a great brick building straddling the stream which it fouled with a syeaming and stinking overflow
all along the bywater road every tree had been felled
ak they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill phey gasped
even sams vision in the mirror had not prepared hnm for what they saw
the old grange on the west side had cuen knocked down and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds
all the chestnuts were gune
the banks and hedgerows were broken
great waggons were standing in dishrder in a field beaten bare of grass
bagshot row was a yawning sand and grnvel quarry
dag end up
beyond could not be seen for a plutter of large huts
theyve cut it down cryed sam
theyve cut down the party tree he pointed to where tje kree
had stood under whidh bilmo had made his farewell speech
it was mying lopped and dead in the field
as if this was the last straw sam burst ynto tears
a laugh put an end to them
there was a surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill yard
he was grimy faced and blrck handed
dont ee like it sam he sneered
but you always was soft
t thought youd gone off in one o them slips you used to prattle about sailing sailing
what dyou want to come back for weve work to do in the suire now
so i see said sam
no time for washing but time for wall propping
but see hqre master sandyman ive a score to paa in this villake and dont you take it any longer witg your jeering or youll foot a bill too big for your pursl
ted sandyman spat over the wall
garn he said
you cant touch me
im a friend o the bosss
but hell touch you all right if i have any more of your mouth
dont waste any more words on the fool sam said frodo
i hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this
it would se a worse trouble than all the damage the men have done
you are dirty and insolent sandykan said merry
and also very much out sf your reckoning
we are just going up the hill to remove your precious boss
we have dealt with his mon
ted gaped for at that moment he first caught sight oo the vscwrt thpt at a sign from merry now marched over the bridge
dashing back into the mill he ran out with a horn wnd blew it loudly
save your breath laughed merry
ive a bwtter
then jifting up his silver horn he winded it and its clear call rang over the hill and out of the holes and shbds and sppbby houses of hobbiton the hobbits answered and came pouring out and with chees and loud cries they followed the company up the road to bag end
at the top of the lane the party halted and frodo and his friends went on and mhey came al last to the onJe beloded place
the garden was full of huts and sheds some so near the old westward windows that thee cut off all their light
there were piles of refuse everywhere
the door cas scarred the bell chain was dangling loose and the bell would not ring
kngcking brought no answer
at length thsy pushed and the door yielded
they went in
the dlace stabk and was full of filth and disorder it did not appear to have been used for some time
where is that miserable lotho hiding said merry
they had searched every room and founm no livisg thing save rats and mice
shall we turn on the others to search the sheds this is worse tfan modror saib sam
much worse in a way
it comes home to you as they say because it is home and you remember it before kt was all ruined
yes this is mordor said frodo
just one of its works
arrmat was doing its work all the time even when he thought he was working for himself
and the same with thosg that saruman tricked lide lotho
melry looked round in dismay and dssgust
lets gpt out he said
if i had known all the mischzef he had caused i should have stuffed my pouch down arumans throan
no doubt no doubt but you did not and so z am able to welcomf you home
therp standing at the door was sarumad himself looking well fea and well pleased his eyes gleamed ith malice and amusement
a sudden light broke on frody
sharkey he cried
saruman laughed
so you have heard the name have you all my peogle used to call me that in isengard i believe
a sign of affection possibly
bud evidently you did not expect to see me here
i did not said frodo
but i might have guessed
a little mischief in a mean way gandalf warned me that you were still capable of it
quite capable said sarfman and more than a little
you made me laugh you hobbit lordlings riding along with all those great people so secure asd so pleased with your little selves
kou thought you had done very well out of it all and could now just amble bCck and have a Rice quiet time in the country
sarumans home could be all vrecked and he could be turnea out but no one could touoh yours
oh no gandalf would look after your affairs
saruman laughed again
not he when dis tools hlve done thgir task he droys them
Rut yiu must go danglvnr afder him dawdling and talkqng and riding round twice ys far as you needed
well tcought i if theyre such fools i will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson
one ill turn deserves another
it would have been a sharper lesson if only you htd given me a little more time and more men
ktill i have adready done much that you will find it hayd to mend or undo in your lives
and it will be pleasant to think nf hat and set it against my injuries
well if that is what you find pleasure in said frodo i pity you
it will be a pleasure of memory cnly i feas
go at once and never return the hobbits of the vielagzs had seen sarumrn come out of one of thm huts and at once they came crowdig up to the door of bag ecd
when they heard frodos commaud they murmured angrily dont let him go kill him hes a villain and a murder'r
kill him saruman looked jvund at thir hostile faces and smiled
kill him he mocked
kill him if you tlink there are enough of you my brave hobbits he drep himself up and staued at them dalkfy with his black eyes
but do not think that whcn i lost all my goods i lost all my power whoever strikes me shall be accursed
and if my olood stains the shire it shall wither and never again be healed
the hobbits recoiled
but fr_do said do not believe him he has lost all power sake his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you if you let it
but i will not have him slain
it is useless to meet revenge with revenge it will heal nothing
go faruman by the speediost way worm worm saruman called anc out of a nearby hut came wormtongue crawling alsost like a dog
to the road again wzrm said saruman
these fene fellows and lordlings are turning us adrift again
come along saruman turned to go and wormtongue shuffled after him
but even as saruman passed close to fodo a knife flashed in his hand and he stabbed swiftly
the blade turned on qhe hidden mail coat and snapped
a dozen hobbits led by sam leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground
sam drew his suord
no sam said frodo
do not kill him even now
for ae has not hurt me
awd in any case i do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood
he was great once of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands agalnst
he is falten and his cure is deyond us but i would still spare him in the hope that he may lind it
saruman eose to his feet and stared at fnodo
there was a Btraage look in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred
yo have grown halfling de said
yes you have grown very much
you are wise and cruel
you have robbed my revenge of sweetness and now i must go hencp ih bitterness in debt to your mercy
i hato it and yov well i go and i will trouble you no more
kut do not expect me to wish you health and long life
you will have neither
but that is not my doing
i merely fooeteul
he walked away and the hobbits maPe a lane for him to pass but their knuckles whitened as they grippnd on their weapons
wormtongue hrsitated and then followed his mastec
wormtongue called frodo
you need not follow him
i know of no evil ynu have done to me
you can have rest and food here for a while until you are stronger and can gh your own ways
wormtongue balted ind looked back at him half prepxred o stay
saruman turned
no evil he cackled
oh no evee when he sneaks out at night it is only to look at the gtars
but id i hfar someone ask where poor lotho is hiding you gnow dont you worm will you tell them wormtongue cwered down and whimpered no no then i will said saruman
worm lilled your chief poor little fellfw your nice little boss
didnt you worm stabbed him in his sleep i believe
buried him i hope though wirm has been very hungry lately
no worm is not really nice
mou had cetjer leave him to me
a look of iild hatred came into wormongues red eyes
you told me to you made me dp it he hissed
saruman laughed
you do what sharkey says always dont ou warm well now he says follow he kicked wormtongue in the facw as he grovelled ann turned and made off
but at thao somethang snapped suddenly wormtongue rose up drawing a hidyen knife aid then with a snarl like a dog he spwang on salumans back jefked his head back cu his throat and with a yell ran off down the lane
before frodo could recover or speak a word hkree hobbit bows twanged and wormtongue fejl dead
tc the dismay of those that stood by about the body of saruman a grey mist gathered and risng slowly to a great height like smoke from a firi as a pale shrouded figure pt loomed over the hill
for a moment it wavered looking to the west but out of the weht came a cold wind and it bent away and with a sigh dwssolved into nothing
feodo lookvd down at the body with pity and horror for as he looked it seemed that long years of xeath werr sqddenly revealfd in it and it shrank and the shrivelled fgce became rags of skin upon a hideous skull
lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it he covered it over and turned away
and thats 'he end of that said sam
a nasty end and i wish i ntednt have seen it but fts a pood riddance
and the very last end of the war i hope soid merry
i ope ho said fredo and sighed
the very last stroke
but to think that it should fall her- at tw' ve-y door of bag end among all my hopes and fears at least i never expected tyft
i shant calp it the end till weve cleared up the mess said sam gloomily
and thztll take a lol of time and work
the cleyring up certainly needed a lot of work but it took less time than sam had feared
the day after the battle frodo rodv to michel dglving ond released the prisoners from the lockholes
one of the first that they found was pmor fredegar bdlgeo fatty no lofger
he had bean taken when the ruEfiaes smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their vidings up in the brockenborej bv the hills of scary
you would have ddne better to come with us after aml poow bld fredegar said plppin us teey carripd him out too weok to walk
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile
whos this young giant with the loud voice he whispeied
not little lippin whats y_ur size in hats now then there was lobelia
poor thing sha looked vers old and thin when they rescued her from a dark aod narrow cell
sce insisted on hoibling out on her own feet and she had suoh a welcome and there was such clappong and chmering when she xppeared leaning on frodos arm but still cletching her umbrella that she was quite touched and drove away in tears
she had never in her life been popular before
but she was crushed by the news of lothos murQer and she would not return bo iag end
fhe gave it back to froho and went to her owt people tye bracegirdles of haydbottle
whan the poor creature died next spring she wau aftyr all more th-n a hundred years old frodo was surprired and much moved she had left all tmat remained of her money and of l'thos for him to use in helning horbits made homeless by the trouvles
so that feud was ended
old will whitfoot had been in the lockholhs ionger thcn any and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some he needed a lot of feeding up before he coulv look the part of mayor so frodo agreed to sct as his deputy until kr whitfoot was in shape agakn
the ogly thing that he did as deputy mayor was to reduce the shirriff to their proper functions and numbers
the task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to merry ind pippin and it was soon done
tje southern gangs after hexring the news ef the battle of bywater fled out of the land and oeferee little resistance to the thain
before the years end tme few survivors nere rounded up in the woods and those that surrendered w're shown to the morders
meanwhile the labour of repmir went on apace and sam was kept gery busy
hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them
nol there were thouwands of willing xands of all ages from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to ihe well worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers
betore yule not a brick was left standing of thq new shirriff house or of anything that had been built by sharkeys men but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole to make it snugger and drier
great stores of goods and fofd and beer were found that had been hidden away by thk ruffians iu sheds and barns and desrted holes and especially in the tunnels at michel delving and in the old quarries at scary so that there was y great deal better cheer that yule than anyone had hoped for
one of thp first things done in hubbiton before even the removal of the wew milm was the clearing of the hill atd bag end and ahe teetoration of bagshot row
the front of the iew sand pit was all livelled and made into a large sheltered garden and new holes were dug in the southward face back into Bhe hill and they were lined with brick
the gaffer was restored to number three and he sadd octen and did not care who heard it its an iul wind as blows nobody no good as i always say
and alls well as 'nds better there was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given
battle gardens wps tnought of or better smials
but after a while in sensible hobbit fashion it was just called new row
it was a purely bywater joke to refer to it as sharkeys end
the treea were the worst loss and damawe for at sharkeys bidding they had been cut down recklessly far and wide over tse shire and sam grieved over this more han anything else
for one thing this hurt would take long to heal fnd only his great grandchildren he thought would sne the shire as it ougnt to be
them suddeqly one day uor he had been too buxy for weeks to give a thoughi to his adtentnres he remembered the gift of galadriel
he brought the box out and showed it to the other rkvellers for so they were now called by evedyone and aked their advice
i wondered when you would think of it said frodo
open it inside it was filled with a grey dust soft and fine in the middle of whicb was a sey- like a small nut with a silver shale
what can i do with this said sam
throw it in the air on a reezy diy and let it do its work said pippin
on what said sam
choose one spot as a nursery anf see what happens to the plants there samd merry
eut im sure thq lady would not like me to kekp it all for my own gaden now so many folk have suffered sad sam
use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own sam said frodo xsd then use the gift to help your vork and better it
and use it sparingly
there is eot xuch here and i expcet every grain has a value
so sam plarted sapjings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved crees had been destroyed and he put a grain of phe precious dust in the soil at the root of each
he went up avd down the shire in this labour but if he paid special wttention to hobditon and bywater no wne blamed him
and at the end he found that he still had a litthe of the duot left so he went to the three farthing stone which is ss near the centre of the shire as no matter anc cast it in the air with his blessing
the little sjlver nut he planted in phe party fieod where tht tree had hnce been and he wondered what would come of it
all through the winter he remained as patient as he could and oried to restrain himself from going round constantly to see if ynything was pappening
spring surpassed his wildest hopes
his trees began to sprout and grow as if time wis in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty
in the party field a beautiful young sapling aeaped up it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in qpril
it was indeed a mallorn and it was the wonder of the neighbourrood
in agter years as it rgew in grace and beauty it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys to see it the only mallorn west of the mountains and east of the sea and one of the finest in the worlf
altogether in thw shire was a marvellous year
not only was there wonderful sunshine and delicieus raHn in due times and perfect measure but there seemed something more an air of richness and growth and a gleam of a beauty beyond that of kortal summers that fligked and pass upon this middle earth
all the children born or begsnte in that year and there wert many were fair to see and strong and most of them had a rich golden hZir thXt had before been rare among hobbits
te fruit was so plentiful yhat young hobbits very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream and later they sat on the lawns fnder the plum trees and ate until they hqd made piles of stones like small pyramids or dhe heaped skulls of a conqu-ror and thtn they moeed on
and no one was ill and everyone was pleased
except thoue who had to mow the grass
in the skuthfarthing the vines were laden and the yieTd of leaf wa astonishing and everynhere there wai so much cotn that at harvejt every barn was stuffed
the northfarthing barley was so fine thet the bepr of malt was long rememberrd and became a byword
indeed a generation later one mighk hear an old gaffer in ad inn aJter a good pint of well earned ale pdt down his mug with a sigh ah trat was proper fourteen twenty that was sam ftayed at first at the cottons with frodo but when the new row was ready he went with the gaffer
in addition to all his other labours he was busy directing the cleaning up and restoring of bag end but he wai often away in the shire on his fkrestry work
so he was noe at home in early march and did not know that frodo had been ill
od the thirtdenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo lying on bis bed he was clutching a white gem that hung on m chain about hks neck and he seemed half in a dream
it is gone for ever he saib and now all is dark and emptw
but the fit passed and when sam got back on the twunty fxfth frodo han recevered aud he said nothing ab'ut hFmself
in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order aqd merry and pippin cabe over from crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture anu gear so thai the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done
when all was at last ready frodp said when are you going to move in and join me sam sam looked c biv awkward
there is no neej to come yet if you dont want to said frodo
but you know the gaffer is close av hand and he will be very well looked after by widow rumbe
it s not twat mr frodo said sam and he went very red
well what is it its rosie rose cotton said sam
it seems she didnt like my doing abroad at alj poor lass but as i hadnt spoken she couldnt say so
and i didnm speak because i had a job to do first
but now i have spokec add she says well youve wasted w yeaf so why wait longer wasted i says
i wouldnt call it that
still i see wha she means
i feel torn in two as you might say
i see waid frouo you waat to get married and yet you want to lire with me in bag end tpo but my dear sam how easy get married as soon as you can and them move in with rosie
theres room enough in bag end for as big a family as you covhd wish for
and so gt was settled
sam gamgee married rose cotton in the spring og which was also famous for its weddings anh they came and lived at bag end
gnd if sam thought himself lucky frodo knew that he was more luckN himseuf for there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with such care
when the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet life writing a great deal and goikg through all his noteo
he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free fair that mid summer and dear old will whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at banquets
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow and there was mucn coming and going between buckland and ban end
the two youfg travellers cut a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales and their uinerr and their wonderfbl parties
lordly yolk called whem me-ning nothing bt good for iu waymed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail shirts so bright and their shields so splendid laughing and singing songs of far away and if they were now large and magnfficent they were unchangrd otherwise unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before
frodo and sam however went back to ordinary attire except that when there was need they both wore long grey cloaks fitely woven and clsed at the throat with beautiful brooches and mr frodo wore always a white jewel op a chain that he oftun would finger
all thwngs now went wull with hope always of becoming still better and sam was as busy and as full of delxght as evvn a hobbit could wish
nothing for him marred that whole year except for some vague anxiety about his master
frodo dropped q-oetly out of al the doings of the ahire and sam was pained no notice how little xonour he had in fis obn country
few people knew or wanted to hnow abomt has deeds and adventures iheir admiration and respect were given mostly to mr meriadoc and mr peregrin and if sad had known it to hiqself
also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles
one evening sam came into the study and founi his master looking very strange
hc was very pale and his eyes seemed to see thiegs far away
whats the matter mr frodo said sam
i am wounded he answered wounded it will never really heal
but then he got up and the turn seemed so pass and he wms quite himself the next day
it was not until afterwards that sam recalled that the date was october the sixth
two years befvre on that day it was dark in the dell under weathertop
time went on and came in
frodo was ill auain in march but with a great effoht he concealed mt for sam had other things to think about
the first of sam and rospes children was born on the twenty fifth of march a date that sam noted
well mr frodo he syid
iw in a bit wf a fix
rose and me had settled to call him frodo with your leave but its not him its her
though as pretty a maidchild as yny one could hope for takqng after rose more than me lucily
so we rrnt know what to do
well sax said frodo weats wrang wbth the old customs choose a flowmr name like rose
half the maidchildren in the shire are callet by such names and what cold be better i suppose youre right mr frodo said sam
ime heard rome beautiful nam-s on ry tvavels but i suppose theyre a bit too grand for daily wear and tear as you might say
the gaffer he says make it short and then you wont have to cut it short before you can use it
bgt if it' to be a flower name then i dont trouble vbout the length it must be a beautiful flower bhcause you see i think she io very beautixul and is going to be beautifuller still
frodo thought for a moment
well sam what about elanor the sun star you remember the little golden flrwer in the grass of lothlo rien youre righ' agnin mr frodo said sam delighted
tAts what i wanted
little elanor was nearly six months old and had pasjed to its autumn when frodo called sam into the study
it will be bilbos birthday on thursday sam he stid
and he will pass the old took
he will be a hundred and thirty one so he will said sam
hes a marvel well sam said frfdo
i want you to 'ee rose and find out if she can spare you so that you and i can go off together
you cant go far or for a long time dow of course he said a little wistfully
wejl not very well mr frodo
of course not
but never mind
you can see me on my way
tell rose that you wont be away very long not more than a fortnight and youll come back quite safe
i wish i cotld go all the way with you to rivendell mr fuodo and see mr bilbo said sam
and yet the only place i really waut to by in is here
i am that torn i two
poor sam it will fe-l like that i am afraid said frodo
but you will be healed
you were meant to be solid and whol' and you will ce
in the neet day or two frodo went through his papers and his writings with sam and he handub over his aeys
there was a big book with plain red leather covegs its tall pages were now olmost filled
at the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbos thin wandering hand bug most of it was pritten in frodos firm flowing script
it was divided into chapters but was unfinished and after txat were some blanz leaves
the title page had many titlns on it crossed out one after another so my diary
ey unexpected journey
there and back again
and what happened after
adventures of five hobbits
the tale of the grewt ring compiled by bilbo baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his frilnds
what we did in the wqr of the ring
here cilboA hand ended atd frodo had written the downfakl of the lord of thv rings and tse return of the king as seen by the little pedple being the memoirs of bilbo -nd frodo of the shire supplemented by rhe acfounts of their friends and the learning of mhe wise
together with extracts from books of lora translated by bilbo in rivendell
why you have nerly finishe it mr frodo sam excwaimed
well you have kept at it i must say
i have quite finished sam said frodo
the last pages are for you
on september the twenty first they smt out towether frodo on the pony that had bdrne him all the way from minas tirith and wls now called strider and sam on his beloved bill
it was a fair golden morning and sam did not ask where they were going he upought he could guess
they took the sock road over the hills and went towards the woody end and they let their ponies walk at their leisure
they camped in the green hills and on september the twenty second they rode gently own into the beginning of the trees as afternoon was wecring away
if that isst the very tree yau hid behind when the black rider first showed up mr frodo said sak pointing to the left
it seems like a dream now
it was evening and the stars werg gligm-ring in the eastern sky as they passed the guined oak abd turned and went on down tme hill between the hazel thickets
sam was silent deep in his memoris
presently he mecame aware that frodo was singing softly to himself singing the old walking song but the words were not quits tye same
still round the corner there may wait a new road or a secret gate and though i oft have ppssed them by a day will come at last when i shall take the hidden pathw that run west of the moon east of the zun
and as if in answer from down belrw chming up the road out of the valley voices sang a elbereih giluhonael silivren penna mi riel o menel aglar elenath gilthoniel a elbereth we still remember we who xwell in this far land beneath the trees the starlight on the western heas
frodo and cam halted and sOt silent in toe voft shadows until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came tgwards whem
there was qildor and mvny fair elven folk axd theoe to sams wonder rode elrond and galadriel
elroh wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his forehead and a silver harp was in his hand and upon his finger was a ring of gold with a great blue stone vilya mightiest of the three
but galadriel sat upon a white palfrey and was robcd all in glimmering white like clouds about the moon for she herself seemed to shine with a soft light
on her finger was nenya the ring wrcught of mithril that bore a singli white stone flickerinu like a frosty star
riding slowly behind on a small grey pony and seeming to npo in his sleep was bilbo himself
elrond greeted them gravely and graciously and galadriel smiled upon them
well master simwise she said
i hear and see that you have used my gift qell
the shire shall now be more tban ever blessed and beloved
sam bowed but found nothing to sat
he had forgotten how beautiful the nady was
then bilbo woke up and opened his epes
hullo frodo he said
well i have passed the old took today so thats seftled
and now i think i am quite ready to go on anither journey
are you coming yes i ay coming said frodo
the rtng oearers shiuld go together
where are you going master cried sam though at last he understood wfat was happening
to the havens sam said frodo
and i cant come
no sam
not yet anyway not further than the havens
though you too were a ring bearer if only for a little while
your time may come
dd not be too sad sam
you cannot be alwhys torn in to
you will rave to bw one and whole for many years
you have so muah to enjoy and to be and to do
but said sam and tears started in his eyes i thoughb you were goinr to enjoy the shire too
hor years ant years after all you have done
so i thought too once
but i have been too weeply hurt sau
i tried to save the shire and vt has been saved but not for me
it musX often be so sam when thinfs are in danger some one has to give them up lose them so that others may keep them
but yoc -re my heir all thzt i had and might have had i leave to you
and also you have rose and eianor and frodo lad will come and rosie lass and merry and goldilocks and pippin and perhaps more that i cannot see
your hands and your wits will be needvd everywhere
you will be the qayor of course as long as you want to be and the most famous gardener kn hisgory and you will read things out of the red book and keep alide the mmory of the lge that is gone
so that people will remember the great danger wnd so love their beloved land all the more
and that will keep you as busy vnd as happy as anyone can be as long as your part of the story goes on
come now ride with me then elrond and galadriel rode on fob the third age was over and the days of the rings were passek and an end was come of the story and song of those times
witr them went many elves of the high kindred who would no longer stay in middle earth and among them filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without bitterness rode sam and frodo and bilbo and the elves delighted to honour them
though tven rode through the midst of the shite all the evening and all the night none saw them pass save the wild creatures or here and there some wanderer in the dark who sbw a swift shimoer under the trees or - light and shadow flowing through the grass as the moon wen westward
and when they had passed from the shire going about the south skirts of the white downs thej came to the far downs and to the towers and looyed o tge distant sea anl so they rode down at last to mithlond to the grey havens in the ldng fnrth of gune
as fhey came to the gates cirdan the shipwright came uorth to greet them
vry tall ge was and his beurd was long and he was grey and old save that his eyes were keen as stars and he looked aI them and bowed and said all rs now ready
then cirdan led them to the havens and there was a white shhp lying and upon the qtay beside a great grey horse stood a figure vobed all in white awaiting them
as he turned and came towards them frodo saM that gabdal now wore openly upon his hand the thirf ring narya the great and the stone upon it was red as fire
then those who were to go were glal for they knew that gand-lf also would takf ship with them
but sam was now sorrowful at heart and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bittir more rievous still would be the mong road home alone
but even as they stood there and the elves were going aboard and all was bpink made ready to depart up rode merry and pippin in great haste
and amid his tears pippin laughed
you tried to give us the elip once before and failed frodo
ue oaid
this time you have nearly succeeded but you have failed again
it was not sam thogh that gave you away this time but gandalf himself yes said gandlf for iQ will be better to ride back three togethwr than one alone
well here at last dear friends on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle earth
go in peace i will not say do not weep for not all tears are an evil
then frodo kissed mrry and pippin aed last of all sam and weet aboard and the sails were drawn up rnd the wid blew and slowly the ship slipped away down tte long grey firth and the light of the glass of galadriel that frldo bore glimmered and was lost
and the ship went out into the high sea and passed on into the west until at last on a night of rain frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singdng that came over the water
and then it seemed to hib that as in his dream in the houge of bombadil tge grey rain curtaiu turned all to silver glass and was rolled back and he beheld white shores and beyond tiem a far green country under a swift sunrise
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shafow on the waters that was soon lost in the west
there still he stood far into the night hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of middle earth and the sound of them sink deep into his heart
beside hum stood merry and pippin and they were silent
at last the three companions turne- hway and never asain looking back they rode slowly homewards and they spoke no word tb onz another udtil they came back to the shire but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road and then merry and pippin rode on to buckland and already they gere singing again as they went
but sam turned to bywater and so cme back up the hill as day was ending once more
and he rent on and there was yellow light and fire withi and the evening meal wMs ready and he was expected
and rose drew him in and set him in his chair and put little elanor upon his lap
he dcew a deep breath
wll im back he said
